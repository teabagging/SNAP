It is not. Unlike the original, the timers seem even less precise, and most importantly, the timers are easily jammed by pets playing with the lids after they've opened. If your pet is like my cat, it knows there is food in this device and is going to play with it to try to get the food out, and probably disable the device in the process (ie knock the battery loose or jam an open lid against the timer, meaning kitty gets the first meal but not the second, which is what happened the first time I used it). I recommend trying to find one of the older Petsafe feeders. As I said, they werent perfect, but they worked well enough to rely on them while away for a day or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a lot of hope, unfortunately didn't work - at all","review":"Was really looking forward to this automatic pet feeder being able to help out with one of my dogs-who has to eat every few hours due to stomach issues. I ordered two (one for each dog) and unfortunately, in both, the food compartments did not fully advance when they were supposed to. Really frustrating, as they would \\"manually advance\\" but not on the automatic settings. One of the feeders would keep trying (with a most irritating noise attached to those attempts) for a while, the other just was happy to move forward 1/2 a compartment at a time.Needless to say, that didn't quite work for my needs, so I will be returning these to Amazon for a refund. I'll have to try some of the other options on Amazon and hope for better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT...WHEN IT WORKS!","review":"Our's lasted for 8 months and then the motor died right before we were going out of town. I ran to the a nearby pet store to pick up a new one. Out of the box the new one was defective. The feeder would only rotate half way and then get stuck. I ran back to the pet store, exchanged it and the new one was also defective! Same problem. So I picked up a PetSafe 2-Meal feeder and this has worked well, so far. (No motors or rotating with this one). There is a silver lining. The feeder has a one-year warranty. I called PetSafe and they sent me a new feeder, virtually no questions asked. I didn't even have to return the broken one. In summary, I'd still buy one (it seems to be one of the best feeders out there). Just keep an eye on it and have someone drop by your home while your gone to make sure it is working."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea is good, but the the follow through is not so much..","review":"I got this feeder because starting last month my cat only could eat can food and that's when my good night sleep ended. I thought this machine would save my life since my cat keeps us awake all night.When I finally got this machine, I just didn't see this could keep the can food fresh because the ice pack wouldn't be able to keep the food cold enough for the whole night. I was worried the food would spoil..and especially my cat is very sensitive ...he wouldn't ate non-fresh food. Then when the timer was on, the bowl turned, it made such a loud noise, and just suddenly stop half way, so it stopped between two bowls, right on the divider..so my flat cat couldn't get his food.After two days with no luck making this machine work..I returned it to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Portion Control","review":"I have used this automatic feeder for several years now, and I think it's a real help in keeping my cat from being a hefer.I have an intelligent cat. He has figured out how to open latched food storage containers, cabinets, and even doors that have child locks on them. He's very persistent about getting to eat. Before I had this feeder, he would wake me at sunrise to be fed and would pester me until I fed him again that evening.This automatic feeder has been great. He rarely bugs me about feeding him anymore. He hasn't figured out that he can turn it, but I also am very careful that he does not see me open it and fill it. He is very observant, how do you think he figured out how to open the locked doors? It would be even better if there was more resistence to being able to turn it, but make no mistake it's not something you can just bump and it will move. Just make sure that when the door is closed that only one compartment is visible."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEAL FEEDER","review":"This is the second one I have bought over the years.

Maybe you guys will have better luck - my cats are just too smart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After 5 years, it's time for a new one","review":"Mine has worked great. The only downside to the product is that there is no low battery indicator, so I probably replace the batteries more than I need to-- just in case. Would hate to be gone for the weekend and have the battery die. It only works intermittently now (after 5 years), so I am going to buy a new feeder-- same kind, probably (unless I can find one with a battery indicator.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Feeder","review":"It worked well. It is smaller that the older version butit works just as well. The colder packs were notincluded as they were in the older models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality -- dangerous for your pet","review":"This device is made of inexpensive plastic -- very light and easy for your pet to turn over. The battery compartment is on the bottom and has no cover so once your dog flips it over -- they could chew up the battery! The timer is not precise -- although the tops did pop open.I would not use this product with any animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timer doesn't work","review":"I didn't have any of the problems others have mentioned with my two cats opening the lids on their own, and to make sure the lids opened simultaneiously, I glued a tongue depressor across the top. HOWEVER, the timers simply don't work. Sometimes they never move at all, other times they open but there's no correlation between the time I set them for and when they actually open. So this feeder is essentially useless, since I can't ever be sure when it will open. I would strongly recommend against buying this product.One additional comment--the reviews posted here are for both the 2-meal feeder and the 5-meal rotating feeder. It would be much more helpful if they were separated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, but it works very well","review":"The PetSafe 5-Meal feeder works very well. It is rather loud when the dish turns and I have it in my bedroom so I definitely hear it at 5:00 a.m. I took a tip from another review and I now feed my cat smaller portions 3 times a day. This has actually kept him satisfied but decreased the total amount of food he is eating. He needs to lose a little bit of weight since he is a very healthy 21-lb boy :) I did have some trouble with the instruction label that is on the inside of the cover. The top left corner was not sticking well and it would impede movement of the bowl at feeding time. I had to rip the label off to stop the problem. I just don't have written instructions now, but other than that I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers As Promised!","review":"This is a great device for pet owners who want to control 'gorging' when a large amount of food is left out while they are temporarily away from home. Initially it seemed to jump two trays at once. I called the tech support number and was advised that if you want two or three feedings per day just program tray timer #1 & 2 (or 3) and do NOT program 4 - *. It then worked perfectly. Some have commented that their pet can push open the next tray in the cycle but I see there is some kind of stop and the resistance of the motor seems to prevent this from happening with my pet. It is possible the manufacturer has made a running change in the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, durable, and gets the job done.","review":"I am very pleased with this unit. It feels very durable, is easy to setup, and seems difficult for a cat to get into the \\"hidden\\" food. I don't understand the other reviewer's complaints. Perhaps there is an older version that they have improved on. I like that the dish area can easily be removed and washed. I DON'T like that it's a battery-only device. FYI, it takes 4 D batteries (1.5V each), this means it takes 6V (4x1.5). I got an old plug from a Motorola device that was 5.9V (close enough) and simply stripped the wires and attached them to the two connectors closest to the setup screen. Voila! Instant, pluggable device! I never even put batteries in it. There shouldn't be a fear of electronic shock, since there should only be 6V DC current coming out of the wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable.. returned it.","review":"I liked the premise of the item and it was highly reviewed so I decided to order it. It was easy enough to set up, although it is stupid the instructions are glued inside the lid. What's wrong with the good ol' fashioned booklet? I set it up and my dog understood what was up and then I went to work. I came home and it was in the middle of the dining room and you could see where she had scratched at it and tried to chew away the plastic. It didn't look like she managed to get the food because there was only one empty container showing. Well, I opened it up and I had filled the carousel and it was completely empty. My dog is not that wild either, never has really destroyed anything of value. So, to sum it up, she was able to tip it over or shake it out or something and it wasn't durable or tip-proof as described so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a piece of junk.","review":"It looks nice. It looks simple to operate. It doesn't work. Not even once could I get the timer to work. In fact, one of the timers seem to be operating in reverse (e.g. set it for 8 hours, in 8 hours it was at 16). I am mechanically/technically inclined but don't feel like \\"fixing it\\" new out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took my cat 30 minutes to get to the food","review":"Useless!

I then glued the trays in, but with two of them they still managed to empty the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for large pets","review":"I'm really sorry I did not do my research before buying it, I have a Boxer, and from the first minute she shredded it to pieces.If you have a large pet, or a heavy chewer, pass it over."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat learned how to break it open after 2 weeks","review":"At first, I thought this feeder did the job and I didn't have to get up at 4am to give the cat food when he pestered me. After a few weeks of using the feeder, my cat discovered how to jam his paw under the cover and pop open the lids. My cat is small but it is fairly easy for him to help himself. My dog also can get it open by force. This feeder is a great idea but is just not rugged enough to work for food driven animals like my cat. If it came in stainless steel and the covers came down further so as not to leave a gap this would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I have had this for about 1 month now. My cat was at first scared because it is pretty loud when it turns, but no issues. I no longer have a cat screaming at me for food at 4 in the morning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I recently purchased this item and promptly returned it because it was evident that my cat could easily break into the compartments. The the flaps that cover the compartments are not tightly sealed and so my cat could pry his mouth and face into the dishes underneath. Any highly food motivated cat would break into this dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Timing","review":"This product would have worked great if I only had 1 cat, or if each side opened up at the same time. I had read that sometimes the 2nd side was delayed, but our took nearly 15 mins. before it opened. So, 1 cat ate both meals, and I have 2 that needed to eat. Customer Service was very friendly & professional. Returning the product for a refund was no problem, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat figured it out.","review":"I ordered this product so my cat would be fed when I have to work late.

We set it to feed twice a day and it will go for two days before it needs to be refilled. My only complaint is that one of the cats is able to turn the tray and get to some of the other food in the unit. Other than that, this is a great product and a true life saver if you need to go away for a couple of days and don't want to leave a giant mound of dry cat food for your cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product in my experience","review":"The feeder works good while it works, but it does not seem to be well designed in the motor as it failed after a year. While it was working, it is noisy when it rotates the tray. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...for a year","review":"If asked a year ago, I would have said that I love this feeder. However, it recently stopped turning. I tried replacing the batteries and resetting the clock and feeding times. I contacted the company and was told they would happily replace my faulty device...for $58!!! Ridiculous customer service and a product that lasted only a year...not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"total junk","review":"This doesn't work at all. From the first day it hasn't opened on time. After the very first opening of the compartment it hasn't closed flush so the cat can see and smell her food and forces it open. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for wet food.","review":"I don't know why the product information says it's good for either dry or wet food since there is no ice pack included and the bowls are not airtight so wet food dries out within a half-hour. Very disappointed in this product performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent way to control your pet's diet!","review":"This bowl is great. My extremely overweight cat is able to have controlled portions at all times, whether I'm there or not. He has made several attempts to \\"break\\" into the bowl but no success. I have not seen any chin acne as other people have said. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to control their pet's food portions.**Updated review**I bought this feeder more than three years ago and it's still going strong. My cat has lost 10 pounds over that time! Also, there have been several times where I will come in the room and the bowl is halfway across the room from where it should be. He is trying to break into it but he never has! This bowl has never failed. It works very well and I still haven't seen any chin acne. Definitely worth its money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it says it will do","review":"Its been a couple of weeks now and I have not had any problem with it. My cat seems to like it and now sits in front of the feeder when its time waiting for the food to appear. The first couple of times it jolted her and she did not understand at all. I had to go and show her that food was already there and she finally got it after like a week.Cons:- Takes up space- No window to see how many compartments are empty or full as days go by.Since my cat feeds twice a day it lasts me 2.5 days and sometimes I forget when I need to reload it.- If you push with just a little force on the sides of the compartment that is exposed it rides to the next one. Luckily my lazy cat has not figured it out yet.- No ice tray... but its not a problem for me as I feed my cat only dry food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars cuz it worked for two days.","review":"Ok, I would have given this one star if it one star if it weren't so funny watching the cats systematically tear this device a part. I would wake up in the morning olny to find no food and bent open. This did not work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked a few times - then not at all","review":"This bowl, i thought, would be a life saver for me... not having to rely on friends constantly when I wanted to go out of town, i could put some ice cubes in the bottom, then wet food in the bowls, and set the timers, and my cat would be fed. And for the first 3 times I did this, it worked perfectly... since then, the timers won't turn. I've tried several different batteries and still nothing. Wish I hadn't bought this, and now it's time to beg my friends for their charity again, if I want to leave the cat at home for a long weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more 4 am wakeups","review":"Bought two of these units as I have three cats. The timer takes a little getting used to if you are using an hour between the main markings (48 hours total per timer)but once you figure out the number of clicks in between all is well.I no longer have my cats pouncing on me or begging me to feed them early in the morning. The unit does not make a sound when it opens but after a couple of days your kitties will figure out that it has opened.Really motivated cats can get into the unit but mine no longer try to get into it early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month","review":"I had read other reviews that stated this product stopped working but I was hopeful that it was not the norm. Well it worked great for one month and now has stopped working. Of course this is several days after the warranty expired. Do not purchase unless you feel comfortable going away not knowing for sure if your pet will be able to have access to the food you left.Update--the manufacture kindly replaced with an new item--which stopped working after six months. Do not purchase or trust this product. Basically the timer they use is a cheap plastic piece that is not reliable. This is not acceptable when we are speaking about a pets dinner being served while we are away--where is the trust in this product when that is exactly what you want for you pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it worked","review":"Ordered this product with such high hopes that is would work for just one day. Put the batteries in and the clock came on, set the timer. But the food tray never rotated. Not once. Tried every way possible. So I returned it and will look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what we need it to do","review":"This cat feeder works perfectly for our purposes. We use it on a daily basis to feed our cat small amounts in regular intervals. Otherwise he eats way too much. We've had it for a year now and it is still working well. We haven't even had to change the batteries yet. It is also great for short trips. It is easy to adjust the feeding schedule for when we'll be away a few days. We haven't had any problems with our cat figuring out how to advance the tray on his own and eat more than he should. Maybe the product has been improved since those reports - or maybe our cat is not all that smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Stressed Out Kitties!","review":"Our cats were very territorial at feeding time, and it was causing a lot of friction in our home. After purchasing two of these feeders, they don't even run when the sections open at meal time, preferring instead to saunter to the food. They are also eating less and consequently there isn't any more vomiting from overeating. We recently left them home alone for two nights and there was still food in the bowls when we returned. They were very calm and couldn't have cared less that we'd been gone. And in fact, they are now grooming each other and sleeping side by side -- and that never happened before in 8 years! These feeders are a real stress reducer in our home. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice... at first.","review":"I would give glowing reviews to this contraption, as it did exactly what we needed it to do and the cat quickly came to associate the sound of the bowl turning with Food Time. He never did figure out how to get it to turn at off-times, and he's pretty smart. On the other hand, I'm giving only 2 starts because IT BROKE after 6 months of totally normal usage. Tried replacing the batteries and that didn't help at all. Very disappointed.((REVISION)) - We thought that the first one breaking after 6 months was a fluke, and bought a second one, because our 18 year old cat bugs us mercilessly if we try to go a full night without giving him a fresh can of food. We've had it for 2 months this time, and it broke. Of course. Tried changing batteries and it still doesn't work. We're upset with Amazon for selling such a shoddy product (we did get it directly from amazon), and shame on us too for giving it a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder = Excellent Product!","review":"This product is exactly what I was looking for - my dog learned by the second time that the noise of the inside spinning meant food and would come running.

Now that we have this feeder he eats every morning at 10am and I can sleep longer. The feeder is great! It does make a sound when it rotates, but it only lasts for 2 seconds. It's nice because the noise lets my cat know it's time to eat. The feeder is really easy to set up as well. It actually has a clock that you set and then you set the \\"feeding times\\". The directions to set up the clock and feeding times are located under the lid of the feeder.

Over all they use cheap lightweight plastic and it doesn't seem like this will last. This may be fine for a cat or very lazy or passive dog, but we left this on the floor and our dog was trying to break into it. Also, he was waking up crying for food every day at 5:30am exactly, so we wanted this to open before he did so. The timer just wasn't precise enough and ended up just crying near the bowl. Recommend something you can set on the counter with a chute down to the bowl, etc and exact timer ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feeder","review":"I bought two of these automatic feeders recently and overall I'm pleased with them. They were easy to program and seem like they're of high quality. I like how it holds 5 meals and it definitely solves the problem we needed it to solve.There are only two complaints. First, they take 4 D batteries each. I suppose I should have read this in the description, but I was expecting it needed 2-4 AA batteries. As long as I don't have to spend $10 on batteries very often this isn't a huge issue. The second complaint is with regard to the noise the feeder makes when it rotates which I would say is akin to the roar of a T-Rex. The feeding times for our cats are 4 am and 4 pm, and it's absolutely terrifying when it goes off. No matter where I'm sitting in my house or if I'm expecting it to turn, it's absolutely startling when it goes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good for multiple days","review":"First off, instructions were not in the box. I don't have internet where I live so I was not able to download the instructions.We got this feeder to be able to feed our cat for multiple days. I set the program for 7am and 7pm and set all the timer slots. My mistake, (I think) is that I set all 9 time slots. Well, there are only 5 food slots. We tested with small 1 minute increments to be sure it was working and it seemed ok. I left for three days and when we returned, we discovered that she hadn't eaten in THREE DAYS. The device was moving but bypassing the next full bin of food and landing on an empty.There is no setting for a day of the week so if you plan to use this for multiple days DO NOT BUY THIS FEEDER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver!","review":"My cat has been on a diet imposed by his vet for the last three years, and ever since then, he whines for food incessantly. Before I purchased this feeder, I couldn't sleep late because he would pester me to feed him, and, whenever I got home from work he would cry for dinner...even when I was home hours early! The feeder took the delivery of food out of my hands. It has significantly reduced his crying. I set the bowl for feed him once in the morning and once in the evening. It is very convenient and easy to use. Would definitely recommend it for anyone with a cat who is struggling through a diet. A MUST HAVE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"I've been using this for a few months now with NO trouble. My cat, while I thought she was bright, still hasn't figured out how to access future feedings. I have it set up to feed her 2x a day and she will sit in front of it for about an hour before it is scheduled to dispense the food. It has DRAMATICALLY minimized her food begging (which was annoying at 5:30am), but it is pretty loud when the motor moves the food dish. Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I was excited to try this product but in the end it didn't work.

Every actor is superb in here, from crooked NBC executives to the Stempel and Van Doren families. Veteran actor Paul Scofield plays Van Doren's father \\"Mark\\" and is a standout in that role.The sad story, if this movie is true, is that the crooks basically got away with it, at least if you read the ending credits right after the movie ends. What injustice!By the way, it's unbelievable how much left-wing propaganda is in this film. The Liberal cheap shots were shots against Eisenhower, Nixon and even Jesus!

This is a great movie with a wonderful message directed by an accomplished artist. After watching the movie a few times in color, I would suggest that you turn off the color on your T.V. and watch it in good ol' B&W. Although some scenes (the yachting sequence, for example), work better in color, B&W accentuates the Frank Capra-esque Rob Morrow role. John Turturro is great in both formats.

Perhaps I should read it to better understand them."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEW, SEW BAD","review":"The seamstress won't keep you on pins and needles, nor will it keep you in stitches. It just falls apart like a badly hemmed wedding dress. The script is as tangled as a spool of thread and the directors talent could not fill a thimble. The movie ends with a blatant murder by the heroine(Enough, Sleeping With the Enemy)-yeah, I've even seen that before. Don't buy, don't rent, don't even look at the dvd cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seamstress","review":"Allie's father has disappeared on an island, and she wonders if his connection to an old crime is responsible. A woman was brutally killed by an angry crowd, and her murderous ghost haunts those responsible for her death. While Allie and her friends search for her father, people start dying in increasingly horrifying ways. The story was confusing and choppy. It relied on film editing too much to tell the story. It could of been a great horror movie but it was just too cliche. It's a cheezy formulaic studio horror movie, not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL SEVEN OR THE ONE","review":"The film opens with Allie (Kailin See) trying to piece together clues of her father's murder. She comes across all kinds of weird supernatural stuff and symbols. The movie then shifts gears from a scary supernatural story to an up beat slasher film as a bunch of young adults go to an island. It is here on the island that the plot is explained about the cursed seamstress who sews shut the eyes and mouth of her victims. If you watch a lot of horror films, you will most likely be bored with this one as it brings nothing new to the table. The acting lacked. The plot wasn't bad, but the drama and filler material, as well as the dialouge was weak. This is evident during an early scene where Allie confronts the sheriff (Lance Henriksen) over the murder of her father. Might be tolerable as a low budget rental.F-bombs, sex, brief rear nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistically Easy","review":"I have used every version of this program.

I am a big fan of Jane Austen and to have her 'come alive' in this series was certainly a find! I agree with so many other reviewers that the author's extensive research into the era and its events lend credibility to the story and allows the reader to escape into this world and become fully emersed in the goings on. This seventh book in the series was by far my favourite so far. Ms Barron has developed Jane Austen's character to a point where you feel you know her very well. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's portrayal of the closeness between Jane and Lord H. It was subtle, yet so powerful and it is what made it so deliciously enjoyable. I love emersing myself in the life of these books and my only regret is that Jane Austen herself did not live past the age of 42 and that means that Ms Barron's series will undoubtedly, at some point, come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"The book came in good condition.

I enjoyed this one more than the first. Though I thought it was highly unlikely that any woman in that day would plan to ruin herself, I understand that it was necessary to the plot. Logan and Madeline were likeable characters and obviously made for each other. The novel is well written and pulls you in. I found myself constantly wanting to know what would happen next and dreading it at the same time. The \\"what happened next\\" was always a pleasant surprise. This novel is well worth reading. I can't wait to read more novels by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Kleypas book that was unreadable","review":"I really tried, but this is yet another Kleypas novel that I wasted money on and couldn't finish. This one's about some girl who is supposed to marry some old aristocrat. Instead of marrying him, she sells the poor guy's heirloom ring he gave her and traipses off to London. She plans on seducing the greatest actor who ever lived, not only that, but he is the hottest actor who ever lived. And like in a lot of this writer's books, this hero is haunted by his miserable past. Only like a lot of her heroes, his past isn't really all that awful compared to a lot of folks. Still it's enough for him to swear off love...until the moment he sets his eyes on our innocent miss and then it is lust at first sight quickly going to love. Not only that but both like to self analyze everything. It's so boring. Ugh. I almost got half way through but could care less about the two lovebirds."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I loved this book. The heroine was spunky and the hero was a tortured soul, which is a great combo in my opinion. The ending was very touching. Lisa Kleypas just writes the kind of characters that I enjoy reading.

There was way too much analysis getting in the way of the story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, those brooding actors","review":"It was lovely to see Lucas Scott in his own romance! Brooding, artistic, emotionally withdrawn and stubborn as heck, Lucas is a wonderful hero and Madeline provides a perfect heroine foil for him. While rather sweet and naive, occasionally a bit too much so, their relationship develops into something pure, although, of course, it takes them several hundred pages to figure that out. Lucas's adversion to commitment (and his relationship with his family and neighbors) seems a bit too much at times, but can be dismissed as a by-product of his artistic temperament. A must for Kleypas fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"Lisa Kleypas has become one of my favorite authors: she writes sexy stories in the Regency times. But this book is very boring and very predictable. The girl is very insipid, little attractive and I really didn't feel that she had anything in herself that could attract such a wonderful hero. Yes, he is magnificent, powerful, charismatic and I enjoyed a lot imagining this kind of David Garrick with a deep and seductive voice. Sorry but the history develops in a very trite way: the sick hero is something very used."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Lisa Kleypas for me","review":"I gave this book a try after reading \\"Somewhere I'll Find you\\" (Which was even worse than this) because other reviews said this book was much better... and it was. But it wasn't good. It was too cliche, the writing was too modern for the time period the book is set in and it was really tough to get through. No more Lisa Kleypas books for me. I just finished the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon and this writing doesn't even fall in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluffy but flat","review":"This was an average and rather plodding story of a girl trying to get out of an arranged marriage who decides to ruin herself with a dashing rake.All of her characters are dashing rakes with some inner decency which is very hard to find. They are all sombre and silent Heathcliff types who use sex as a way of entertaining themselves and as a weapon to control women. I never get the sense of any clear commitment from any of her couples, only women boinked into submission.The women especially are all naive virigins who endure untold suffering losing their virginity in 'love' scenes which make me cringe and wonder how on earth and supposedly talented rake can be so indifferent to their feelings.They are all just too flat and unbelieveable for me. About as sensual as a dead fish and just as exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Reprint of a 1997 Book","review":"I ordered this book for my wife thinking it was new. It is actually a re-release, reprint, of a 1997 book. This was not stated anywhere on Amazon. I actually pre-ordered it long ago. Her next truly new book comes out in February 2012."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, bland, bland...","review":"I'm a big Lisa Kleypas fan, and I was really disappointed with this book. Too much psychobabble (which is especially offensive in an era before Freud was born), too many standard cliches and plot devices, and a plethora of cardboard characters guarantee a must-yawn read. The prequel to this, Somewhere I'll Find You, is even worse. Skip this one, folks; for Kleypas's best works, try Only With Your Love, Then Came You, Dreaming Of You or Midnight Angel. However, despite the book's many flaws, it's still a Kleypas and therefore readable--barely. It's not overtly offensive, just really bland and kind of silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing!! A paranormal thriller well worth the read.","review":"Mr. Bonadio's Voices is one of those books that leaves one wondering. He has the uncanny talent of making the unbelievable...believable. The evil forces in the tale lend credibility to the psychological conclusions drawn about why people are capable of dispicable and inhuman acts of terror and cruelty. The main character, Lea Moore, knows first hand the extent of power the evil force carries. She partners with unusual people to try and thwart the evil demon. The question is...does it work?It is with great anticipation that I look forward to Mr. Bonadio's next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful disc","review":"This recording features wonderful works written by each of the four musicians on the album. Some tracks are solo pieces, others have the full ensemble. The music has the depth and integrity you would expect from these excellent players. The recording is fantastic... as is usually the case with ECM releases. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for fans of Jimmy Giuffre","review":"One thing missed by Douglas T. Marin's excellent review is Paul Bley's involvement with Jimmy Giuffre on his brilliant trio of albums Emphasis, Flight and Free Fall (the first two of which are re-released as 1961 on ECM). In The Evenings Out There is surely a reference to the second track on Emphasis, entitled In The Mornings Out There. I can't help but hear this album as a meditation and exploration of Giuffre's (and Bley's and Swallow's) legacy. Both are highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful \\"Hawaiian Engineering\\" disc","review":"This CD was released after changes in the band components: Licks left the group, and others guitarrists joined it.

I find this perspective much more useful than one from an employeer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reader","review":"I bought this as part of the curriculum that we are following, via The Well Trained Mind. It is good, but I'm annoyed by the outdated grammar. There is spacing within the contractions like \\"is n't\\" and is missing other appropriate punctuation. I'm also not a big fan of each sentence being separated and numbered like a list, rather than in paragraphs. But the merits of the reader outweigh the negatives and I've not sought out another reader.

DVDs have also played quite clearly, no ghosting or irritations with picture quality.As an aside, I use the analog cable. I did get a digital video cable (and be sure to look up the connection type that is needed.. another Amazon reviewer mentions it) but after a few days my digital video driver appears to have died.

No ghosting during fast game play. DVI and regular monitor input option are nice (though DVI cable must be purchased separately).

Since it came from CompUSA, I have to go through their technical support. They are only open during business hours and the wait time on the phone for support is awful. 45 minutes is a bit excessive.

The aerial photogrphy rivals that of Top Gun. The story of Meagan and Jay provide real insight on just what it takes to make it as a fighter pilot. The task of landing a figher onto the deck of an aircraft carrier moving up and down in the middle of the night gives us a brief look at the kind of stress these pilots go through. UH-RAH Navy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great imagery","review":"Not only is this a great story, but the imagery is fantastic.

Yet the film's brilliant and sympathetic crafting overpowered me. I spent the whole movie perched on the edge of my seat. Here is a story of the desire to be the best at something very hard and to risk all to gain all. Yes, it is about fighter pilots. But no it is not a war movie. It is an intricate tale of what it took for one man and one woman to be the best at what they do. I was captivated by it. Technically, it will knock your socks off. Visually it is stunning beyond belief. Emotionally, it is the work of masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speed and Angels","review":"Great movie with tons of flying action. If you like jets like the Navy F14 then this is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary, but a Blu Ray letdown","review":"This documentary can't be praised too much. Great story, interesting characters, superb photography all centered around \\"nuggets\\" learning to fly the late, great, and much missed F-14. Given the struggle the producers and to get this to the public, thank goodness they persevered. Highly, highly recommended.There is a fly in the ointment: Although the price difference between the DVD and the Blu Ray version has narrowed, the DVD is the better buy. The Blu Ray version's quality is only marginally superior to the DVD, especially on an upscaling player, possibly because the producers had to expend so much to get it distributed at all that they didn't enough funds left to do a proper HiDef version. Get the DVD. You'll save a couple of bucks, still have this magnificent production, and you'll be able to show it on any DVD or Blu Ray player.So I grade the documentary a 5 +, but the disappointing quality of the Blu Ray lowers my overall grade to a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic from start to finish....","review":"What makes this film so compelling is how it seamlessly combines rich, fully developed personal stories with incredible aerial footage and inside knowledge of the navy.

No film has ever been so true to the challenges and nuances involved in the pursuit of this demanding career, and no filmmaker before Peyton Wilson has ever had such unparalleled access to the world of carrier aviation and those who work within it. The aerial cinematography is breathtaking and groundbreaking-- no gimmicks or studio magic at all. The flying and dogfighting scenes are the real deal and they-- and the movie-- will absolutely thrill you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Insightful!","review":"Most American manga these days lacks alot of storytelling and character development, plus, the art is well---not very appealing, kinda stagnant and 'doll-like'. But this book, is a different matter.All the characters are interesting, but I relate the most to Judas--so introverted, lacking self-esteem,not use to affection at all--but who could not recognise having a crush now and then as silly and out of proportion as Judas has for his professor?I generally don't enjoy yaoi because most of it lacks substance and meaning, but INCUBUS actually projects the type of character insight and psychological drama that one, looking for more than excuses for sex, will appreciate.All I hope for, is that this series keeps going, and teaches other yaoi manga (Japanese and American) that sometimes an intriging story can be just as inticing as the erotic scenes themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baroque, But Brilliant.","review":"Coming off of Slow Freight, All Mine was my second Ray Bryant purchase. What a shock. All mine is a sad, moody collection of works that probably don't fit the definition of jazz. That said, this disc is wonderful.

I was a bit intimidated by the additional size, but was able to set this up all by myself (53 yr.old woman), with only the humidity working against me.Once again, nature gave me another test... but this time I was able to pull my collapsible chair, a small table, the cooler, food box, picnic basket, and my suitcase all into the extra room, where I spent a cozy day working on my watercolors and reading, despite the heavy rain. NO LEAKS WHATSOEVER.It's a great tent, and I have had three.

YEA! Get that!!??? Navman's customer support voice mailbox was filled. No calls allowed for abotu one week. Idiots!!!The maps are bad too. GPS doesn't hold position well with cloud cover.They could easily improve the company if they replaced all personnel (developers, customer sup[port, admins) with chimps.

Nothing good to say about this unit. Slow to acquire satelite. Also slow to adjust if get off course (tells you to turn left at an intersection after you are already in a different lane) making it hopeless on downtown city streets. Not user-friendly (not touch-screen) - have to \\"type\\" everything in perfectly or you won't find addresses and POIs. Speaking of points-of-interest, this unit has very few, and no way to search for POIs other than knowing the exact name of what you want - ex: no way to find the closest petrol station... must know the exact name and location - yeah right. POI is one of the great features of using a SatNat and this one is useless. Choose any SatNav other than this one!

There is a lot of material in this book, and it's not always completely straightforward, but it's not impossible to understand.

If you are looking for a much better product that does all of the same things, and does them well, check out the line of Mustek cameras available on Target's website. Mustek cameras have gotten rave reviews on numerous digital camera review sites. But be advised, NONE of them are available in their stores. Which baffles me to no end. Why would they have this cheap camera in the store, and not any of the superior Mustek brand? Unless they are worried that customers would buy the Mustek cameras, and not the other much more expensive digital cameras that Target sells. Just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor picture and sound.","review":"Although the Aiptek Pocket DV Digital Video Camcorder - 3100size is appealing, the picture quality is very poor and grainy.

This is mostly due to it's poor performance in less than perfect lighting. The 10fps video is also a bit lacking if you try to capture video with lots of motion. I was amazed, however, by the quality of the pictures it takes outdoors, and it's great fun to shoot short video clips with it. I find myself often throwing it in my pocket and capturing moments that I wouldn't have otherwise since you can't carry a 'normal' camcorder and digital camera in your pocket.

It runs on 2 double A batteries and so therefore dies after about 8-15 minutes or so on new batteries. This includes playback, where the batteries seem to die even quicker. Installation of software for playback on a PC or playback on a TV is difficult, frustrating, and requires a lot of patience. This camera is not good at taking digital still photos (turn out blury, lighting bad indoors), and can only hold a few on the 128 MB card. This card also holds about 15 minutes of video and nothing else. The camera is low quality and the cards are also lacking. Please, Please do not do what we did. We are stuck with this camera because it passed the 90 day return policy. Don't put yourself in that situation, do NOT buy this camera.

It takes excellent pictures and video. I gave this only 4 stars because it does not have a flash. This camera can only be used outdoors or in good indoor lighting. It is about the size of your hand and easy to use. I do recommend though that you not buy this camera from Target. That is where I bought mine and when I tried to exchange it for the 4500 model which has a flash, I was told that I could not return or exchange the camera because it was opened. The store was very rude and now I am stuck with this camera and can not get the one that I really want. I do like the camera and I will keep it but I will not ever buy anything from Target again!!! I should have bought it from Best Buy or Circuit City which both carry the camera and have much better return and exchange policies. I do recommend that if you purchase this camera you go through Best Buy or Circuit City. If you want this camera with a flash I suggest purchasing the DV4500 model."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"This camera is awesome!!! I bought it just to fool around with making little movies. I doubted it at first because the low price and I had never heard of the brand before but I decided to try it. And boy am I glad I did! Sure the zoom's not that great and there's no flash but other than that it's great. My advice is if you want a little camera with BIG things this is the one to buy. Or even if you don't want a little camera this one still is cool. All my friends are jelous and can't believe the price!

You get fairly nice quality stills(3megapixel 2048x1540) and reasonable quality video(640x480 10 fps) it also has 2x digital zoom. With a good 128 mb you can get 30 minutes of video and about 120 high quality pictures. The weight/size are perfect for carrying this around every where. The only complaints I have are that the up and down buttons for the zoom seem to not respond that well when zooming back out and that the plastic is not all that durable, it seems cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad camera for the price...","review":"If you are looking to not spend a lot of money for an entry-level digital camera, this wouldn't be a bad choice. My mom has this model and I've used it on several occasions without any problems. Much better than the Aiptek DV4500 which is supposed to have more bells & whistles, but just doesn't have the same level of quality as this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class By Itself- Great Before Upgrading to Expensive DVC's","review":"I like it because four functions are crammed into this small DV Camcorder. In addition to capturing AVI video and photos, this mini cam works as a Webcam and a voice recorder. Easy to load the pics, sounds, and videos onto your computer. You can even erase easily. The flip display is easy to use. Battery life was o.k., It's not a battery drainer. I've never recommended a product online before. I think it was a very smart purchase. I actually think this camera is underpriced. If your expectations are not too high and your wallet is low. This is the product for you. You can't get all of this in one product for less than $250. Not good for indoor use though. With proper lighting, this camera is satisfactory. No lighting, no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 out 2 IS bad","review":"I purchased this item and received a damaged unit. The CD player just doesn't work. The display is a horrible readout.

You can purchase the same thing from Timex cheaper. NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Annoying....","review":"Well, I wanted a clock that could wake me up with nature sounds or alarm. Only one or two of the four nature sounds are bearable. They are way too repetitive and two of them are more annoying with squawking birds than soothing. The light has three settings. Even the dimmest setting appears as a beacon in my room at night. It wakes me up at night! If you're in the market for an all-in-one nature sounds alarm clock...keep looking!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This clock is TOO BRIGHT!","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try, boy was I wrong. I returned it the next day and bought the Timex T608T, it has the same features as this one except for the annoying bright yellow light. This alarm clock lets off too much light to be used in a bedroom. If you look at it in a dark room you will go blind! The lowest setting on the dimmer is still too bright. I don't care for the shape of this, it looks like a boom box. The controls are hard to use, there everywhere even in the back of the unit. The numbers on this unit are a little small and rounded, if you wear glasses you might need them to read the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, am I blind?","review":"This is a nice enough radio in itself. It's big and bulky, and its round shape does pooly on my perpetually cluttered nightstand. The controls work fine, though they're poorly laid out. What's really annoying is the light this thing puts off. It is BRIGHT. I have to cover the face when I sleep, and if I look at it in the dark, there goes my night-vision. It has a dimmer switch with, strangley, three settings. They're all still too bright. Add to that the two indicator lights, a green FM indicator and a red battery warning, and you've got a radio you could use as a lighthouse.Note to clock-radio designers: Red light does not interfere with your night vision. There's a reason it used to be used in clock radio displays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Seinfeld quote","review":"Great shirt, great quility.

However, I was wrong... dead wrong. This show is terrible. The main cast doesn't do anything other than make absurd comments. Each episode begins with a canned idea for a new gadget and then the 'team' enlists others to do all of the work. The prototypes are often unpractical or just plain lame.

While On Nature, Contemplation and the One remain singularly important as a part of Plotinus' massive body of work, it still stands, nevertheless, that it is difficult to understand the whole of the Alexandrian philosophers thought with merely a portion of his writings. This pamphlet only engenders injustice for both Plotinus and for Thomas Taylor, the worthy translator of this text. For nearly the same price one may find Stephen MacKenna's much more scholarly edition of Plotinus' Enneads, which contains the following: a biographical sketch of Plotinus, an essay concerning the philosophers place in the history of thought, an insightful introduction, Porphyry's life of Plotinus, the preface and finally, The Enneads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plan B","review":"This book offers outstanding insight to our changing times and human evolution.

It's barely gay and with that funny australian dialect it's like they're all repressing their feelings and spending more time having tea. Bla.

The book lacked all over the place and most dissapointing of all was the very much open ending which made you wonder why it was even written in the first place. Being the first book featuring same sex relationships from New Zealand, my residing country, i think that was all it was to the author, an oppurtunity for a first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching And Yet Unfinished Story","review":"What can be said about this book? Well...maybe that it's very interesting how the author, was able to embed so many well detailed moments into the story AND the emotions that a young man feels. Who's to say what is right and what is wrong for a man to feel when he's confused and in search for answers? That is pretty much what the author tries to explore throughout the story.However, there are a few things in which I was [am] a bit puzzled about. Was the reason for not exploring the characters moments with sex something to be best left to the imagination or just being cautious? What becomes of the characters with their families, friends and society?My believe is that maybe the author left these details out so that maybe...just maybe some day, he could pick up the story again and continue it. I can clearly see this story being continued and explored more...so, who's to say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Voice but...","review":"Neil has an awesome voice and writes great songs but a Christmas album?

It covers everything you need to know for the Elementary Praxis, but some of the information goes over 5th grade level and makes you panic more than you have to.

Because, quite frankly, nothing released before 1976 ever sounded like this totally original song. A brutal brutal tune. The drums can only be described as psychotic.

One of the legions of songwriters who feed the Nashville machine, Camp has provided hits for the likes of Garth Brooks, John Anderson and Randy Travis, and even made a record or two himself, back in the early '90s. He tilts towards the traditional end of the spectrum, and is a soulful, appealing vocalist, working in a fairly alt-y, old-school style. The whole record is pretty good, but one song, \\"Tune Of The Twenty Dollar Bill,\\" stands out as a real gem. A compact little story-song (of courtship back in the good old days), this is a catchy, thoroughly enjoyable, tune, and really quite memorable. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Nashville's best Writer/Artists","review":"Although more recognized stars have had the hits (\\"How Long Gone\\" on this CD was #1 for Brooks and Dunn), I prefer Shawn's soulful somewhat edgier original versions.

I tried taking out the DVD from the tray, but it doesn't even open. I unplugged it and waited for 5 minutes and came back to plug it in. The DVD still won't come out. Very poor design in this aspect.

However I played some vhs tapes that didn't play well on my 2-head portable player. The tapes looked great on this player so I'm pleased with the vhs part. I tried some bought dvds and one I burned from my pc. They all worked fine. This unit is pretty basic, but at the price it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"I bought this about two months ago and so far it is working great. For the price, it is the only DVD player I could find that plays DTS as well as full 96khz/24b. It may not equal other more expensive players, but this one certainly has a lot of value for its load of features and low price. Had to play around with output settings to get the Dolby Digital to work, but it wasn't too much of a struggle for a pleasing end result.The Hi-Fi audio on the VCR sounds much better than my old Magnavox VCR, and my reciever pulls out full surround from Dolby Prologic VHS tapes flawlessly, which sounds surprisingly good coming from the ancient VHS format.So far no complaints, I hope it doesn't decide to die after a few months like others' have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money!","review":"This thing has not worked right from day one.

And what happens to all this hardware in landfills?A landfill is a good place for our current Samsung DVD/VHS unit. It stopped playing any DVD at all. We've used a cleaner disc, done compressed air cleaning, all to no avail. The unit is no longer a combo and we can't watch DVDs on our nice new TV anymore.

To test the DVD, I played it in a Sony DVD player and it worked like a charm. I guess the old adage is in play here - you get what you pay for. With more and more DVDs being burned on computers and recorders, it appears that only top-brand players or new models should be purchased.

Her book didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know. I wanted to learn about what really makes each medical specialty unique, but the \\"question and answer\\" format made each chapter almost identical. The answers were so vague and non-specific that you could apply them to almost any specialty.

We couldn't find such information anywhere else, and, unfortunately, we didn't find it here either.This book is a hodgepodge of trite quotes and whatever the author found during a 15-minute search on Medline-- I know because I tried it myself, and I got the same handful of articles that she cites. The information she presents is often outdated or taken out of context, and is generally too vague and/or superficial to be of use in any case.I cannot imagine how anyone other than the author herself would rate this book highly.

Bravo on their intense accuracy on my having a \\"top cover\\". A call to their support was a lesson in \\"patience on hold\\", with no results.

Mr. Disch is a great writer, full of good turns of phrase and well described settings, but the characters in this book were made of wood, the plot jumped around to no effect, and I spent the last 100 pages waiting for it to end.On a more global level, the only explanation ever given for the main characters actions are that she was abused as a child, which perpetuates the harmful stereotype that the victem inevitably becomes the victemizer.

The dark harmonies, indeed eery at times, are as captivating as the striking lyrics.

Not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don't adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies, but the book is very badly written; they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi-meaningless jargon.

What Robin needs to do is re-release this album without the whiney female pretentious lovesick puppy, and make it instrumental.

This book fit the bill until the last 50 pages or so, when apparently our author realized she had to end the book. To say the least, the ending is farcical and almost unbelievable. Still, the book as a whole was very good, and although the most of the characters were stereotypes, they seemed to fit in this story.

Is it to much to ask for a 'heroine' to be more realistic? Lara cares for orphan, nothing wrong with that, but why does Lisa Kleypas potray her to be such a saint. It almost detered me from completing the book.Dreaming of you will always remain as my favourite book of all historical romance. But I am sorely disappointed in this book.

She tends to use heroines that are so strong and heroic that you can occasionally be forgiven for thinking that they are superwomen but mostly you can empathise with them and the books are quite entertaining. Unless the author's intention was to create huge sympathy for the male character and to emphasize his growth, this particular novel was not up to her usual standard. Most of the central characters were either underdeveloped or in the case of her heroine, an emotionally stunted, self absorbed priggish miss caught up in making herself feel better by doing good works. It was tough going to find any sympathy for her because she seemed to wear her suffering like a hair shirt and no one loves a martyr. She was one dimensional and as a result the book suffered. If you like Kleypas, you'll probably forgive her this lapse, I couldn't make it to the end of this one, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"So happy this wasn't my first Lisa Kleypas novel","review":"If this had been the first novel of this author I had read I would NEVER read another book by her.

Knowing that \\"Hunter\\" couldn't really be the actual Hunter, I found him difficult to like since he basically spent all his time lying to her. I also thought that Lara was a rather wooden character and the whole plot just felt contrived.So there really wasn't much to like, and I plodded through it just to see how they would resolve the matter in the end (knowing that it had to turn out better than the movie did, of course!).But even at the end, several questions remained, as some reviewers have pointed out. For example, how \\"Hunter\\" would know the details of personal conversations between Lara and her husband is beyond me, and beyond the scope of believability.It wasn't an awful book, but I felt kind of cheated by the plot and its lack of originality, as well as the cookie-cutter characters who exhibited very little depth or realism.Library donation."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing rehash of 2 films & beneath author's ability","review":"From one of my very favorite authors, a real dud. Kleypas does nothing original with the same plot as \\"The Return of Martin Guerre\\" and \\"Sommersby\\", the films. The hero and heroine are unbelievably perfect whereas all villains are undiluted evil. The heroine grated on my nerves and at every turn made a decision that made no sense and was against her best interests (until the very end where it should be too late and isn't, making the resolution highly unbelievable). Perhaps the most unbelievable legal proceeding imaginable (I am a lawyer). I cannot believe that this came from the same author who created Derek Craven, Logan Scott and Lawless Lily. Buy and collect this author's backlist as all of her other titles are outstanding! I have kept them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat Lacking in Strength","review":"Overall, I thought the book was good. The suspense concerning the long lost husband added a certain quality to the book that you don't usually see in many historical romance novels.My only problem with the book was the character of Lara. Usually, Ms. Kleypas' female protagonists are strong willed, independant women, who let neither society nor aspiring suitors to get in their way. However, Lara proves to be a very flight character, latching onto which ever side seems to fit the best at the time. She starts showing moments of strength toward the end of the novel, but in my opinion that effort was too little, too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS BOOK","review":"I cannot understand the good reviews for this book. It just plain stinks. She is totally unfeeling and should not have been portrayed as a heroine. He is just dumb to continue his pursuit of her. I guess I would just rather rent the movie Sommersby than to have to sit through this book again. I could not feel any sort of emotion throughout the book for two characters who are so unsuited for each other in such an overused plot. I guess I may have also been expecting too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty good...","review":"I absolutely loved Hunter, without a doubt. Lara did, at times, get on my nerves but she came through at the end. Janet and Arthur were just scum. Rachel was crazy for always making excuses for her abusive husband. And Johnny was adorably.It was, overall, a great read but it was a little wordy for me. I found myself skimming over a lot of details on what everyone was wearing. I know it makes a book larger but I really don't care for all that descripton. I just like to get to the meat of the story. But that's just me.I would recommend this book to all romance readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Stylish","review":"These boots are stylish and extremely comfortable. I wear a size 12 womens and unlike most boots that come in this size, the boots fit snugly around my calfs. And even though the boot has a chunky heel it doesn't take away from the comfort when you walk in the boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"different in person..","review":"Yes this shoe is very cute, it made it a little hard to return in fact... the picture depicts a nicely fitting shoe but my calf was floating in the sea that is this shoe. It must take a very large calf to fit such a space! And Its not like i'm a terribly thin person either- just normal if not on the thicker side of normal. I've been looking for a nicely fitting brown boot, but this just did not fit the bill. If you're looking for just a cute toe to come out of the bottom of a pant this shoe would be excelent- but too expensive for this purpose alone in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift!!","review":"I received The Snow Show as a gift and I love it.It documents an architectural/artistic exhibition in Lapland. Teams of two, one artist and one architect designed and built temporary structures of snow and ice.The book is primarily comprised of color photographs of the projects. The pictures of the structures, made of snow and ice, with the sun coming through are just breath-taking. They are incredibly beautiful. At the back, each project is elaborated on: The teams, the concepts and processes, including working drawings and photographs.The book is sooo great, I can't imagine how amazing it must have been in real life. Anyone would enjoy it, architects, artists and laypeople."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very stable","review":"I thought an underbed mounting system would be great, but I was disapointed. The underbed locking system may work well for a gooseneck, but the fifth wheel adapter rotates +/-10 degrees from center. It is also difficult to lock in the adapter. I didn't like the movement of the fifth wheel adapter when using a regular pin box, and it was really bad when a switched to a 5th Airborne/Sidewinder pin box. The hitch would lock in place off center causing the trailer to tow off center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better OBX stories out there.....","review":"I was hoping to find great Outer Banks stories here as that was suggested.

However, I really like this one.This book gives great historical and cultural information, which has really helped my understanding of the New Testament. I realized, when reading this, that there is a lot more to understanding the New Testament than I had gotten from just reading the Bible. Without the historical background, some things just didn't make so much sense. And the entire story was sort of flat for me before.I really appreciated the comparative look at the books of the New Testament, and the perspective given on the authors and the intended audience.Of course this in no way replaces the Bible.

The remaining stories were listened to for the purpose of being able to say, \\"I listened to them in their entirety.\\" Based on that, I may voice my opinion, which is that they were not only misplaced in a collection of \\"Tales for a Stormy Night\\", but would have been misplaced in a collection of \\"Tales for ANY Night\\". Another grisly tidbit: The 're-enactments'(rather than 'readings') seemed to serve as a sounding board for frustrated/mediocre actors who were committed to giving the texts their unbridled self-indulgence and much puzzling auditory gnashing of teeth amidst screeching falsetto and booming basso profundo.

Robert E. Howard would be proud to put his stamp of approval on this.If you liked the original Conan the Barbarian of 1982, starring Arnold Schwartzenegger, you won't be disappointed either. Where the 1982 version had a more mythic feel (especially with Basil Poledouris' sound-track), ...the new version is definitely the original gut-gripping action-all-the-way pulp-novel come to life! Jason Momoa is even more convincing as the brooding barbarian who stomps across the Hyborean world with sword in hand. Niether movie follows a specific plot to one of the many Conan novels.

Even the production values brought nothing of interest. Whatever liberties the 1982 adaptation took with Howard's canon, John Milius established a setting that gave weight and authenticity to Howard's artificial mythology, insuring the film would endure the years.

Just a dreadful film, the continuity is just terrible and the dialogue inane. When Ron Perlman is in a production I know it's either first rate or a paycheck role for him. This one is clearly a paycheck with some residual deal I'd wager. I think Jason Momoa was cast for his ability to scowl. Rachel Nichols, lacking her natural blonde hair, is sorely misused.

He does not rescue strangers out of the goodness of his heart, often he is to them amoral.The acting was not particularly good. I did not think anyone was good. Part of the problem is although Jason Momoa is a good actor, I do not think he was allowed to develop the role as it should be done and Rachel Nichols was nothing in the role.

Classic case of bad guys talking too much2. Too many holes in the plot3. What's the point of having sorcery powers if you don't use it4. Jason Momoa isn't really the best actor, his voice still breaks like a teenager going through puberty5. Like a bad cheesy horror movie, characters does decisions that lacks common sense6. Main bad guy sets himself up to fail, really lousy cliche ending7. If you expected at least some good fighting scenes, the blade and blood effects look cheap8. Morgan Freeman doing a background voice? Is there some morals to be learned from a violent action movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original, but...","review":"Okay, we don't have the 1980's brooding hulk version. What we do have is a mid-20's adventuring Conan. Part-thief, part-warrior, this was a wonderfully fun movie that should be seen. Mamoa is charismatic enough to carry the movie. Completely over-the-top and un-yielding for most movie fans, but grab some popcorn and enjoy if you can separate the original and this version. This is the Saturday-morning, little-brother version of Milius' classic. Much better than the ultra-silly Conan the Destroyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Amazing, But Still Awesome","review":"Critics hated this movie and a lot of people have said it sucked or was only kinda so so, but I disagree. Is it the most amazing movie I have ever seen? Not by a long shot, BUT...I did really enjoy it. It's worth giving a watch if you're into these kinda movies. Not for the kids...lots of gore and nudity, but it will definitely sooth the action/adventure/epic lover. You can listen to some of the negative reviews if you want and skip it, but I recommend at least renting or Netflixing it and give it a watch and judge for yourself. I liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flat movie","review":"Movie was just O.K. My wife and I had to watch the original after this just to bring our spirits back up. New movies like this, the hero always succeed with no strife and everything goes his way, no moments of feeling utter defeat. With the original you at least felt that the Arnold Conan had to work hard to learn what is best in life \\"To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSURD, BUT ENTERTAINING","review":"Okay, c'mon now.... It's CONAN THE BARBARIAN!!!!! My husband and I hardly expected Academy Award winning material when we rented this. We were only looking for entertainment and that's what we obtained. For those of you who don't know the story, it is about a young barbarian (a.k.a. Conan) who wants to avenge the death of his father and entire village at the hands of an evil warlord and his sorceress daughter. Jason Momoa (from Baywatch) intensely scowls his way through the entire movie in the title role. The only reason I did not give this one star is that I LMAO through most of this movie and I have seen far worse movies than this one. It also brought back fond memories of the even more absurd original with Arnold S. It is worth watching if you have seen the original movie or are entertained by movies with absurd plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting at first, but got boring quickly - even turned it off half-way through","review":"I was excited to watch this movie, but was quite disappointed with it. Started off interesting, but got boring - story seemed to go nowhere and make no sense. I just eventually turned it off and watched something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Lame. Looked like Sci Fi Channel caliber, except for the blood splatter.

Rent, Don't Buy","review":"If you are a fan of the real Conan The Barbarian with Arnie in his youth, then this movie falls very short!!! It is Conan by name only. My opinion of this movie solely on its own merits still isn't pleasant! It's crappyness is equal to that of \\"The Beastmaster\\". Plot is weak, acting is sup-par, and all in all it feels like \\"The Scorpion King\\" without the Rock! There was no empathy for any of the characters, it does little to explain who the title character is or how he got to be where he is. I know it is supposed to be a mindlessly entertaining movie - not an Oscar contender - and it does get the mindless part down. It the entertaining part that is missing! Do yourself a favor: Red Box or rent this before you consider buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONAN THE BARBARIAN","review":"THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE OF THE FILM.

My boyfriend and I went in knowing the movie was gonna be lame but there are only so many 3d movies to choose from. Anyways, when it was over we both said \\" that was actually pretty good!\\". I would watch it again......weird that I never heard anything about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Source material? Who needs it!!","review":"If Hollwood would make a film staying true to Robert E. Howard's incredible source material they would have a GREAT movie. For some reason they make a movie based not on Conan, but every other crappy fantasy cliche they can think of. So they basically have a piece crap. I had to stop watching this movie several times due to lack of interest. Maybe someday a filmmaker will come along and make a film based on Howard's writing and stay true to it. We can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have 3D Version","review":"Loved Jason Mamoa in Stargate Atlantis. Just got a new 70\\" 3D television. Bought this movie to enjoy both. Extremely disappointed. The movie really sucks!!! I mean REALLY is bad. Poor writing, acting, plot, characters and more. If that weren't bad enough, the 3D version only has 3D in the opening credits and closing credits. The rest can be viewed comfortable in 2D. Don't waste your money buying this one, unless your a porn/gore enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPICAL ASSEMBLY LINE GARBAGE!","review":"Never thought I would defend or recommend an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but this was a very bad movie. The Original had a terrible actor leading the cast, but with a great story written by Oliver Stone & good Direction from John Milius it is amongst the top Comic Book Movies ever made. This new one was hard to sit through & I was only able to go an Hour into the show before turning it off. It just looked so bad. I can't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Conan should have been better","review":"I did not enjoy watching this new Conan the Barbarian movieas much as the original with Arnold.In this movie the photography, sets, special effects, costumes,movie, stunts and acting are all better than the original.But for some reason I had liked watching the older film versionof Conan The Barbarian better. I think it's because the originalversion told a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad...","review":"SPOILER ALERT: Evil guy kills boy's father. Boy grows up and kills evil guy. That's it in a nutshell. Even at $0.99 for rental, it felt like a rip-off. Horrible acting and dialogue (cliche ad absurdum).

This one falls very short of being more than a standard action movie with nothing that really sets it apart from 100 other titles done like this. I was very let down. Glad that I didn't pay for it in the theater or but the Disc version. Free online is the way to go on a rainy day when your expectations are low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just fun","review":"This movie was just mindless fun. I liked the Arnold one but was not in love with it and it was timeto move on. This was more fun then that one and I must say the Actor was better.

If you like fun fantasy action movies then try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, It was horrible!","review":"First If you like the original \\"Conan\\", this is nothing like the old one.

Would not reccomend this movie to a friend or anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original Is/Was SOOOOO Much Better!","review":"Sad to say it, but I like the original more. Not it's sequels, which were horrible. Just the original film. The music, the humor, and the characters. In my opinion this film was a complete waste of my time. There was nothing this did that the original did not do better--except this version has special effects. Even the quality of the 3D (I saw this on the big screen) was lousy compared to films like Avatar or Titanic in 3D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"The acting is incredibly scripted. The main actor is no Arnie, thats for sure. He grumbles along through his obviously scripted dialog worse than the new Batman.The special effects and costumes are pretty awesome. There is a good bit of gore, which pleases me.It seems like hollywood is always trying to redo classics and it never quite works out. A good example is the new karate kid.Its worth watching if you get it for free with prime. I definitely wouldnt pay for it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Left Undone","review":"It's very rare that you have a movie that can't grab me and I've often enjoyed everything the critics hated with a passion. However this movie is inexcusable and outright an abomination. Weak story, pathetic swordplay, the lead guy is about a charismatic as glue and I'm even sorrier to say that the ballbusting beauty who took out bad guys in GI Joe without a second thought is terribly dull. You buy or rent this for one reason - to see Conan and Rachel get busy in the hay. That's all you watch a piece of crap like this for. The specific effects can't even save this flick and there's no real menace, the villain is a joke. There are people in my neighborhood who are more menacing then that when unarmed!!! Congratulations to the producers, you managed to make Arnold's performance in the original appear worthy of a belated Oscar Award and that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan the Movie 2011","review":"This movie did not live up to my expectations. Whoever did this movie has never read any of Robert E Howard's books. Even Arnold's movie was better. I certainly hope there isn't a Conan II in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover Art is awesome...","review":"...It's just the movie that sucks!! Very, very disappointing movie. I normally don't buy movies without watching them out in theaters or at least renting them, but with this being in my Quik picks section for a dollar off and after reading some of the positive reviews on here, I thought hey, why not. Not even the 3D (which was also bad) could save this film. The first scenes are ok/good. But once Conan comes of age, you may as well hit eject! Do NOT buy this movie for yourself, for your family or for your friends....but I guess it'd be okay to pick up for your enemies! ;Dp.s. I wish i could give it a negative star review"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"not good, worst movie i have seen in some years. don't send your money on this total lackluster production. it cost 70 million to make and looks like a syfy channel movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this was just bad!","review":"Don't know what the creative minds behind this revisioning was thinking.

The original Conan should win an Oscar compared to this turd. No redeeming qualities whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan the boaring","review":"This is a C movie where blood and shouting like a angry Brown bear is used as a substance for bad acting in a film that is like short random sketches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conan? If you say so.","review":"Friends were telling me that I gotta go see it. That this how Conan should be. I dont know where all those shill 5 star reviews came from but obviously it had to be studio people. This movie could have been a made for TV film. Unoriginal, plodding, the usual straw huts for burning, the boy looking for revenge for father and people. Sorry, say what you will about the corniness of Ahnolds movie but at least it was good adventure, even if you had to laugh at many scenes the way they played out. This guy who looked Mowgli from the Jungle Book movies, not cartoon, was wooden and too restrained as if afraid that if he gave it his all he would be accused of being over the top, which I prefer in movies like this. I appreciate that the wanted to be more serious but in doing so took it to extremes. The scenery was even much to look at. Sorry. Give me Ahnold and James Earl Jones snake cult and more popcorn and coke and shine this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie ever","review":"Warning:Don't ever buy this blu-ray, because if you watch this in 3D, you'll realize that this movie has nothing coming out of the screen, so the 3D for this film makes it entirely pointless. The film has a horrendous script for it's genre, so it's nothing like the original, However the visual effects are great for this film, but this film is really insulting to all successful remakes, this film also has poorly edited action, and also it has horrendous acting, so I'm warning you don't buy this movie, if you do, it's a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DUD.","review":"HELLO,THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, SO TAKE IT AS SUCH.

The original not only had Arnold, but James Earl Jones as the enemy. Now while Jason Momoa looked the part, his voice didn't match the character. I expected not only a slightly deeper voice (like the one he uses in Game of Thrones) but, I don't know, MAYBE an accent? Also speak a little slower, it's not a race to finish your lines. Maybe knowing how badly the movie was going to turn out, they felt they had to get through their lines fast in order to get out of there.And the people who watched it before release...you were OK with it??I'd avoid buying this movie and just rent it if you want to watch it....or better yet rent the Arnold versions. This only succeeded in making me want to watch those older movies anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you are a fan of the books like I am then you might want to see it just to see it. Otherwise it's not worth watching. The special effects are good but Momoa is a terrible Conan. How much does he weigh? 180 lbs.? Hardly fit to be a Cimmerian. And he's not a good actor either.The plot needed more depth and overall it was a complete departure from the books, and that's unfortunate because the books would make a good movie if they stuck to one of the stories. Marique the Sorceress (Rose McGowan) is the only reason I didn't give this movie one star. She played the best role. Other than that this movie was a waste of 112 mins, and an even bigger waste to those who produced it, as it flopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, easily worst movie of 2011","review":"I had pretty low expectations going into this. I'm a huge fan of the old Conan comics and the original Conan movie with Schwarzenegger and understand the inherent campiness. He's a barbarian. He drinks, he kills, he beds women. He's the James Bond of the Bronze age. But this movie had the most ridiculuous plot and horrible Syfy channel acting, it took campiness to a new low. The movie starts with a shot of him in the womb, and his mother getting stabbed in the belly during a battle. His father then cuts him out of her belly during the battle and has time to raise him in the air.The rest of the movie is just as ridiculous. There's some people made of sand, the rules of their abilities unexplained, there's a giant squid, there's a pure blood... it's just all crazy. Just about everyone in the movie, while not exactly A listers, are better than this. Jason Momoa did a much better job being Conan while playing Khal Drogo in \\"Game of Thrones\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"fail! just gore","review":"Of course Hollywood ruins another remake.

I rate 3 stars cause I like the movie, however I'd rate the 3d at a 1.2 stars. Im looking to start a 3d movie collection, thus far I have avatar,Conan, and transformers dark of the moon, with alice in wonderland on the way. But back to the movie, the price wasn't worth it especially since this movie only had 2-3 good 3d moments, and 2 of those moments were the beginning and credits of the movie that had the little fire ambers floating all over the place, wait for this to be under 10 dollars unless you are made of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top ten worst movies I've ever watched","review":"I knew Conan wasn't going to blow me away, but I did assume that a 2011 production would have decent enough story and effects to make it worth my time.

The first Conan with Arnold to the Savage Sword of Conan comics, and yes even Conan the Adventurer cartoons. This movie was by far the most disappointing (yes even more the Conan the Destroyer). The first 20 minutes of the film were good, to which everyone agrees. But the next hour or more of the movie was horrible. The casting of Conan wasnt that bad, however, Conan is a barbarian, this character was too soft and he talked too much. Action sequences were too far in between and even then the most you would get is fake blood splatter... really.... really??? Personally, I would say wait for cable.

I think you should rent it as it's not for everyone, especially the amount of blood spilled.

You will be better off watching the original with Arnold Schwarzenegger (at least you can excuse the short falls because of when it was made) .

What a waste. It's down there with Krull, Beastmaster, Scorpion King and all other 'B' fantasy-adventure flicks. Mostly a sword-fest, if you're into that kind of stuff.What I miss the most from the first version was the spectacular soundtrack from Basil Poledouris. Even though the first one was mixed in Mono (see IMDB), it still sounds better than the 6+ channel, ultra bit-rate audio from this version.The first version also had this interesting charm and simplicity. Arnold's gift was using body language - so he didn't need to speak at all in his most famous roles.Perhaps this one is closer to the original story-line but I'd rather watch that interesting Abraham Lincoln, vampire movie instead. That one was more believable - LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Momoa version lacks music, bulk and live action.","review":"Momoa cant hold a candle to Schwarzenegger in this movie(size wise). He is too skinny, and its very evident in his lack of arm size. Hardly any tricep muscles. Also, his goofy facial expressions made him look like Brendan Fraser ala the Mummy. The music score is just bland, lacks power and emotion of the original. WAY too much CGI, the cartoony sand monsters were laughable. The villian was pretty ho hum boring. They should have had him dubbed by James Earl Jones. Weak movie.. watched it once, and have no intentions of watching it again, or any sequels. Reboot? No, just boot this to the trash can. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Although this probably jibes with the story of Conan, he doesn't have much depth to his character other than a revenge seeking, womanizing warrior.

I found it better than the Scorpion King and just as good as The Prince of Persia. It has a good story with a nice array of characters to fill the world of Conan and for those who thirst for blood there is plenty of it splashing the screen. All the actors do a great job in their roles, the special effects are just right not to over the top and the enviornments fit the feel of the movie perfectly. This movie wont blow you away but it will entertain you. I was a big fan of the comic book series back in the day and with so many stories available I hope there will be many sequels to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical modern Hollywood fantasy action garbage","review":"I thought (..or perhaps optimistically hoped) Hollywood was beyond the likes of craptastic fantasy action films like The Scorpion King & Kull the Conqueror. Conan proves otherwise, as a thin storied action driven film laced with bad dialogue and 'pretty' half-actors wedged into poorly written roles. Its sad that Hollywood can continue to so badly drop the ball with this genre (...and in general) while CABLE TV NETWORKS like HBO churn out a quality product like Game of Thrones. What's even worse, is that this movie did so poorly that we'll be lucky to see another shot taken at such a great property (Conan).<edit>Allow me to retract my initial statement about Hollywood being beyond such films, as I recall seeing the tragedy that was a bundle of wasted $ : Prince of Persia. I can still hold out hope that some portion of Hollywood has quality fantasy films to offer us, after all Peter Jackson is working on The Hobbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putrid","review":"It's obvious that the only thing Conan like, in this movie is the Name. Comics are fantasy, but not absurd. He spends over half the movie flirting with the ingenue, He's a Barbarian for gosh sakes, not some simpering swain. She dispatches bad guys with aplomb, and then spends 50 minutes screaming, in one dangerous situation after another. No matter where they are, ship, forest, or hovel, the (bad guys), are always there. The 1293 gory deaths are O.K.,but,too fast to follow, but the sets are neat. The 3-D effects were weird, the things that are supposed to come out of the screen, don't. I love 3-D, and I just hate see this kind of tripe, in this medium.

Jason Momoa is better suited to grunting as Drogo than trying to be Conan.Swords, a lot of screaming, even more fake-board-break-throughs, and some impractical armor don't make a fantasy movie a success.This film needs to sit next to the re-interpretations of The Phantom, The Shadow, and any of the Highlander sequels.

Look at Arnold in his hay day and tell me he doesn't look the badass warrior he is made out to portray, the guy's comments were ridiculous but opinions are opinions.

I thought that Jason Momoa was great in his role as Khal Drogo in \\"The Game of Thrones\\" and that would have been a great way portray Conan, but I'm afraid this Conan movie is a little too soft. Like most movie re-makes, the story was a bit weak. I think that if the writers had stayed true to the Conan graphic novels/comics, it could have had brutal potential. The acting left much to be desired and the fight scenes were so complex, they seemed staged. Brutality folks! That's all a Conan movie needs.

I do not know the production budget of his movie but some of the \\"CGI\\" scenes were pretty crappy. The only reason why I gave this movie two stars, was because the of the first fight scene when Conan was a Kid, it was pretty bad a$$.

As I type, my daughter's twin sister is on the floor, picking them up after another failed attempt at opening the peg drawer. The drawer sticks and once you finally get it open, you have to do so with such force, which causes the pegs to fly everywhere.

So when I saw this for my kids (ages 4 & 7), I was very excited.First the screen is about half the size as the original, the pegs are much chunkier and the pictures are simple. It seems to be a 'kiddie' version of the original. My kids took turns playing it and they spent about 10 minutes each before they got bored and never returned. They love crafts, puzzles, spin art & spirographs, so I thought this would be a hit. When they applied pressure to put the pegs in, it fell over. The button was difficult to push and the light was dim and did not stay on during play (only a few short minutes). The drawer was too hard to open and I had to use so much force, I thought I was going to break it - it did not break, but the pegs went flying.Anyway, If I find an original at a yard sale, I may buy it, but would not spend any amount of money on this cheap rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The product is not so great.

Great, the unit shuts off to conserve battery power (3 D batteries, no less) and must constantly be turned back on. No, there is no way to turn it on and leave it on.It does have a nice storage tray for the pegs, can be laid flat, and can easily be carried from place-to-place.

I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks soon. Also, I was dismayed that the templates are single-use only. I don't know if I'd have purchased it, if I'd known. I assumed they would be multi-use.

We had to keep turning the unit on, over and over just to finish one picture. The pointed pegs are shorter and do no stay in the holes. The paper sits on the outside of the unit and relies on the pegs to keep it in place. The overall quality of this Lite Brite compared to the childhood toy that you remember is not there.

The little drawer is nice to keep all the colored pegs in but sometimes it gets stuck. If you just shake it a bit, then you can open the drawer if it sticks. It runs on 3 D batteries.

You press the button and it automatically shuts off after 3 minutes. I'd prefer the electric type to this.It doesn't stand up well, if at all.You can't push a peg in without holding it or propping it against something. It's just not the toy I remember.

However, the new lite brite has a white peg grid which you must use with the several picture sheets and two blank black sheets with white dotes or letters to show you where to poke the holes. The holes on the paper DO NOT line up with the actual holes in the gird. When my daughter uses up all of the picture sheets, I plan on using black construction paper to do the job.

I personally always liked the World of Darkness series but when this game line came out it was like white wolf hinting heavily at ending their Classic WoD series.It seemed to be impossible to read due to the fat that there was fiction everywhere. Sometimes I just want to know what a Lore does without reading a page of fictions. Horribly formatted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful game and must have for any White Wolf fan","review":"This game was very well thought out, and the stories were very well written. Demons make excellent additions to the world of darkness. Yes demons have been mentioned in White Wolfs WoD books before, White Wolf was disapointingly vague on detailing demons. The new take on demons while definately different than what White Wolf did with them before, gives demons a lot more depth. The book also gives an all new layer of depth to the over all history of the WoD role playing world, making it very useful even if you aren't planning on having Demon PCs. The only flaw of this book, which unforunately White Wolf often does was a few rules which were poorly worded, this is certainly not enough to subtract from the over all score of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of White Wolf's Best RPG's","review":"What can be added to what others have written? Its well written, well researched and fun to play. It combines the best elements of Vampire, the esoteric nature of Mage and the sheer brutality of Werewolf with a little bit of Mummy thrown in for good measure. This is going to be one of WW's most successful games."},{"rating":"2","title":"World of Darkness gets a jumpstart","review":"Demon: The Fallen is in my opinion the best game that White Wolf has made since Mage: The Ascension. White Wolf obviously put their best writers on this and it definitely shows. The system that was designed for showing off the players supernatural prowess is great! Sure it isn't as versatile as a Mage's sphere magic or as overtly powerful as a Vampire's disciplines but it can sure kick some serious tale if used correctly. The beauty of the system of the book as that characters can be made SO distinct. They can be fighters, manipulators, redeemers, assassins, etc. As to their power-level relative to the other denizens of the WoD... lets just say that a well-made Angel of Death (slayer) could probably send any elder vampire into the afterlife. That said... if you are a die-hard roleplayer pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New thought patterns","review":"The Impeccable Warrior Of Light is a intersting book about looking at life from a different perspective. The author Peace Mother has within her, a way of explaining why and how we, as human beings do not have to get caught in old programming and negative thinking from society or our parents and choose to be happy, joyful and successful in our lives. Her book is a reminder that you must be open minded to new ways to deal with old problems. .Her book reminded me to not let negatives into my life and that will effect my outcomes in the future.Lee Milteer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Don't let the somewhat high score fool you. The author's friends wrote those reviews. If you don't believe me check her website out and you'll see for yourself. That's pretty bad.There is really nothing new or groundbreaking about this book. Much of the content has been said before. The only difference is HOW the message is being addressed. The quote \\"We did not come here to lie in bed and eat bon bons all day. No one ever earned a black belt by sitting around eating bon bons\\". Seems more sarcastic than humorous and it gives me the impression that the author has some sort of disdain for the \\"unenlightened\\" masses. I'm apprehensive about self proclaimed \\"chosen ones\\" who want people to believe they were brought here to earth to save us all.

But my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. It's several short films. The first was the best, about a high school experience I think almost every gay girl goes through. The second was my least favorite. But the rest were all pretty good. Decent quality. Good story lines and over-all enjoyable.

The stories were okay but it was hard to form an opinion on something so short. I really thought since I was paying for this that it would be of a higher quality than the webseries girl/girl scene which is free. Although I do like the last short film in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling for unity","review":"She wrote it when she was 12, in sixth grade. That's impressive.I like how she incorporates in a such tragic event the unity that it brings, the strenght that build up, the morals we should live by, like \\"live like it is your last day\\", and the message we obtain by reading it.I was very moved by the story and anyone who reads it will think twice again. I recommend it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginner's book.","review":"The only thing New in this book is the photos, which are detailed and excellent for learning the basic major crochet stitches. It's really a learner's book, not an \\"idea\\" book. It has basic patterns after the learning section to practice on, and would make a good first crocheter's book because of the photographs. But there's nothing new or interesting otherwise, and it's a total waste of money if you already know how to crochet."},{"rating":"2","title":"good photos, classy projects, can't find the yarn anywhere","review":"The photos were very attractive. The projects are easy to follow and complete. The products are classy and not too \\"folksy\\" or \\"grandmotherly\\". They really are quite modern. HOwever, the yarns that she recommends are mostly sold in England and are nearly impossible to purchase in the U.S. You'll have to be a little creative on substitutions. The yarns she chose were very specific. It would have been nice to include something in the begining describing the differences in yarns in more detail. The ideas are also very practical. I especially like the simple, single color afghan that folds into it's own case as a pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Design","review":"Great fabric choices, modern, fun and colorful. I don't care for a lot of the fabric patterns used for baby items, especially ones that essentially become part of your decor.I was disapointed they used white fabric for the back of the seat reducer . . . it's not too noticable when it is on the highchair but would look better in a color that coordinates with the front fabric. The cushion is nice a thick and provides good padding to protect baby from the hard wood surface. Good quality overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"i am involved with computer graphic project.","review":"I think this book is good for create computer graphics,modify image and other entertainment or educational things."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible introduction to graphics using Java","review":"I first got hold of this book for a day in the library. I was upset that it appeared somewhat out-of-date and did not cover the Java3D API.I was very wrong.

You will be ready to tackle Java3D with renewed vigor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent writing, painful pricing","review":"Although providing nice code examples and clearly explaining the mathemantics of standard computer graphics algorithms, its ~270 (paperback) pages do not cover the scope or detail of the ~1100 (hardcover) pages in \\"Computer Graphics\\" by Foley, van Damm, et al., which costs roughly the same amount. John Wiley & Sons needs to be brought to task on the pricing issue, as the high price really shadows the real value (and business opportinity) of the book. My conspiracy theory is that the publisher is aiming to market it as a text book where students can't counter being ripped off by a publisher endorced by a professor or university."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every Penny","review":"That book was really worth every Penny. I hope Leen Ammeraal (author) continues the tradition in writing such comprehensive textbooks that are generous with information as well as code.

This means no printable dimensions or text fields to identify rooms and such. OK if you just want to play around, but if you want to design something for real you need to buy at least the Deluxe version. Not much good if you can't print the dimensions of your design.Software crashed on me several times and I was unable to get the tutorial to run until calling tech support.

The songs are more catchy & it's obvious that Jimmy has got much more confident in his singing in this one! \\"All I Want is You\\" is the most easy-listening one & it's already a Top Ten Hit in UK. (There are 2 other UK Top 10 singles \\"How Do You Want Me to Love You\\" & \\"Part People...Friday Night\\". My fave is \\"Nothing Stops the Rain\\". It's got a funky beat.

The clamp secures the fork nicely and fit both my 1 inch and 1.125 inch carbon forks.- To use it, you first clamp the saw guide into a vice (I fortunately have a clamp built into my workbench).- Then you slide the fork into the saw guide and clamp your fork down.- Oiling a new hacksaw blade makes the cut smoother and keeps fewer carbon dust particles in the air- The guide then just guides your blade through the fork. The cut is nice and even.*The only thing that could be improved upon is to see the mark for the cut through the saw guide. This required a flashlight off to the side to illuminate my mark before final clamping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as designed....","review":"I bought this to trim down my aluminum mtb handlebars and seat post and it worked great.

Orlando Jones & Eddie Griffin are wasted in a movie that was made for teenagers as all the jokes are safe black humor.

George Gailo who had input on Bad Boys and Midnight Run should be ashamed of himself for this stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is off da chain!!!","review":"This movie starts off with fantastic scenes where the two stars (orlando and eddie) are complaining or making funny gestures and jokes.

However, I knew soon enough that it was just going to be another RUSH HOUR wanna be. A very bad imitation, I might add !The plot was \\"rocambolesque\\" to say the least and Orlando Jones and Eddie Grifin had no chemistery what so ever. Further more, Eddie Griffin is NEITHER Chris Tucker nor Martin Lawrence, therefore he cannot carry a movie by himself. He better stick to supporting roles until he finds the right script. Skip this one and wait for RUSH HOUR 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY NOT FUNNY... WEAK AND VERY MESSY","review":"I wasted 2 valuable hours on this piece of garbage. Eddie Griffin and Orlando jones are WASTED in this movie. You can tell that they have true raw comedic talent, but the script doesn't do anything to really showcase their abilities. Griffin was funny for like 5 seconds and then he becomes just plain annoying. Everything about this movie is like an overstuffed burrito: JUST PLAIN MESSY.

At no point through the entire movie was I even remotely amused by anything I saw or heard on my TV screen. I started questioning how a movie that so severly lacked the essence of comedy even made it to the theaters. And what was up with the plot? I don't want to be suprised when I rent a comedy, I want to laugh. I was expecting something along the lines of \\"Rush Hour\\" or \\"Blue Streak\\", but instead I get \\"Mission Impossible\\". Horrible comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The commercial was funnier.","review":"When I bought this movie, I was so anxious to watch because the previews on the commerical was sooooo funny!

You have to listen carefully, because the wisecracks are fast. There wasn't too much violence in this movie (which is something I like). There wasn't any sex either. Therefore this movie, other than a few \\"colorful words\\" was great for teenagers. There are a few gunshot dead people, but they don't show too much of the red stuff.

My students find it interesting and readable. Each chapter begins with a case study, and includes historical background presented in a way that captures the imagination and emphasizes enduring themes in the development of U.S. social policy.

If you're going to make a Louis Armstrong compilation, at least remaster the audio. Sure, there are going to be a few record pops and crackles here and there, but that doesn't bother me. But this set does. Something you should note is that most of this disc is a live recording, if not all of it. And the sound quality is terrible. So why buy this?

Add to that the constant perspective shifts that work for numerous other authors, end abruptly without any true resolution to the scenes. In a later scene, sometimes the action may be summed up from the previous one, sometimes not. In the second half of the book, it is more of the same. I gave up at page 316. It was like reading a dry rambling lecture that puts one to sleep so that if there is a kernel of substance, it gets missed. Sorry, but I will not pick up another book by the author. My time and money are too precious to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of a good series","review":"I've never read Michael Stackpole before and picked his book up on a whim when I bought Harry Potter. It looked like it had a unique plot line so why not?It didn't disappoint. It was a little slow to start off (which may just be my inability to remember character names) but it really picked up later on. The last quarter of the book really had me hooked with the way he weaved the multitude of plots. And he is willing to kill off a main character to further the story which hightens the anticipation that much more.I can't quite give it five stars, but I have high hopes for the next in the series and might place the author on the short list of those I'll buy in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"I'm a big fan of Stackpole's writing. The first book in The Age of Discovery struck me as a bit different than some of this other work. And I'll honestly say that it took a little more time than usual for me to get into Book 1. But the book builds and the series as a whole is an excellent read. I can't recommend the book, the series, and this author highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really mediocre until the end where it gets downright bad.","review":"What seems like an interesting attempt at something different quickly loses its way and becomes trite. The concept of mapmakers being the all powerful is interesting. However, the story bogs down with uninteresting characters, locales, and plot threads. You care about no one in this story and they mostly do nothing. Just when (about 3/4 of the way through the book) you're resigned to the mediocrity, the story takes a nasty, gruesome, misogynist bent.

However, by the time I got about half-way through the book, I realized that her conclusions are based upon wild conjecture. Thiering believes that basically everything in the gospels is symbolic and that she has discovered the keys to understanding the real story behind the fiction. The real story, of course, was hidden from the uninitated, and now that hidden knowledge that was lost for thousands of years can be yours! Ya, right.

The Creative Call is much more in depth, and has exercises designed to help you understand how creativity works.If you are secure enough to know that a book does not have to include strictly \\"evangelically Christian\\" language in order to be helpful, go ahead and enjoy The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron and/or Creativity for Life by Eric Maisel, PhD.

I had hoped to use this book for a group study at my church, but ended up being very disappointed. There is little here that seemed new and fresh.One note: It seems completely geared toward women.

I don't think I've read the other authors, so I don't have anything to compare them to, but Howard's story disappointed me.She is usually a thought-provoking author, and in my opinion one of, if not the, best authors I've ever read.

This is NOT appropriate, he is not heavy enough to actually trigger the buttons--we can barely do them ourselves--if you do not hit the EXACT spot on the colored pegs, it will immediately go onto the next game. It is not that he is uncoordinated (as he rode a bike without training wheels when he was 2 and could ice skate at the age of 3, we think quite the opposite). In any case, we opted for this because the alex toys balance board is way too easy for him. This balance board is just not that fun for anyone--and as I said, not easy for a child who is not heavy enough to trigger the system to make the game work. The sounds are also fairly annoying. If you are looking for a more challenging balance board for your child who is athletic and ready for a challenge, I'd recommend getting just a standard balance board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobble Deck too wobbly for a four year old!","review":"I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandson but he was unable to do it.

Absolutely would recomend it to anyone under the 80 pounds limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good balance and focus toy","review":"My son really has fun with this toy. It's a safe way for him to enjoy feeling off-balance and it gives him a mental work-out as well. More daring kids may prefer a more challenging wobbler or balance board but this is a good place to start for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs some design changes","review":"This thing only works when used on a hard surface, and you have to hit the sensors against the ground pretty hard to register the input. Harder than my child could make the sensors hit the ground reliably in fact. In order to make it any fun for her, I had to glue plastic bumpers to the sensors on the bottom so that the sensor gets pushed further into the board with less force required, meaning that even a gentle tap on the sensor registers the hit, and I had to put it on a hard board on the carpet. Using it on our hardwoods actually DAMAGED the floors. So what you've got here is a toy that's supposed to teach kids to balance, but requires that they SLAM the sensors down, and requires that they learn on a hard surface like concrete, unless you do what I've done to it. It's a good idea for a toy, but a poor implimentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My 5 yr old son hates this toy, it was entertaining for about 5 minutes then never played with again unless I pulled out to try to entice him again.

He tried for 30 minutes on a hard wood floor. Both kids tried it. Yes they can get it to occasionally register a color, but more often than not the annoying voice says \\"oops\\". It is impossible to play \\"simon\\" when even though you are clearly balanced on the right color, the board doesn't register it. DON'T WASTE THE MONEY.Just to be clear, I tried sitting on the ground and tried to push the right side/color down and it would only register about 60% of the time. The sensors are not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My son received this toy as a generous gift, unfortunately, it has been sadly disappointing. As stated by some reviewers - the board does not seem to register the hits unless extreme force is used. My 6 yr. old son got frustrated quickly and resorted to using his hands to bang the colors/numbers - thus defeating the whole point of the balance or \\"Wobble\\" game. Even when my husband and I tried it-- more often than not it did not register the hits. I don't know if our wood floors are not level enough or if the toy is defective-- but currently it is just taking up space in our apartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This toy is a disappointment. The bottom of it is made of hard plastic, not a round rubber surface as I imagined. It does not \\"wobble\\" smoothly because of that.

This also almost completes the album cuts noted on the infamous Drama V record, circa 1975/76--which, in my opinion should *still* be released in it's entirety in CD form. \\"Life of The Party\\" and \\"Come Out of Your Thing\\" with that traditional Tony Hester/Don Davis Detroit sound are two seriously rare cuts that the true slo jam aficionado will be very pleased over.

Big mistake! First of all, it took 3 different people to finally get the battery cover off to replace the two batteries. I used cooking oil on the plastic parts so it would come off easier the next time the batteries needed replacement. That did help, although I was surprised how quickly this would be necessary.The brush does spin quite fast and with a fair amount of power.Compared to the Oral-B, this is a poor design....plus it uses 2 batteries instead of one.Get the Oral-B. A much better buy, only one battery needed and better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke almost immediately","review":"The design must be defective, because I'm reading review after review where people have a similar experience. My spinbrush failed after just a few days. It seems that water somehow got into the battery compartment and quickly corroded the electronics.

Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah...","review":"It worked great for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it just went dead... Now if this was maybe 2 or 3 months it would be fine, except for one factor:THEY MARKET IT WITH REMOVABLE HEADS AND BATTERIES. Why pretend that the product is sustainable if it isn't? I didn't abuse the toothbrush in anyway and barley got any water on it (although thats what toothbrushes do) and it still broke..I opened it up and tried to replace the batteries and I could smell that the motor burnt out. Bought an Oral-B Pulsar today, hopefully that will work out better. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery compartment won't close","review":"It does work well when you get it. I use it once a day (regular brushes the other times) because I worry about whether it's too harsh, but that's just my own thing which may have no basis in fact. Be aware that there are some replacement brush-heads that only have the top part spinning, and the bottom part doesn't move. I think those ones are not labeled \\"whitening.\\"Anyway, after a few months I have trouble getting the battery cover closed all the way.

THe problem is getting worse and worse to the point where it's almost unusable now."},{"rating":"1","title":"spinning is off","review":"I bought this toothbrush because I was looking for one that was not a kids toy. I have no basis for how it should work because I have never had anything quite like this. Basing my selection on past purchases, I expected to have a similar experience with this brush. I like the design and the coverage area of the brushes (the last one that I got seemed to have been made of rubber. But, once you manage to turn it on it acts like a jackhammer (bone jarring) in your mouth. I looked for some way to see if I could turn it down but no go. I am now afraid to use it because I am afraid that I will lose tooth enamel because it seems much too strong for its purpose.

When it dies mid brush and you have half of your mouth all nice and brushed and a mouth full of paste. Then you are forced to use something else to finish the job. I bought 2 replacement heads at the same time. The next day I had to buy a 20 count battery pack. Cheaper than buying a new \\"powered\\" brush. I just hope they last me through the 2 additional heads. All that said... that isn't the worst of it.

It cleans as good, if not better than the Sonic Care toothbrush that I used in the past and they are really cheap. You can simply purchase replacement heads when they wear out. It runs on two normal alkaline batteries and I use rechargeable batteries to save money. The toothbrush has a very good battery life and can go months without having to replace the batteries. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I highly recommend the Crest Spinbrush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery compartment is the weak point","review":"I've bought two of these tooth brushes and both have had the same problem: the battery compartment. The black o-ring within the battery compartment is the cause of the trouble. It either prevents the proper closure of the battery compartment, as other reviews have noted, or it eventually breaks entirely, allowing even more moisture inside. I've tried to find that particular o-ring in hardware stores, the Crest website, and elsewhere, but have not succeeded. If Crest would make them available, these units might last a lot longer. When they work properly, I really like these brushes, which is why I bought a second. However, until the company either supplies the o-ring replacements or, better yet, develops a new design for the battery compartment, I would strongly discourage people from buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST toothbrush EVER!","review":"This toothbrush lasted all of three weeks.

DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I have ever owned","review":"This phone is so poorly designed that I have nothing positive to say about it except that it is small. It rings very annoyingly and chirps loudly for no reason when you do something like simply hanging it up - try hanging up the phone while someone is sleeping in the next room, and you'll have problems. It has an incomprehensible menu, and the handset goes dead when it runs out of battery charge without any warning. That's the only time it DOESN'T make any noise. It runs out of batteries very quickly, so this happens often. You won't see all of these irritating features until you actually get your hands on this phone after purchase, so don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless phone!","review":"Stay away from this product if you have other phones in your house. If you are having a conversation and someone else picks up another phone in the house it will either hang up the Siemens or worse hang up both phones! Called Siemens tech support and they had the audacity to call this a \\"feature\\". The only solution to my problem is to buy another Siemens handset. I have crossed out out the name Siemens in any future purchase of any electronic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst phone ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really hate this phone. I've bought the basic $19.99 GE special (in black or white)in the past and those phones, sad to say, are much better than this one. This phone is nearly impossible to program. It is awkwardly shaped and slippery so I am constantly dropping it. You have to monitor the battery constantly because the thing always dies in mid-conversation. It also cuts out -- just goes dead sometimes - for no apparent reason. It also makes an awful chirping sound when returned to the cradle or when it rings. The keys are SO sensitive that it is nearly impossible to even enter numbers or letters. Alas, it seems like my spotted history with this device might be over. It died on me today after a year of ownership. I replaced the batteries. The thing is still dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo Siemens!","review":"I gave this two stars, only because it has some neat bells and whistles but I had to return it. I bought it for the speaker phone feature and could only get a faint sound when I tried to use it. When I called Siemens customer service, the guy told me, \\"Sounds like it's broken. Guess you'll have to return it.\\" Thankfully, Amazon is wonderful about returns so I will buy a different phone from them.

I guess it's my own fault for not reading enough about it before buying. I loved the cover illustration, but sadly, the contents were not as good. Most of the illustrations in this book are black and white, or nearly monochramatic, and small. The text I found had little to add to the illustrations. The pictures themselves start at tastefully erotic, but turn to very graphic sex acts by the end. Definitely not for kids, or the faint of heart. I found the most artfully rendered image to be the cover, and I didn't feel it was worth the money. If you're looking for a book of full color paintings of Royo's best erotic work, this is NOT the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft Core","review":"Even better than the first two in the series, not as much story, but Royo explains that off the bat. Very cool, and very prohibited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical and operetta selections","review":"The \\"Hollywood Greats\\" CD is a nice collection of musical selections from the operettas: Roberta, The Student Prince, The Desert Song, Naughty Marietta, and The Merry Widow. The songs showcase the marvelous voice of Gordon MacRae and his flexibility for singing many different types of music, be it fast numbers or beautiful love ballads. On this CD, Anne Triola sings on three numbers, but she is no match for MacRae's great voice; however, Lucille Norman, his other singing partner, is!! Her beautiful soprano blends perfectly with his golden baritone. MacRae's beautiful, sensual renditions are overwhelming! He can sing tenderly and softly one minute and then powerfully the next, and his diction is so clear that you can understand every word. This group of music was taken from records released in the 1950s featuring Gordon MacRae. My only complaint is that it does not include selections from The New Moon and The Vagabond King, which he also performed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE SERIES FOUNDERS","review":"This is the second in the series, and whilst it is a great book, it lacks the detail of many of the other in this series. It only covers the WWII era of this vessel that served up to Vietnam.

My kids were driving me nuts so I took a \\"time out\\" and went to a local coffee house for a break from family life. Lynn was the musician on stage and her vocals and guitar playing blew me away. I'd never heard of her but have now purchased all three of her more recent albums. \\"Night\\" is supposed to be the weakest of the three. Frankly, I couldn't tell and the stuff on the disk is so much better than most of the [stuff] on the radio, it really doesn't matter how it stacks up against her other work. But, even upon comparison, it's a great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great recording by Lynn Miles","review":"I read some less than enthusiastic reviews of this recording before I bought it, mostly based on Larry Klein's production being \\"too slick\\" or percussion heavy. I completely disagree with those reviews. I think the production on this CD is complex and interesting, and definitely gives Lynn her own distinctive sound. Especially following \\"Slightly Haunted\\", which is much more folky and sounds a lot like early Joni Mitchell in places, this cd has a clear, contemporary, but not slick sound. Lynn's songwriting is spectacular, and her voice is unique, beautiful and a little quirky. This has become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs make a gread CD","review":"I bet all of you share this experience with me - there are some CD's you bought where you end up only liking one maybe two songs on it and there are others that turn out to be full of good songs. It all gets down to the songs themselves and the songwriting. You can have a crappy song and no matter how good the singing, musicianship and recording is it's still a crappy song. Well this CD has great songs from a great songwriter and they're performed beautifully. I actually like some of the production better on \\"Slightly Haunted\\" but it doesn't have the great songs this one does.This ones a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you people talking about?","review":"I am amazed at the reviews I have seen here. I really do not understand. Lynn's first CD was a masterpiece, one of the greatest CD's by a female artist I have ever heard and probably the only one I listen to on a regular basis these many years later...Night in a strange town, however, was an enormous letdown. I bought it as soon as I saw it, just assuming it must be great. Wow was I disappointed. I thought, well, maybe it will grow on me.

Not so much. Mounted in a useful position, openeing the closet did not provide enough light (even on the low-light setting) to turn these on. So I moved it right up to the front of the closet. Well, that worked... however when you close the closet, the light reflecting off the door is enough to keep the stupid thing on, so it wouldn't turn off.

But, then, why did we lose our hair? Well, maybe we didn't come from apes!Evolution is probably flawed, and Creationism doesn't explain how God was created. So, I opt for the agnostic view of things.

It gives plausible explanations of so many of the things that religion cannot explain. Biology, human nature and sociology are explained in a simple but interesting way . It leaves the human species uncovered on just what it is that makes us. Books such as Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors enriched my life.

Yes, it's grown on me to an extent, but not in a good way. Carl Sagan is clearly a clever guy, who knows his evolutionary biology. It's written in sharp, polished prose, which draws in (rather than puts off) the layperson. Having spoken to some of my science friends from university, however, it's clear that his views on extra-terrestrial intelligence are not mainstream. In isolation, that's okay, but you need to offer good quality evidence to back it up. Sagan doesn't really do this, and should therefore be more suggestive."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book","review":"Although a Carl Sagan fan since I was a student, I never heard of this book.

It isn't - it's sweet, not minty at all, and slightly grainy.Regarding Mintiness:The non-mint nature of it makes it perfect for cold and wind-ravaged lips, when mint would burn and irritate.Regarding Graininess:The slightly grainy nature is a normal effect of cocoa butter granules crystallizing over time and is actually a sign of the highly natural formulation.I can't recommend this product enough - as far as I'm concerned, it is one of the gentlest, longest-lasting, nicest-feeling natural lip balm preparations on the market.

The author reiterates those three ideas on almost every single page.I officially cannot finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Stuart at her worst","review":"Ann Stuart's writing is not for everyone, but I usually find her books riveting and a welcome change in romantic reading. The heroes are rough and cruel and the sex scenes (lots of them) are not tender and warm, which is ok as long as there is growth and change in the relationships and the heroes themselves.Not so in Moonrise: The heroine is a cluless wimp who does not learn anything from start to end. She is afraid of the hero but wants him, without realizing anything about herself or him throughout the book. The hero loves her but hates her, drawn to her but hates her, wants to protect her but hates her... Its tiresome.And lastly - the plot is unreasonable, and you end the book still not knowing what went on and why. Leave this one alone and read instead Ruthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best biology book I ever read!","review":"This is an outstanding and very readable book on the world of microbes. Beautifully written and filled with insights, it should be required reading for biology students. I couldn't put it down and I hated biology in high school! I takes you from the beginnings of our planet to the present time, showing the reader the crucial role of microbes in the creation and maintenance of all life. This book will also be of interest to any serious student of the Gaia hypothesis. Read it and you will never think of cells, bacteria and viruses the same way again. You will come away with a humbling and enlightened view on man's place in a world created, dominated, and maintained by microbes.For those of you who don't know, Lyn Margulis is the ex wife of the late Carl Sagan (prior to Ayn Druian) and Ms. Margulis is Dorian Sagan's mother.Together, they make an excellent writing team."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book blows your head off","review":"In this book Lynn and Dorion show that things are not as we usually think they are. It covers the evolution of life from the beginning to humanity. It also shows that the synthetic theory is an uncomplete view of the evolution of life on earth. The book will change your point of view or at least will make you think a lot. And that, with a lot of work and research, is what sience needs. I think that \\"What is life\\" is another book that everybody should have in their library. I believe that the endosymbiothic theory as the origin of eucariotic cells is as important as the idea of natural selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but lacks depth","review":"Worth reading for some intersting facts, but I prefer the similar \\"Vital Dust\\" by Christian de Duve, which seems to convey far more information in the same number of pages, although it is also less easy to read.

It is *symbiosis* that drives evolution!!!","review":".This is of the most important books in the history of humanity! . . . Don't believe me?I can understand why you may hesitate. After all, there have been decades of propaganda to the contrary!This book proves (to my satisfaction, anyway) that Darwinism is incorrect when it insists that competition is the driving force behind all of evolution. While competition is an important aspect of the process, it is *symbiosis* that is the true and primary engine shaping the evolution of Life.All of you social darwinists . . . read it and weep!

I did not expect an undergraduate book with many chemical formulas, but many ideas seemed only sketched. I can not say that anything is really wrong but I was left with the impression that the claims were not really substantiated.I am now reading \\"the origins of life\\" (Smith and Szathmáry) which -- while even shorter and somewhat dense -- I like much more. It is more precise and the authors clearly tell, what is substantiated \\"knowledge\\" and what is speculation.

There's a lot of energy coming from the band, especially the vocals. But what immediately turned me off to this album is the horns. I don't think I've ever heard an album from a signed band that is as out of tune as this one. As soon as the horns start playing you can tell unmistakebly that they are not in tune at all with the rest of the instruments. I don't see how they could overlook that. They should have noticed after recording the very first song that something wasn't right, but instead let it go for another 20 songs. If everything had been in tune, this album would definitely rock and I would give it at least a 4, but instead it gets a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good advice, but you've got to hurry!","review":"As I said in another review: \\"Love Parker or bash Parker, just about every American wine lover pays attention to what he says.

The only thing he seems to care about is selling himself.This isn't just a criticism of this book, but of all Parker's world. He rates wine on a scale of 50 - 100. If a wine scores 82 is it really 5 better than one that scores 77? What does this mean? Wine is something that should be enjoyed with friends, not scored like a college exam. I don't rate my friends from 50 - 100, and I don't rate wine this way. On a more technical level, he trys to taste all his wine straight from the barrel before bottling. This is just plain silly. You don't judge a cake by eating flour and raw eggs. You taste the finished product.If you want good wine advice, then buy books by Hugh Johnson or Oz Clarke or Jancis Robinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Heart warming read!","review":"I enjoyed this book so much.

This was a wonderfully woven tale of family tragedy and triumph as well as individual growth within the protagonists as women and as sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and full of insights!","review":"Mary Alice Monroe always has wonderful insight into emotions and relationships. Her style of writing is crisp and beautiful. In The Four Seasons, she does a great job of interweaving the story of sisters who have unresolved conflicts and family issues. Their journey--literal and emotional--develops the characters on lots of levels. The story is like a symphony, with some notes and instruments taking the lead while others subside. Bottomline--this novel is uplifting, insightful, and comes to a full and deeply satisfying conclusion. Monroe is a gifted author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Seasons - Wonderful!","review":"You know a book is really good when you want to pass it on to everyone you know!

Am anxiously awaiting her next book. kg"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dimensional Characters","review":"I went in search of a touching yet humor filled story that provoked thought, discussion and action and ultimately chose Four Seasons as our book club pick based on reviews and research. I'm embarrassed as the story lacked depth, connectivity, and humor. The author skimmed along the top of major issues, dipped a toe in when the story was stuttering to a stop, then jumped out and flashed forward before you \\"felt\\" what she was trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Male Perspective","review":"Women's fiction? The Four Seasons should be classified as \\"Men's and women's fiction\\". I'm a 43 year old male and found the book delightful.Whether you have one sister, four sisters or even four brothers, there is something unique that this book has to offer i.e. a look into the maturing relationships among siblings.Jilly, Birdie, and Rose stumble upon a once in a lifetime opportunity to find something \\"lost\\" within themselves and find that the beauty of childhood is always with you.Very good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"This novel tells the story of the four Season sisters . When they gather for youngest sister Merry's funeral they are presented with the chance to confront a family secret that has festered for nearly thirty years. As they gather for the funeral each of the Season sisters is awash in her own problems. Investigating an old family secret gives them the opportunity to face their own demons, as well as to fulfill Merry's dying wish. If the plot sounds a bit hackneyed, that's because it is. The plot is entirely predictable. At no point was I surprised, and I saw the end coming from a mile away. The writing is also clunky. The prose is littered with excess detail, which serves no real purpose. Ultimately this book was far too predictable and sentimental to be enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story with relatable characters","review":"An easy to read entertaining story of three sisters reunited to bury their youngest sister. painful long buried family problems come to light and are explored from each sisters perspective. Well written and quick moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"guilt and love folded together","review":"I am an only child, but totally understood the relationships among the four sisters in this novel by Mary Alice Monroe. Any woman will'get' the connection these sisters have. They have different responsibilities, goals and personalities but two common threads... they are sisters and they all have guilt. The story is somewhat predictable, but there are gaps of the conclusion that are not understood until the end. It is a beautiful tale of the experience three of four sisters have after one of them dies. Each of them have harbored guilt for many years over a childhood family tragedy. As the story unravels, it is obvious that none of them realized the impact the incident had on all of their lives. Gripping, heartwarming and as usual with Mary Alice Monroe... thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"cars, trucks & trains","review":"My son just turned 3 years old and is obsessed with trucks and construction equipment.

The text is fine, but a couple of the illustrations send messages that are objectionable in my mind - one shows a mom basically ignoring her kid while she gabs on with a friend at the coffee shop (kid wants a cookie, the implication is that mom will say \\"no!\\" even though she got herself a coffee), and the other shows a dad ignoring a dejected-looking kid on the playground, who is waiting to play basketball, while he talks on the phone.

This is especially great for people who are always busy and want to have some fun studying while learning a ton. And she even comes up with enjoyable poems and songs to help remember the word. Believe me, I was skeptical at the beginning too, but once I kept listening I realized it was really working and I obviously have proof.

This driving time really cuts into her study time. In an effort to help prepare for the SAT I searched for a form of media that she could listen to during her commute and that would help prepare her for taking the SAT. The only real resource I found was this CD, Not To Scary Vocabulary. I took a chance and purchased. My selection turned out to be a win with my daughter. She has really enjoyed the casual, informal and humorous delivery of the material. As a family we have even taken the CD's with us on a couple of road trips. I have found my purchase to be a good value and would highly recommend to others.

I bought this set to study for the GRE and found that I could not use it as a study aid for more than ten minutes because Mazer's voice and anecdotes proved to be so irritating that they seemed condescending to me. These CDs may be helpful and enjoyable to young high school students studying for the SAT or ACT, but adults and college students should stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoying but effective","review":"I'm an SAT tutor and if you can stand to listen to Ms. Mazer's annoying voice and stories of her dating days, you will learn new words and her approach is effective. For some teenagers, Ms. Mazer is too much to listen to--my son refuses. However, I've listened to all her CD's and I've learned and remembered new words. I would suggest your borrow one CD from a friend and try it first before you buy it. Ms. Mazer's approach is more effective than Princeton Reviews Word Smart and Word Smart II if you can tolerate her. If you are a parent who doesn't allow your children to watch the Simpsons or South Park then you will find Ms. Mazar's stories equally crude. But remember, this is targeted to 16 year old students and you probably won't like her stories but she doesn't say anything kids don't already hear in a public high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutter trash.","review":"Well, this would certainly expand your vocabulary.Normally, one would associate the idea of increasing your vocabulary with lifting yourself to a higher level and communication on a level that is a bit more dignified.If never want to associate with successful people of the world but you want to know what they are taking about then this is probably a CD for you. Or if you are in high school with run away hormones and want to impress your friends in the bathroom go for it.In the first few minutes you'll learn about the word abash by association with phrases like \\"if your fly is open and people can see your private parts.\\" After that you'll have other examples to help you learn words where the examples are things like a woman \\"posting nude photos of her over weight husband on the internet.\\"That's all in the first 5 minutes.The slang that is used in all the examples just further supports the idea that the CD's are for someone who's vocabularly is \\"like totally cool.\\"Buy a dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was thrilled but my young teens couldn't stand it","review":"I heard the author when she was a guest on a local radio show and I was so impressed with her concept and personality.

I figured we would all enjoy it. Well I was very disappointed because my children couldn't stand the style of it. They thought it was really dumb. My young teen said, \\"The jokes weren't funny, her voice is irritating, the way she says thing is irriatating and it seems like she is talking to a 2 year old.\\" I think it comes down to style and taste, but in the case of my kids, it wasn't a fit.

So be aware that it might not look nice and new.Secondly, I didn't realize how lengthy and detailed this book was until I got it... and I found it really excessive in that sense. Most new parents won't have the time, energy, or desire to fill in this book. But some will, of course. So if you find it important to keep a record of things like \\"My child first focused his eyes on _(date)__\\" and other minutiae, this might be the book for you.

The size of the book is nice because it's small enough to carry in a pocket, for ease of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not really small enough...","review":"It wont tuck nicely into your lab coat about half of it fits, snug and the top half sticks out. As for the inside...I haven't found a use for it yet. The days I had it at work with me, there was no need to pull it out and the days I didn't have it, I didn't miss it. I'll hold on to it, it may come in useful at some point, just not yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Who's Your Daddy\\" Kicks Butt!!!!!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a fellow student in the Classics department at the University of Iowa. The minute I started reading this, I had to call in sick from class and work because I could not put this down. I laughed so hard at Patrick and Robbie's escapades with Latin Clubs in California, because I am a former \\"consul\\" of a Latin Club, so I can identify with the two fellow classics lovers. The characters are just so amazing in this book...I never felt myself care about imaginary figures, but these people are written from a truly creative, understanding mind. These characters are more than imagination...they are genius creations. I carry this book with me everywhere...anybody with any sense of what's good in literature is in for one heck of a ride. This is an amazingly clever, touching, and wickedly funny piece of writing. You must read this. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK","review":"This is my favorite book. It talks about politics, religion, music, anime, high-tech surveillance, and families. The main characters are interesting, and they care for one another. I especially like the character Patrick who is Jimmy Callahan's son. He shares the same interests I do. I would like to have him as a friend. It would be cool to have a father like Jimmy even though Jimmy has problems. It would also be cool to have a father who has a girlfriend like Fiona because she is very hot. And Patrick's half-sister is good at Social Studies, so she would be cool to have as a sister when final exams come around.I think everybody should read this book. I wish my English teacher would assign this book instead of the one by T. Whatshisname Boyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what it Promises","review":"The basic idea of this CD was a good one - taking unused Ray Charles tracks and adding as backup the Count Basie Orchestra. However, there is a good reason these tracks were never used - they are awful. On most of the tracks, Ray Charles sounds like he is high on drugs. He had trouble sticking to the melody, and the Basie accompaniment only amplified the difference between a solid performance and what can best be called toss away material.These tracks should never have seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"faking and industry crass commercialism","review":"This is the recording that never was. One will never know what the original ray charles tapes sounded like--all we know from the liner notes is that much was unuseable and that through the genius of modern technology, ray charles' lyrics were improved and melded with an improvised new basie (after the Count) band's music. Whether Ray would have wished it his way or did it this way is an unknown and the effort, in the circumstances, exploits an artist and his public to improve the bottom-line of a recording company. That, in my view, is a sad commentary on the state of today's music \\"industry.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but...","review":"This is a very good album. Yes, it is a sham. It's not real. Basie and The Genius never happened, at least in this fare. But guess what? It doesn't matter.The reality here is, the Basie band is great. Joey DeFrancesco is great in his cameo. Ray is not bad. All of this adds up to a much better album than I have heard all of the artists on this record produce in a \\"real\\" setting on several occasions.So, the fact that the vocals (Ray) were dredged up from some basement somewhere, then the Basie Band was overdubbed backing the vocals doesn't make a lick of difference in my opinion. It sounds really good. Yes, Ray's voice sounds a little flat at times, but the whole thing comes off well. Plus, I didn't hear anyone complaining that Avatar wasn't real. We all just sat back and enjoyed. Try that with this album. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"...an \\"excellent use of technology,\\" but is it good?","review":"This may be an \\"excellent use of technology,\\" but is it good? I don't think so. Yes, Ray sings and yes, the Basie band (not Basie) swings (a little), but what I hear is not a real synergy. To my ears, which have heard both Ray and The Count (not together) live on many occasions, this CD sounds fake and contrived. This is not Basie's book it's Ray's, and the band just does not fit with the C&W hits and the other Charles classics. I had high hopes for this album as I am a fan of both Ray and The Count. Call me a stinker, but I've been listening critically for close to forty years and this one just does not cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listenable... but there's so much that is better","review":"Ray Sings, Basie Swings isn't a bad album... it just isn't very good.Other people have commented on the sound quality of this CD. For my tastes Ray's voice is flat and the Basie Orchestra isn't exactly on fire. So what...But in world where you can buy any one of a dozen of Ray Charles or The Count's best albums for less money than this album, why would you settle for this one?And you would get so much more out of them. This album is practically throwaway by comparison.For Ray Charles, try Genius Sings Soul, Genius Hits the Road, or Soul Brothers.For Count Basie, pick up Atomic Basie (or just about anything else he recorded WHILE HE WAS ACTUALLY ALIVE).Get it if you want it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just don't prepare to be amazed, because you won't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the hype on this CD","review":"Despite what the producers of this album want you to believe...the vocal tracks on these tracks are not \\"superior\\". It sounds like Ray Charles is singing in the shower, and the shower is on the other side of the house....meanwhile, the basie orchestra and the backing vocal singers are blasting away on the couch right next to you.This is a great technology achievement???? This is horrible, on many levels, and not because they merged two sets of tracks cut 30 years apart. On some tracks, Ray's vocals are basically inaudible...and Ray is just an annoying buzz in the background. Most modern bootleg recordings are way better than this. There's a reason these tapes were buried away somewhere, as good as Ray's performance may have been if you saw the show live.Spend your hard earned money elsewhere...as another viewer noted...there are much better recordings of both Ray the the Basie Orchestra available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful gimmick . Sadness.","review":"I don't care how good the songs may appear to sound.This a complete fake and I am concerned that these mash ups will initiate a trend.... \\"Shakira sings Misty with Wes Montgomery\\", anyone ?

If it takes you 100 pages to build a climax and you can't get your reader interested until halfway through your book, then I would not suggest writing or reading this. It was terrible! If there wasn't such a long beginning it would have been all right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack McNamara","review":"I read other Lois Duncan books, but this one is the worst. It is about two boys who supposedly go \\"hiking in the woods\\" but never come back. This book makes know sense and it is very confusing. First of all, the reason why they go \\"into the woods\\" is because they are both involved in a drug smuggling scam and it is destroying their lives, and one of them pushes the other down. One problem, Joan (one of the boys' sister) talks to a girl named Peggy. To Joan, Peggy seems awfully familiar to her. Then, when she gets home she says \\"Now Joan knew where she had seen Peggy before, she was staring at her in the mirror\\" referring to herself! What is that supposed to mean?! Also, the ending made no sense, just read it for yourself! I don't recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this because it was a wonderful book.","review":"The book Never Came Home was wonderful I think any kid that loves to read should get this book. I'm not saying I love to read or anything. but I'm saying that you should read it. The one thing I like in this book is that when they were lost the Mother and Father always got some kind of funny or scary call. That was the favorite parts that i personally liked. Well I'm not going to tell you any more about the book. It's up to you to read the book. But I think you will love it, I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I would have to say that this novel did not do a good job keeping the reader interested yet at times it did have good scenes.

I had a hav-a-heart trap and i caught multiple mice with it, in a couple of weeks--but i bent the door latch and decided to try these... big mistake. In more than a month, I've caught just two mice (I used to catch two mice at once with the other trap). The traps tip if your floor isn't perfectly even, so every morning I come in to empty closed traps. (And today, I found a trap from which a mouse had managed to escape--he pushed the cap off the end after he finished off the peanut butter.) I'm upset that I wasted money and time with these. I'm ordering a new hav-a-heart trap now--I need a mouse trap that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic too thin - mouse chewed right through","review":"I bought three of these not only because they are a humane option (killing is NOT an option in my house) but because of their price. I set them out at night and checked them in the morning. Nothing for two days. Then on the third morning I noticed a pile of black shavings under the door which was about 75% closed. The mouse had gone in, ate the peanut butter, then chewed the plastic and got out. These are too cheaply made. Don't waste your money.

I wonder how he feels about GE food? Very thought provoking. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really enjoy it","review":"Take your chances with this book. I didn't like it really. I bought it because it was an award winner. And though the details of the story were cool, it was too pretentious for me to get into. I give 2 stars for originality and being able to convey the fantastic in rich detail. But there was nothing underneath it to hold it together. I just have to voice this opinion - you will of course make your own decisions. But the Marxism and the opera and the flash-back-forward-around was not so much impressive as tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is a great Work, I am very happy to have it as a part of my collection.

The author breaks his subject down to \\"forces responsible in the Charismatic groups\\". He also shows followers of these mind control organizations case histories of these groups. I find his book excellent because while he shows a description of these organizations, he also shows recovery principles. I recommend anyone reading this who knows someone who has been involved with not-only religious mind control organizations, but someone who has become involved with pyramid-scheme marketing companies and even people who exert a strong influence. I recommend you reading this publication so you can learn how people are influencing you to do things you may not want to do. Other recommended categories to research includes confidence schemes, mind-control and charismatic groups. This book is a recommended first-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful, but poorly made boots","review":"I was originally very happy with these boots.

The most obvious fault is the steth. The bell sensitivity seems to pick up lots of random noise at an equivalent level as the BP you are trying to take. So, its very hard to hear anything with this unless you have high BP. Good luck using this on a hypotensive person or listening for breathing sounds. You can't hear clearly with it! Also, the cuff doesn't deflate fully. I hate that. You check a BP, let the air out, then you need to manually push the air from the bladder for anything below 20. Good luck, but don't buy this one.

The textbook was not the easiest book to read, although it did help on sleepless nights! There was a good use of color and graphics in the textbook but they didn't help clarify the topics as well as I thought they should. The graphics and tables should be another way of presenting the material covered, but they just seemed to add more confusion. The review quiz at the end of the chapters was helpful in regards to the terms. The application excercises should be left for a computer application class. I think most of the people that are reading this book for class purposes already know the basics to most applications used on computers. Overall, I would recommend using another textbook for this type of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is well organized, but the substance is lacking","review":"The organization of this book is very good, and very understandable. The way the author organized the main concepts and backed them up with real-world examples is commendable. However, there is a problem with the book's content. The main concepts are presented in such a way as to assume the reader had previously been taught what they were. I am presently taking a class with this textbook, and it took three chapters before I finally grasped the idea of what an information system really was!

All case studies and real-world problems have been updated to correspond with this movement as well. The 9E is the \\"Essentials\\" version of O'Brien's books.

It seemed to me that they were just trying to come up with definitions to make the book longer, when all they were doing is repeating themselves over and over again. For instance, on page 280 it talks about videoconferencing. It gives the definition and that's all good, but then it has to go into desktop conferencing and teleconferencing, which they're all basically the same thing, but yet they all have to have they're own definitions and then again repeated in the chart on page 291. Yes, the book was informative and someone could learn from this book. The seemingly needless repetition, and all the little definitions about every little process was a little frustrating to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIS Textbook Evaluation","review":"Overall I gave this book a rating of 4 stars. My general reasoning behind this rating is the ease to which I could use the book and its contents. I feel that the figures in the book are the most helpful and useful features. The figures give a good summary of a large amount of information in an easy and understandable format such as Figure 11.23 and Figure 8.1. The way the chapters are sectioned off makes reading easier. It breaks things down so you don't feel so overwhelmed with the amount of information. I really liked chapter six dealing with the internet and e-commerce. This is a huge area in business in which we need to know about. I feel this book gave a good basis for understanding the role the internet and e-commerce plays in business.

It's Suess-Lite, but perfect for when you just need a smile, or a breather. Sometimes the simplicity lets us look at our selves better and to see the simple truths in living. It is a perfect little gift for the graduate, or just to keep on your desk for when you need a smile, and a short breather to put life in perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment narrowly averted","review":"Based on other comments, I bought this as a \\"stocking stuffer\\" type gift to go along with something a little more substantial for my Mom's birthday. Am I ever glad I didn't ship it directly to her! This is little more than a hardcover pamphlet with disjointed, context-less snippets from Ted Geisel's wonderful books forced into highly unlikely, even bizarre categories invented by some editor years after the good Doctor's death (would you believe Dr. Seuss \\"On Equality and Justice,\\" or \\"On Diversity\\" or \\"On Activism?\\"). I found myself recoiling from this obvious attempt to milk a few extra bucks out of the Dr. Seuss legacy on the cheap. Buy it for yourself if you were just going to toss that money in the gutter anyway, but don't embarrass yourself or the recipient by presenting this painfully obvious marketing project as a gift. Buy a book by Dr. Seuss instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Book\\" is about 50 cents worth of Dr. Seuss...","review":"This is not a critique of Dr. Seuss, nor a bash of his works... BUT... REALLY... It's almost like the few pages of this tiny book get lost between the covers. You can read and digest what little has been printed in this book in less than 2 minutes(even if you're not the fastest reader!). Considering the wealth of writings of Dr. Seuss, please don't waste your time with this pitiful excuse for a publication.

The ageing of this book shows in some phrases such as \\"Got any Veras?\\" which, incidentally, is Brit-slang for an illegal drug.

While that is true (it's only 32 pages), it's also a physically small book (4.5 x 0.3 x 5.8 inches). Additionally, I was a bit disappointed with the content. All of the advice is just snippets from some of the good doctor's more famous books. The best advice comes almost exclusively from \\"Oh, The Places You'll Go!\\" while the rest is just hardly what I would really consider to be a \\"prescription for living\\" (Example: The book's advice for respecting your elders is \\"Don't Hop on Pop\\").

Including why Roxane had run away from her husband in the first place.Reivew: The first 2/3rds of this book took place over a very short period of time and the entire rest of the \\"pregnancy\\" took only the rest of the book.

There are many errors, duplicate pictures and projects, poor writing, hardly any instructions. Headings are switched around or completely left off. The peyote chapter had no heading and the stitch is explained incorrectly. This is true for most of the instructions. It seems that this book was put together quickly by people who had no idea what they were doing.

I have found other reviews stating they had discharged themselves right out of the box.These extinguishers are made in Mexico of cheap and crudely molded plastic parts it's no wonder they can't make a gas tight seal.

Amarex fire extinguishers are the best, they are made in the USA, and they come with a sturdy metal mounting bracket, unlike the Kidde that comes with a total piece of junk plastic bracket (what a joke). Plus, Kidde extinguishers are made south of the border. Do yourself a favor and get Amarex! It is the only way to go.

That is not entirely so. Although the album is good, the recording does not sound as good as the albums released a few years after. The music is a little more blues sounding and a little less country then other CDB albums, but still has that Southern Rock sound the Charlie Daniels conveys on all albums. I wouldn't recommend this album for first time fans, but rather something to save for serious fans that know the sound from an album doesn't have to be perfect for the song to sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several myths included as \\"fact\\" in this book","review":"Be careful - though this is an entertaining read, several historical anecdotes in this book are based on folklore rather than actual documented facts. I would recommend \\"A Way Through the Wilderness\\" by William C. Davis for a factually accurate history of the Trace instead of this book, which at times reads like a dime novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the Trace","review":"The best book on the Natchez Trace, where Meriwether Lewis died, is The Devil's Backbone by Jonathan Daniels (1962). Very evocative details and a good map too. It's difficult to imagine traveling under such difficult circumstances as faced by people in early America. The Trace was considered an improved road; tree stumps in the road were required to be cut off shorter than 16 inches. As well as being rough traveling, the Old Trace was a dark, heavily forested, and creepy place. Some years later, Audubon made special note of the vultures that flew low to the ground in this area, looking for food. There were human vultures as well.One entire chapter of The Devil's Backbone is devoted to Lewis's death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Economy means broken on arrival","review":"I picked up two of these because they were inexpensive. I understand that you get what you pay for, but that shouldn't mean that the plastic should be delaminating/coming apart right out of the box.

Many public speaking help books will fill your mind with mechanical tips that everyone, I assume, should already be aware of...i.e., \\"put inflection into your voice to emphasize your point...\\" Duh!Wydro takes a much more top-down, holistic approach to speaking which emphasizes the attainment of an inner stillness (i.e. states of relaxation / self-confidence) as the REAL first step in successful speaking. He not only emphasizes this but gives practical, no-nonsense advice on turning this \\"inner stillness\\" into a reality. In this way, Wydro's book is AWESOME, and succeeds where other books fall short.While many books in this genre will mechanicize your speaking thought process, and, sadly, turn you into an even more self-conscious speaker, Wydro's techniques teach much more: that is, to speak naturally, spontaneously, and freely..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find!","review":"I first read this book years ago when I began speaking at a Toastmasters group. At first, it helped me with my impromptu speaking. Later, it helped me to begin making small improvements in my daily actions (the slight edge technique). I was very disappointed it was out of print at the time and I couldn't buy a copy for my own library. Recently, a fellow Toastmaster member found it...and bought a copy for me. I was so grateful -- this is a book to read again and again.I recommend it to all my clients...Deceptively valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much More Than I Expected","review":"The reason I got this book was illustrated in the first sentence. All of us have been called upon, on a moment's notice, to speak on a topic without preparation. I got much more than I expected. This book is one of those that will have to be read 2 times or more to fully digest the important topics. Expect to be challenged and maybe a little overwhelmed as the author delves deeply into what is going on in our \\"background thoughts\\". While there are a lot of abstract points, Wydro comes through with some very practical applications as he discusses the Slight Edge Technique, P.R.E.P., the Creative Process Technique, and an intriguing open-ended question exercise. I took lots of notes and found his stories and illustrations to be extremely helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought that this book would give me significant guidance for impromptu speaking, but it didn't. I have to be honest and state that I haven't read the entire book. I got about half way through. It talked a great deal about breathing exercises which I found irrelevant. The only thing that I liked about the book was that it gave you the PREP formula to apply to your impromptu speaking.

But it surprised me to hear how \\"done up\\" the arrangements were: too many instruments, at times, and often too much harmonic or rhythmic complexity backing very basic melodies. Frankly, some of the arrangements seemed to mimic some of the worst aspects of canned Celtic and new age music. This is a promising program and I would not discount Card's ability to sing it well.

The individual vignettes are both historically informative as well as most entertaining. I plan on purchasing several copies of this masterful work to give as Chrismas gifts to friends and family. This book is a real sleeper...and it needs to be discovered by reading Americans who care about significant historical relevance.

This album combines pop and rock tunes with jazz, and breathes new life into tired old standards. The depth of her voice and tone are warm and soothing, and the melodic background singers add the sweet frosting to the cake. Art Khu's smoking piano solos leave you wondering if there were any piano keys he didn't hit. And John Evans makes the bass come alive; the bassline isn't just background on this record. The 2-CD album has lots of songs (24), with a good balance of originals (both folkish and funky), standards, and \\"acoustic smashing\\" tunes combining several elements and styles.

And, quite honestly, it was one of the best devotional experiences of my life. Balentine is a wonderful writer, and one of the only complaints I have is that separate sections of just pure reflections were few and far between. He does a great job of connecting the seemingly irrelevant, ritualistic stipulations of Leviticus to our modern understandings of worshipping God. In particular I enjoyed his continual stating that Leviticus is a book that combines belief with action: \\"The measure of Israel's obedience to God is not only the purity of the rituals; it is also the morality of its everyday conduct\\" (153). The sad thing is that most folks will still tend to ignore the book of Leviticus in their sermon circulation. However, if you are one of those few who is brave enough to tackle Leviticus, this is by far the best resource available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that unites","review":"To accompany David Maybury-Lewis' thought-provoking PBS series \\"Millenium\\", Hans Zimmer has fashioned a tapestry of the sounds of the world.

This PBS series and the accompanying book seem to be unavailable through the Amazon site. Pity. The message of \\"tolerance and pluralism\\" cries for more listening ears. Each time I hear this collection of rich music, I am carried to another place. Excellent. This music deserves a new category called \\"For the Ages\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music to carry you to other worlds","review":"This music is beautiful and inspiring. I once created a dance to one of the main themes of this score.This music is the soundtrack to a TV series that aired on PBS in the early 1990s. The series was about the differences between modern lifestyles and \\"primitive\\" lifestyles of the tribal peoples from throughout the world, and how an exchange between the two might be mutually beneficial. So, naturally, the composer incorporates the sounds and effects of the different tribal peoples into this soundtrack, and some songs even include tribal chants and songs, which are very beautiful.This music has a timeless and encompassing feel to it.

I have had the CD for about one month and play it all the time and still think it is on a par with Zimmer's The Thin Red Line and Batman Begins sountracks.If you still are skeptical go back and give the sampler one more try fortracks 2,3,7,8,10,11,16,17,18,and 18.

Hans Zimmer has crafted such an amazing collection of awe-inspiring beauty, to which I weep with joy every time I listen to it. If anyone can create music with a Christ-like conscious level, Zimmer has indeed done so with brilliant ease.The fusion of music from the rain forest combined with a contemporary format, while utilizing additional instruments, forms the complete essence of the PBS documentary.

However, being the romantic person that I am, I held a lot of hostility towards Dom as he decided to leave Anne on the night of their wedding and abandon her for four years. Their love throughout the story grows and the passion between them sparks and rises to put the romance back into the story. Overall it had a lot of romantic quality but, I would not say that it is among one of Brenda Joyce's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but....","review":"I wouldn't recommend it.

Being told that the characters fell in love, without seeing any reason why, does not work. The hero was awful. Why did the heroine fall in love with him?

Yes that's right he could sleep with and have children by an exmistress but he couldn't give his wife the same time, AH. Please do not read. Too much angst to bother.

Tom Laughlin is passable, at best, as an actor. His wife, Delores Taylor, to be charitable, has neither passable acting skills nor a charismatic appearance. You'll note that she hasn't starred in a lot of movies sans the Billy Jack series.3. There's a young blond haired woman who can't really sing but who sings throughout this nonetheless, a balding doctor character who's passable from an acting standpoint, and some good scenic shots. In fact, the best thing about this entire movie is the scenery.

The movie starts out long by tracking the trial of Billy Jack (hence the name)that does not resemble much of a real trial at all. It is only a format for Tom Laughlin to spot many of his esoteric views.The next chapter of the film is notoriously long as the character Jean (Taylor) continnues to recounts events from a hospital bed about the kids at the \\"school\\" and the local evil rich people. This movie is just too preachy and it never bothers to examine some of their (school) prejudges and uncivil behavior.The only redeeming value is that Tom Laughlin still brings out a \\"Billy Jack\\" persona. Tom is Billy jack, and is convincing in the role he was made for.

To best describe the quality, I would say it's like talking on a speakerphone even when speaking directly into the handset. There are odd fluctuations in the volume levels of what you can hear, there is static whenever you speak, there is eerily dead silence when the conversation pauses and there is a very faint echo of everything you say. People on the other end of the call also complain about the quality. Using a headset did nothing to improve the situation. This is all too bad because the design of separating the base from the handset is perfect for me. And the fact that using the phone doesn't disconnect my wireless internet connection as my 2.4GHz phone did is great. But I guess I am willing to put up with that to return to the excellent sound quality of my 2.4GHz Uniden telphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality and range.","review":"I agree with other reviews stating the poor sound quality, dependant on position/room location.

Thought maybe it was just this model so ventured off to Best Buy to try a new VTech model. It wouldn't communicate either. Returned both and have settled for a Uniden with base speaker phone.

This is not a true 5.8 GHz phone. The base transmits at 5.8 GHz, but the phones transmit at 2.4GHz.

Side-by-side with the AT&T 5830, only differences looks to be the handset/base unit configuration (with AT&T, handset sits in base unit). If you don't have room for the base unit or you want to wall-mount the base unit . . . the VTech 5820 is the perfect choice. Probably the best cordless phone I've owned thus far. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best pick","review":"I bought this phone set 5 months ago and have been very happy with it. I wanted a wireless phone set with high clarity sound, was expandable (one handset for the home office and one other for general use), had caller ID waiting and speaker capability on handsets as well as the base, and could handle the range (for use outside). I did not want an answering machine because I have a smart fax that serves that purpose already. This phone set has exceeded my needs. I like having the capability of unique phone lists for each phone, too (numbers for customers on my office handset and family/friends on my general use handset). I can walk all the way to my back fence and the person on the other line says I am crystal clear even on the speakerphone (they are clear as well - clean sound). It would be nice if the caller ID didn't stack up with same name callers (vs. depicting one entry with the number of times they called).

I have hidden the base station in the closet with the wireless router (it is sitting on top of the router and I plan on wall mounting it in the same general location) and I have had no network or phone issues from them stepping on each other.My other pet peeve is that the 5820 handset that this came with has a cool blue backlight and the other handsets I bought came with a (not so cool) green backlight.

I have a WiFi network, and wondered if that might be the problem. I returned the phone and bought a Vtech 5825 (available on Amazon via Circuit City), a less well known model that comes with two handsets but is not expandable beyond those two. The 5825 has the same technical specs as this model (same frequencies), but works vastly better when configured in exactly the same way.

For instance, if you want to know about Contituencies then you would look in the CON section (i.e. Constinuencies, Parliamentary). This book is as the name suggests a reference dictionary applicable to the late 1800's. Probably good to have if you are a Victorian writer or historian or just have an interest in the time period.

This book was given to me as a gift at Christmas and I felt the only polite thing to do was to (finally) read it. It's so bad I can't finish it.

The characters were very flat, one dimensional, and acted like complete idiots throughout the book. I didn't really feel there was any sort of mystery to solve.

In this tale, lottery winner turned amateur sleuth Alvirah Meehan is invited on a free cruise targeting \\"do gooders\\" as reward for their community service.

But it all goes wrong when the owner's nephew, intent on a big payday, brings on a couple of criminals hell bent on escaping prosecution...and when that happens, nothing goes as planned for anyone.

If you like Carol's books you should read this one. This is a light, easy read.One thing unbelieveable, although exciting, in the book is at the end when Alvirah jumps overboard (the ship was not moving) to get away from the bad guy who had captured her and tied her up.If you like shipboard mysteries you should also try Conrad Allen's books.

Two out of the six I purchased have now failed. What's worse is that the failure mechanism is not repairable. I took one apart to see what went wrong, after all it was not working anyway. I found that the socket that the bulb plugs into is so poorly designed, that eventually (a few months after installation) it will fail, even if you don't touch it - I mean the socket, not the bulb. This is poorly engineered garbage. Don't waste your money. If it was free, I wouldn't pay the shipping. As an aside, while they are working, the 20 watt xenon light is great for undercounter kitchen lighting, it's just the fixture - from American (made in China) Lighting - that blows.August, 2009 update: I was sent two extras as replacements so I now own 8 units. Only two are still working. Much credit to the engineers at American Lighting for creating such a reliable failure mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot change burned out bulbs","review":"DON'T BUY ANYTHING THIS COMPANY MANUFACTURES.

We finally just unplugged the stupid thing. The second fixture has been burning for two years with no problems. EVERY American Lighting product I have bought has been of AWFUL quality.

While it is true that the sound is not up to modern standard, that is not what one buys this set for. The Mitropoulos 9th has the worst sound, but it is an electrifying performance by a master conductor who would be dead within one month. Boehm's Strauss performances are invaluable given his close relationship to the composer, even if they are a bit too swift and objective for my taste. The Karajan Bruckner 8th is excellent, even if it is topped by at least one of his studio sets. I love Andante's documentation, and the sense of history that accompanies these performances. If you have a special interest in the Viennese orchestra style, or any of these conductors, you will love this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away for your own good...","review":"If you aren't ten years old, you're better off not watching this movie. The choreography is great, if you don't know how to recognize truly *good* choreography. The acting is literally painful to watch at times. I know they were low budget, but when you're hiring (mostly teenage) actors, I doubt it'd break the bank to pick ones that could actually act their way out of paper bag. Aside from the horrible acting, terrible dances/songs, the kids' attitudes stink! Other reviewers have mentioned this, and I agree whole-heartedly. Not only that, but their emotions don't fit the scenarios. I mean, it seems as if the \\"director\\" wanted to portray a fight scene somewhere in the movie, and just picked a random scene in which to put it. If I was thirteen, why would my friend fight me because my mom is making me move?TLDR; don't watch this movie unless you're ten years old and not bothered by plot holes, terrible acting/dialogue, and just all-around-bad movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning about this movie: Good Christian families should not buy or rent!","review":"Esther LINDSEY \\"esther_in_ohio\\" was very perceptive, and you should read her review carefully (even if we have different ideas about appropriateness of kissing).The movie is indeed full of spiritual problems.

Seriously, this is a very bad album. Practically none of the \\"superstars\\" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs. Not that they fare too well when they sing \\"serious\\" songs. Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders \\"Cara Mia\\" unintelligible.

Hilibilly Jim, JYD, \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage, Jimmy Hart, Mean Gene, George \\"the Animal\\" Steele, Vince McMahon, and even Jesse \\"the Body/Mind\\" Ventura grace the cover and also add their wonderful voices to the soundtrack.

I guess the glasses are the \\"old\\" style 3D, with red and blue lenses, but my kids (6 and 3) were really excited about it. As other reviewers have said, we love these movies because they can be enjoyed by kids and parents of all ages. They are not very scary, maybe just suspenseful and intense at some parts, and there is really nothing objectionable in them. The only thing that made me pause was in Spy kids 1 and 2 when Carmen says \\"you are so full of shi....take mushrooms\\". It really sounds like she's saying \\"full of sh**\\" until she says \\"ta-ke\\". Not the worst but don't want my kids saying that. Other than that, these are great movies. Yeah the 3rd one is cheesier than the first two and Sylvester Stallone is painful to watch but only for me, my kids absolutely love these movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly; Poor Sound Quality","review":"This item is EXTREMELY difficult to set and use.

This was given as a Christmas present in Dec 2001. One thing I do like, the progressive alarm that gets faster and more irritating the longer its on.Right away problems/annoyances appeared. The sleep volume isn't adjustable enough. To get the volume low enough to goto sleep while still being loud enough to wake you in the morning isn't possible. Sound is like listening to a can with cheap transistor radio speakers in it. Radio and the CD player quit working. The display is invisible when trying to look from a slight angle. The dimmer didn't go low enough. The backlight quit working too. My wife paid close to $100 for this thing at Sears. THe only part still working is the beeper alarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in the Timex Clock radio I bought and will probably return it. The main reason I chose this clock was for the built in CD, but the CD sounded terrible! Not because the sound quality was bad but because when the CD is spinning it makes a loud whiring sound - you can only drown it out if you turn the volume up really high. I also didn't like how bright the LCD window was. When it's sitting a foot from your face on the nightstand it can be very annoying. It does have the option to turn the brightness down, but then you can't see the time! I liked the styling and thought it was easy to program but I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just look at the picture","review":"Just check it out folks. There are a total of 21 buttons on this clock. That sure sounds a little complicated to me. It's supposed to be an alarm clock, not a space launch. I've had it for over a year now and still have to keep the instructions near by. And by the way... the \\"Indi-glo\\" face is more like \\"indi-blind. It very hard to read unless you are directly in front of it. It could have been a good idea. Instead it's like a clock designed by engineers on acid."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"It's not as good as it could be.The Bad:I agree with other posters who say the alarm limit is horrible, and the cd player hisses way too loudly, the hiss will actually wake me up before the music even starts, and it's impossible to lie in bed and relax with the cd player hissing right in my ear. The cd player also has plenty of problems reading \\"burned\\" cd's (CD-R's)The nature sounds are also really bad, you can hear an audible click or pop every few seconds when the loop ends on every sound.Speakers are horrible, I get better sound out of my older, much smaller tape player/alarm.The good:Large Indigo display, very nice.The ability to set the volume low for the \\"sleep\\" timer, and still have it be loud when the alarms go off.Having three seperate alarms is a nice feature.Overall, if I had to do it over again, I would definitely choose another system with the same features."},{"rating":"2","title":"New version out","review":"Apparently Timex licences it's clock radios out to another company called SDI Technologies. They have a new version of this alarm clock (as of 03/13/01) with the model number T601G. The biggest noticable change is the lcd color is now amber. Hopefully they address internal issues? You can also hear the Nature Sounds if you go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't bought it","review":"There are WAY too many buttons, and it's way too easy to screw the thing up accidentally and oversleep because you shut off the alarm without realizing it.

I bought this one for my kid and was very sorry. I ended up returning it. The reception was poor compared to the Aiwa and the only reason I tried the Timex was because it has a dimmer for the display. On its higher settings its like a beacon in the night, but to get it low enough so its not distracting when trying to sleep you have to turn it so low you can't read it!The control panel is mediocre at best and you will probably spend a lot of time fumbling to set it or turn it off in the morning. Steer clear and grab the aiwa if you like this type product (my decade old Panasonic still beats them both, alas without any tape or CD features!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed alarm clock","review":"I bought this alarm because I liked the idea of having so many features to choose from. Unfortunately, I did not notice how poorly designed the clock is until I received it. The snooze button is right beside the off button, so I have already overslept several times when I thought I hit snooze, but actually hit off. The indiglo display lights up my entire bedroom, so I have to pull the covers over my head to get to sleep, and when I wake up in the night and want to know what time it is, I have to put my face directly in front of the clock to see the numbers, as they are invisible from an angle. I do appreciate the options available on this clock, but I would recommend looking around some more if you think any of my complaints would bother you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete disappointment","review":"The unit I got was defective, the cd player clicked as it spun up, and it couldn't actually play a cd (skipping, going in and out). But the nature sounds as mentioned elsewhere are on about a 7 second loop, and they are disturbing, rather than relaxing. I didn't bother to exchange it for another for fear that the other cd would die 1 day after the warranty. It seems clear that the watch/clock company got bargain basement components for this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a lemon!","review":"I had a bad result with this - after setting it up (no small task) the CD didn't work.

Both have a very serious problem for anyone who hears well. Although the quality of the CD playback seems OK (this is not a stereo component folks), the motor in the player that spins the CD gives off an loud, high pitched and extremely irritating noise. It can even be heard through headphones. Listen too long and you will get a headache.I have checked a few that I have found on retailer's shelves and they all do the same thing. You're better off buying a clock radio and a portable CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product - Poorly thouht out","review":"This is a poor product, you cannot even use the cd player and buzzer together for waking up. The sound generally and the nature sounds in particualr are poor as well. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I recieved this as a gift, which is good because I would not have spent the money on this if I had known that it was difficult to operate and made a wicked hissing noise when CD's were played. I had gotten this radio/alarm clock/cd player for my office so that I could listen to music softly instead of blasting my real CD player louding three rooms away. As far as the radio function, that is pretty basic and simple. However, to play CD's, I continuously forget how this thing operates since it has multiple buttons on front (so many to press!) and once I get out the manual (again) it has a high pitched hissing noise that scares the cat. I rarely use the nature sounds. They are just 6 second bits repeated over and over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT LAST","review":"have had this item for about one year and kept it in very good condition -- no spills, no dropping -- yet the cd & radio alarms no longer work (cd only works if there is not cd in it). not reliable at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Player stopped working","review":"I agree with StevenJM's review. This product was defective within weeks of the purchase. The CD player just stopped working.Replaced it with the Magnavox which was much better (but had one big drawback, no battery backup). A recent spill has sent me looking for a new one. Probably going with the Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly incomprehsible controls","review":"Sure, the nature sounds are nice, but getting them (or anything else) to play is a patience-taxing, button-pushing nightmare. I have a degree in computer science, but it still took me ten minutes of kneeling in front of this damn thing before I could get it to do what I wanted. Too, too many poorly-thought-out and poorly-labelled buttons.Clock radios have been around for long enough that designers should know better by now: Pressing a button labelled \\"CD\\" should play the CD. Pressing a button labelled \\"Forest\\" should immediately result in forest sounds. Pressing a button labelled \\"Sleep\\" should immediately display a countdown timer...One last thing: All clock radios should have the option of sounding like an alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too complicated","review":"I recently tossed mine in the trash.I was soooo frustrated trying to set it, play a CD, or even getting the alarm to work. There was nothing intuitive. I did not use it for two years because of the nonsense, so hey, if its that bad, I did not even want to donate it to Goodwill.Maybe you will have better luck being a techie, but as a guy who just wanted to listen to CDs and have a wake up alarm, I now use my phone as the alarm and play CDs in my computer CD player with my Bose speakers for $50 on eBay.Also, for the price, the sound is tinny.I hope there is something better out there for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"On my Timex T600B the CD player would not work after about 12 months. The disc would start spinning and then just stop, and I did not use the CD that much during the time I had this product so was not real happy that it failed. I tried everything to get it to work - and it was not the seating of the disc I had in there. Also, I agree with other reviewers also that the nature sounds are noticeably repeating over a very short duration. I ended up just getting rid of this entire contraption. Initially I replaced it with an iHome clock radio where I could dock my iPhone, but that was rubbish as well. I got rid of both the iHome clock radio and the iPhone. I have now found the perfect solution to nature sounds (white noise makers) and replaced it with my android smartphone at night. My smartphone charges while I sleep and there are a few really good White Noise applications in the app markets that go light years above and beyond the nature sounds you hear on this clock radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many flaws","review":"I have owned this alarm clock for a couple of years now, and I regret to say, I am at long last in the market for something better. From day one, the clock would gain time, a couple of minutes per month. The cd player (which whined noisily when it started up) also stopped working long ago, and unfortunately, the cd player was the main selling point for me when I purchased this clock. The radio reception leaves a lot to be desired, depending on where I stand in the bedroom. My final complaint is that some (not all) of the functions are way too complicated to program without the manual, which disappeared a long time ago.Why 2 stars then? The one reason I have kept the clock far beyond its prime is that I love the nature sounds feature. I find now that I have difficulty falling asleep without the serene forest breeze whispering in my ears - I am a \\"soothing nature sounds\\" junkee. On another positive note, the alarm has been very dependable, aside from user error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undependable and too hard touse","review":"After putting up with this Timex radio for way too many months, I'm back searching for a better quality, more user-friendly clock radio. It looks great, but the quality isn't there. Poor reception. Volume control is particularly bad -- hard to find a mid-level sound output. It jumps from too low to too loud, which can be incredibly annoying when you need a dependable alarm. Sometimes the sound was too low to wake me up; other times, the sound would blare out and wake up the whole household.Worst problem is difficulty in setting the station pre-sets. After reading the insructions several times, the radio just proved unresponsive to my station settings. I'm extremely disappointed and would not recommend this radio to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"From the first day, the CD mechanisim was very noisy. Now it has stopped working altogether. I don't know how they did it, but Timex was also able to make the first digital clock that doesn't keep time accurately. Mate that with a couple speakers that buzz when the volume is turned up and this clock radio is a three time looser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great on paper, but doesn't deliver","review":"This clock sounded great. CD player, nature sounds, indiglo etc... But, frankly, it kinda [stinks]. The CD player is WAY too loud. It's ridiculous. You can't listen to a CD without hearing a hissing sound unless you crank it; this player wasn't made to be cranked, though. Also, the Indiglo feature is so bright that it kept me awake at night. I had to turn it down so low that it was illegible. Also, Timex made the numbers so hard to heard that you have to be at the right angle and proximity just to read it. Lastly, the nature sounds sound terribly fake. And....there is no buzzer....I do not recommend this product. Look elsewhere. It is feature-packed, but low quality. The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil is in the details","review":"This clock doesn't work well for me for a couple of rather specific reasons.First of all, as other have mentioned, the indiglo backlight is too bright at night, and if you turn it down, it becomes difficult to read. My wife's red-on-black alarm clock radio is much easier to read. Part of the reason for this is the fact that I wear glasses, and can't see clearly when I wake in the morning. So perhaps it is me-specific...The other problem I have is that the snooze timer goes off after an hour. So if I'm really tired and keep hitting snooze, after an hour...no more alarm. I've been late to work WAY too many times due to this feature.Overall, it's a fully-featured clock radio, but if you share my little problems, it won't work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex should stick to watches.","review":"The sound quality was really poor in my opinion. The Nature sounds were not realistic. Even worse, the sounds were all on a very short loop. The sound of the same Three Large waves crashing over & over again was anything but relaxing. Also there was an annoying clicking noise everytime a sound loop was repeated. (About every 7 seconds). I took it back the same day. Like they saying goes... You can't judge a book by its cover. Sorry Timex. Great watches though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The clock is inaccurate - One star is too high","review":"A clock radio has one primary function - to keep time. I have tried 2 of these clocks and both gained time. 15 minutes in a month is NOT acceptable accuracy.The clock has adequate sound at normal levels. I found the blue LCD to be okay unlike some other reviews.I do have to agree that this the controls on this clock radio are very difficult to use.This is one of the worst clock radios I have every encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"CD player never worked.

No wonder it only lasted one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound","review":"I bought this product. Took it home and pluged it in, the right speaker sounded distored when played with a CD and the radio. The nature sounds were great. I put on head phones when listening to a CD, it sounded great. Could never tune in the radio. Took it back to the store thinking it was defective because of the right speaker. Guess what, they were all that way. SO I bought the Philips AJ3940CD. I would NOT recommend ths timex product. Poor sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I got this because I wanted to reduce clutter in the bedroom by combining many functions into one -- nature sounds for blocking out traffic, radio and cd for listening at other times, alarm clock. It sounds great for such a small unit. The directions are well written, but because it has so many functions, it can be a bit complex to use. if you take the time to read the manual, though, it's not bad. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"great clock, bad sounds","review":"The radio itself is a great alarm clock, with the ability to set up to four different alarm times, one for each of waking to sounds, one for a buzzer alarm, and one to wake up to radio.The drawback to this device, however, is the sound. All of the sounds just sound like the white noise you could get by changing your radio to a frequency where there isn't a station. Those sounds that aren't white noise are so short that when they repeat, it's so close that it is just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Product","review":"This clock-radio has gadgets galore. The problem is that many of them are of disappointing quality. My biggest gripe is that the CD player mechanism makes an annoying hissing sound when playing. This makes it very difficult to enjoy a CD at low volume. My second beef is that the nature sounds are repetitive. They repeat themselves after an interval of about 15 seconds.If you want a good clock radio with a CD, there are better choices that this Timex product."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooh lala","review":"Super cute for francophiles who love cats!

The first song \\"Evil - A Chorus of Resistance\\" and \\"Ill\\" sound like it came off of the group \\"The Sisters of Mercy's\\" CD \\"Vision Thing\\". \\"Molotov\\" is classic \\"The Mission UK\\". \\"Normandy\\" gave me a feeling tht I was listening to \\"Fields of the Nephilim\\".There is enough classic P86 styled songs to keep hard core fans happy and it would be a good add to your collection.

Not too many are made in this style any more. These chairs looked like a decent match from the photos. It was hard to tell so we took a chance. When they arrived, they just seemed cheap and were also slightly damaged in shipping. Aside from the damage, the chairs were just not comparable to the chairs in the set. Our current set is not \\"high end\\" at all, but the chairs are lesser than what we already from a quality of build. Color was more red than the picture implies That said, these chairs were incredibly inexpensive and expectations were modest. Even so, we returned the chairs due to the damage. We might have even repaired or touched up the chips had we liked the chairs, but it didn't seem worth it. If your expecattions are very modest, and just need a couple chairs, go for it.

Logic was absent. As an example, in trying to demonstrate how unlikely evolution was, the author used the example of flipping a set of 10 coins, to calculate the probability that they would all come up heads. His answer was one in 10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = one in about 4 million. The real answer (pardon my arrogance) is 0.5^10 or about one in 1000.No wonder he thinks we didn't evolve.Read it, and marvel at the things people will believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it...","review":"I read this book and, in hindsight, I still am not sure why I bothered to finish it.

A female serial killer who is also a bestselling author witnesses the abandonment of an Alzheimer victim. She is being interviewed by a reporter who is the boyfriend of the victim's granddaughter. Oh, did I mention the winning lottery ticket? Nor is there any mystery, as the reader always knows who is guilty. There's a limited amount of suspense as to whether, how, and by whom the perp(s) will be brought to justice. And it's far from a typical \\"cozy\\".

The Necron in particular add a new twist to the game, as they seem to have a radically different tactical style from the other races. The Tau are probably the \\"coolest\\" race, yet, with their high energy weapons and battle suits. The new units for the old races don't seem all that new for the most part. A few more limitations on the ability to build large numbers of units have been put in place, as space marines can have only one unit of terminators and one whirlwind tank at a time, now, both of which changes I thought were unnecessary. I had a little trouble getting into the campaign game at first, but after a couple missions, it looks like it is at least as good as the campaign from Winter Assault.

First it's a strategy game with little actually strategy so the retarded squirrel in your yard could probably play it pretty well.

Unfortunately they have done a terrible job of making the races in this game feel anything like their tabletop counterparts, the tau being the biggest example of this...They've also managed to ruin a number of older features in this expansion.

Isn't that what pop music is all about? The album's number one track, \\"Turbulence\\" starts with heavy synthesizers and lyrics that Death Cab for Cutie wish they would have written.While the 36-minute album is incredible, highlights include track number three, \\"Out of Line,\\" and track number ten, \\"Chameleon Jukebox.\\" The album ends with \\"Smile and Wave,\\" a sweet instrumental farewell to the listener that clocks in at just over a minute long.If local music is your thing, I would advise you to check out and try Aubrey on for size."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!

The book is unusual because it comes from the male perspective, a viewpoint that Becker conveys in sometimes painful honesty. But This Mean Disease works on other levels of the human experience and will be of interest even to those who have been spared direct association with the mean disease. The author's strained relationship with his father, which begins with interactions that barely achieve superficiality then gradually deepen as they both come to terms with the illness and their feelings, will find a ready audience for fathers and sons who struggle to express deeper thoughts than predicting the latest pennant race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recounts the starvation disease's impact not just on his mother, but on his entire family","review":"This memoir of author Daniel Becker's mother, a survivor of anorexia nervosa, recounts the starvation disease's impact not just on his mother, but on his entire family.

It didn't work for me and so I returned it. I'm going to look for an AM radio that receives in the range of 5,000 to 25,000khz (shortwave).

Very cute, vivid pictures.There are a few MINOR problems I have with it.1 - It would be nice if there were more faces (enough to fill the pages)2 - I agree that the flaps are flimsy esp. in a toddler's hands3 - The \\"angry face\\" wasn't cut right and didn't fit into the spaces (frustrating for a little one). I had to shave away an edge with a knife so it would work.4 - Faces can get lost very easily if you're not careful.

Clearly a bootleg judging by the sound quality and the fact that Madacy is releasing it, it's uncertain to me why it's even on the market.First off, Gaye is not in top form here. Look elsewhere if you want a Gaye concert with Marvin at 100% and at his finest.Second, the sound quality is not great. I could make a better recording in my basement. And I'm absolutely serious. It's alright for a bootleg, but it's still not great.Overall, unless you are a die hard Gaye fan or a collector, just avoid this. There's nothing here that's standout. Just buy one of his standard compilations. You'll be much happier that way.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I should of done some research before ordering.

The actors are great, but not together. Somehow I kept imagining Sarah Jessica Parker as Carey Bradshaw, and in one particular scene where she contemplates her reasons for sleeping with a client, or rather client's adult son who refuses to move out, it brought back flashing memories of Sex and the City.

Totally mismatched with the male lead really. Some scenes were just draaaaging and way too long, e.g. the paintball match and the last part following the pair when they were shut in by their friends... how great was it to watch on a big screen looking like a reality show.

I do have to at least say that the nerdy roommate thing is so old and tired, it creaks, and the thing with the animals was totally unnecessary and irrelevant-- just something to keep the guys awake, I guess. What annoyed the heck out of me: Matthew McConnaghey's teeth are so preternaturally white that their blinding chalkiness distracted me every time he opened his mouth. I can't understand why everyone interviewed in the special features kept talking about him as if he is the most irrefutably gorgeous thing they've ever laid eyes on, when he's about as truly humanly sexy as a Ken doll.

This is the second flop that has Matthew McConaughey as the leading man (the first one being \\"The Wedding Planner\\"), although he is still very good to look at. Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates, which is always a sure thing, has no place in this film. The rest of the actors are less than memorable. The premise is good (single guy loafing off his parents = parents hiring gal to get him out of the house, etc) but the delivery is awful. This movie tries to be funny and poignant (and the first 15 minutes are passable), but from then on it is totally moronic (oh and wait to you see the ending!!!!).

And when he does, the parents can enjoy or dread their new found freedom.What impresses me are the cameo appearances of a squirrel, a mocking bird, a lizard and lastly, the dolphins. The irony that those adorable sweet creatures can give one the shock in a lifetime is hillariously presented here. Zooey Deschanel as Kit is also a delightful and refreshing choice as a cool, slightly eccentric pal.

I'm not a huge SJP fan and thought she looked old in a few scenes, but I enjoyed her roomate's quirky humor; thought some of the scenes in nature were silly/funny and really liked the characters that Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw played.

The film is cliché at best and while both actors give a good performance it's a has been there done that type of movie with an all too familiar plot and character assignment.With Parker playing the carrot to get McConaughey to move out of his parent's house, it actually reminded me of the complaints I often hear in relationships. When will he get on his own two feet? Why does she still live with her parents? While it would seem this commonality would make this movie a sure fire hit because most people can relate to it, this movie misses the mark with little or no chemistry amongst the performers. This is a must miss movie that definitely fails to launch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly cutesy predictable comedy","review":"\\"Failure to Launch\\" a mindless comedy featuring Matthew McConaughey as Tripp a 35 year old bachelor that still lives at home with his parents, suffers from a failure to entertain. His parents hire Sarah Jessica Parker playing professional interventionist Paula to seduce McConaughey into a relationship to get him out of the house. Terry Bradshaw is surprisingly funny as the father Al. Kathy Bates' superior acting talent is wasted in her role as enabling mom, Sue.As expected Parker falls in love with McConaughey and problems ensue. Yeeeesh! Had I not been a captive on a trans Atlantic flight, there is no chance that I would have chosen to see this moronic flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to Entertain","review":"This is one of those movies that you watch and then, within a few days, you forget about.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, a \\"launcher\\" or something.

Sound stupid enough for you already?Paula is hired by the parents of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) and the story is about how, during the course of her employment, she falls in love with him, and he with her. There are a very few laughs along the way.Some might call this a \\"chick flick\\" but my wife (who is a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and \\"Sex and the City\\") didn't like it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, Unforgettable Torture","review":"I give this film an extra star because it has one decent scene between Tripp (McConaughey) and his mother (Kathy Bates), where Mom says Tripp served as a buffer between her and his father (Terry Bradshaw), and now she's concerned that his father won't like her if Tripp leaves.It was the only genuine moment in an incredibly plastic picture.There are some funny moments, like when Tripp's father calls Sarah Jessica Parker a tramp, and offers to take Tripp out in the woods and shoot him to save some money. The scene with the Star Wars nerd and Parker on a paid date is entertaining: she plays Darth Vader's march on a kazoo, and he gets all overexcited. Then she ditches him. Zooey Deschanel plays Parkers' kooky roommate (sister?) Kit, and has the right stuff with Tripp's friend Ace (Justin Bartha) in a funny scene where they almost kill a mockingbird. The Daily Show's Rob Corddrey shows up to explain why the joke is funny to anyone still enjoying the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I am an English Literature Educator and I decided to concentrate on some new reading strategies for this upcoming school year. After reading the wonderful reviews, I felt like I could do no wrong in purchasing this book. Guess what? I was wrong. These mini-lessons are not practical and are not really geared to help reading comprehension in the least. I admire the author's knowledge of reading as a study, but now have a book that will sit on my shelf for the rest of my career. I wish I could see what others found to be so special about it. Perhaps I am just too much of a realist and I know that this is not something that will work in my class. If I find it boring-- I can't imagine what my middle grade students will think.

Oh how wrong were we. As soon as I pulled it out of the box and looked at the directions I knew we were going to have problems. The two main pieces of this island, which provide support for the tunnel and ramp, do not hook together in any way. They rest next to each other and the orange ramp and blue tunnel snap together on top of them. So any time your child attempts to roll Thomas down the ramp or bring him up the blue tunnel piece, the base comes apart. It's not so durable. I'm open to the super glue idea, but I don't even see where you would super glue the island together. My son who can play alone with a Thomas train for hours played with this island for about 5 minutes then abandoned the island and set off to play with just the little Thomas train that came with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't stay together!","review":"We were very excited to find a new Thomas toy that we did not already have. And it's a bathtub toy. Sounded great. All of you with sons that love this adorable train know what it's like to have about everything thomas and to find something different. Well, this toy won't stay together. The pieces do not articulate well. So, when we go to roll the train, the whole thing falls apart and we spend another 3 minutes putting it back together. :( And do not expect to use it in the tub. It's so bulky. It does float. But since the pieces don't exactly fit together well, it tends to topple over if floating when you go to roll the train. Bit disappointing overall. Our finale with this toy was when the elevator part broke (and we only had it three days...not played with hard by any means since we spent most of our time putting the pieces back together).As a side note, the train that comes with it is cute and works well in the tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"This toy comes in several pieces that snap together but after about two minutes in the bathtub, the parts have disconnected and are floating in the tub.

The elevator doesn't work well and doesn't tip the train out. But despite all this, my 2 yr old still enjoys it. (At least as long as I'm willing to repeatedly fix it for him.) If it was full price, it would have been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy does fall apart ALL the time.","review":"I agree w/ everyone else!

What a disappointment!The story hit most points from the Alice story, yet with none of the charm, wit, adventure or madness of the original. The art also disappoints. Alice looks like a rip-off of Penny from the Inspector Gadget cartoons. The artist doesn't show the faces of the Duchess or the Red Queen in what seems to be either laziness or inability, and not some artistic affectation. For some inexplicable reason the Mad Hatter is a cartoon-version of Jay Leno complete with a huge chin and a goofy grin. Though it is a re-telling of an existing story, I expected originality and got none. This doesn't even rise to the level of mediocrity.Despite my unreasonable need to acquire all things Alice, future volumes of Rod Espinosa's series will not be on my list.

Even if I wouldn't get my full refund (shipping charges not refundable if it was my mistake), it was worth it to get the little money I could for it. The art work was very unimpressive and the story, was the same story, but somehow seemed boring! There's even an intro where Rod Espinosa himself explains how he ripped off the idea of doing a manga on a classic from someone else...it's already really hard to make your own work sound interesting, I guess it's even harder when you're telling everyone that this wasn't even your idea to begin with.

Based on this experience, I doubt that I'll be back for more. While some reviewers here contend that this books concentrates more on the crucial aspects of Spec Ops planning than actual firefights, I found more tedious descriptions of dinner party menus, polo matches and honeymoon arrangements than discussions of tactical/operational issues. And how many Special Forces operators on assignment are billeted in luxury suites, attended by personal servants with their wives and children vacationing by the pool?Clue: When the number of champaign bottles emptied exceeds the number of rounds spent, you're closer to a Danielle Steele romance novel than Stephen Ambrose."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remembered the characters, vaugely","review":"Once again WEB Griffin has written a book I stayed up until 3 AM to finish.

I had only vague memories of those characters, but Mr. Griffin does a good job of prompting. (The Lieutenants -> The Green Berets)I don't need reviews to know that I will love a Griffin book, but read the other series 1st.

The last pages of the book were almost exclusively \\"block orders\\" that Griffith used sparingly and effectively in previous novels.

Characters were poorly developed: some major characters of past novels played only cameo roles and could heve been eliminated. Dull!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully the series ends here....","review":"I think what I found most annoying about this book was the beginning where large chunks of the previous two novels (The New Breed & The Aviators) were either torn intact or badly rewritten and stuffed into this novel to flesh it out. Granted it's been a long time since a Brotherhood of War novel has been released and it's ok to remind the reader of what has come to pass, but this was nearly insulting and if you've read either of the previous novels recently it's just downright boring to read them AGAIN here.Mr. Griffin, if you must write another BoW novel, lets hear the story of Craig Lowell's adventures in Vietnam, they're hinted at in several places and sound exciting. Anything would be better than Special Ops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will fall off the door","review":"The hanger valet works very well for jackets. I have had this item for over 5 years.

We got hooked on Marco Antonio while vacationing in Costa Rico. A friend advised me to listen to him while I was trying to learn to speak Spanish because his articulation is perfect and he speaks slowly enough to pick up the lyrics. His style is now mostly love ballads and his albums are popular as romantic mood-setting background music. He is so nice to listen to even if you do not understand a word!

You will recognize the symptoms and patterns he points out in society as a whole, in your family, your friends, and (painfully) even yourself. He's so brutally pessimistic in tone he doesn't leave much hope. However, looking at things with eyes wide open, as they are, is the first step toward recognizing these obtacles and pitfalls within ourselves (in my opinion) ... and thats our best chance of taking responsibility for it and changing it.

Three hours of screwing around with them, repairing them repeatedly (the diagonal cable) and finally I was able to make it up my modest incline of a driveway. This all occurred in about 6\\" of snow on a dirt road and drive. The next day I was able to get out (amazingly the cables stayed on for the 1/4 mile drive to pavement) and I immediately went to the local parts house and bought old fashioned ladder style chains. The cable style might work for some, but they were terrible for me.

The set that I received had a sticker that listed dozens of tires from 15-17 inch including floatation tires. This did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the fit. Sure enough, they are not the right size for my tires. The tensioner can not even take the slack out enough to clear the brake drum because of too much chain. These were obviously for a higher and/or wider tire, not the size listed when ordered. I'd return them, but since I didn't try them right away, the original packaging is long gone.

Well, the chains will not fit. I contacted customer service and received no help. I did get an explanation about how tire manufacturers are allowed 4% variance to the tires and my tires just must be in the variance. Sorry, too bad.

My low rating is due to the fact that one of the cables is about to break (about 2 or 3 strands of the cable are holding it together, but it's not safe to use).

I was not able to climb the hill at all. I removed the chains and was immediately able to crawl up the hill with nothing but my all-season tires. These may work on flat surfaces, but i did not notice any increased traction for climbing - in fact they made things much worse. I think I'll go back to good old fashioned diamond-pattern chains.I do have to admit that these are extremely easy to put on. It only took me about 2 minutes per tire, and they give a nice tight fit.

This book is very straightforward and a rare find. It explains human interaction on a very basic and fundamental level. It leaves God, blame, guilt and what you \\"should\\" do to fix your life out of it. This book explains WHY in the end YOU make the decision for how you want to feel about yourself.

But he vibed well with the people. The venue contained some small children so he couldn't go all out as far as explicit lyrics is concerned, which was a good thing. I think the \\"undisputed truth\\" was slightly better than this C.D. However (4) Prince charming, (7) Blah blah, (10) Forrest Whitiker, (13) When the beat comes in, (?)Dorian, and the last two were pretty sharp. My favorite might be the \\"prelude\\" so reminiscint of the late J.B. don't know who it is but I listen to it over & over again. The baddest unknown and underated M.C. around.

Ali is obviously the #2 man at Rhymesayers. This CD is a success because Ali is a great rhymer and Ant really shines in the production dept. I would have to say this is one of the best produced records I have ever heard. Everything comes together.

The album winds into Dorian, perhaps the most powerful song this young man has ever heard. A neighbor is beating his daughter, Ali confronts him, the result is pure art. Yet all these flows are companioned with jazzed out Atmosphere producer Ant. The beats resemble those of Dj Hi-tek, quite an accomplishment.

However, it lacks substance, and the so called quick scheme does very little for the tarot student. It approximates, and does not really fully cover the meanings behind tarot cards, which are full of nuances and complexities. In order to fully understand the Tarot, one must really study it in its entirety, not use little cheat tricks to be fully illuminated. Its pretty much like trying to learn Algebra without first knowing how to multiply. This cannot be done, just as learning Abraham's system of Tarot reading is not going to make you efficient at understanding the cards. I say scheme, because it seems that's what these books are, geared toward the quick buck, quick explanation, and quick nothings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was pleased with this purchase at first...","review":"I bought this after reviewing a number of books like it and reading the reviews.At first it seemed like a great book. After awhile, the keywords seemed to be too narrow for the true meaning of each card. For me, it took the life out of the readings - paring it down into a flat, mechanical routine.I recently picked up a copy of Tarot Plain and Simple - and I love it! In all fairness, it could be that I was using the wrong deck to begin with. After thumbing through the Robin Wood deck (illustrated in TPS) I found the symbolism much easier to interpret and the meanings seemed to jump out at me.I no longer use this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent beginner to intermediate book.","review":"I began Tarot study/reading about a year ago, after becoming open minded to other spritural and self-help resourses, and refusing to prejudge the Tarot as \\"the devils playing cards\\" before finding out more about them first. This book really helped to open my eyes about Tarot, and has helped with learning and remembering card meanings. The author Sylvia Abraham has many years of experience in readings, and her book can be an excellent beginner's tool to understanding the cards. Illustrations of the Rider Waite deck are featured, but the text information can be used with most other decks(marseilles,renaissance,etc.). A great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read this book because it was so highly recommended by so many people, but I found the actual product unsatisfying. It's got a great premise and could have been heart-wrenching and exciting, but it just ended up dumb, in my opinion. The main characters were just irritating. I found Sarah a totally unrealistic heroine, and when she finally ended up offering to be the guy's mistress, after all the jabbering on and on about her reputation, I thought, \\"You are just an idiot.\\" The hero was fairly unsympathetic. The book could have said more about his mother and his relationship with her, and showed you more a glimpse of his heart, instead of going on and on about dragons. I felt totally uninvested in this story, and it's a shame because it could have been such a good one. The scene in which they finally \\"made love\\" was as stupid as any I've ever read in a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and poorly edited - a waste of time!","review":"Read the author's first chapter and you get the sense that he has a vendetta against Richard Hatch. The rest of the book supports that suspicion. This book is nothing more than a feeble attempt to cash in on the popularity of Survivor. And worst of all, it contains errors of fact, typos, and is poorly edited. For a so-called \\"investigative journalist\\", Lance has written a pretty lame book. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment!","review":"I love Survivor. But the books about Survivor on the market are not very good including this book. The author endlessly discusses his failed book deal with Richard. Then he endlessly discusses his failed deal to use Stacey's pictures in the book. All the way, he treats us to emails to and from Richard and Stacey. I found the book to be a hatchet job on producer Mark Burnett, Richard, Stacey, and Dirk. I guess an \\"investigative reporter\\" has to dish the dirt, but it makes for a sad read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written; editing nonexistent","review":"It is hard to judge the merits of a book in which typographical errors abound on each page. Worse, the author doesn't know the difference between \\"elude\\" and \\"allude\\", nor \\"effect\\" and \\"affect.\\" His punctuation is bizarre. Sentence fragments abound.Clearly, this book was rushed to press to capitalize on Survivor's current popularity.If you are looking for new information on Survivor, or facts and the life history of Richard Hatch, look elsewhere. Throughout the book, the author repeatedly says \\"more on that later\\" or \\"we'll get to that soon\\" -- yet never does.I'm glad I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't pay my own cold hard cash for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style - 1, Content - 3","review":"This would have been a mildly interesting book, but two things spoiled it for me: 1) careless editing (typos, grammar, errors of fact - getting Sue's last name wrong in one spot was the most glaring), and 2) tabloid-esque teasers and hyperbole (\\"wait-till-you-hear-what-shocking-thing-I'm-about-to-tell-you!\\")It's hard to believe that Lance could have won a journalism prize if this is how he usually writes. The same material, had it been written in a more straight-forward and less hysterical manner, would have made for a much thinner, but more readable account of the behind-the-scenes insider dirt that I expected.As it is, the book appears to be an amateur production. I wasn't impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD,BUT NOT OUT OF DATE","review":"For all of you who atre wondering whether or not to buy this book,buy it!

Ms. Fortune also happens to be trained in the Western Christian tradition, which is at varience with contemporary pagan beliefs. This is a classic work, and the anecdotes are great, but if you want more up-to-date methods, I'd recommend either \\"Psychic Self-Defense\\" by Robert Bruce, or \\"Arcane Lore\\" by Scribe 27."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good beginning","review":"This author does a good job of describing the damage that may be done to suggestible individuals - affirming that an interest in the occult may leave one open to negative influences. The many Christian based practices bothered me because they were intermingled with occult practices (Golden Dawn). I stubbornly hold the concept true Christians shouldn't be dabbling in the occult and true pagans shouldn't be invoking Christianity as alternative defense when troubled by domineering personalities or unscrupulous practitioners of magic. This book seems a little old fashioned today perhaps but is still a very good beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and bad for n00bs","review":"This book is so often the first one handed to a neophyte or seeker. This is a problem, because if you read it as some one brand new to the idea of the occult, you will think every headache, every moment of doubt, and that time when you were drunk you fell over a lot, was a psychic attack.I personally don't mind the book as a historical document. But given the neopagan and occult community is rife with drama queens who will shout \\"are you threatening me with magic\\" if you accidentally leave a bone from KFC on your plate pointed at them, it does more harm than good. Again for those not particularly versed in levels of threat, response, or sad to say this, REALITY.Read it with an open mind, but understand it comes from another age, and another mind set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WEALTH OF INFORMATION","review":"Here we have a book first published in 1930, that challenged the norm. I am one of those that believe Psychic Attack is prelavent in today's society with so much jealousy and competition around. Although it is a little hard to read, the information contained is well worth the extra effort to study. The author also documents her own personal encounters and also provides some means of relief for those in need of psychic self defense. I have applied the advice and techniques for myself and it does make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it","review":"Compared to other books, I found this one to be the least informative.

The information is still very much valid today. Ms. Fortune has some ignorant views concerning eastern religions, wicca and some ethnic groups of people, however if you can look past her early 1900 attitudes you will gain excellent information regarding the nature of psychic attacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychic Self-Defense","review":"This is a book I have been told to get for years.

There are many other books on the subject out there which are much simpler to follow and offer a good introduction to the novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, biased, and stereotyped","review":"Since the book was written in 1930, I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the stereotypes and inaccurate statements. Her views and statements about witches, psychic vampires, and magic come from a detached viewpoint, not from someone with an understanding of this phenonmenon. I put it down after the first few chapters, when I found a third series of stereotypical statements with no basis in fact.

Through her exposition on working methods of attack, Dion intends that the reader will be able to construct an imaginative defense, dependent on the nature of attack. To this end, she, wisely, devotes much of the volume to discerning the varying instances and motives of psychic disturbance, including those of vampirism, haunting, astral projection, and use of ceremonial magic. Ending chapters are devoted to specific applications of defense, including the use of the quabalistic cross. The author's focus on psychic actions related to magical work makes the book an excellent introduction to occult practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"Lets say you are sleeping on the train tracks and the train is comming. This book would not teach you how to move. It will tell you what the author thinks of the colour of trains, how rude the conductors can be and other things that might be of entertaining value during afternoon tea with a friend. But not so useful in your current situation. Get a book that says: \\"Do not sleep on the tracks, but beside them if you must. If you sense vibrations and hear a loud honking, get up fast and move to the side of the track. Trains are good if you do not sleep in front of them\\".

I have no idea if they are \\"carbon\\" unless China is another word for carbon. They are, however, flexible, so I think they may last longer than the cheap Walmart glasses.I just don't like getting something that doesn't look like the picture. No brand name. No carbon.

I thought that was a horrible way to toast bagels anyway (though I think thats how its done with most toasters). It makes it not very crisp, and as you can imagine, makes disgusting regular toast that falls apart when you attempt to butter it. Also, it doesn't toast as much as completely dry out the piece of bread making it like a cracker. The booster feature thats supposed to raise your toast out of the slots enough to grab is is a joke.

Of course even that wouldn't work since you often need to press the lever several times to get the toast done even on the darkest setting.This is true for all three of these we have at work, so I know we didn't just get a clunker.There are also other problems. The toast lift feature does not lift the toast high enough. the toasting is uneven.I hate this toaster and you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so slow!","review":"This toaster is terribly slow and has no power.

Natasha Lyonne has all the spunky tomboy qualities you would expect in a young woman growing up in a household (so to speak) with all males. Marisa Tomei is hilarious as her strung-out cousin. I don't believe that the youngest boy had a crush on the older, as a previous review said. He just looked up to him. Their nomadic lifestyle makes them quirky. The funniest scenes are the infamous vibrator one and the one with Uncle Mickey. It's a coming of age story mixed with wit and sexual experimentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheres my DVD I paid for?","review":"Since I ordered this on 9 April and haven't received it yet it's hard to tell what I think!

To the rest of us, the only thing learned is that precious money and time have been wasted in buying and viewing this film. Sure, the ultimate lesson, I think, is that family is the most important commodity of life, But I didn't need a bad film to teach me that lesson. \\"So what's this movie really about?\\" I ask rehetorically. It's about a nomadic family, a divorced father with no prospects raising three kids in the \\"slums of Beverly Hills\\" while he sponges money off of his rich loder brother, and a teenaged girl with mature-for-her-age breasts gaining consciousness of life's true meaning. Alan Arkin's performance is completely forgettable. Marissa Tomei, a star in her own right, is only tangentially involved in the film (although her breasts play a limited role, as well.) All in all, what is the point of this film? To avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nomads of Beverly Hills","review":"Movies that involve unemployment, divorce, incest, drug abuse, and, worst of all, coming-of-age plotlines, tend to strike me as a recipe for a depressing cinematic disaster. This movie, though, is hilarious and invigorating. Every one of the people in this film has the potential to be really obnoxious, and they end up very human.All of the performances are terrific, and the character's problems are compelling. Kevin Corrigan, standing around in his Manson t-shirt, is hilarious. Most of their characters end up with some sort of dignity in the end, and that's what matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"All in all, an ugly little movie","review":"This movie has a top-notch cast. Natasha Lyonne is absolutely wonderful as the big-breasted teenager. It's very hard to like any of the characters, though, and most of them are downright obnoxious. This is certainly not a date movie.Most of the little stories aren't very believable, so it's hard to take this movie seriously as a drama and it's definitely not funny. All in all, an ugly little movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly pointless","review":"Mostly a waste of time, with some amusing moments, especially when Tomei and Lyonne dance with a vibrator.

Wait to buy it untill it only cost 5-10 $"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"There are talented actors wasted here on a lame script. Lame because it has nothing to say and even less to make one laugh. Sure there are laughs to be had, but for the most part it's just plain, poor taste masquerading as something in your face clever. If attendance is anything to judge by theatergoers gave this one a miss. It opened in August 1988, at 540 theatres and grossed so far $5m (so there won't be a sequel!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"I was really disappointed!!! This movie should have gone somewhere with the top notch actors it has. Anyone who rated this with more than one stars has a VERY different sense of humor OR is just being very generous. I'm sorry but I have trouble laughing at unmarried unemployed pregnant 29 year old female druggies, pot dealers, potheads, and masterbation. Dancing with the vibrator was the only humerous spot. I suppose someone had to make a movie to let us know there are two sides to Beverly Hills."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pointless Ride to Nowhere","review":"Not much to say, except I'm glad I caught this on cable instead of renting it. The only good thing about this movie is Alan Arkin who steals every scene he is in, he continues to be one of the most overlooked actors of all time. The film just has a dirty, creepy feel to it and really accomplishes nothing in it's two hours except for the contempt you feel for having wasted 2 perfectly good hours on this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"I've seen this movie three times. It's a very funny slice of life comedy. Good writing and acting.

Not pretty life, not life as portrayed in movies but REAL(TM) Life! If you've read the other reviews, I won't bore you with the details. However, do not expect this movie to be a comedy like Animal House. The funny moments there are to relieve the tension of this semi-documentary comedy. Regardless of your take and preferences, you cannot but root for the characters in their struggle with daily life and growing up. It's not an \\"entertaining\\" movie, it's more cerebral. If you don't like to think, don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"i love this product and how it came on time and shipped perfectly. i suggest you get this product. its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, hilarious, and very sad","review":"This is the best kind of indie film. THe characters are realistic and vivid, way outside of the junky stereotypes that come out of hollywood.The family is a complete mess, barely managing to avoid homelessness. THe father runs a restaurant, but can't handle money. He struggles to provide for his many children, who are adolescents in a dangerous phase of rebelliousness and increasing awareness. Arkin is painfully believable, warm, sympathetic and submits to the insults of his successful older brother who subsidizes him. You also empathize with the kids, particularly the smart, sensitive oldest daughter who is discovering her sexuality and recognizing the meaning of love, but also getting involved in petty crime with her drig dealer boyfriend. Tomei, the wayward cousin, is hilariously subtle and pathetic, avoiding her strident father and willingly participating in her uncle's scam.REcommended with enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"This is kind of a strange coming of age story. There's no real point to it, not much of a storyline. Just day to day scenes in the life of the main character. Natasha Lyonne is a pretty good actress, she was interesting to watch. But I didn't find the movie that amusing. Alot more could have been done to make the film funny and to connect with the audience. This film was a bit of a miss.There is a very brief cameo with Mena Suvari as a neighborhood girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slums of silliness.","review":"Slums of Beverly Hills had all the potential to be a great indie flick but to my chargin, I couldn't relate or tolerate any of the characters. Natasha Lyonne is an unique actress but even her talent can't save this uneven and boring film. Alan Arkin and Marisa Tomei also try to make this dud into something great but after awhile you can't stand how their characters are so inane and pathetic. Slums... is a critics darling and I can't figure out why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"...And it had so much potential...","review":"I read the reviews and saw that several people absolutely loved this movie.

I have seen this egg and though it is unusual in its lack of jewels, its simplicity deserves mention. I believe that there is one, maybe two more omitted, but as I am writing this, I am unable to bring those to mind.

They don't cut near as fast a waterstone (or shaptons) but they last longer (pretty much won't wear out).Pros:Low maintenance (no flattening)Durability (long lasting)Can get a great edge with just three stonesCons:Must clean them well (using water while sharpening helps)Fragile (don't drop one they will break)Does not cut fastI'd recommend them for edges that don't need large amount of work.

I would add that most songs in this series are solid stand-alone solos, and also feature beautifully scored teacher duets, which afford the students weekly opportunities to make live music with another musician!! The teacher duets are in the tradition of the classics (often based on specific and named classical pieces), jazz, and eclectic accompaniment styles, so the student's musical taste is further developed. Slam dunk!One more note about duets: teachers, our part is a tad more complicated than the accompaniments, say, in the same level of Faber.

This collection only contains Japanese audio with English subtitles.I made the mistake of purchasing the 3 individual DVD's and then also buying the collection thinking that it has additional audio tracks, but IT DOES NOT. They are both exactly the same.With that out of the way, this is an amazing price on a fairly good anime, so you should buy it right now. Just know what to expect before you order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful is too kind","review":"Now, I'm not one to knock shows with fan-service, I own all of DearS after all.

There are No illustrations whatsoever! In small print in the 2nd page of the book says you can go to a website for the illustrations. They should tell you this before you order.

A classic case of \\"good things come in small packages.\\" The book is written in a very down-to-earth style, using plain language, so the author is easy to relate to...almost as if one of your friends was just conversing about taijiquan with you. There's nothing really profound or new here, but for some reason the way Scott Rodell explains it, it makes a lot more sense. As other reviewers say, I'll likely go back and read this over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Magneto \\"Siempre\\"","review":"I loved this CD.

The author really knows how to paint the picture for new traders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Basic","review":"Although this book contains an overview of the new product, it is pretty basic for intermediate to advanced traders and investors. Basically, I think the book was released too soon before many of the rules and regulations were finalized concerning the product (the book even states this in the preface), so as a result it only paints half the picture. I was surprised that there were only about 70 out of 250 or so pages in total having to do with single stock futures, the rest of the book covered fairly basic technical analysis. It is more like a technical analysis book with a little info on single stock futures. I am going to go with one of the books being released later in the year as I feel they may have more info on the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much content","review":"I was interested in learning more about single stock futures for trading and hedging my portfolio, but found that this book did not have much content overall since it was published before the product began trading. There is a good review of basic futures trading but the info on single stock futures is limited and I am going to look to read more about the topic in other texts. This book offers mostly basic overview of the new product and not detail on how to use it to protect portfolios or apply to trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single Stock Futures","review":"Don't bother buying this book. It is so general and vague it's not worth the money. It rehashes tech analysis etc., that most would already know. It sheds no light into the world of SSF at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"This book is so out of date it is a joke. There is really nothing about single stock futures here. What is here is basic technical analysis. The book should never have been called Single Stock Futures. It should have be titled Basic technical analysis. It is a good buy for $1 more than that is a waste. It is heavy enough to use as a paper weight and that is the best use you can get out of it. Anyone that disagrees is related to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book geared toward novice traders","review":"This book was obviously written for the novice trader. There doesn't appear to be anything in the book that one couldn't read in the NFA's publication, \\"Security Futures: An Introduction to Their Uses and Risks\\", which is available free of charge.With no clear date as to when Single Stock Futures will start trading, the shelf life of this book will be limited, especially given the current state of the stock market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp satisfaction","review":"read the reviews, did the research, took a chance and purchased through amazon and their affiliates.

The color, brightness, viewing angle, etc., are all terrific. That said, there are a couple of things I found annoying and perplexing...1. When mounted on the wall, the power, inputs, and outputs are all unreachable. If you need to add or change a cable, it means pulling the TV of of the wall. It would have been much better if all of the connections were placed along the side or bottom, so that they were accessible while the unit was on the wall.2. The mount points for the wall mount are too close together. This leads to the TV feeling wobbly when mounted on the wall. I guess it's secure, but the amount of play doesn't instill much confidence.All-in-all, I'm very happy with the TV. It's just a shame Sharp didn't put a little more thought into the physical design of the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of box - lousy customer service","review":"Bought the tv as a Circuit City close-out. Was defective when I brought it home. I assumed Sharp would replace it with new since it is 2 days old. They are insisting on a repair after a week wait. I had to call twice to get that info.

However they are pretty spending, especially when you need to just buy some mailers and nothing else as the shipping is pretty steep (though i get it the next day). I went looking for an alternative and these have turned out to be great. They are almost as thick and the adhesive on the lip is great. Here are the differences: 1/4 inch smaller width than ULINE - They are grey instead of white - they do not have the matte square areas on the front for writing on. BUT - these are 1/2 the price and are working great for me. I don't have any worries about them coming open or ripping while I am putting my products in them or ripping while in transit.

The sound quality is atrocious (sounds like it was recorded in Murray's laundry room)! The song selection is horrendous! The last song on the CD (#11) is some jibberish called \\"Railroad Bill\\" where Ms. Murray is nowhere to be heard. The whole mess is an embarrassment to someone who has recorded some really wonderful music. Buy one of her Capitol albums instead (\\"Somebody's Waiting\\"), or something by Helen Reddy. (If you're stuck with this, use it as a coaster)!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Reap the Whirlwind is an excellent collaboration by Lackey and Cherryh. Cherryh's work is obvious in the plot and setting; every scene fits yet the book isn't predictable or flawed by excess drama. Lackey's influence on the characters is equally obvious; they're warmer and better developed than Cherryh's usually are. Collaborations are often worse than either author produces alone, but as a fan of both Lackey and Cherryh I'm happy to say that this one works."},{"rating":"1","title":"premise interesting, but book doesnt follow through","review":"If you are looking for the detailed world building and the finely crafted characters of a good Cherryh book, this unfortunately is not the book. It takes an interesting premise and bogs down into a series of boring committee meetings. Potential conflicts are either ignored, or come to too easy of a resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackey wrote it, not Cherryh.","review":"Mercedes Lackey actually wrote the text of this book, not CJ Cherryh. If you are a Cherryh fan, you will probably not like it.

Weaving across the album's eleven tracks, the songs seem to tell the story of desperate characters trapped in some pre-apocalyptic fantasy world. The music, propelled by a flexible rhythm section and Gang of Four-meets-Jawbox guitars, is up to the task of giving these stories grit and muscle.Favorite Tracks: Drunk under the Electrics, Bottom of this Town, Ministry of Helicopters.This is the record that will be playing when someone pushes the big red button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"I'm always open to new bands, or new sounds. I got this CD free in some radio giveaway at Michigan State University. I listened to it all the way through, and didn't enjoy any of it. The vocals are not good, the guitar seems to be way to far off rhythym to even be called experimental or post-hardcore, and there are no songs that even stick out in my mind. If you get the CD free like I did, cool, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"Mediocre in every way - content, organization, and currency.

In this age of high tech, there is one constant -- people. If you do not understand and know how to deal with people, all the high tech will not help. This book is a breath of fresh air for people like myself, who are tired of dealing with companies by voice mail and endless menus to make selections that only lead you further and further away from a real person. \\"You Can't Go Wrong By Doing It Right\\" is about real people, real situations and the kind of genuiness that keeps customers for life. As I read each of the 50 principles with each entertaining example, I found myself saying I would like to be treated that way both as an employee and a customer. Not only is the book a roadmap to success in business, it is beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful monitor","review":"After reading lots of online reviews for this monitor, I bought one a year ago and I have to say that it is the worst monitor I've ever had.It had to go back to NEC twice within the first 4 months, once for a colour problem (no red if I remember correctly) and the second time to fix bad focusing (which wasn't really fixed to my satisfaction).Good monitor for gaming, bad bad bad for text, the focus is terrible in some areas of the screen. To cap it all, text has just started shimmering and I fear that the tube is on the way out.All in all, I would say that according to reviews its the best CRT out there, in my experience it's awful, do yourself a favour and buy a Samsung SM913N 19\\" LCD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible text and images","review":"I received a Viewsonic G90fB today.

No problems with the English rider but this western rider has several issues. First of all- as mentioned by another reviewer- the rider's legs are too short to reach the stirrups. Also, the stance on this guy is very tight and if you try to fit him in the saddle on a male Schleich horse he does not fit on there. Also, the saddle has two girths- I have not been able to fasten both girths when placed on a male Schleich horse. On the female horses- no problem b/c the female Schleichs are thinner in the waist.

Europe was their market place in the 70's. While Yes, Genesis and ELP were very successful in the states during this time, the Strawbs were almost unknown. This band was not a copy-cat band. Their writing and playing ability were second to none. But since commercial air-play of their music was minimal their music was spread by fans and college stations. They are a gothic sounding band with guitar and keyboard taking a front line. Most of their songs are emotionally charged and beautifully arranged. David Cousins (vocals) was a prolific and talented song writer. With the lead guitar player, David Lambert, they made many memorable songs togther. The song \\"Simple Visions\\" is one of my favorite songs of my music collection. If you are an artrock fan your music collection is not complete without this cd set. You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertisement not Objective","review":"This book did not provide any information that was useful in making a decision.

The 9th edition didn't have any of these drugs listed (all very common drugs) either so it was a complete waste of money as far as I am concerned. Why would you market out of date publications without some advise as to the availability of a later version?

I found the development of the friendship between the two women and their children to be forced and unrealistic in the period of time she was covering ( about a year?) The emotions seemed exagerated. The sentence structure typically resembled what one might find in a grade school primer. I'm wondering if perhaps this is a result of it being translated from Swedish to English. At any rate, not a pleasant read, fortunately it was very short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had never read one of Marianne Frediksson's books before this, and after reading Two Women, I will never again.

This book gave me a much better idea about the man, and the reasons behind the founding of the Knights of Columbus. In a time when the Catholic Church is in the midst of a pedophile priest scandal, it is comforting to read about a parish priest who was a true holy man, and looked out for his parishioners.

Most knights know that Father McGivney started the order with a small group of men in the basement of St. Mary's Church in New Haven, CT in 1882. But that's about it. The book sheads a lot of light on the founder, that time in history and the people he worked with to start the KC's. The reader learns that all was not smooth within the order on the start up. But Father McGiveny had forsight for the organization and prevailed in his beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A STRUGGLE OF THE TIMES","review":"I found the book gave an excellent account of life in the late 19th century.

The unit itself is rather light and flimsy, but I figured it really just needs to fire off the monolight flashes and does not need to be a durable piece of photographic equipment. Batteries installed easily, took my first dozen or so photos and the unit worked perfectly. Soon it would work only every other time even when my camera position had not changed. Then the unit would have to be switched off an back on in order to work. I thought the batteries might be going dead and thought this thing was a battery \\"drainer\\". Put brand new Energizer batteries in. It worked for about a dozen wore shots then stopped working completely! I intitiated a return with Amazon in hopes that this was a defective unit.

Maxim's incredible meeting with Adolf Hitler is only sweetened further when viewed after the final family reunion at the novel's end.

Disc#2 has none of the original characters on it at all. I do not even recall an episode of Slevester and Tweedy on the whole collection. What I mean by the originals is this: If you are looking for all Bugs Bunny, Daffey Duck, Road Runner, etc... don't buy this collection because there are not very many of them on it.

The book is filled with copious photographs of artwork and art museums (some in color, some black and white, all reproduced with the high quality you'd expect from Abrams) that do an excellent job of complimenting the points made in the text.

The best episodes are those where I feel like I left with some well earned storyline that builds off of the natural questions raised if you really came to care about the characters.Lately I've seen a lot of filler episodes...OR SO IT SEEMS. This is where I've come to appreciate this season. The value is in the rewatchability. The little jokes you get only if you think about how the story developed, and go back to confirm/gawk.

Save your money and don't take advice about advertising from direct mail people; they're different animals. If you really want a good read about the business, try John Steel's book or, better yet, David Ogilvy's Confessions of an Advertising Man. Ogilvy's book is a 30-year old classic and is written with timeless wit & aplomb.

It's a quick and easy read, and the focus is on things that really have an impact on the overall client-agency relationship.Having seen junior and senior agency people make a lot of mistakes that have killed or strained client relations, I would recommend this for everyone who works with, or works for a client...meaning anyone and everyone in an agency setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"\\"... it is amazing how the best relationship can keep a client, even if the work is far from the best.\\"How good can the relationship possibly be if the client is getting work that is \\"far from the best\\"?And why on Earth should a client stay with an agency that is delivering work that is \\"far from the best\\"???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Account People!","review":"This book is a wonderful resource that gets right to the point and provides important information.

While there is no statement anywhere on the book that this is just part I of a 2, 3 or 4 part story, it obviously is just that. Major plot points are just throwaway lines, never dealt with in this dull volume. I kept reading to the end hoping that these points would be developed, and they never were.In addition to one of the most unrealistic portrayals of life in the White House I have ever read, we see a bizarre world where disaster has struck the world, but the president still has time to whine about his personal life.It would be nice if someone took this good idea and wrote a good book around it.

Where are the communities, cultures and societies that must rebuild the world? I don't think children are even mentioned except as a few underground cult members.This is my 4th Sheffield novel and it doesn't compare to his earlier works. It lacks excitement, surprise and humor. \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow\\", \\"Godspeed\\" and \\"Cold as Ice\\" are much better reads and, the lame attempt to attract my attention at the end of this novel only convinced me not to read the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story goes on...and on...and on...and on...and on...and.......","review":"The problem with this one is that it has LOTS of different lil subplots and doesn't really center on Any of them.

He had absolutely no grasp of female reproductive biology on the fifth-grade level--which was not what the book was primarily about, but it was distracting.

My conclusion is either details of this product are wrong or Amazon people are completely ignorant about the difference between those two chipsets. I've learned my lesson, I will never buy a hardware component from Amazon. Amazon is good selling books, DVDs, CDs and even some electronics.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CCR Powerlite 325E Single Stage Snowblower","review":"Love the electric start! When this puppy fires up, it only goes one speed, FAST! This little snowblower is less than 40 pounds making it easy to haul up stairs to do the deck. It really throws snow! The intake system was able to throw a rock through the snow chute and chuck it 30 feet from the blower and the machine never missed a step. I'm really happy with Toro! This little unit can move snow in very little time with little effort for the user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro 38182 Frustration","review":"I was given this unit as a gift in 2003. I've used it probably 30 times in these past five years. Each year I run the tank dry and when winter approaches I fill the tank with fresh gas and oil. Despite that the unit has stalled repeatedly, has been difficult to start using either the electric starter or by pulling and is easily overcome by the snow in the northeast. When I contacted the local Toro recommended dealer, he stated that since I had to store the unit outside in the winter, it was probably too cold for the unit to start (18 degrees F).Based on my experience with this expensive unit that repeatedly stalls or fails to start, I would not recommend purchasing a CCR Powerlite 325, model 38182."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"Just came in the house after blowing 8-10 inches of snow, kind of heavy wet too.

I had no trouble starting it and hope it stays that way....for the money this is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked a few times","review":"After using the snow blower four or five times, it wouldn't start. Because it was only a few weeks old, I took it to the authorized service center. The technician said the cylinder was scarred, which was consistent with the engine being used without oil in the gas.However, for the first batch of oil-gas mix, I used the oil supplied with the blower. The second (and current) batch was a different brand, but the technician said the mix indeed had oil in the gas. The machine always had a gas-oil mix. He said he would call Toro to see what they had to say, suggesting a total engine replacement. Great.What's more, the web site would not identify the serial number on the box.I am very disappointed with what typically is a brand name with a great reputation. I could not recommend this product for any reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty good mini blower","review":"This little beast gets it done. Easy to lift - I sometimes lift it by the handle on the chute and use it like a shovel. Easy to clean. Takes a while to get the hang of using it to best advantage, but this is the second one I have owned and I love it(the first one is five years old and still works, but I have another property to maintain now). Best use is for decks and walkways - not recommended for big jobs, but great for small areas where you want to scrape right down to the surface without damaging anything. Tilt the handle up a bit after priming to improve starting - and get the electric start - it really saves wear and tear on your arm. I have owned others; this is the best small blower you can get. I would recommend this blower to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine when it starts","review":"This snowblower is fine when its working however, parts fall off when in use and starting at the beginning of the new season is a dubious proposition. I have had it repaired but, now consider the cost of repairs exceed its value. I am looking for a different snowblower. My first snowblower was Toro's 1800 powercurve. It worked dependably but, it lacked weight (it's hollow wheels were a joke)and therefore lacked traction. I bought this model hoping for more power. I got the power; it just came with a temperamental personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 10 minutes","review":"I bought one of these and the engine siezed up after 10 minutes of use.

What I find unacceptable is that there is no MF/AF switch on the lens. According to the manual this is only for the Nikon-mount version of this lens. The manual suggests that you use the AF/MF switch on your camera body to turn the lens to manual focus, but at least some (possibly all) of the more recent Nikon APS-C cameras (including mine, a D3100) do not have this switch. This makes the lens almost unusable for someone who wants to set the focus, reframe the camera on a tripod, and take a photo. It also prevents me from shooting more than one photo at a time without loosening my ball head, autofocusing again, holding down the shutter while repositioning my camera again and then shooting another frame. Needless to say this makes shooting with this lens very impractical. It does look like the Sigma 10-20 3.5 has the switch, so that may be the direction to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Lens","review":"I'm very satisfied with this lens. Shooting with a Nikon DX format camera I needed a lens that could capture wide angle landscape shots and this lens gets that job done. Be prepared from some serious distortion at the wider focal lengths but it can be corrected in photoshop. If you don't have editing software that corrects lens distortion this may not be the best choice for you. Most of the time I manually focus but the autofocus works fine, except in very low light situations (like most lenses). Overall the Sigma 10-20mm is an excellent well made lens and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better sharpness, brightness and color saturation than Canon's 10-22","review":"I just did some test shots comparing the Sigma 10-20mm and the Canon 10-22mm. The Sigma beat the Canon hands down on sharpness, brightness and color saturation without question. I've owned the Canon 10-22mm for almost a year and have never been satisfied with the softness of the images it produces. I've even sent it to the factory 3 times for adjustment. The tests I did today show the Sigma to be surprisingly the better lens hands down. It may be that I purchased a bad Canon lens, but after 3 trips to the factory for adjustment, I would think it would have been spotted. I'm constantly being told by reps how good the Canon 10-22mm is as it has the super UD glass and is supposed to be similar to L series quality. I've never seen this on my 40D and I'm now ecstatic to have found the Sigma to replace it. This is a great lens for a very nice price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping the second copy is better","review":"I loved working with this lens. It was great for panoramas, group photos and open vistas. The fisheye is only noticeable when the subjects are close (less than 10'). Unfortunately, when I finally got the images on my computer, I could see that every photo was noticeably defocused on the left side of the frame. I am returning it and hoping for a better copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read dpreview before you buy","review":"Mechanically well constructed. Come with pinch-type lens cap and hood, as well as boxy carrying case you can thread onto a belt or rigging.I wasn't going to spend extra money for the Canon glass since I anticipate using this lens only occasionally. I figured I'd go with the Sigma over the Tamron because the Tamron is a 77 mm filter while the Sigma shares a 72 mm filter with my main everyday lens. I fully read the review on dpreview about the lens' performance at various apertures, but I wasn't prepared for how soft the picture looked at 10mm F4! Don't rush to return your lens if you're surprised by the poor quality of the test shot, try F11 or F13 where the lens performs the best. This does mean that I'll have to be more thoughtful capturing a landscape than just setting the aperture to F22 and firing away. No quality problems in my copy when stopped down, unlike other mentions here."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned","review":"I returned the lens today. Tried it extensively on a Rebel XSi. Maybe I had one of the bad copies. The sharpness was barely acceptable in the center. The corner sharpness was terrible. The images from the \\"cheap\\" 18-55 IS kit lens included with the XSi blow the ones taken with the Sigma flat out of the water. I will not take the chance and get another. Too much hassle and frustration. In my opinion it is not acceptable for a company like Sigma to have such sloppy quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid, but Fuzzy","review":"I have taken nearly one thousand pictures with this camera, anything from architecture to nature. While my initial assessment of the camera was good, after having it for some time, I feel that the fuzziness of the pictures is unacceptable. I guess I felt as though it was my initial settings, or maybe becuase of the wide angle of the lens this was something that was par for the course. I have since read about softness on right or left side with this leans, but my experience is clarity is no good accross the entire frame, in EVERY situation. I will either send back for repair or get rid of it for the cannon 10-22 lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very pleased with this lens","review":"This is a nice lens.

It was my primary lens at this spot as there are many possibilities where the wide angle works exceptionally well. It seemed to live up to expectations. It was sharp throughout and reasonably easy to use. The reversed positioning of the zoom control and the focus control was not very bothersome. I appreciated having that really wide angle as an added tool for my D300. The price was reasonable and I had done a fair amount of research on line to decide between the Sigma 12 - 24 and this lens. The Nikon equivalent cost almost twice as much. It's a fairly heavy lens but this betokens that it may be better made than some other lighter wide angle models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good lens","review":"I have Tokina 12-24mm and Sigma 10-20mm. I prefer Sigma for compact design, wide usability (HSM/AF-S) and wild 10mm focal length. Sigma provide slightly better sharpness than Tokina 12-24mm, but both are very good and hold the candle even against Nikon 50mm/1.8 prime lens and better than Nikon 18-200 kit lens. Although the prime lens have absolutely no CA, but both lens are good in CA department. Sigma's barrel distortion is too complex, so you would not be able to correct it fully during post processing. Tokina distortion could be corrected. Nice lens case included.If you own D40, D60 - it is your only choice (currently, in this price range), but it is a very good one.Thanks Sigma!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lens, but has quality issue","review":"I purchased this lens for landscape shots.

So instead of investing in the Canon for alot more I ordered the Sigma. The first copy was extremely soft wide open and closed down. Sent it back for another copy which was alot better wide open but at about f11 on up it got softer and softer, not sharp at all at f32 which seems odd since you'd think wide open would have the issues. I exchanged this lens three times! The last three lens were all the same. Thinking somethings up or it's just typical for this lens, I called Sigma. They advised me to send in my Canon 50d with the lens and they would check it out. Seems there's firmware in the lens which may not be reading my camera correctly, or at least that's how I interpreted it. Haven't gotten it back yet, will let you know if there's any change. Just beware, check the lens out as soon as you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"save to buy a canon lens","review":"Got this lens as a birthday gift, but sadly had to return it as it did not meet my expectations. The zoom range is great (10-20mm), but I either received a bad copy or Sigma does not offer good quality. I shot about 50-60 exposures, and I can count on one hand the number of good pictures I got from this lens. It was slow to focus, it lacked sharpness. For indoor photos this lens will leave you very disappointed. For outdoor photos, you will need great lighting and non-moving subjects.The positives: Solid built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly sharp lens !","review":"This lens is very sharp and reasonably light. The reason why I chose this lens is because it probably is the smallest among the wide angles out there. No, it is not an \\"HSM\\" lens for Minolta and Sony. But for this price it is unbeatable ! I've used it on my cruise to Vancouver and Alaska and hardly taken a bad shot with it. If you're into wide angles and price is, or is not a concern, it really doesn't matter, this lens performs with the best of them out there. As with any wide angle lens, barrel distortion is noticable but at 15mm, what can you expect. Knowing that you can shoot more creatively and out to 30mm group shots are very nice and convenient. I've had several wide angle lens previouly and this lens is also a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens","review":"The amount of angle you get from this lens will cause you to look at things different. I had a difficult time framing, however after getting use to the wide angle, you can expect nothing but sharp, well-focused photos.

By the way - the 10mm is really nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun","review":"This is an extremely fun lens, I really enjoy using it. With that said, my pictures are sharp 'enough,' but this is a bit of distortion/softening towards the outside edges at 10mm, but that is to be expected. Overall I am happy I bought this lens and would definitely buy it again.Had a bit of trouble with amazon's shipping getting it out on time, but that has nothing to do with the product, but rather, Amazon's service--I am not sure if the camera equipment falls under a different department than other products in shipping, but there seem to be 'time issues' whenever I get camera gear from Amazon, while all my computer gear is shipped out fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased with the len but..","review":"I am very happy with almost all aspects of the lens. The price is nice and was what got my attention. The lens is very well constructed and the saturation that the lens adds to the photos is very welcoming. It has better saturation than both of my nikkor lenses. The Sigma was not as sharp as the nikkor though. This is apparent when you are editing photos or magnifying the images. However, most of my photos are landscape and it is not a big deal. There are some photos though with people that I wish their features would be more defined. The lens I bought was for a Nikon D90. Overall I am happy, but if you are concern with a real sharp image at 50% magnification I would what to test the lens first. 8x10 prints look great! As for lens features. It has auto focus or manual focus. you can screw a polorizer or any other filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and Super Wide","review":"If you are considering buying the Sigma 10-20 Ultra Wide Angle, there are a few things you should know:* The Hyper Sonic Motor is fast and quiet, even on this big, heavy lens.* The image quality is very good and sharp from corner to corner, even when wide open.* Construction quality is quite nice. I personally like the rubberized coating and how smooth the focus ring is.* This lens is quite heavy, so be careful when you set it up on your tripod, so you don't tip it over.* The angle of view is amazingly wide, I mean, really, really wide, even considering that is is made for cropped sensor cameras.* This lens comes with a terrific, padded lens bag and a nice lens hood. Both are awesome.* The f/4-5.6 is not very good in low light situations. Better use a flash.Overall, I am super happy with it. It works great and the images I have taken, so far, are amazing.

However, as far as the product itself goes, I was not too impressed. Overall, the picture quality was good, and probably even acceptable. But at the 10mm setting, the pictures were not sharp at all when compared to my standard lens (Canon 18-200). The end result came out sharper when I took two or three regular picures with the standard lens and stitched them together to get the same field of view as the wide angle. Perhaps I got one of the \\"bad\\" Sigma lenses that I've read about in the other reviews, but at this point I'm going to return the lens and get the Canon 10-22mm at some time in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens!","review":"Pretty happy with my purchase, I do notice with the camera flash a dark spot where the lens shadowed....out past 8 feet this wasn't a probem."},{"rating":"2","title":"W I D E angle awesomeness!","review":"I love trying different things with my camera.

It comes with a nice lens pouch too (even though I never use them). A couple minor issues: 1) I have the wasia hack and a couple of the settings cause the autofocus and aperture readout to non-function (I thought it was defective until I disabled the hack settings). 2) I wish the distance markings were in smaller increments (not a big deal though, since the autofocus works well).

True it is a little bit fuzzy around the edges of the picture, but I tested a Canon and it did the same thing. I feel for HALF the price this is at least a much greater value than the Canon 10-22 I tested. It is a great little lens for the price. I am sure there is a better wide-angle out there but I know that I would tell anyone interested to get this Sigma over the Canon.I never use auto-focus (why I bought SLR in the first place) so I can't tell you if it does its job well or not.

The distortion at this length makes the center of the frame so distant that it seems too far away. That being said, some people like this style. I still prefer 14-18mm on a DX body, which brings other lenses into the equation.You can, however, get some neat angles on up close subjects at 10mm which is fun.

However, I simply could not get any shots that were sharp. I mounted this lens on my D3100, on tripod, and tried all focal lengths and apertures. The lens didn't start getting close to sharp until 20mm, which kind of defeats the purpose of an ultra-wide.I returned the lens for a refund instead of an exchange, because I didn't want to get into a game of \\"lens sample roulette\\" as it appears many folks have had to do in order to finally get a good copy.

Maybe its better with those, but I wanted to be able to take rich landscape pics and needed the wide aperture.I have looked through images taken using this lens on different forums and it looks like it works a lot better with Nikon cameras than it does with Canon cameras.I purchased this through Adorama and it was easy enough to return it.

I strongly recommend this book, because you can't put it down, and it touched me on a deep level. The characters are alive, you KNOW them, they live next door to you. And the traumas in Digging Out, the disastrous pain, the death, the sadness.....we all feel that in everyday life.

And i loved it.What made me want to read this book was because i really liked the movie it was based on.But after i got done reading the book i liked it even more.It had more sacry patrs than the movie and the ending was totally diffent in the book.If you want to read a serisouly sacry book get this.I mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantoms","review":"This book kept my attention entirely from the beginning to the end..........just the kind of book I look for when purchasing a book, it must catch my attention from the very beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! Some problems...","review":"I'd have given this great supernatural thriller five stars if it weren't for the numerous instances of inconsistancies and plain ignorance. A problem I noticed immediately is the author's apparent ignorance of firearms. He makes reference to a .38 AUTOMATIC, a .45 revolver (NOT Long Colt, a police officers weapon) and one weapon even changes from an automatic 9mm to a revolver in 2 pages. The behavior of police is also amateurish. Six officers respond to an empty city, discover it is indeed full of the mysterious dead and instead of immdiately retreating and calling 'reinforcements' continue exploring WITH civilians in tow. They also seem to be unable to communicate via radio with each other. An author as prolific and successful as Koontz should be above such mistakes.Still, it's a great book and I highly recommend it. I'm just picky, especially as regards firearms and police procedure."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Excellent book, this is one that you should NOT read when you're home alone, it'll scare the pants off of you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great story with an exciting plot,a MUST read","review":"This book makes you think what if this really did happen? It has a great story line and it keeps you thinking about it even when you are not reading it. I've been reading his books for quite some time and this one (along with all the others I've read) is really great. I encourage you to read this book if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"Phantoms is the first book I've read by Dean Koontz. But I'm sure I'll read more of them, because this is one of the best books I've read. It's very thrilling and fascinating. You never want to put the book down. You want to know what will happen next. I finished this book today and have already bought a new Dean Koontz thriller that I will read as soon as I can. If you like horror thrillers (or any kind of thrillers), you will LOVE this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Dean Koontz combine suspense, horror and action in every one of his books, besides a romantic story with funny and clever stuff. This make a perfect hook for every tipe of readers, except for those who don't know how to read. This book in particular develope a great story with a wonderful ending. I recommended especially for those who like horror novels with and great story behind it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Early","review":"I stopped reading when the author did the math for a gun. 3 rounds had been fired and that left 7 rounds in the magazine of the revolver. Revolvers do not have magazines and they hold 6 rounds. I don't expect the author to be a gun expert, but basic knowledge/fact checking would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately a page turner","review":"It instantly brings you in and never gets boring. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't like what the killer ended up being(seemed kinda cheesy to me), but all-in-all it was a fantastic book and I couldn't put it down. I definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! It definately had me scared!","review":"I could not put the book down since the first chapter. Never have I read a book so quick! It's the best book I've ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARY!!!","review":"This is a book I just picked up at Wal-Mart one day as I was looking for my usual Christopher Pike (another GOOD author) books. I saw the title and thought WOW! This looks good. Well let me tell you, it is. Dean Koontz always has and always will describe things to their fullest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Koontz book I read.","review":"This was the first Koontz book that I read, it was perhaps the best book I have read. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. I was hooked right from the first page, to the last. I would recommend this book to all. The movie did not even come close to the real thing. If you saw the movie, please get the book and read it. You will not be sorry I promise....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I normally love Koontz and was excited for this book. It started with a bang and captured my attention immediately. I thought it would be a real adventure but instead became a huge let down. Even after the characters learn that they're not dealing with any ordinary men or terrorists that can be terminated with guns, they still proclaim \\"don't go in there without a gun!\\" Really! Wait, you already know it can't be killed with a gun. . . .so why . . . .. Fighting the monster/ Ancient Enemy became almost comical at the end. So unbelievable that it was not suspenseful or thrilling at all. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Kept me turning the pages.It held me in suspense. Made me keep turning the pages for more. I looked over my shoulder a few times while reading it.I would have given it 5 stars, but I think the characters were a bit flat.The sister, Lisa, of 14 years old behaved and talked way beyond her years. Koontz should have cast her as at least 19, perhaps 20.I wish Koontz as well as other writers would choose more common names for their characters. I have never in my life known anyone named Bryce or Tal.Well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"wannabe scary","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I had just finished \\"In the Moonlight\\" and loved it. To follow that with this was a let-down to me. It seemed like he was trying too hard to make it scary and it wasn't. Then I read his afterward and he agreed with me. That helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz was hyped as King's sole competition for so long...","review":"But I don't understand why after reading this book. I saw flashes of Koontz as a contender with this story, but in the end the book limped along on half-drawn characters and stilted dialogue. Koontz came up with a grand slam premise, and it was the strength of the premise that dragged me across the finish line. Without that I'm not so sure I would've made it.The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete. The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid. As a case in point, I have not forgotten--nor will I ever forget--the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail AS HE'S BEING EATEN. I almost took off my running shoes at that point. Almost.Koontz can write well when he puts his mind to it. But Phantoms proves too stiff and underdeveloped to truly showcase his talent. Pick up Intensity instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite page-turner","review":"This book was very well done. I thought the characterization was particularly effective, and the plot didn't disappoint either. I rated it with 4 stars because I found it a bit gruesome at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a rest!","review":"Well, first off it's not a bad story and it is a page turner. But...it's been done sooooo many times before and since! Shape changing monsters that can look like anything they want. Oh, and don't forget the tentacles. Why can't these writers (both books and movies) write about a \\"normal\\" monster, or alien, or whatever that CANNOT make itself look like a human? And why does every life form in these types of stories have to have tentacles? I'm still waiting for that great story where these themes are dropped. Please just give it a rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a great beginning, but nothing then on.","review":"I had high hopes from the description in the book's jacket, but after a riveting beginning the reveal of the \\"villain\\" left me astonished and quite disappointed. The rest of the book was cheesy, bordering on humorous and just not up to Koontz standard. Find a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much a waste of time","review":"The first 40 pages of this book were great. I had to get up and lock my door and turn on all the lights. That is the only reason I give the book 2 stars. It could have kept up the scary and intense pace but after the first 40 pages it was executed so poorly. I hope i have the energy to try one more Koontz book. This was my first one, and it gave me a very bad impression. Anyone have any suggestions for my next try? Feel free to email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I am a Peter O'Toole fan, so in preparation for seeing his latest movie PHANTOMS from this book, I read the book before seeing the movie. I'm glad I read the book first, because that way I knew in advance that the movie would probably be lousy, too. And it was lousy. The only good things in it were Peter O'Toole and Rose McGowan. PHANTOMS is the type book that should give hope to aspiring untalented horror writers everywhere that they too can become best selling novelists. The only thing preventing me from giving the book one star is that the writing itself was actually pretty good. But the writing told an inept tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real page-turner","review":"This is one of the best novels I have ever read! I saw the trailer for the movie and just knew I had to read it. Luckily, my dad had a copy lying around, so I picked it up, and couldn't put it down! This is the only book that actually ever frightened me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my favorite koontz book so far!!","review":"once i started reading, i just couldn't put phantoms down. it is by far my favorite so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL Terror","review":"Since the movie is coming out, I thought it a good time to review Phantoms. I read the book many years(6)ago but I loved it. It was one of the first Koontz stories for me and it hooked me. He makes an unbelievable situation become frighteningly real. You believe it's happening. Only Stephen King used to be able to do that(not anymore). I strongly reccommend this novel for any fan of this genre. It's one of the best. Even if the movie disappoints, please read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is Kindle Version More Costly Than Physical Book?","review":"Seems a bit odd that the Kindle version costs $7.99 for a book out for so many years. The actual, physical paperback is less money. I thought one of the advantages of e-books was that they were less costly than printed matter. I may be retiring my Kindle sooner than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"This book shows both what I love and hate about Koontz. Great premises, but crappy endings.For the first 70 pages or so he had me hooked. A town suddenly empty of people; Marie Celeste like food still hot on the stoves. A woman and her young sister, alone, with \\"something\\" creeping around. So far, so creepy, and I was loving it.I was still with him when the cops turned up... but when the \\"creature\\" turned out to be a huge, almost omnipotent amoeba, he lost me. I stuck with it through to the end, but I had ceased to care about what happened to the characters by then.A missed opportunity. It could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unavailable in Canada!","review":"Can't get the Kindle ebook because it's not available in Canada. That's ridiculous and it really SUCKS Amazon ... you need to do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to death.","review":"This book was utter and total garbage. Or should I say the 100 pages I managed to read were garbage, I couldn't read more if you paid me. I did read his ODD THOMAS and it was brilliant - five stars. If you're going to try Koontz go right to his best- ODD THOMAS. PHANTOMS was sophmoric trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic horror.","review":"Stock characters and monsters fill this story of a town that has suffered a mysterious and complete disappearance of all it's inhabitants. The first half or so builds up interest, but the rest is by the numbers. Worse is Koontz' tedious writing style, the way he has to not only explicitly spell out every last detail of what is happening (either in action or in the characters' thoughts), but he has to then beat the concepts into the readers' heads. PHANTOMS might be okay beach or travel reading, but I can't recommend it any other way at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start reading it, you can't put it down!","review":"People are disappearing mysteriously into thin air. This book is sort of based on true incidents that actually happened, like the incident of Anjikuni. You just can't wait to find out the end. Its really grr8!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the shadows in the night will never be the same again","review":"Since a year or so I have this preference of reading horror and thrillers (especially about serial killers). Every book I read was just for amusement, they just didn't scare me a bit.Phantoms was a different story, it grabbed me like no other book in this genre. The shape changer is one of a kind.(luckily!)What was maybe the most disturbing about the creature is that he maybe picked up all evil from us people throughout the times. So, is Koontz saying that we should fear ourselves more than anything else?Anyhow, since I read phantoms (or better devoured it) I'm again a little afraid of the dark, especially the shadows.When I walk my dog late at night I watch them and fear them!I'm afraid The shape changer will have a place in my mind forever. Thank you (??!!!?) Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pull the covers up and close your eyes read","review":"This is absolutely one of Koontz best. It grabs the reader from the very first page and the suspense continues to build all the way to the end of the story. Be prepared to spend all of your spare time with your nose buried in the book until the last page, it is a \\"can't put it down\\" read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Dean Koontz, my favorite author, wrote this book back in the eighties. For those of you not familiar with Koontz, his style has changed since then. In fact, normally I don't like his older books as much.This is the exception.This suspenseful and terrifying tale of an inhuman demon/beast/thing destroying an entire town shook me to the point where I stayed up until 3 AM trying to finish the book before passing out. I loved almost every sentence, and the novel idea of what sometimes causes strange disappearances throughout the world is something every sci-fi lover will...well, love.The downside was the end - parts of it were too rushed, and I'm not one for a final standoff between Good vs. Evil or Weak vs. Strong. I also think the end came somewhat too conveniently - hence the 4 stars instead of 5.Nonetheless, this is one of my top 3 favorite Dean Koontz books of all time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers for Algernon","review":"Flowers for Algernon is an awesome book! The way Daniel Keyes wrote like Charly would write before turning into a genius was interesting. Changing from retarded to a genius in a matter of two weeks is amazing. I like the way Mr. Keyes went in depth in describing the way Charly felt about his teacher, Ms. Kinnian. (...) It was extremely compelling.I loved this book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!!","review":"I read the book for the first time in High School and I have continued to read it at least once a year ever since. I am not normally much of a science fiction fan but this book really makes you think. What if it were true?! Once you get into it, I'd be willing to bet you cannot put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"This was a really nice book(: Really moved me. The book itself was really nice too. Colorful, affordable, and sturdy. And it came early for me, so double bonus points for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers For Algernon","review":"When I read Charlie I thought it was going to be a bad book, I thought I thought it was going to be about a guy that had mental problems. But instead it was a very interesting book about human feelings and human nature; it showed all that he had to become smarter. It was fascinating, because all of the different things he suffers to become intelligent. I think it that is very impressive how a human being has this obsession and tries to overcome it. It is fascinating and impressive. Even though it is a fiction book it is very realistic and human, and shows both sides of the human nature, (when he was retarded, and when he was smart). I really liked this book and I really recommended to anyone that wants to have a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLowers for Algernon","review":"Flowers for Algernon is a deeply touching novel. The story centers around its main character, Charlie Gordon. In the beginning of the book Charlie is selected as the human experiment that will undergo an operation to increase his intelligence. After much testing, the operation is completed. This determined and courageous hero will go through struggles in the areas of love, education, and self-understanding. You will feel what Charlie feels as he goes from challenged to intelligent, but don't get to comfortable. This story has an unexpected ending that will leave you wishing better for the characters. I highly recommend this novel to anyone fascinated with the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers For Algernon","review":"To me flowers for algernon was a very inspiring book. It showed the courage that Charlie Gordon had. It showed how mean people could be to people. Charlie didnt care what people said about him he just held his head up high and went on his way. I feel very bad for Charlie that he had no idea his friends were making fun of them but once he found that he was smart he found that out. If I found out my friend were not my real friends Id be devasted. I feel bad for Charlie to loose his best friend Algernon That was his best friend. I feel bad and sorry for Charlie for all he went through. This book taught me alot because it taught me to treat people with more respect. just because someone is different doesnt mean that they could be treated badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please enter a title for your review:","review":"A friend of my mom's in France sent me this book quite a long time ago. It sat on my shelf for months before I finally picked it up to read it - and by the time I got to the second or third page I didn't want to put it down. I finished it that same afternoon.This book is amazing because the author has the talent to use the journal format in a very effective way. Not many people can do that. Usually I find that style rather dull - but here it is outstanding. Through first person you step into Charly's shoes. As things dawn on him, they dawn on you. Some parts are humourous and most are touched with a bit of pathos, because you know that any minute all he has gained is going to go. And when he goes - you go with him.It's very sad and moving overall and I was so affected by it that I didn't want to even talk to anyone for several hours after finishing it. I just kept thinking about the story.It's definitely a classic and I think everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to read at any time of the year","review":"This is a book that I will read again and again as the years go by. I have a copy that is in horribel condition and plan on keeping a new one on my shelf so I can refer it to others and so I can re-read it. The people are interesting and the story is timely considering all the gene therapy going on. A definite must have on anyone's reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true reminder to be thankful for what we are given","review":"Flowers For Algernon is a touching story, and a heart breaking drama. In it a medical miricle allows a mentally challenged adult male to become a super genius in a matter of weeks, only to return to what he once was. If there is anything that this book should teach, it's that we must be greatful for what we have been given, and that to tamper with it is to tisk losing it forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart-wrenching sci-fi classic","review":"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. This is a very short book about a mentally challenged man who is given the gift of intelligence. By the end, you should be crying, or close to it. It's an SF classic that should be on everyone's list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you fear madness, loss of coherence and sanity?","review":"We all fear madness, loss of our coherence and sanity. At least all of us who are sane fear these things. There, I've hooked you. You've got to read on now, or you're not sane ... Losing the brilliance of youth, of success or of dreams we once held bright in our minds - these common fears also haunt us.The narrator of 'Flowers for Algernon, Charlie, a mentally handicapped man, burns from dim to bright. From candle stub he turns, or is turned, to a nova and then to a guttering candle he returns. And all the while he is aware of his condition.I cried when I first read the book - perhaps because I egotistcally thought I was once as bright as Charlie at his best. In truth I'm dull and average and dimly aware of the brilliance of this book. As is Charlie dimly aware of what he once was when he finally fades from genius to low IQ.Read it. Despair. Be hopeful. Be admiring. As you please. But read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmotionally Draining","review":"This book was so so well written, and majestically put together. Like the Catcher in the Rye, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Flowers for Algenon is a modern classic that challenges opinion and turns over the stones of controversy.After the first few pages this book pulls the emotional cords and tugs your conscience in all directions. I thought it lost something in the middle, but it made up for it with a fantastic climax that could be seen a mile off, but was still heart wrenching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Inspirational Book of all Time","review":"Flowers for Algernon is above all the best book i have ever read. This story of a retarded man given a chance to be a genius was brilliant. From the front to back of the book, i loved it all. Every word was incredibly awesome. Everyone should read this book. It tells a lesson that you must take chances in your life and trust others besides yourself. And that not everything lasts forever, as did Charlie learned. I recommend this book to everyone i meet and see. Your life will not be complete untill you read it. It opens new pathways to a persons heart, mind , and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner","review":"This book was definitely a page turner and I was glad I read it. Keyes wrote an engaging story that was hard to put down. I'm not giving it five stars because I thought it lacked something - I guess I felt the author was trying to send a message and I wasn't really buying it. Charlie caused his own loneliness and unhappiness. It had very little to do with him becoming intelligent. Someone like Dostoyevsky could have taken the same story and done so much more with it. That may be an unfair comparison though. Flowers is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of offensive language and adult content","review":"Charlie is a mentally retarded adult who has agreed to be a human guinea pig. Scientists want to see if they can improve one's IQ by performing an operation. The operation is done on Charlie and a mouse, Algernon. The scientists compare results and see that both IQ's grow very high and very quickly. Charlie's challenge is to act normal as he deals with his genius status. One day, Charlie notices that Algernon is not acting normal. He is irritable, forgetful and unclean. Charlie knows this will also happen to him.Because of language that could be offensive, and descriptions of a nude picture and making love, this book is for mature readers only."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really like this book...","review":"I didn't really liked Flowers for Algernon... it wasn't the best book I have ever read. I read it in 8th grade for school. I found the events hard to follow because there were so many. Plus the book never seemed to be going anywhere. I reccomend this book if your patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't float my boat","review":"Flowers for Algernon provided entertainment in the biggining explaining his operation and sad stories, but I found that it was all downhill from there. I feel the book goes too in depth about Charlie's feelings on relationships. Not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Alright","review":"This book was alright. It wasnt the best.It is about a guy who is mentally challenged and get pick to try an experament to make him smarter(well and opperation). He had to take all these tests and mazes before they could do it to see if he was good enought to use. He was. After he got the opperation he thought it wasnt going to work because he thought he wasnt getting smarter. He really was getting smarter everyday. After he got the opperation he started doing more mazes and tests to see how it works. He kept getting smarter and smarter and remembering a lot of things. He could never remember anything. He remembered how they treated him in school and how the people at work treated him because he understands what they mean by all the things they said about him or to him. He never understood all them things before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowers for Algernon","review":"I was very disappointed in the product quality of this book. Amazon stated this was a Hardcover Book. When I received the book, it is the size of a paperback. The print is very small!! And the cover is \\"cardboard\\" quality, it has no book jacket! Amazon should have been clearer on the type of book that this was.(I do love the story. - It is just the product.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journal Format is Perfect for this story.","review":"I don't think this story could have been told in any format other than the journal format used by this book. I have seen the film adaptation with Cliff Robertson and Claire Bloom, but it doesn't do the book justice because it is not in the journal entry format.I don't know what else to say other than I think that every child should read this once between the ages of 10-16 and then as an adult read it between the ages of 24-30 to get what they couldn't understand the first time.This book makes you feel sorry for 'Charly' and then turns around and makes you feel angry with him and then sad, but not quite as sympathetic at the ending. I can't really describe much else without spoilers, so I will end this review by saying that everyone who has never read this book should pick it up and take a day or two to read it. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would you?","review":"This book is like an onion, with many layers of emotion and not-so-subtle challenges to your world-view. If you are reading this review, more than likely you are well-read, middle-class or better, and above-average intelligence. The 'hero' of this book was none of those things, but that all changed with an experiment. Today, you often hear the term differently-gifted to describe persons of lower intellectual capacity. But, broadly speaking, we are all 'differently-gifted.' You may not be gifted athletically, logically, aesthetically, spirtually... Would you be willing to become the \\"most interesting man in the world,\\" but for only a brief time knowing that it would be a fleeting temporary experience? While Charlie doesn't choose, think about yourself. Athletes and many entertainers, in a manner, are very much like Charlie in some ways. Their glory is but a candle, burning bright for an hour. There are many other interesting questions raised between the lines of Charlie's journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but very good read","review":"Thought provoking book which examines the connection between intelligence and happiness in a mentally handicapped individual who for a time has his low intelligence artificially raised. Is ignorance bliss? Well worth the read, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to engraves in your memory","review":"Flowers for Algernon, although a simple story writen through the simpleness of a adolecents mind, was able to convey overwhelmingly the will and courage of the human spirit. Flowers for Algernon travels through the mid life of Charlie Gordan, a retarded man, with the one wish of being smart, or in his words \\"like everyone else\\". He's motivation is rewarded when a promising new advance in science allows him to surgically compound his IQ. ..and when this new aquisition Charlie was able to soak up all the knowledge he had longed for. With his new mind, Charlie no longer sees the world through the mind of a 6 year old.. he realises the perfect world he always knew, was not so perfect anymore. He discovers the truth of who he is, and what is really significant in life. Not IQ or gift, but only love, goodness, and the will to succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"This book is not actually as bad as everyone say it is. It's juts that SOOOOO many schools make this required reading, and only a small percentage of kids would actully find this book engaging.The plot is pretty cool, it's a very interesting thought: what if an operation could make you a genius? The format of the book; diary entries; is engaging also. However, the book goes into too much detal about pointless things...and that's why so many people don't like this book. It drags on and on, never getting very exciting.I love to read. I really do.

I mean, fifty years ago, this would NEVER have been printed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the worst book that I ever read in my life","review":"I think this book related to real life. One is that Charlie Gordon has who a problem in that to improve his IQ,and he was looked down upon by people who belittle him because they think he is dumb. So he we went to Dr. Strauss for help which he got. Some of the reason that I did not like this book because in the middle of the book and in the beginning he started to speak gibberish which is very hard to understand. That is one of the reason that I does not like this book. Another was that it did not intrigue me so I did not want to read more. This was a real problem that I had trouble to come back to the book and reading more of the book that I thought was a complete waste of my time reading this book for me and also for you. This book is one of the worst book that I read in my whole life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS BOOK","review":"This year I had to read this book for an English assignment. It was so boring.

I had never in my life fallen asleep while reading before. I swear I fell asleep every time I picked up the book to read my assigned chapters. I am really not kidding. As an adult I saw this horrible book at a library book sale and spent a quarter on it just for nights I suffered with insomnia. I hope it will work years later, too. Really detested this book.

I'm shouting from wireless rooftops here for everyone to read it!And as for those posting reviews who just can't get past the smallest obstacle that takes them oustide their own sheltered lives (especially those who felt so compelled to mention that this made the \\"banned book\\" list), I don't know what to say....Did you even read it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Absorbing and Emotional Journey","review":"Among the elements of life we most often take for granted, the most provocative might the ability to think, reason, and comprehend the life around us. Flowers for Algernon touches upon this idea in the form of Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged 33 year-old who became the recipient of brain surgery to improve his intelligence. Finding his aptitude eventually surpasses that of even his doctors, Charlie is lead to a state where he contemplates the deep implications of his own operation.Daniel Keyes has produced an intriguing journey that captures hearts by instilling readers with a sense of intimate compassion and understanding for Charlie. The emotional appeal combined with the intrigue of Charlie's development results in an exceptionally absorbing story that is difficult to put down from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Sad","review":"Charlie knows both extremes of the IQ ladder. Reading of his changes, successes, misfortunes and battle to find himself is interesting yet sad. With knowledge Charlie becomes arrogant, losing his kind childlike qualities.

One is from the perspective of a \\"mentally challenged\\" person, and the other is from the same person made a \\"genius\\". I liked this book because it points out both our potential and our shortcomings as human beings. This book is listed on Easton Press' Masterpieces of Science Fiction Collection which I have subscribed to, and is worthy of the price to add to anyone's personal library. This is one of those books which \\"expand your horizon\\" and contains several lessons for life within it's pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Deep","review":"This book is very deep and full of interesting and thought provoking analysis of a science experiment that in effect helped, but then turned on the main [challenged] adults. During this time, he gets the opportunity to have an experiment on him to increase his intelligence, something his mother always wanted for him when he was younger. After the experiment is performed, his knowledge increases and he becomes a genius, absorbing all types of information at rapid speeds. While many will view this book as one man's journey through this, it is really about sexual experiences and emotional breakthroughs throughout his \\"new life\\". After the experiment he starts to understand what his emotions and sexual abilities mean and he utilizes them. This is truly a work of art by an amazing author, Daniel Keyes who spent a tremendous amount of time into the completion of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banned Book List? NO WAY!","review":"I read Flowers for Algernon, which is on the banned book list. I was intrigued to find out why. When I finished the book, I still couldn't figure out why it is on that list. The book is about a man in his thirties named Charly who is mentally challenged. He undergoes an amazing operation to try to raise his I. Q. Well, it works, but perhaps it wasn't such a good idea. He begins to realize that the people who he thought were his friends were actually very cruel to him because of his disability. You don't have to dig very deep to notice that the book is about self-realization and knowing yourself. This tear-jerking novel inspired me to try to be a better person and make sure that I keep track of myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel","review":"Students really enjoyed reading this book.

It has totally changed my perspective on mentally retarded people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutally Honest, a whirl pool of emotions and yet--- predictable.","review":"I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, \\"What goes up must come down.\\" right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, \\"coming of age\\", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful","review":"Beautiful book. Just wonderful.

It took me a while to grasp the concept of it but after a few attempts of reading it, I just couldn't take my eyes off it. It shows you how a mentally retarded adult who has an IQ of a kindergardener endures phisical and emotional obstacles of life. After his operation that makes you smarter, he understands what he went through and finds faults in many famous scientist's theories and philosophies. He also began to understand how stupid human nature can be. While on this rugged path of knowledge, he also began to understand love. This book is great for people who think humans are stupid as well as people who just want a great laugh and cry. It is also a great romantic book also. I promise you that this will be a 5 star book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction with Humanity","review":"Flowers for Algernon initially attracts its readers with a tantalizing experiment. As experimental surgery converts sluggish mouse Algernon and retarded young man Charlie Gordon into geniuses, readers are swept helplessly into a turbulent emotional experience entirely contradictory of the scientific curiosity they were drawn in by. Your heart will ache while reliving Charlie's painful memories of an abusive mother and a ceaseless struggle for love and understanding in a world where humanity is measured by numerical IQ's and Rorschach tests . This novel offers a serious intellectual question to the mind as well as a new level of compassion and understanding for the spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic book that gives inspiration to us all","review":"This is an enchanting story about a middle-aged man named Charlie Gordon who is mentally challenged. Every day is a never-ending battle for him. Charlie's only wish is to be a normal, average young man. Flowers for Algernon has inspired me, as I am sure other readers, to live their lives to the fullest and feel fortunate for what they have. This novel should be on your must read list. A+'s across the wall for Daniel Keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers for Algernon is a touching and inspiring book","review":"Flowers for Algernon is a touching and inspiring book for any young reader that struggles in school. The main courtier, Charlie Gordon, should be commended for his motivation to excel in the field of education.

I liked it because it was fascinating to see how Charlie's retardation slowly fades into oblivion and his IQ steadily rises. I would strongly recommend this book to any one, child or adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book of the painful life of a mentaly challenged man","review":"Flowers For Algernon is a novel about hope and hardships.It is a science fiction novel about a 32 year old mentally disabled man who undergoes a life changing operation.It is a heart warming story as the author take the reader through Charlie Gordon's trials and tribulations at a extremely important point in his life.Charlie has a drastic life change at the age of 32 when doctors do a mental experiment on him to increase his I.Q.I recommend this book pretty highly to any one who wants to learn about how painful life can be for mentally challenged people."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should read it.","review":"Truth is I only read this book because I had to for school. At first I thought I was going to hated it even though my teacher said all his students loved it. But it turns out it is a great book and I love it.

I suggest reading this for fun maybe during a vacation or just whenever you have free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book~","review":"Flowers for Algernon is beautifully written, highly emotional and a thought provoking novel. The book starts with reading Charlie's thoughts, written when his IQ is 68. He was chosen for a controversial surgery, and we get to experience his growing intelligence (IQ is 185) through his progress reports. We also get to see how people treat Charlie at all stages of his intelligence and vice versa.

Really a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers For Algernon","review":"Charlie, the main character in Flowers For Algernon, was born retarded. He goes to Beekman University to be a part of a study to make retarded people smart. Through the book Charlie goes through many challenges. These events make the reader think a lot about their life for many ways. Though out the book, you get an inside view of a retarded person and the struggles they go though even if they don't know it. I think that in parts the book goes slow, but in a way it makes you want to read on just for the exciting event. I personally have worked with mentally retard people and I think that this book shows real life problems that they go though everyday. This book is very powerful, you need to be al least eighth grade student to understand the book fully. This doesn't mean it is not for adults. A lot of adults and kids should read this, because it give them insight in to a world that they would never be able to imagin."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional, memorable book","review":"There are few science fiction stories as touching as Flowers for Algernon. We care about Charlie because he's the focus of the story, not the experiment that makes him a genius. The ending moves us because we witness what's happening to him in human terms, not scientific ones. All good fiction is about the characters, something Daniel Keyes clearly understood. For that reason, Flowers for Algernon is- and will remain- a classic. A newer novel with a fairly similar theme- and very memorable characters- is An Audience for Einstein. Both books have a strong emotional impact that lingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The author of this book, Daniel Keys, really seems to go into the mind of the character, Charlie Gordon. The book is the sad story of Charlie, age 32, a mentally ritarded adult who agrees to undergo a brain operation to \\"make him smart\\". However, he learns that being smart can be worse than being in the dark as he finds out about how everyone in his life hasn't always been as nice as he thinks. The worst part is when his brain starts to deteriorate and he realizes that he's going to be back where he was at the beginning - except not quite as innocent. This book is very excellent. I definitely reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Retarded to Genius","review":"Flowers for Algernon is a novel that will keep you intrested all through to the end. This novel is about a man who is 32 yrs. old, Charlie, who is retarded and with an operation he becomes a genius. Many things happen to this man during the process.Including things that he remembers from his past, and things that happen to him when he becomes a genius. Everything is explained in a very detailed matter. The book takes you into sharing the experiences that Charlie goes through and this is what makes it a wonderful book to read. You will learn about how it is to live in two different ways, in a retarded way and then when he becomes a genius, and everything that he realizes. This book shows us that intelligence is not everything, and that if someone is not smart or retarded they are not less than anyone esle in the world.

However, it becomes clear that the operation might start regressing and he may end up as retarded as when he started. The story is skilfully told in diary form, with the writing accurately reflecting the mental ability of Gordon. We watch through Gordon's eyes his mental ascent to unassailable heights; fumbling with his emotional development as it lags behind his intellect; coming to terms with his past....and brooding upon his eventual future. Although the story is sad on so many levels, the book is never depressing and always compelling. This is because Keyes is a writer of skill and subtlety, and deserves to be known to a wider audience than his narrow science fiction base. A minor 20th Century classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"tears","review":"I read this book a year ago and when I think of all the hardships he went through, I still cry.

Yes his intellect surpasses that of the doctors who operated and they, too become an foe. Algernon is the lab rat they tested the experiment on first, and now his brain is tuning to mush.Will the same happen to Charlie? That is a question yo will have to fingd out. I'm no spoiler!

It shows the simple things people go through each day shown from a retarded man's point of view. It's about a man who must confront the many challenges he faces because he's different.

It is a story dealing with topics, such as mental retardation, that are rarely discusses. It is the story of a simple man named Charlie Gordon. As an adult with severe retardation, he decides to go for a controversial and secret operation to reduce and possible completely eliminate any signs of this disease. From that point forward, the book deals with Charlie's day-to-day struggles, especially with his uncomfortable past.As a result of reading this book, I have learned many important rules to living a happy life by myself and with others. I highly recommend this book to any person that feels unequal to people around you. The ending of the book is touching and will lighten your heart. If you plan to read this book, keep in mind it does deal with adult content, but overall, most anyone can respect its morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very original, touching, and thoughtful!","review":"I have to admit I didn't read this book by my own choice.

It's just that kind of book that is critically acclaimed for how well it is written. However, the story is poor. I wrote better stories when I was in first grade.Basically, things happen in chronological order as they would in real life. However, they are not connected. It's true that in real life not everything is connected. However, if I wanted to experience real life, I wouldn't read it, I would live it. The point of a book should be to tell an interesting story.

The reason for that is because it changed directions too many times in the first part of the book. I read 8% of the kindle edition and i felt like I was starting new books four times! The author would start a story line with one set of characters, I'd just start getting interested, then he's change directions entirely and start a different storyline with all new characters and i'd have to start trying to get interested all over again. I'm sure somewhere down the line the story lines would merge, but with so many characters following such different paths early on, I found I didn't care about any of them. I know there needs to be new characters introduced into every book, but in this one it just seemed so abrupt with the new story lines that it just lost my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but heavy going","review":"This book is very interesting but many, many characters, worlds, plots, etc. It's also very lengthy; I will probably not re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of our time","review":"Most of the time authors write giant books and they suck.

It shows boundless imagination and is truly striking in its breadth and detail. Plot elements include (but are not limited to) numerous different worlds, an \\"Intersolar Commonwealth,\\" cults, vanishing stars, wormholes, interstellar starships not limited by light speed, repeated physical rejuvenation of body and mind, and a fascinatingly inhuman alien life form. It is also daunting in length. For me, the book took fully 700 pages to reach ramming speed, but it was so rich and unique that the effort itself seemed worthwhile.

It is simply too long, over 1100 pages, which could easily have been compressed into three or four hundred. However, the real problem is the ending, there is not one! After stuggling though the whole thing, it leaves you hanging with a little note saying it will be concluded in the next book. Are you kidding me!? You could not wrap it up in 1100 pages, you need a second book!? I am pretty sure I will ever know what happens to the commonwealth, just not worth getting through another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the old days","review":"Reading this book brought me back to the days when I first discovered science fiction; when I would take a thick book and read and lose myself.

The whole book is full of profanity and childish sexual themes (Almost every character it seemed like). And this book should have been half the number of pages. The plot was full of tangents and pointless long-winded dialog. I wish i'd never read it. I don't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"bloated and shallow","review":"Too much emphasis on exposition, and not enough depth to the drama. WAY TOO MUCH vulgarity. That kind of writing turns SciFi into trash. The ending isn't a cliff-hanger, er falls-hanger and I feel I wasted my time on this novel. When authors do this I have no interest in the sequel. Written with a British perspective and style which doesn't translate well to Yankee expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better editing.","review":"I gave up after 650 pages... his tendency is to obsessively detail every planet's geology, culture, development, and history only to have it have no actual relevance to the plot, while leaving most of the humans without discernable motivations beyond the broadly comic and obvious.Entire swaths of this \\"epic\\" could be cut without impacting the core story. And yes, I skipped to the end only to discover no good resolutions... only buy this if you're prepared to endure 3000 eventual pages of this largely unedited meandering.I'm not afraid of space opera: I love Iain M Banks' Culture books, Alastiar Reynolds' series, and others back to Larry Niven. But those authors provide detail to propel the story, to add relevance and texture. Hamilton is not in this league."},{"rating":"1","title":"A box you may not want to open...","review":"Somewhere within the 1,000 pages of this book is a very good 600 page book struggling to emerge.In Hamilton's desire to craft a comprehensive future world he launches into sub-plots, characters and details that fail to serve his story line. The result is a story that plods along relieved by only moments at a quicker pace.When the pace picks up Pandora's Star is difficult to put down. Alas, these moments are far too few leaving one looking for the end of chapters in the hope that the next chapter will bring more energy.Halfway through Pandora's Star I became aware that this was only the first half of the story. Only after reading some 2,000 pages of Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained is this saga brought to a close. Given the slog to get through Pandora's Star, Judas Unchained may have to await my being stranded on a desert island."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audiobook is nearly unlistenable","review":"The narrator starts out his sentences incredibly loud, then trails off into a barely audible mumble at the end. If you turn the sound up high enough to catch the ends, the start will be intolerably loud. I had to run the whole book through a Dynamic Range Compression filter and re-burn to CD to make it a tolerable experience. But the content of the book is pretty good, so I'm giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Opera without Spaceships?","review":"I've rated this highly because I found it to be a page-turner, engrossing and fun. Other reviewers' critical remarks about the tedious descriptions are correct, though. Some of the character sketches are thin or unbelievable. Those factors weren't obstacles for me. That's because most of the characters are dynamic, sympathetic, or intriguing. The stories of their intertwined lives, along with a strong plot, keep this moving fast.The idea of space travel without spaceships is also fun and it's well described.So: skim lightly over the descriptions that seem irrelevant to the story. Have fun. And buy this together with Judas Unchained because this is really a 2000 page book that's been chopped in half."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Science Fiction titles I have ever read.","review":"Puts me in mind of Harry Turtledove with the rich and varied cast of characters. Not nearly as repetitive as Turtledove however. Hamilton manages to create a great world, wonderfully detailed, and his prose is not overly pretentious. Best book I have read in a looooong time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring, Almost no Action, Mostly \\"Filler\\"","review":"This novel is 700 pages. The fisrt 600 pages are basically people having converstaions. Almost nothing happens until the end when Humanity is attacked by the aliens. Then we find out that the novel is continued in a second book. It seems that the first 600 pages are \\"filler\\" that one can sleep through.It seems to me that the author was required to produce a certain number of pages, regardless of whether or not he had enough of a plot.I understand that Hamilton is considered a talented writer, but is difficult for me to understand why. I would reccommend any of Robert Sawyer's books to those who want to read excellent sci-fi.This type of writing by authors like Hamilton, is due, in part, to the new trend among writers to leave the book unfinished so they can produce a sequel. This creates the need to artifically inflate the number of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandora's reviewer. Why write a spoiler for a recent book?","review":"Frodo gets the Ring to Mt.

I'm on about page 300 so not even close to half way. Now rather than heading towards the \\"amazing cliff hanger\\" described by the other reviewers you've exposed the whole mountain range!The reviewer above who posted when he was on about page 250 shows that readers will check this page before they finish the book.

Its almost 1000 pages are only the first part of a serial. They come to no conclusion. The many characters never reach a resolution with any of the challenges. The entire book is a set-up for the next one in the series. I finished the last page and could only ask 'how does it end?' I'm not willing to buy the next in the series, for fear that it too will present no conclusion to the story. Arg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good epic story, a bit long and wordy.","review":"I like the author's writing style, in some ways. It started slow and different story lines were sometimes confusing, since they sometimes didn't seem to be connected to each other. These days, I am only able to read a few pages a day, so it seemed the story went too slowly for me. But at the end of the book, I've realized that I was able to sink into the culture and storyline of the story to be able to figure out who is who and how they relate to the storyline. I like the action sequences but it took a while to get there. But all in all, it's a good story with it taking it's time to get there. I would recommend it especially to people who like to read a book straight through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down!","review":"I must admit, one star off for the weird grammar usage (punctuation misuse is more like it), but other than that this is definitely a page turner! I haven't finished yet, but the depth of the character profiles is intriguing; there are tons of characters to like and dislike in the first half of the book. Environments are nicely fleshed out (and there are many), and supporting characters are used sparingly. This is not 'hard' sci-fi, but includes some interesting tech. Hamilton's writing reminds me of Fredrik Pohl's 'Gateway' series, and I miss that in most of today's authors. Great find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much filler and written too quickly with shallow plot","review":"I've decided to avoid PF Hamilton novels after a few bad experiences with his later works. Esp that last novel in the Nights Dawn Trilogy. He spent hundreds of pages setting up the excitement for it to be all neatly tidied up by using a \\"God\\" like machine that was in no way different than a big Genie granting your every wish. Nothing science fiction about it. This novel introduces some interesting science but does not use any of it in an interesting way. Devices are used and created without effort or exploration of their effects. The many many characters are too numerous for them all to become worth worring about. The aliens are too alien and thus hardly require any moral qualms about their inevitable demise. Peter in fact tries too hard to make them unlovable. His normal anti social tendencies of giving everyone in power the lowest morals is dreary and unsuprising. In summary this novel is a drag. Stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten, bloated and in need of a red pen","review":"I have just put this book down, a little more than halfway through. The only other author I've ever done that for is Robert Ludlum. Like Ludlum, Hamilton has never met a word he didn't like. Every person place or thing has multiple modifiers and the action is explained, rather than allowed to unfold. Add some cliche characters (Dead-head style Techno Billionaire wandering through space, 'Right-Stuff' Space Captain, etc) include way too many side plots and story lines and this wandering, undisciplined tome is just too much work. Are there no editors? No red pencils or pens? If I knew his address I'd send Peter Hamilton a copy of Strunk & White. There are still some great Alien-Culture, Hyperspace-Travel genre sic-fi books out there. This isn't one of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad SiFi","review":"Unfortunately this is another example of an author that believes that the only way to sell his work is to pollute it with sexual content. Strip out the irrelevant sex and it could have been a good book, though the lack of conclusion is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishing and Seller EPIC FAIL","review":"The book would probably have been good, but when I got to page 252, the book jumped directly to page 669. At page 732, the book started back at page 317 and continued until the end. Thus, the pages of 669-732 replaced 253-317, and were then repeated in their normal succession after that. The book was good until then. I would not have given this purchase any stars, but I was forced to put at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice SciFi, but Too much profanity","review":"I enjoy good scifi and Pandora's Star is certainly good scifi. I understand one is likely to encounter some profanity in today's literature, but Pandora's Star went well past the limit of what I felt was reasonable. More than once I contemplated stopping without finishing the book.I also feel that the amount of profanity and nature of the profanity fails scifi itself. In a world 400 years from now, a world that has worked to ban words like \\"war\\" from the collective vocabulary, I would hope that, if not eliminated, the amount of profanity people with wormhole and rejuvenation technology would experience would be far less than contained in this book. If won't happen if today's authors keep using as much profanity as Hamilton does in this book. This spoiled the book and series for me. As much as I would like to see what happens to the characters in this book, I will pass on the rest of the series because of the profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere under all that fat...","review":"Somehow it all went wrong with the Naked God...ten sub-plot jostling for page space until the bitter end. The same with this tree killer. Lots of characters and very little action - and when it happens it catches you almost off guard' and in a semi-comatose state of endless pap and hackney'd character development. Somewhere under all that fat lurks a damn fine story. But like his previous soap epic it needs some damn tight editing and slicing off useless subplots and endless descriptions of hang-gliders on mountain tops, industrial parks and silly love scenes.Come on Hamilton...don't write shaggy dog stories. You have immense talent and super ideas...just compress them a bit like you used to do in the early 'leaner days' of the Nano Flower....Oh, and stop trying to write like an American. It's a bit embaressing mate!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow moving and boring.","review":"For almost 1000 pages this story goes nowhere. It was painfully slow and boring. A huge cast of characters who I did not care about. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"1100+ pages of mediocre prose & dull storytelling","review":"I was expecting a big, sprawling, colourful galactic-milieu story in the vein of Brin, Cherryh, or Niven. Book is big alright (1144 pages!), but I've rarely come across such dull, lifeless prose and mediocre storytelling. Endless boring descriptions that convey nothing interesting or significant, inane dialogue, and a vast array of characters so indistinguishable, lifeless and lacking in depth or personality that calling them one-dimensional would be generous. I'd recommend this book only if you have alot of time to kill and don't really care how you spend it. Might be a good book to read in prison, for example (where it's size and weight might make it a good weapon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magna Opus","review":"I thought nothing could top Hamilton's Night's Dawn trilogy for modern science fiction. Pandora's Star exceeds his previous series, if by just a little. The action and plot get off to a much faster start and things keep chugging along though some of the plot lines seem mostly for description of the world and not an advancement in plot. That might change in the second novel...As well there are a ton of characters that the reader follows and for the most part they are all interesting though some are clearly doing much more plot advancement than others...each chapter could have several plot line advanced with is good as the point of view keeps changing...and maddening when the reader is left wanting more...and staying up sinfully late satisfying their appetite.If you like smart science fiction this is a book well worth pickign up. If you are a fan of Hamilton's Night's Dawn Trilogy either you have it already or SERIOUSLY need to get out from under that literary rock you are hiding under."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"What you think from the summary the plot is makes only about 15% of the book. The rest is enornous number of parallel plots (overloaded with useless details) very loosely related to the main plot. Also this book doesn't belong to Sci-Fi, SCIENCE is not present here. The closer to the end the more implausible it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"read without expectations","review":"I had never read any of his books ,have been reading Science Fiction since 1954 and I know a guy who doesnt know what he is doing when I see one .The story is very good but it is so filled with useless junk that unless you are really curious like I am,you will put the book down.Someone please tell him ,he is writing a book ,not a screenplay.not good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good. Not on par with previous work.","review":"Unlike the Reality Disfunction trilogy and Falling Dragon, which were very fluid, sometimes I felt like I could do without so much description. Hamilton overdid it.I also found many similarities between some characters of the trilogy and this book. I won't go in detail to avoid spoiling it for you, but some were old ideas with a new twist.That being said, I enjoyed the book and could not wait to get the sequel (same thing happened with the trilogy). If you have enjoyed previous Hamilton books, you will enjoy this one too. If not, I'd suggest reading Falling Dragon first, then the Trilogy, and then this one. Take into account that \\"Pandora's Star\\" and \\"Judas Unchained\\" are one book. There is no conclusion at the end of \\"Pandora's Star\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's not in Heinlein's universe","review":"My god. This guy is a prolific writer in need of a good editor. Make that a very good editor. I failed to find an interesting character or story line. It seemed that much of the verbiage and description was just filler. Mid-way through, I relegated this tome to my emergency reading pile (in the bathroom), and eventually plowed through to the whimpering end. Toward the end, I just wanted it to be over, and found myself skipping pages and large sections of chapters to find anything meaningful. Then of course, the denoument, if you can call it that, was unsatisfying and inconclusive and intended to sell the next book in the series. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Reading Pandora's Star was extremely disappointing for me. I very much enjoyed Peter Hamilton's previous works, so was looking forward to another great read. What I found was 758 pages of boredom. The characters were too numerous, shallow, and mostly unengaging. The plot was also severely lacking. Nothing important happens over most of the book. The action is better suited to fill a short story than two entire novels. The rest is filler that is unbelievably tedious to plow through. I was able to get through only half of the book before giving up and speed reading the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 Sub Plots and a Cast of Billions","review":"I had no idea what was going on half the time I was reading this book. Every chapter introduced yet another set of characters with yet another sub-plot. I reached the point where I was skipping 10 pages at a time and not really missing anything significant. And when I finally reached the end I almost hurled the book out the window.... what a crappy ending. This is hands down one of the worst \\"epic\\" sci-fi books I have ever read (although pared down to basics it might make a pretty good short story.) The sequel is not on my reading list..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick! Get an editor in here! We need to cut 300 pages!","review":"I own and love Peter F.Hamilton's every book up to and including the Fallen Dragon. I'm very disappointed with this one. Usually I read Mr.Hamilton's books in one sleepless marathon. This one was a two week long struggle and I had no problem falling asleep. In fact falling asleep is quite easy with this book. It's full of boring filler. It seems the success of the author's earlier books enables him to bypass the editors and common sense. This book could have been great if about 300 of its 760 pages had been left out. Or it could have stayed the same size and contained the whole story and not end with a cheap, abrupt cliff-hanger.I give one star for ruining a book that could have been great. I will not buy any additional books in this series. First the author has to prove me that he can write an honest, tight book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many subplots.","review":"There are at least half-a-dozen subplots in this book, any of which could have (and should have) been a book unto itself. As it is, Pandora's Star is a disjointed narrative, flipping from one plot to another; not randomly, but annoyingly. At least two of the subplots are tedious enough that I ultimately just started skimming over those sections or skipping them entirely. Yeah, the author had a big story he wanted to tell, and it is an interesting story, but he didn't pull it off. Oh, and to end the book so bluntly just to make us have to buy his next one is just crass commercialism on his part.That's not to say that there aren't great elements in this massive story. But they are few and too far between to ultimately provide a satisfying experience. My advice, regrettably, is not to buy this book. And even if you can borrow it for free, don't bother reading it. There are far better \\"space opera\\" authors out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree With The Others: Needs Editing","review":"I'll throw my two cents in there with the rest and say that this book was just too long. It's a rare book that I start skimming certain threads and this is one of them. It finally started to pick up in the last 200 pages, but when you have to wade through 800 to 900 to get there, that is not a good thing.If it was 300-400 pages lighter, then it could be a 4-5 star book.Seems like modern fiction authors feel the need to go through this rite of passage and birth a few of these monster books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time unfortunately.","review":"I do give this book 2 stars for potential with a wonderful future universe created by the author that could of been so great, but thats where it ends. I read 900 pages of 1000 and could not go as I felt I was wasting my time. I had made it that far with hope that at one point something would grab me and I would be swept up into the story and not counting pages.From the description of the book and the reviews written about it, I was expecting high pace galactic action, wonderful characters and page turning madness... yea no. Not much action and characters who I could care less about, that second note being the biggest let down. Many characters who had potential but its almost amazing how the writer has manage to create no connection with them and the reader, I could really care less about any of them.Some positives though, I really appreciate how this book felt like it could one day happen. The writer has a good handle on contemporary science and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space opera","review":"Hamilton is a great author who walks the line between too much geek and not enough detail. The science he describes just plausible and in depth enough to satisfy the arm chair engineer in me.That said, he is verbose when it comes to setting up and introducing characters. More than 100 pages into the novel you are still meeting new characters and after 200 pages you are still trying to remember who they all are.Overall it is an enthralling read that, once under your skin, is impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too slow for me","review":"I tried, really tried, to like this book.The first time I got thru the first chapter and gave up.The second time I got almost halfway thru.Maybe there's a good story in there, I don't know. It just goes way too slow for my taste. The characters aren't particularly interesting, and the author takes forever to move the story along. I don't have that much patience.If you want space opera, go read something by Charles Stross. There's a man who can move a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill after the first 300 pages","review":"If I had been asked to rate this work after the first 300 pages, I would have been hard pressed not to award 5 stars. However, the last half was a real slog. In fact, I had to skip a 100 or so pages near the end just to say I finished it - only to find that almost nothing had been resolved after all this effort. I don't mind (and sometimes really enjoy) multi book series but not this one. An editor with a liberal red pen would have improved this book considerably."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not have been less interested","review":"Possibly the most uninteresting book I've ever tried to read. I couldn't make myself care about the characters, who were shallow and obvious. The writing was trite in the extreme.

I stayed with this book to the end despite my suspicions that what I was reading was mostly meaningless drivel that contributed nothing to the actual story. Ponderous, useless narrative, forgettable characters, and a confusing story line are just the beginning of my problems with this book. The end of the book didn't even tempt me to read a free kindle sample of the next one in the series.

If it was a library book, i would return it after some 200 pages.I liked The Reality Dysfunction -- the thickness was justified by interesting subplots. The fact that humanity had acually evolved was a nice change from most sci-fi too.This book does not stand out in any such way. It's not the worst book i've read, and i will probably read the sequel too (but not if the story doesn't end there!), but i would not have read it if i knew about the fat.Short story: buy some other book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Europa II Solar Light set only average","review":"The prior reviews on this product looked very good and the price was simply GREAT.

In two of the lamps, the batteries will not hold a charge at all. In the rest of them, so far they are only holding about a three hour charge after dark. I suspect that the batteries that are used in these are not the best. I may buy some new nicd batteries and test to see if they work better.

They simply do not produce as much light as low voltage and the color is sort of purply blue. That said, with the exception of one light not working out of the box, these lights are great! They need to get direct sunlight to work for several hours. In fact, the ones that get sunlight all day are still on when the sun comes up!

When compared to cheaper solar lights, these units are much brighter and whiter. However, in terms of performance I was dissapointed on a couple of fronts: on cloudy days the lights located in direct sunny spots did not light anywhere close to 8 hours and the ones located in partial shady spots lasted even shorter time; on rainy days the lights located in sunny spots lasted even less and were dim, whereas the ones located in partial shade did not even come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Service","review":"I bought this lights and 14 out of 15 failed.

I started thinking it was going to be a quick read because the sample was hard to put down. The authors are very descriptive and there are very little grammatical errors. But, I started to get a little bored about 60% through. The detailing started to seem drawn out and it was difficult for me to finish.

This book resolves that problem. By the time they read through it once we can at least talk together and I don't feel like I am using a foreign language.A very valuable book that should be required reading for anyone who goes into business for theirself or moves up the corporate ladder to a position where understanding these things is beneficial for their career.

The movie is not at all about DiCaprio, as I thought it may be, but there is a great line up of well informed scientists discussing quite a critical issue - the state of earth's ecohealth, and not surprisingly the report card does not give us a good grade.Due to DiCaprio's role as narrator it should be a documentary received by a wide audience and is a must see. I think (or wish) it was a must see for all and not just environmentally oriented minds as they are already aware of the concerns expressed in this DVD - it is the ones not aware that we need to get onboard and this DVD will certainly be one such vehicle to gain access to a potentially new crowd.Hats off for doing this - more of its kind are needed to reach new crowds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing doumentary!

They have two versions tailored for churches, one for wildlife organizations and a general version. \\"The 11th Hour\\" is a hard hitting video. The first 2/3rds left me believing we are all screwed.

Probably there is no hope now of avoiding catastrophe for our species (although the rich will have their islands for a long time), if not extinction (hey, wait till malaria moves north), but it is a call to arms for some help. Only the temporarily insane can look at this world and think 1. it's okay, we're doing fine, 2. we need to make as many babies as we can (although the film doesn't really address this, it is implied that the 'every sperm should hit an egg' types are half a bubble or more out of plumb), 3. we're an intelligent species overall, 4. the (existing) kids are all right, 5 we are well governed but it would be better if those tree huggers were all dead (more guns to kill them with) and Sarah Palin was world empress.

The keys on the PalmOne 3169WW are just small enough, and just non-standard enough that I have to concentrate on how I am typing, rather than on *what* I am typing. My fingers are squeezed together, I keep hitting the hinge instead of the space bar, and I keep hitting \\"scroll up\\" where the question mark key normally is.The 3169WW is technically a keyboard, and my words per minute are certainly faster than drawing graffitti.

I wouldn't want to write the great American novel with it, but for note-taking at meetings and email-correspondance it's fine (better than I expected for something that folds into such a compact size).* The driver headaches that earlier reviewers described sound horrible. And Palm support is... well, do they even have tech support? But, I didn't have any problems. I ignored the instructions on the box (which don't list the Palm TX yet), downloaded the most recent driver from the Palm site, and it worked with my new Palm TX without any trouble at all.* Ultimately, between the Palm TX, this keyboard, and my bluetooth-enabled mobile phone I end up with a net-capable setup that I can carry in my pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this rubbish?","review":"This keyboard is a totally unstable design, you cannot use on your knee or anything moving, otherwise the Handset will topple over.

But it doesn't secure the handheld into position very well. The little support bar that the handheld is supposed to rest on continually retracts, causing the handheld to fall out of place. I have to keep the handheld in place with a strong rubber band--and even then it can shift around. Also, the arm that houses the infrared (IR) sensor keeps going out of alignment with the IR sensor/transmitter on the handheld.One nit: I wish Palm would've called it an IR Keyboard. Technically, the product is indeed wireless. But folks today generally associate the word \\"wireless\\" with Bluetooth or WiFi, which implies that you don't have to strap-in your handheld and make sure the IR sensors are aligned. Sure, IR has an advantage over \\"wired\\" keyboards in that you can use it (kinda) with a wide variety of handhelds.

The bottom of the Treo is rounded. The support on the keyboard is flat with no sides, so the least jiggle causes the PDA to fall off, not a good idea with a $500-$600 device. Could not get the screen to rotate sideways, so lying it on its side was not an option. You would not be able to use this easily on an airplan, in a car or any place without a table. Because it uses an IR, the PDA must be placed on the keyboard. A docking port or blue tooth are much better designs because the device is either connected and held in place or the keyboard can be used on your lap and the device can be placed on a flat surface.

When you press a key there is often no response. I found this to be particularly the case if you just finish typing a sentence and pause for a couple of seconds. It seems to work fine if you don't pause (provided you get it to work). The space key and the shift key (as well as some letters such as \\"a\\") are particularly prone to this problem. After a brief pause sometimes I have to hit the space key 5-6 times to activate it.I read a review by someone else who has the same problem with another keyboard.

Some of the things like quotation marks are not laid out like the real thing, and this is where I take off a star in the rating.Otherwise, it does work very well. I don't see it as particularly flimsy. Is it built like a tank? No, but it's not flimsy.

After using it for few days, I have to waste more and more time to switch the driver on and off to get the two devices connected. Recently it even caused an unexpected hard reset on my PDA and wiped out all the data on it. It took hours to restore everything back online.Unless Palm Inc. provides a update of driver to fix this problem completely, I highly suggest NOT to buy it. It's not worth your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time keyboard","review":"Perhaps if I had loads of time to fiddle with it, I could get this keyboard to work reliably. But since I'm someone who would rather plug and play and work, so far it looks like a waste of money. I cannot get the keyboard to connect reliably to my Palm T|X. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and I can't make rhyme nor reason as to why. Maybe if I spent a few hours on some discussion group or tried a customer service hotline to India and stayed on hold for a day or two. At any rate, I can't recommend it unless you just love to tinker and search the discussion groups for esoteric fixes for software and hardware that should work out of the box, especially for the prices demanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful gadget from olden days","review":"I've had one of these for years, but haven't been able to use it since my last Palm PDA died.

I actually rate \\"5-7-0-5\\" as one of the weaker tunes on the CD, which should give some indication of the quality. I think the reason they never caught on was because they WERE so versatile - you could never pigeonhole them. For my taste, the successful band which most closely reflects their eclectic versatility (and was reasonably contemporary with City Boy) are Toto. Able to go from a gentle ballad full of lush strings and beautiful harmonies to an out-and-out rocker in one album track!For those who want to know what became of the band after they called it a day: several of them teamed up with \\"Mutt\\" Langer once again to form the nucleus of the band that backed Jake and Elroy Blues in \\"The Blues Brothers\\".

One song sounds like Springsteen doing E.L.O.-- the next makes you dream of an alternate dimension where The Doobie Brothers play 10CC.

They show Morrisey much the romantic that is not readily evident on his music. Too, his selection of Directors is quite noteworthy. Unlike the modern glamourboy images so prevelent on MTV, Morrisey looks very common as his followers.

These are some of the obvious questions this book overlooks. There's more. The picture of the future is interesting, but foolishly described. The flow of the book is sporadic and I get the feeling the author isn't well versed in biology or genetics to give compelling details of the books creations.

For me, this is that solution. I have used this lens extensively on my KM5D and find it to be quite usable. Yes, it is a megazoom. Yes, it has problems, but these are compensated for the sheer convenience. I find the lens to be rather sharp and colors to be quite nice as well. The price is certainly reasonable and the build quality is quite good (i.e. metal mount). I highly reccomed this lens, but be aware that it is not \\"G\\" (or \\"L\\" for you Canon folks) glass. Once you get by that, you can appreciate the lens for what it is. I highly reccomend the PTlens plugin for photoshop to use with this lens to correct distortions, vignetting, etc. Highly reccomended!Here's a nice shot I took with this lens while vacationing in Northern California.http://images14.fotki.com/v21/photos/8/896360/3774403/sfb3sm-vi.jpg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great lens... for the short time it lasted","review":"Loved this lens when it worked... however now, only one year later, this lens doesn't work!

In low light at full zoom it focuses well in bright to good light. Considering it's zoom range it produces excellent picture quality. Always stop down to f8 or f11 outdoors and you will be amazed at the quality. Macro performance is good with a close focus of 17 inches so you can capture large flowers and even larger butterfly's.

I took a least four shots each leg using a D90 and all of the shots turned great. All of them could be used by the school. If it continues to perform, that $250 saving really looks good.

These are great lenses but I was trying to hold down the bulk and weight, so I gave Sigma a try.Big mistake. This thing is TERRIBLE. Horrible chromatic distortion -- I frequently got BOTH purple and green fringing effects on opposite sides. Depending on the zoom and the angle I was shooting at, I got laughably distorted barrel and pincushioning -- sometimes in THE SAME SHOT. Literally, the extreme barrel distortion would flare back out at the corners. And it won't focus properly -- the center will be fairly crisp but the edges will be completely gone -- not the far edges either, but a mere third of the way across the frame. It vignettes really badly.This is a CRAPPY, CRAPPY lens.

I was kinda looking at 50-300 lenses but I felt like I'd hate to have to keep switching lenses since I usually take pictures on the go in the outdoors. I shopped around a bit then picked this one and I just love it. From what I can tell the picture quality is pretty good and I just love the general feel of the lens.

With sufficient optical quality, mount it on your little Rebel camera, it beats the point and shoot camera at any time and even at similar cost in a sense.One think I want to point out is that the lens does auto focus at f6.3, at least on XTI, T3i and 7D which I tested. In most cases, f5.6 is the limit, but somehow this one works at f6.3. I don't know why.Get this lens, and add a 50 or 85 prime.

This happened approximately 15-20 times in an eighteen day period. Also, the lens developed numerous spots. In handlind the lens while on the camera I either put the lenscap back on, or cupped my hand over the lens to prevent burning, and was in a very dry area.

For those of you who are not familiar with Phoenix it is a desert here. Never a lack of sunshine no matter what the season is. With that in mind I never have my shutter speed below 1/250. For a while I thought it was my camera hinting to me that it was time for an upgrade. I then tested my camera with my crap kit lens 18-55mm.

However, after trying out the lens for one event, I had to return it due to it's very disappointing quality. Zoomed in, the pixels look muddled, and at times, the shadows look... choppy. I don't know the best way to explain it. If it helps at all, my camera is a Nikon D300s. I have never seen the type of results this lens produced from any other images/lenses.I've learned my lesson.

Instead, the content is mainly a description of scheduled cyclo-tourist events on these courses with the only route detail being a single page map of the courses which offers no route markings or numbers. The only way to find the actual course would be to overlay the book maps onto real Michelin maps and hope you could duplicate the route.I think a better way to find the Tour of Flanders route (for example) would be to take a good map into local racing shops and ask for help.

As a Wolverine fan, I couldn't wait to read \\"Origin\\", by Paul Jenkins. This was a great book and it had shed some light on Wolverine's dark and mysterious past. I couldn't wait to read, \\"The End\\" as a result. However, this book seemed to be written by a different writer. It had none of the good, solid story telling as the first and little to no strong characters. It was a very big disappointment from \\"Origin\\".

The ending is awful, totally anti-climatic and without meaning. The great contribution to Wolverine as a character is finding out he has a brother and the secret the specter of Xavier makes vague reference to. To make it all even worse, the promise of \\"the end\\" isn't even fulfilled. Very, very poor.

I don't consider myself an expert in writing, but as far as art goes, I know my share, and this is probalby one of the least moving art layouts used to sell logans story and reviewed well. (I'm discluding some of the real old bootleg ones with some scary and lame art of Logan)Anyway, the story is based on the plot from Origins (one of my favorites) and it seems like there is no support in the story line! Its just so farfetched and obsurd. The character of Wolverine isn't represented well either. It has some good classing Logan one liners, but they aren't anything I would put on a bumbersticker. I would have given this 1 star, but I still love Marvel, and more so Wolverine. Why did I ever read this../wheep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the middle years","review":"Leaping from the alpha of Logan's life to the omega, Paul Jenkins (of questionable \\"Origin\\" fame) decided to use Marvel's \\"The End\\" series (a sort of \\"how did they die\\"/What If? occasional series) to cap Wolverine's life and, in the process, further seal the hero's storyline. Logan is now old, having outlived his X-friends by a century or so; his mutant healing factor is starting to fail but he continues to seek the answers to his identity that we regretfully learned in Jenkins' previous outing. Suddenly, Wolverine has a brother who knows all the answers and teases Logan with them -- but only if he assists in a scheme to wreak havoc on humankind. Ugh.Coupled this time with muddy, unexciting art by Claudio Castellini, \\"The End\\" seems to say that Logan's life must both begin and end with a fizzle.

I actually like the idea of an old Logan, following his final years, but this publication is simply not up too par. The story (picking up the \\"Origin\\" trail) is, too put it bluntly, bad. The amount of actual information given about Wolverine is next to nothing, no explanations are given, no insights. The plot is very weak and boring, bringing in a two-dimensional main antagonist in the shape of Logans brother and generally following a far too well known pattern.The artwork is not the best I've seen, yet I don't find it as bad as many other reviewers seem to.There's nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing plausible, nothing.

The genre is along the lines of Christian (strong emphasis on the Christian) pop/rock. The singer (Dustin Ruth) has a great voice and seems to have passion for what he does. The band definitely has talent, and the songs are quite catchy. I took half of a star away from my final score because some of the lyrics are a bit bland at times and could have been improved upon (though this is not too detrimental a problem). I took the other half of a star away because a little after half-way through the album, the songs start to slow down and seem kind of repetitive. Still, Ruth has created a debut album that is worth looking into, particularly if you are looking for Christian-based, uplifting pop/rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing Debut Album","review":"Ruth brings an honest and genuine sound to the table. They are a new and upcoming band that will most certainly succeed in the future. Dustin Ruth, the band's lead singer, came from an environment of adversity and expresses himself through their lyrics and that combined with his and the band's musical talent create a killer combination coming to your ears. Their songs while catchy, still maintain the quality of rock, but stay in your head all day. I look forward to future releases from Ruth and hope to see them live some day.

I was very excited to find them on Amazon. I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale. I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open. I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips. They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude. The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier. Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now? I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season. Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"great product but stop raising the price...","review":"I like these chips a lot.

However, like most everything else here on amazon as of late, the prices are going up and up and up.I was paying 23.20 for subscribe and save...now it's about 26.50. Soon, these chips will be as much as getting them in the store and that is a shame.I have been a very loyal amazon prime member for some time.

Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad).

Anyone who is a member of AA will see right through her and know that glamorizing her addictions shows she has a long way to go find serenity, humility, and acceptance of her addictions. It becomes clear she doesn't actually like anyone unless she's high, drunk and horny. She's not an endearing drunk or a decent storyteller. She's mean-spirited, prejudiced self-centered and worst of all, not funny.I saw her yesterday on the Bill Maher show and she hasn't changed from her addiction racked personality.

The main character, a woman, screws a random guy on a one-night stand. She drinks. She screws some more men. She drinks some more. The resolution? In a tantrum because the guy she picked for the one-night stand of the moment has had so much cocaine he can't get an erection, she decides she's going to \\"take a break\\" from casual sex and hunt for a husband. Fifties throwback much? Ick.I kept thinking there was some emergence story coming out of this, as in stuff like, \\"Crank\\" and the other Hopkins' books, or even a struggle story. No such luck.

The language used is really basic and there's nothing really happening besides the girls sexual innuendos that are also explained on the level of a 16 yo teen experimenting with life. Nothing you'll read is any different to what you'd have heard many times before from your friends if you're not a complete prude. And as with Tucker you'll constantly have that feeling that many things were made up just so that \\"different\\" experiences could be put in the book.I guess the book might be interesting to people with very conservative approach to sexuality as it might speak to them on situations they didn't encounter, but it is so poorly done they'd be better off watching some erotic movies or porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"I read this book in a couple of hours.

It is hands down the most lateral book I've ever read; no beginning, middle or end but most of all absolutely no climax. Boring.Yes, true to her comedic-ways, there were several funny lines but most of the writing seemed forced and a pathetic attempt at trying to be hilarious. Her stories were more pathetic than anything and the characters lacked depth. Her tangents were nonsensical and left me wondering whether her book was even read by publishers or simply put to press because she's achieved some level of fame.I'm kinda pissed I wasted money on this book... 2 stars is pretty generous - I'd give it a 1.25 max."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploits Not Funny","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

I guess the words that come to mind: sad, pathetic,lonely...What I thought was going to be humorous and maybe occasionally edgy turned out to be incredibly offensive and disgusting. I found myself incredibly grateful for my sobriety after reading this book. If it did anything, it served as a reminder of how life can be really meaningless and lonely to some.

Definitely a few funny moments, especially the last 3 pages, but not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the redemption?","review":"There is one thing that all memoirs should have... redemption. Or at least be so funny that it doesn't matter. This fell so far from the mark of being a good memoir. It was just - sad. I would have loved to see her end up in rehab and maybe married to someone with no sexually transmitted diseases. It was like *giggle* a story *giggle* about this *giggle* little girl *giggle* in this grown up *giggle* body - that drank entirely too much (and *giggle* thought it was funny), would find the nearest guy and go screw - maybe if his penis wasn't too big or small or whatever other problems the author seemed to have.

But it hurts me to realize the Chelsea Handler generation is so tame. As a boomer, I lived the Boomer Bacchanal of the 1970s on the front lines of the sexual revolution. It was a decade when the largest clump of twenty-somethings lost their innocence after failed first marriages and had nothing to lose thanks to birth control and antibiotics. I realize the environment changed with AIDs and Ted Bundy in the 1980s.

Some of the chapters remind me of papers I would have gotten a bad grade on in high school. The author meanders around topics to fit her jokes in, and maybe needs an editor or co-author who can help with the writing part of it.My other problem with it is... Well sure, it's trashy, I knew that going in. But it's not sexy. These experiences sound gross and embarrassing and not even a little fun. Does Chelsea like sex, or just notching the bedpost? Many of the stories are not about having sex, but about waking up not sure if she had sex, or about coming to her senses and leaving before having sex. Maybe that's part of the joke. Because this book was controversial for being about a woman who has a lot of sex. But Chelsea's life seems to be \\"horizontal\\" because she passed out drinking most of the time. Did anybody else notice how much drunk driving the girl must have done?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"I thought I would like this book more but it was just ok for me. I won't say I did not laugh at all at any of it but most of it I just didn't. I think she was trying to hard to be funny in most of the book and it just came across like she was a drunken slut. I am not trying to judge her but the whole book is about sleeping with men (a lot of men) and drinking. Yes I read what the book was about but I still read it because it was supposed to be funny. A lot of readers did find it very funny tho and that is great we just have different taste on what humor is but I won't be buying anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh?","review":"Sigh,Chelsea isn't a terrible writer, her comedic pen is pretty good, but yeah....I guess reading about drinking until your wasted enough to take a stranger home just didn't hold my attention after the umpteenth hook up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun From a Distance.","review":"I purchased this because it was recently on sale and I'd been tempted to purchase other books by the author. For whatever reason, I don't watch Chelsea Lately, but I find her funny. When reading autobiographical stuff, I often ask myself if I'd like to hang out with the author.In this case, no.I would have loved to be friends with her while I was in my twenties though. She's fun to read about from a distance and has a lot of crazy, probably only slightly true, anecdotes and I laughed a fair amount. Enough that I purchased and readLies that Chelsea Handler Told Me (A Chelsea Handler Book/Borderline Amazing Publishing)and I'm listening to the audiobook version ofAre You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost my interest fast","review":"stories hopped around alot.

To my mind there was little humor either, unless you find the words \\"large penis\\" funny, apparently a recurring theme for Ms. Handler. Mildly amusing might be a better description for this tome. Unfortunately, it was written at about a fifth grade level. It has been edited well, so far as grammar is concerned; and that is about the best thing I can say about it. Ms. Handler drinks a lot. She has sex a lot. She does not seem to be terribly nice. Her show is often much funnier than this book. If you want to read a funny semi-tell all, read \\"Running With Sissors\\", and skip this one. I am sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recomend.","review":"Disclaimer: I'm a dude.This book was somewhat funny, uh thats about all there is to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"she's a comedian?","review":"I ordered this book because I read the reviews, and it was described as the female version of Tucker Max's \\"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell\\". I thought that book was obnoxious and absolutely hysterical. I was hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately, I didn't think she was nearly as funny as he is. It was a quick read and kept my attention most of the time, but the stories were sub-par at best.I didn't laugh out loud. I thought some stories sounded too far fetched and made up- whether they are actually true or not, I'm left wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!!","review":"This is the funniest book Ive ever read.

I finished this book really quickly, I never wanted to put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone with a good sense of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life of a Bicycle","review":"There are many things that Miss Handler and I have in common: the love of alcohol, the love of pills, the love of mixing said alcohol with said pills, and the propensity to make morally questionable decisions whilst under the influence. I will say I loved her second book far more than this one (there were even some points where I found this book a little depressing. Desperado is right). But anyone who mistakenly hooks up with a sombrero-wearing midget, who was passing out chips and salsa at a party the night before, is still a hero in my books."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY!!!","review":"I LOVED this book. I was laughing out loud! Better than \\"Are You There Vodka? It's me Chelsea.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Chelsea at her best","review":"Chelsea handler is a freaking genius. Her stories are real and hilarious. This book clearly showcases her humor in a whole new light. Instead of seeing her from a television viewpoint, the reader gets to see Chelsea in her true sense.

Now i'm looking forward to the next book. It's a great book if you want some fun in an all too hectic life we live... It's like drinking a few too many margaritas and enjoying each one without a headache the next morning... it's funny and witty and a great read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I waited forever for this book and it got such high reviews, but its not even funny and i feel like i'm forcing myself to read it because i waited so long for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, pointless, not funny","review":"I expected something akin to Sex and the City in book form but was sorely disappointed. This book is not intelligently written. The vocabulary range, idea/interest originality and depth, and writing style are about equal to a 12-year-old's. And it's not funny, though it approaches a sexually tinged equivalent of infantile slapstick."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugg","review":"This book was picked for my book club. I could not even get more than a few chapters in. Maybe I'm too much of a prude, but the stories seemed so unreal, over the top, and stereotypical.

Chelsea's recap of her hilarious run in's with random guys is great. I've even taken the book to work with me to hide and read it because I couldn't wait till i came home to finish it. Its an easy read and will make you laugh out loud I highly recommend it to any Chelsea Handler fan or even if your a fan of Sex and the City. I can't wait to get her second book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"This book is hilarious! It had me laughing out loud the entire time.

It's a fast read and quite funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy about a girl's perspective","review":"A friend showed me this book the other day and after reading the blurb on the back I was curious. I got hold of the audio book version. One review said mentioned its content had shock value. I'm still waiting for the shocking parts. The book is fun, but hardly shocking. Maybe because I write erotica? The book is more funny and frank than sexy.The opener is a story from her childhood with her sister \\"Sloan.\\" Each chapter is a story from her various conquests or lack thereof. I like her style of story telling and there are a few reoccurring characters that keep the flow going. They are a progression of her life starting from her teen years. It's a fun book and each chapter/story is funny and can stand on its own. If you're looking for a funny version of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" this is your thing if you're looking for a sex filled book of erotic stories you'd be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chelsea","review":"Great book.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I laughed aloud a couple times. Easy to read in an afternoon, but not quite as memorable as other memoirists.David Sedaris, who writes memoirs is the master. And If you like knarly memoir humor, Laurie Notaro is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable leisure reading","review":"If you like Chelsea Handler, you will love this book. It is a very entertaining story of her love interests over the years. I thought it was funny and it read quickly. I think it is one of the best books she's written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"I wanted to like this book. I wanted to read a story about a strong, confident woman who is not afraid to be open about her healthy and active sex life. I was looking for something along the lines of Sex and the City.This story is not about healthy one night encounters with quirky men. Instead it is about dangerous, very drunken one night stands. Even the \\"friends\\" she writes about are pretty nasty people. I'm sure the people in the book were written in a poor light in order to make the book funnier but, instead, it makes you thankful that this isn't your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $","review":"This book was wat too short and dissappointing. It also ended abruptly. Dont waste your $ too."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"I chose this book to improve on my English, ha-ha... I was sure it will be written in an easy, comprehensible language and I was right. However, the book itself... hmm... if most of us had nothing to do we could write even a better one about our horizontal life ;)Choose this book if you want to read just for readings sake, if you are tired after work and just want to relax..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable light reading","review":"This was an enjoyable book to read. My only complaint is that some of the stories aren't believable because of how perfectly neat and cute the events and characters in her chapters tie together. I am guessing the author fictionized minor details or did character/time composites to make a better story which is fine when you have to make a joke work or give more meaning to certain events. I just think this writing tactic might have been used a few times too often. You'll see what I mean if you read this book, but it really does not detract from the overall quality which is definitely a fun read you'll want to share with your girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo funny! I just love this girl!","review":"After watching a few episodes of Girls Behaving Badly and The Chelsea handler Show....I thought..\\"I love this girl and the way she expresses herself with no shame.\\" I rarely ever read but I was so eager to get her book. So I ran to the bookstore to get a copy of her book and I finished the whole thing in a day. It was absolutely hilarious and I'm so happy I bought it. I reccomend this book to anyone who dosen't get offended too eaisly and just wants a good laugh. I love her wit and way of thinking and I'm really hoping she will write another one soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader","review":"This is my first read of Chelsea handler.

Onto her next book. I hope Chelsea keeps writing books for all to enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"TMI","review":"There are some funny bits, but after a while it gets tedious. I kept getting that awkward feeling I get when I'm around an good friend when they are drunk and making an ass of themselves. It's only sort of funny at first and then you just want them to go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"NotMyChoice","review":"Absolutely an outstanding first chapter, full of humor and laughs. That's where it ends. The rest is all about a drunk slut who had no more sense about what's right and wrong. It wasn't even a good \\"X\\" rated version. Wouldn't be worth it even if it were free."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt at humor","review":"I bought this book hoping to be entertained. It has been three weeks since I read it and am having problems recalling anything from this book except for the fact I think I cracked a smile probably three times. Overall completely unfunny, and totally forgettable. A single pane of Dilbert is funnier and has more to say than this entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handler is one lucky train wreck","review":"Handler is a train wreck who doesn't know when to stop sharing/lying, although her willingness to take risks and make fun of herself is a key factor in her persona and her success. I'm guessing being the youngest of six kids had a lot to do with it. Like most creative twenty-somethings for whom college and/or traditional employment isn't the obvious choice, it takes her a while to figure out her personal path. I was disappointed by the book, probably because it was so well hyped, and with the exception of a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, I expected it to be funnier than it was. Although I do enjoy Handler as a comedienne, and I would have loved seeing her in the green M&M costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I almost never write a review but felt compelled after reading this absolute waste of time book. I paid 1.99 and believe it or not, that was too much. Who the heck are those people writing decent reviews, her friends?

I HATED this book.She should have called it \\"How to be a Ho.\\" Her other book \\"Are you there, Vodka? It's me, Chelsea.\\" had a few stories of her sexcapades, but at least it wasn't page, after page, after page, of all of the guys she's slept with. I could barely finish reading it, half way through I just started skimming the chapters and realized that if did take the time to read it cover to cover, I would have wasted a few hours of my life that I was never going to get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, girl","review":"This book is only what it says it is-a collection of the stories of one night stands. It is not wry, sarcastic, insightful, and the most it is not is funny. Not humorous at all. I was expecting so much more, got it to read aloud on a road trip. Ordered it from Amazon, when it came I started and completed reading it at my dining table, it is a fast read and that is all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sense of Self","review":"I like to watch Chelsea's show, and she has a wry sense of humor; however, the way she conducted herself as a young woman is both frightening and sad. The thought of two underage women constantly drunk and inviting Godess knows whom into their beds, including criminals and absolute undesirables, wreaks of low self esteem, lack of self respect and no boundaries. I have to wonder if young women know they are putting themselves in danger when they get drunk and go home with strangers?? Not to mention diseases???? This lifestyle is not healthy. Think before you leap or read! I don't recommend this book to young women, who may be influenced to behave in unhealthy ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably Tedious","review":"Hmmm, she must've slept with all the people who wrote the glowing reviews, too. Maybe that'll be her next terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All glib and no meat","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. But it's so shallow and just reads like a laundry list of awful men she's climbed into bed with. No self-examination, no growth, just mindless drinking and low self-esteem on parade. The only shocking thing in the book is her descriptopn of her racist putz of a father. A waste of time & money. I bought this book based on all the rave reviews on Amazon, but now I have to conclude they must have been written by her pals, because they are far off the mark. For a reality check, read the Publisher's Weekly review above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horizontal Crap!!!!","review":"I honestly kept reading this book hoping it would get better. It did not. I was waiting for some dirt and nothing happened. It was more of a rambling crap fest. I know people that sleep around and the stories they tell are much better than this. I really didn\`t care about the part where the doctor was gay. It didn\`t shock me at all. I\`ve heard worse. Some people just want to write books because they are famous...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Crap","review":"This book is trashy, vulgar, obscene and gross! I bought it by accident and because it cost me $5, I read the stupid thing. It was extremely bad writing; this is coming from a writer herself.

I am really displeased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible& Boring Book","review":"I found this book rather shallow and boring.

It's compilations of one night stands by a comedian. Duh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for general reading","review":"I was SO excited to receive this book because I love watching Chelsea's TV show. I would recommend this book ONLY for people who have a sense or humor and someone who just wants to read for fun. This book is full of stories and they range from chapter to chapter. (Some are more extreme than others). Some of the stories I can't help but question whether they're true or AT LEAST have some sort of twist on them. I think I must have read this book in 4 days and was a VERY easy read- almost boring at the end. Eventually, I'll probably end up buying her other book \\"Are You There Vodka, It's Me Chelsea?\\" but I'm in no rush. Overall, OK for a time-passing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me laugh","review":"I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. My life is and has always been boring and when I read I live my life through theirs and I have to tell you this was fun.

The stories that Chelsea recounts are very well told and are so humorous. Some of the things that happen to her are so happenstance that I can't help but question if they are embellished. I love that she is a compulsive liar when she drinks; the made-up stories she tells the men she meets are beyond hilarious. And the encounter with the midget is priceless.

This trashy collection of sexual experiences reveals a few genuinely humorous spots, but to me screams out that this gal has addictions to booze, drugs and, oh, yeah...sex. What she didn't get from her lax, anti-moralistic parents has her jobless, running from man to man, drinking and drugging (and DRIVING while in this condition), and seemingly confused and without goals. Harsh in her judgement of others, she has no room to criticize, when her sexual conquests far outnumber her overall IQ. She often tries too hard to be funny, and winds up just sounding extremely pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"You've got to be kidding. For someone to even think of writing on this topic is bad enough ... but for others to want to read about it. Pretty pathetic. There is plenty else worthwhile and edifying to read; I suggest finding that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"Boring at times. The story doesn't flow well.

I didn't expect Sedaris or Christopher Moore funny, but at least a little funny. Normally, I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to humor. This wasn't a funny book. It turned out to be a book about how to seek perfection in shallow. Her sexploits weren't even book worthy. And the drinking seemed pointless, except to mask her self-loathing. Can't blame her for being self-loathing. I loved the stories about her dad, thus two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Book ever","review":"I had to knock one star off because the book was way smaller than I thought it would be. I read it in entirety in about 3 hours. Kind of selfish but her writing leaves you wanting more. But that being said it's a very quick read sure to make you laugh out loud.

WTF people? I can't even tell you how dull and offensive this book is. I don't mind edgy literature, but this is just one boring pile of garbage. There is nothing smart or creative in this book. It's filled with generic story lines and terrible writing. I did not relate to the character in this book nor did I like her. She comes across with no awareness of self.

The first few chapters were interesting, but after a while it was the same thing over again and it got really boring. I wouldn't say it's an intellectual read at all, and might border on romance novel with some bed comic relief. My girlfriend also read it and couldn't put it down, so maybe it's for girls. I wouldn't advise buying it, just get it at the library if you really want to, but I wouldn't say it's a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOTT MESS","review":"Watch out Chris Rock.....You have some competition because Chelsea Handler is showing the world that she is funny...funny...funny....Who cares if she has slept around......It's her business. But, I look at this book as a cautionary tale and young women everywhere can learn from her. You are probably not going to find love on a one-night stand....you might even lose your dignity, but you'll never lose your sense of humor...and isn't that what it is really all about? Not taking ourselves so seriously....."},{"rating":"1","title":"decieved by 5 star ratings...this book is horrible","review":"i was interested in a light comical read and what i got was this poorly written collection of nasty conquests. she argues the importance of sex when getting to know someone, then takes a dump on her point by describing all her messy drunken sexual feats with nameless trashy men. what important things did she larn about these men other than to give them idiotic nicknames and barely remember half of the sex she supposedly had? none of the sex is even recounted in all its filthy glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad....","review":"I bought this book to read over my spring break (I\\"m a teacher). I thought a good, light, funny - slightly on the naughty side book would be a good distraction. This book made me sad. If these stories are really true - poor Chelsea. If they are lies - poor Chelsea. To write a book about someone who spends so much of their time drinking, doing drugs and having sex with any man she finds hot - sorry - not my cup of tea. I am very accepting of alternative lifestyles and people doing what they need to do to be happy. I just found this book to be a story about a very sad, angry individual who engages in some pretty high risk behaviors. I'm surprised she has survived these experiences without getting raped, seriously hurt or diseased. High risk behavior is not something to promote - nor make fun of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny ...","review":"It's funny!

She has no respect for herself or others. Dont waste your money on this book. she is disgusting going to bed with so many different guys she didnt care how old they were.

What I hated most about this book was a lack of seeing inside the soul of the writer.

Worse NOT FUNNY, kind of sad actually"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrring.","review":"Okay, Chelsea, so you've done all these wild things. So what? You've made it BORING to read about.

Worth every dime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"I read this book only because it was like passing by a horrific traffic accident and having to see the carnage.

Although she is funny on her show and stand up gigs, this book reeks alcohol and Chlamydia from cover to cover. I wonder if she ever has caught any STD?? ,because one can not party that hard without any consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This was the second book of Chelsea Handler's that I read and it is probably a good thing I read it second. While I found this memoir to be witty and entertaining, I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea. I expected more hilarity from a book based on Handler's lifetime experience with one-night stands. I also expected more pizazz, which I didn't get.Again, it was witty and entertaining. If you are a die-hard fan, definitely read it. If you are looking for a great memoir to read, I would probably skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Is it a bad thing when you start reading Chelsea Handler's My Horizontal Life and realize you could have been her co-author?Very funny.

That's pretty much what kept me going to finish it. And I gave it a good rating because of that since not many authors can be so open about their sexuality and funny at the same time, especially realizing their mistakes.The reason I didn't give it a 5th star -- the lying. I mean it's all fun and games 'til you realize lying is not gonna work -- then you *should* cut back a little. Sure the lying had a lot to do with the hilarity factor, but in the end, it didn't help with the desired effect.I loved the midget story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like listening to your outrageous friend!","review":"I loved this book, it was hard to put down, so I read it all in one night. I purchased the paperback from Borders (I had a coupon) and I was not dissappointed with my purchase. The book has a total of 213 pages and it just reminded me of my very outrageous friends. They just know how to tell you a story that will just crack you up!

I tell you she is one special person <hahaha>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and comedy","review":"After reading this, I'll never see Handler on TV again without thinking about some of the horrible situations she has found herself in. Still, I love reading books about other people's sex lives, especially women. I am now reading Abby Lee's Diary of a Sex Fiend: Girl with a One Track Mind. It's also sexy and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's here it for Chelsea Handler!","review":"While I am a fan of Chelsea's stand up I found reading it and hearing it in the voice of hers I'm familiar with even more entertaining. Not all the jokes I've heard live on her show have the kind of punch that the material in this laugh out loud book does. It's a great book if you want to have a really good time and also have the freedom to put it down after each chapter/story. You can use this book as your light pick me up reading between deeper, darker, heavier reading.Just so we're clear this book will teach you nothing about sex. It is in no way \\"erotic\\". Chelsea is merely offering up her sex life as comic material that is truly unique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gross","review":"how has this awful , meritless, currently fat, and generally snarky unpleasant THING entered our world? please make it stop. go buy a Grace Kelly book and wonder? okay?

Occasionally, there was a clever sentence or paragraph but those were few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Chelsea Handler's show. She's funny, and there are usually equally funny comedians guest-starring.Her sense of humor didn't translate into the book. I can't remember laughing once, or even smiling. As for the book being about one-night stands, she seemed fairly conservative about what she included - which is at odds with her typical style - and while the title suggests a lot of sleeping around, most of the sexual encounters she detailed didn't end with intercourse. I'm not saying I expected a play-by-play or anything, but her life has hardly been horizontal.I guess what I'm trying to say is, the book makes for a semi-interesting memoir, but it isn't about a series of one-night stands. And in my opinion, it isn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was LAME!","review":"First, let me say I like what she does on GBB, but, man, she cannot write at all.

Maybe they, having enjoyed living vicariously through the author, have the book all the five star reviews that boosted its score.I for one have found Chelsea's adventures neither funny nor titillating, and , since there is no dept whatsoever to this collection of vignettes , I consider the book to have no redeeming value .She gets 2 stars based on looks alone. Yes , after reading her sophomoric stammering sexual stories , I feel I am entitled to make a sexist statement myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring memoir with faint touches of humor","review":"On TV, Chelsea Handler can be funny, but it doesn't carry over into this book. Mostly about one-night stands that feel highly embellished to appear humorous except they really aren't. Comedy based on self-centeredness, fuelled by alcohol, doesn't appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a good time...","review":"I have a pretty racy sense of humor but I found this book to be, well....really sad. Its just a bunch of stories about a drunk girl having sex with random guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I can't believe that so many people actually enjoyed reading this book! The only thing positive that I can say is that she is very smart to use this title. It was very misleading and I am sure a lot of people picked up the book expecting something racier.The book is more about mocking men's physical traits than it is about one night stands. If you really insist on buying your own copy, I'm putting mine up for sale. Maybe I can make my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"Skip this book. First of all, it's poorly written. Her stories take off on too many tangents. Secondly, after a while, I grew annoyed that each story was just about the same thing, over and over again. No growth, just one sloppy, drunk night after another with questionable men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously mislead by the good reviews and little snippets","review":"The book was at times funny, but mainly a disappointment. I somehow missed the fact that this book was written by a comedian. Hence, every line of the book was an attempt to be funny. The added fact that the stories are told from an admitted compulsive liar and alcoholic didn't enhance the appeal much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wear your depends while reading","review":"Once again, Chelsea did not dissapoint in this book detailing all of her ups and downs (well, mostly downs) in her sex life. I have not laughed this hard while reading in a long time, at one point during her reference to the midget I nearly wet myself.If you want funny and crude humor then this is definatly a book you should read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as funny as I expected","review":"This book really is more of a story about her life, which I enjoyed reading. Of course there were some funny parts, but it's mainly about the problems she's had with men. I would still recommend it if you're a big fan of her like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"Not a good read. Not enough substance to any one story. I didn't even finish reading it because I was so bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"If you into description of drinking, sex, and drugs, it would be fine. I did not care much for it. And I'm not a prude either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I am a huge fan of Chelsea Handler from her Chelsea Lately show on TV.

I have rarely ever laughed this hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Funny","review":"Before reading this book I had read Chelsea Chelsea, Bang Bang. I wasn't very impressed and was half apprehensive to read this one. I'm so glad that I did! Throughout its entirety I couldn't help laughing out loud almost every page. (A real feat since I don't normally laugh out loud reading) I was entertained the whole book at the end wished the escapades continued. I have a whole new love for Chelsea Handler and look forward to reading more of her anecdotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wicked laughter fest!","review":"If you're looking for something that is going to make you giggle like an oversexed prude, look no further. The author has a fantastic way of telling some rather embarrasing and personal accounts. If anything, this book strips away all pretense and through her writing, really makes you feel a whole bunch more accepting of your own bizarre sexual fantasies / disastrous one night stands! Cheers to you Chelsea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"I have been watching Chelsea on TV for sometime now and wondered if her books were as funny as her shows. They are!!! Chelsea Handler sure can tell a story, I recomend this to anyone who needs a little bit of laughter in their day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still funny","review":"Another funny book. I can't believe all those stories are real.. but if they are.. wow. It was fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as skanky as you'd imagine... but still Totally Relatable!!!","review":"After seeing it on Amazon and reading the first few pages I ran to the bookstore on my lunch break and bought it... & finished it later that day... It was AMAZING!!!!It's a series of chapters in her life that are hysterical and very much like your own life (if you're a party animal like circle of friends).... Some of us aren't as extreme in certain aspects of our lives as she is, but nevertheless, it is great!!! I will definitely read this book again in the future after I read a few others.. I also want to read her Vodka book... I will buy it immediately when it comes out in paperback..But.. The book isn't as slutty as the title makes it seem. It didn't get into any details of anything \\"nasty\\".. But I've bought copies of this book and given them to my friends who I knew would appreciate a book like this.. and they've all LOVED it!! So read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"Chelsea Handler paints herself as a shallow, pathetic, trashy, small-minded person who desperately tries to define herself with random sexual encounters. If I could detect even an ounce of sarcasm her sexcapades might be funny, but instead it leaves me feeling sorry for her and for anyone who ever got between her legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Loved it. The humor with her parents was hysterical. She is so good at the one liners. I need to get her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast funny read","review":"I could not put this book down. It reminded me of all my crazy adventures as a teen and young adult. I finished the book in a couple hours and was sad because I wanted more. There were so many laugh out loud moments through out the book. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and funny","review":"I read this book soon after I read \\"I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell\\". I was curious about why some woman sleep with so many strangers. I found this book interesting and funny and I plan on reading Chelsea's other books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining!","review":"I got both of her books for an 8 hour flight. I read them both before vacation was up. Her sense of humor is crude but well worth the purchase of the book. She was cracking me up in almost every chapter. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I dont like it..","review":"Well I honestly thought this book would be as much fun to read as watching chelsea's show. Wrong. it started out funny, but soon became shallow and cheap... with no story line whatsoever. the one-too-many mentions of her genitalia and her drug habits really disgusted me.. and Im not one to take scandal easily. Just thought this book would be more..elaborate. 30% into the book, Handler mentions a male and you immediately know.. ok.. shes gonna sleep with him and we're gonna know how she did it. in EVERY sense of the word. not a read i would recommend at ALL..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chelsea No No","review":"I'm not going to lie, I didn't like this book at all. It was a disappointment. The book consists of random exaggerated stories that don't really mesh together. On top of that I felt like she was pretty crude in most of her stories. Crude as in just a tad trashy.Question to pose: She was on drugs most of the time in this book... how did she remember all of her encounters so vividly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands","review":"I read her previous book and laughed till I couldn't laugh anymore, This book,however, was so not funny ..... I ordered her next bood and only hope it is as funny as the first. I would not recommend this book to anyone,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Jewish Girl","review":"Ms. Handler is basically a little blonde tramp from a wealthy family. No idea were the money comes from but they have a house on Martha's Vineyard and Chelsea always seems to have a car and plenty of money to enjoy lots of sex without actually doing anything. It must be nice going through life knowing your parents will always pay the bills. Stories and she get boring around page 130. She also is very proud of how much she drinks and all the naughty drugs she takes. It all goes to show that if you are pretty and have money people will think you have talent and give you even more money. She will turn out to be an burned out blonde nobody remembers, Very sad, not funny at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"From reading this book, I'd have to say that the people to read this and think she is funny, have to have somewhat of a twisted and open minded sense of humor and not for those people that take offense to her sexual and very forward jokes and stories. If you're one of those people, then you probably should do you research, read the reviews and mostly know what kind of mind and sense of humor Chelsea Handler has. NOT buy the book to just leave a bad review even after knowing you have no interest.She is hilarious! And I loved this and her second book.Would I recommend this to friends? Yes. To my mother? No."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and disrespectful--at the same time!","review":"This is such a funny book. However, be warned that Chelsea does include some racism and stereotyping. All that aside, it's still hilarious and included a lot of nice stories of her life when she wasn't a household name. It really reveals her true colors and where she comes from. I think it was a worthwhile read despite all the discrimination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a memoir that I actually WANT to read!","review":"I fell in love with Chelsea when I first saw her show. She has this type of dry, sarcastic humor that I find completely hilarious. This is the first of the books that she wrote even though it's not my favorite.Each chapter is about a new man that entered Chelsea's like (and more often than not, exited just as quickly). With wit and humor Chelsea revisits several one night stands that stood out in her life. Accompanied by her saucy group of gal pals, Handler takes on every city with the same attitude: find a glass of vodka and a hot man, STAT!It's completely irreverent and full of language that will disgust the average prude, this is a memoir for anyone who enjoys Chelsea's naughty sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Though the book was not laugh out loud funny, it was very entertaining and tough to put down. It's definitely worth a read for those who enjoy humourous tales involving drinking and relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"There is nothing below a single star to give otherwise I would have given it. Since I borrowed the book I can't say I wasted any money but I think the time I spent reading it was a wate."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Wish I had read a sample before buying. Not funny. Not insightful. Not sexy. Not interesting. Basically the author chronicles some of her one night stands and associated behavior that often crosses the border into abusive towards her partner while mocking everyone who doesn't share her passion in having no interests other than booze, drugs, and sex. I'm all for humorous stories of sexual encounters, but that is not what this is. I was bored through most of it and cringing through the rest. Wasn't even worth the low price I paid for the kindle version. Wouldn't give the author the time of day if I met her in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misadventures of a Self-deprecating Minx","review":"What one person may find hilarious, another views as ho-hum. From reading some of the other reviews, I apparently am in the yawn minority. I don't know, maybe it's because I'm a middle-aged guy. A half dozen, forced smiles was all Ms. Handler's book elicited from me. Also, the veracity of her adventures comes into question due to the fact the Ms. Handler portrays herself as almost one step short of being a pathological liar. If you are someone that is looking for a light, summer read and doesn't want to worry about having to use a dictionary, you'll probably enjoy this book. It wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"One of the funniest books I have ever read, I flew through it.

This is a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Life Chelsea.","review":"Ok, but how do you remember all those encounters? I guess they were worth remembering. I wonder if you would change anything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring to say the least","review":"Being a fan of Chelsea 's I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy this book and her wacky ventures but to be honest it got boring in the 3rd story. It was also an easy read and after a while was extremely predictable. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone and now I am a little put off by reading her other books especially if they are written like this. There should be someone (editor) to give this book a once over because there are some grammatical errors too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corwin and the family reunion","review":"Corwin decides to see if it's possible to rescue Brother Brand, and gets the rest of his siblings involved in the action. What becomes unfortunately apparent is that one of them wants him dead, and that family politics are always a lot more complicated than they look when it comes to the Amber royal house.A lot of great information about the family dynamics comes to light here. A readable, fascinating installment in a readable, fascinating series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Book Improves The Series","review":"Well, the author sure has a knack for ending books on cliffhangers!

It was, sad to say, one of the most trite and predicable books I've read in a long time. From the first chapter, you know pretty much how the book is going to end. By about the 5th chapter, you know for certain. The characters are either stock or charactures, neither of which are believable.

The cast of 'characters' was unique and not predictable which made it more interesting to want to get to know them the better.The only predictable part was Julia playing hard to get, understandably after being hurt and not trusting, but all love stories have that same pattern we all are used to. The other stories and characters gave it some substance.If you liked The Knitting Club this one is even better. They both have similar genre involving a group of women dealing with and overcoming their life situations.Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouthwatering","review":"Cathy Lamb's debut novel happened to be my debut with Cathy Lamb's novels.

The characters are not developed, they are all predictable, and every single scenario is a cliche. This book wasn't even about chocolates!

Every time you get excited and think something, ANYTHING is going to happen and actually be developed...nothing happens. I didn't laugh either...there's nothing funny in this book.

If you want to read graphic details about women stuck in abusive relationships and how abusive men treat them, this is the book for you.

The characters are all one-dimensional; here's a sample description of the women: \\"A psychic with a twitching eye, a bald woman chasing down her guns, and a mermaid-type mother crying.\\" As for the men, they are either tall, handsome gentle giants or mean, evil, violent abusers.And then there's the whole \\"Faux-Bohemian pseudo-feminist psychobabble\\" thing.

The author led you through with the central character to a new awakening leaving behind an acoholic mother with many boyfriends and a controlling, abusive fiancee. The central character was very brave when she left her wedding dress in the tree and started forward without a planned goal. People tend to put up with what they have rather than advance into the unknown. So often people are abused and will not leave the abuse because they cannot accept what they cannot see. The aunt was a delightful eccentric who pulled the central character into a world that allowed her to grow as a person and to heal from the abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Genre Has Been Done to DEATH","review":"This book was a sad, unoriginal mish mash of \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood,\\" \\"When Katie Wakes,\\" \\"Persian Pickle Club,\\" blah blah blah.Absolutely nothing original about this book.

I was so disappointed. This book is one of those highly oversimplified, sappy, fairy tale type books where the main character comes from hardships, changes her physical location, and her enitre life changes. Everyone sees her worth the instant they meet her and love her immediately, everyone she cares about is the most exceptionally gifted person at whatever they do. Nobody judges superficially as they used to, and the main character now suddenly has the power and fortitude to stand up to all wrongs and give so many gifts to the world.I honestly just found the writing ludicrous and the storyline laughable. If you are looking for a story with some substance or realism, skip this one. If you just want some immature girly fluff, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly poor...","review":"I was very surprised to be completely disappointed by this book. It was a poor cross between \\"The Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood\\" by Rebecca Wells and \\"Chocolat\\" by Joanne Harris. Both of these wildly popular books had a unique way of capturing the spirit of the characters. Yet, \\"Julia's Chocolates\\" fails to deliver that sense of knowing the people you are reading about. This novel seems to take elements from both of these books, and mishmash them together, to create something lesser than either.The characters are more like caricatures, and none seem fully developed. Each one seems to be 'putting on a play', but not establishing themselves.I wanted to love this book, and kept plugging along, even when it became repetitive and predictable. I wish I could say it ended better than it began. The beginning few pages were the best in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Simpleton","review":"No doubt in my 66 years I have read a book with worse writing than this, but I'll be damned if I can remember when or what book.

Test!!!","review":"If you think this book will prepare you for the test you are wrong. The first exam: CX-310-014 yes, it helps. But the Exam Cram is better.But the CX-310-015 does not cover enought areas to aid for the test. For example,the author does not explain setfacl, RBAC enought. There's not enought guides here. This part is really poorly written.He must get paid for filling up pages. However, if you want to be a Solaris admin, this book is a good reference. THIS book is not for test studying.Try look for the Exam Cram for Solaris 9. That book has a lot better info section for RBAC and others.

After reviewing the other books, will buy this one. I have class notes for ess and intermediate so I am ready. SO armed with this book and exam cram, some good practice questions, away I go.

These live solo jazz piano recordings were made in 1979-80 and 1986 in Russia. He's a master improviser and a good technician. He uses huge, blocky chords at times -- and since the recording is good you can hear the inner voices well. There's a bit of audience noise, but nothing different from most live recordings. I only give it a \\"4\\" rather than a \\"5\\" because of one track that's a real clunker (#3), sort of oompah band meets jazz.

It contains a version of the song but it's nothing at all similar to the Joe Pass version on Virtuoso. The same goes for the two other recordings on the CD. It's in the JP style I guess, but I don't like it. The recording quality is also very poor, which really annoys me. I've already shelved it.

I wanted to read about Jacen and Ben and Luke and Mara, the mains who are dealing with the main storyline instead of Boba Fett, who's storyline adds little to nothing to the whole story arc as a whole. I feel his whole addition was just to allow the authors to say, hey look, the mandalorians are back!Still a good book, and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar job!","review":"Triple Zero and Bloodlines are two of my all time favorite Star Wars novels. The author's real-life knowledge of law enforcement and military matters adds a needed touch of realism to this fine book. I love the grittiness, insight into Mandolarian culture, pacing and characterization. Jacen's descent toward the dark side is a thousand times better written than Anakin's in either the book or the movie. The impact on Ben, Jiana, Luke, Han, Leia, etc. is very well done as well. Furthermore, the escalating schism between Luke/Mara and Han/Leia as they find themselves on opposite sides of the GA/Corellian conflict is not only believable and but heart-wrenching as well. Boba Fett is cool too, one of the most interesting characters in the story. Fast paced and great fun, this book is very well worth buying. This one is much darker than earlier Star Wars books, but overall a supremely stellar job. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really enjoyed the first book in the series but had a tough time with the 2nd.

I hope the next ones better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacen's continuing decline to the dark side","review":"I enjoyed this book even though I really don't like Jacen turing to the dark side.

Boba Fett is dying and trying to find a kaminoan scientist to help him. It makes him a little more human.He is also trying to find his daughter who he hasn't seen in 50 years. He finally finds his daughter but he finds out she has died by the hands of Jacen. If you want see how Jacen falls deeper to the dark side then read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book in a terrible series","review":"The characters in this book often make decisions that make no sense based on their values or past expereinces. I wonder if the authors in this series have read or care about the Star Wars universe. This book and the others in thie series seem bent on old allies becoming enemies and killing or attempting to kill each other. Luke tries to kill his nephew, Luke's nephew kills Luke's wife and tortures Luke son and on and on it goes. The inclusive of Bobba Fett and his \\"family\\" seems almost a \\"nice\\" diversive compared to the Jedi trying to kill one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and readable","review":"I wasn't crazy about the first book, \\"Betrayal\\", basically because I needed a magnifier to read it, since the font was so small. However, if the print was larger it would have been probably over 500 pages, which would have made the book too long (and it was too long anyway).This book, \\"Bloodlines\\", was much better and smoother. I disagree with some of the criticisms that Luke and others were in denial over Jacen's turn to darkness. Luke and just about everyone else (except Mara) was keenly aware of Jacen and quite suspicious about it. But a war was on and everyone was involved in their own way and role, which explained how Jacen was to change. This is the first Star Wars novel I've read from Karen Traviss, and I plan on reading more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Expanded Universe story line yet","review":"I've had the pleasure of reading several dozen of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books. This was the first one I actually had trouble finishing. It is dark and throughly depressing. If this is where the EU is going, I'm not following. I'll stick to the books before this series in the chronology. If you care about the Star Wars main characters, avoid this book and the series entirely.On the other hand, if you are a great fan of Boba Fett, you'll probably enjoy his return. The expansion of his character was the only worthwhile part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"old","review":"Old, outdated, for the newbe.

From the legendary fortress Megiddo in Israel, where Armageddon is prophesied to start, to Namibia and Botswana in 1979, to the Final Stand of the Knights Templar and the space-based Death Star, A Hitchhiker's Guide to Armageddon pulls out all the stops in a chilling, brutal tour of humanity's most precipitous failings.

I don't really like the mesh on the back (I think that it just looks a little dumb). But the real problem came after a few uses the fabric at the end of the fingers started to roll and form a little ball between my fingers at the bar. It might not sound like a big deal but when you get enough weight on the bar it really hurts and I find myself having to stop reps short and adjust the fingers several times eah time I work out. I will admit that I have somewhat small hands and that my fingers are not really thick, but for that reason I bought a medium size and the fit seems good until I start lifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheap material","review":"i guess you get what you pay for. the price was very low as the quality of the gloves. they will do the work but they feel like they are going to rip off any time. next time i will invest more money into better gloves since working out is something i really enjoy doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice gloves","review":"I needed a size XXL and a decent price.The gloves are very nice and much better than similar gloves forund at a large retail store.

I am a woman with normal to small-sized hands, with very narrow fingers. I ordered a size small and they are difficult to get on and off.

But then I looked at the front part of the gloves, and I discover that the seaming was not as described AT ALL, which upset me quite a bit. It is much less comfortable than it should be... I also ordered a Medium size pair, which turned out to be more like a small - Xsmall size. I requested a refund/return, and got no reply.

Well, gloves that are too large don't help in any way as well.

I have small hands, but they're somewhat chubby, so I ordered a medium size, but the gloves are tight and they pinch my fingers, which is very uncomfortable.

Who picks these? Bosko? I don't think anyone's left alive that remembers him. I know everyone has there own favorites, but come on! When they played \\"Overture, dim the lights\\" and they all marched out I didn't see Bosko in the line."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOONY TUNES VOLUME SIX","review":"What a disappointment. If I want a study in early black and white cartoons I will buy the Disney MICKEY MOUSE BLACK AND WHITE set. At least they were honest. This Looney Tunes set features an entire disc of black and white very unfunny cartoons. I didn't mind that in earlier sets they featured a few early black and white Porky Pig...but these are the very very early Bosco, etc. Come on guys....what happened to ROAD RUNNER, BUGS BUNNY, SPEED GONZALAS, etc? I can see what Warner is trying to do....stretch out their library so they can go up to VOLUME 100. At least Disney broke their sets out - DONALD DUCK SET, MICKEY MOUSE SET, GOOFY SET, PLUTO SET, ETC. Come on Warner....lets get more of the good stuff...you are going to make enough money with the 100's of quality Mel Blanc cartoons to keep em coming for the next few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertaining to casual cartoon fans","review":"If you are perhaps a cartoon historian you might appreciate this collection, however, this set of cartoons is not entertaining.

So if you are a casual cartoon fan, I would stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid $65 for this?","review":"Honestly, what did I pay for exactly. There is something majorly wrong with this DVD set. 2 out of the 4 discs are complete garbage. I thought I was going to see cartoons with Bugs, Tweety, Sylvester, Daffy, etc. Instead, all I get is cartoon after cartoon of German / Nazi banter and WW II crap. They should rename this Looney Tunes WW II edition.... not Golden Collection. It's a waste of $. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"put it out of its misery","review":"with each year my excitement was diminished and my expectations fell. to read this is the last set in the series and to see what shorts are included is the last shovel of dirt on the grave. four disc of exactly what i do not want to see. one whole disc of patriotic war cartoons? ugh. two disc from waaaaaaaay in the back of the vault and another disc of \\"all stars\\" aka generic watch em once and pack em off to collect some dust. and a bizaro world bargain at forty something dollars. no thanks and zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"And this time we didn't forget the gravy!!!!!","review":"I am so happy that Chow Hound is included, along with Charley Dog shorts. I would like to see more Foghorn Leghorne, criminally omitted from these sets, and the Porky Daffy classic, my favorite with them, Tic Tock Tuckered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Argue With A Closed Mind","review":"Hello,I can't understand some of the reviews of this set. I am one of the people who likes to learn. I have been watching Looney Tunes my entire life (I am 57), and there is nothing I delight in seeing more than ones I have never seen before. It is like finding a lost treasure. Why would I want to see the same ones over and over that I saw when I was a child in the late 50's? It is fascinating to me to see the origins of these characters and the origins of the artists and directors. After all, this is the sixth set. As an adult collector, how many Bugs-Bunny-out-wits-Elmer cartoons do we have to see?So!! Bring on the \\"Bosco\\"s the propaganda 'toones and the early black and white Porky Pigs. I have never seen most of these before, and I just might learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have purchased each volume of the Golden Collection so of course when this one came out I hurriedly ordered it as well.My goal in buying this collection was to recapture those great cartoons that I watched as a child. Many have since been discontinued or heavily edited on TV, so this was a way of enjoying these classic cartoons from the days before we became so politically correct.I am not one to expect that every cartoon will be a favorite, but I'll have to say this volume is rather full of filler. All of the classic cartoons on disk 3 are the type you'd find in the discount stores for a dollar a disk and are certainly not what I expected for my money. Those who want the very early cartoon classics with unknown characters might love this collection, but I expected to see Golden cartoons, not ancient ones!WB could have done much better than this, but I guess they expected die-hard fans like me to buy it anyway. They got their wish, but shame on them for not doing better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, BUT ONLY FOR THE AVID COLLECTOR","review":"This is a good collection, but it is only for the avid Looney Tunes and vintage cartoon collector, like me. Some of these shorts may not be interesting to some people, including children. Most of these cartoons are World War 2 propaganda, which were shown at movie theaters at the time, encouraging people to buy victory bonds for defense. There is also some violence.I recommend the Spotlight Collection Vol.6 for those who want more of the cartoons that were shown on television. If you are not a collector of vintage cartoons of an era, than this collection is not for you.sg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining old-timers, including some WWII ones","review":"Like the other five volumes hitherto issued in this series, this sixth collection is quite interesting for collectors of classical toons. The selection is quite varied, including both quite early b/w ones as well as quite a few of the rare WWII vintage, very typical in their propaganda style and therefore often excluded from other collections, as they're today hardly to be considered politically correct. Don't let the warning texts on the cover discourage you: These toons are funny for both grown-ups and kids: Actually much funnier than most of the crap issued during this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"None better","review":"No one can do it better that Looney Tunes. I have all six collections and view them often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorriest of all the first 6 collection sets","review":"I love Looney Tunes cartoons, except for most of the ones on volume 6. I'm a Bugs and friends person, and I do not like the old, forgotten, Disney knockoff, original characters. Most of this stuff is from that lot of toons. The 'extras' contained a few that I liked, but most of the rest were skipped.If you like Bugs, Elmer, Porky, Sylvester, Tweety, and friends, but don't like old black and white characters that are basically Disney clones, don't waste your money! I only paid $23 for volume 6, and that was $22 too much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Relatable; Our son was mezmorized","review":"This DVD was a great tool to offer our son a way to see that other kids have similar experiences, questions, and fears when starting preschool. It also seemed to bring out a sense of pride for his own school. It was remarkable how much he tuned into the similaries and differences between Buddy Bear's school and his own. We also bought the book \\"I love you all day\\" about a mommy giving her son the reassurance that she loves him when they are together and also when they are apart (and he is at school). Each were great! Good luck. The best advice we got was 1) make sure your kid knows you think his school is a great and that you want him to be there and 2) try dropping off and setting short goals: I will come back for snack (30 minutes) then leave again and come back for Yard...etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Hill Without A Name\\"","review":"As a promoter of haiku, I found these Haiku to be of amateur quality.

O'Donnel and Granger are a slightly odd couple with a palpable chemistry; O'Donnell's vulnerability is perfect for her part. And well, Farley Granger is about the sexiest male film noir lead this side of Robert Mitchum. (both are about the sexiest of all time, really) Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good memories","review":"The songs brought back a lot of good memories; happy, carefree times. Four of my all-time Culture Club favs (in this order) were on this CD: Church of the Poison Mind, Karma Chameleon, Time, and Miss Me Blind. On the cover is Boy George in all his flamboyance--he does makeup better than any woman I know. The costumes he wore...over the top gorgeous.

That's fine seeing that this one has the most complete selection. This disc gives us all the obvious choices like \\"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\\", \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\\", \\"Church Of The Poison Mind\\", and \\"Karma Chameleon\\", as well as alot of the later material other collections skimped on. Truth be known, I kind of miss some of Boy George's solo material like \\"Everything I Own\\", \\"Bow Down Mister\\", and of course \\"The Crying Game\\".

I'm amazed that such a novel inspired a movie director to create such a wonderful film with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. Probably he condensed it and added a few funny scenes.I had ordered the sequel, \\"Blandings\\" Way\\", via inter library loan as well, but will skip reading it.A much better, more rewarding read was \\"Now, Voyager!\\" by Olive Higgins Prouty which I also recived via ILL at our public library in 2008. That was a great great forties novel!Other books from the forties that I recently discovered: \\"The Woman in Red\\" by Anthony Gilbert (a must read for all fans of the 1945 Nina Foch film \\"My Name is Julia Ross\\") and \\"The Blank Wall\\" by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding (although I liked the movie location (Balboa, CA) better than the book location (CT) which has been filmed with Jamnes Mason and Joan Bennett (Reckless Moment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection of hits","review":"This album has 14 songs, about 11 of which were number 1 hits for the Platters.

At the time, it only appeared on the Born Slippy single (the one with the tractor on the cover). So the Nuxx mix was given its own single. It appears here in its longer 11:45 form (opposed to 9:48 on the single and soundtrack). Also on this is Deep Pan, which, like Pearls Girl (Tin There), was a song already released, and then put on a single under the guise of a remix. It shares a beat with Juanita, not Born Slippy, but is good anyway. The Darren Price Mix is absolutely brilliant, and the Remix is good too. The other part to this has an edit, Dark Train, and an Alex Reece mix of Banstyle worth checking out. You're probably better off getting the US single that combines all these, but if it's unavailable, this will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"Givry gives an excellent overview of certain areas of occult study and a unique perspective since he substantiates much of his observation with data gleaned from art images of the time periods involved.

Homicidal Intent, with the intent to keep you on the edge of your seat. A smart, sophistocated, polished read.

As with the past few Hip albums, it has taken a few spins to get into Coke Machine Glow. Its eclectic nature and its departure from Gordie's work with the Hip makes it a bit more difficult, but the effort is worth the rewards of such lines as, \\"Now for the spectacular part\\" and \\"I'm discovering uses for you I though I'd never find.\\" The album is filled with these little gems, but any Hip fan already knows about Downie's tendency toward lyrics that are at once powerfully familiar and impenetrable, an effect both pleasing and provocative. The words are the attraction here, but the music, by turns folksy, bluesy, and just plain goofy (good goofy, ya know), also seems an effort to force the average fan to consider what else is out there. Consider it well. Thanks, Gordie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another spin...","review":"This is one of my favorite Canadian Albums of all time, and I'm discovering it all over again. It's the forebearer to the now numerous indie-style Psych-Folk albums that are currently painting the airwaves. Only this is much better and much smarter than anything in the mainstream.Too smart for the masses and about 5 years ahead of it's time? - perhaps it was, but its time for another spin, so plugin your pods and enjoy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but extremely uneven","review":"Those anticipating a reprise of the turbulent hip venacular may want to give this debatable solo disc a wide berth. Clearly not the musical force behind his day gig, Downie relies on resonant background effects and airy engineering to add heft to some rather rickety compositions. Lilting ballads \\"Vancouver Divorce\\", \\"Trick Rider\\", and \\"Lofty Pines\\" are the keepers here, along with a sloppy garage rocker called \\"Canada Geese\\". The remaining songs on this drawn-out release are little more than fussed-over filler; genre pieces like \\"Elaborate\\" and \\"Every Irrelevance\\" are generic and uninspired, while the ponderous spoken-word segments - complete with Director Atom Egoyan on classical guitar - are likely to alienate any listener not incontestably enamoured with, well, ponderous spoken-word segments."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sorry","review":"This is the worst album I've ever been duped into buying. Admittedly, I was brought in by the legacy of the Hip, and Downie's very peculiar live ramblings, and expected something in that vein.Instead, this is coffee house open-mic poetry to very eclectic music. Gord's odd verse is a neat filler on mellow guitar solos during Hip live shows, but it doesn't cut it as central lyrics. Some of the poems are good, but most don't do it for me. And the music behind them borders on downright terrible, by any genre's standards. Artists should be allowed to experiment, but they should know when the results aren't good.Keep with the Hip albums, even the worst of them are better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleuthing Jane","review":"I'm not sure how to discribe this book except that I felt like I was intimate with Jane Austen herself, while she was at Chawton. This mystery begins with Jane just ariving at Chawton Cottage. In the process of moving in she gets a visitor who is delivering a chest that she is to inherit from her deceased friend Lord Harold Trowbridge. In the chest is a lifetime of papers that Lord Harold wrote. Anyway this brings about a lot of problems to the Austen party and to top it off they find a dead body in the basement that was placed there before they arived. Jane is wonderful in the use of her wit and brains and we see how she unwavering she is in the persuit of finding the truth. Also the references to what is going on during Jane Austen's time makes this book just wonderfully historical. Just love it!! I'm going to go back and try reading the other books!! Definitely recomend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"Reading the preceding book in this series nearly broke my heart.Jane and the Ghosts of NetleyEven though I know, historically, that Jane Austen died without marrying, I found myself wanting her to find happiness with her Gentleman Rogue, and I could hardly wait to find out what the fictional Jane did next. I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its wonderful descriptions of Chawton and its environs, as well as for a perfectly delightful mystery with as many misdirections and red herrings as the best of Agatha Christie. I highly recommend this book, but would suggest the reading of \\"Jane and the Ghosts of Netley\\" first, in order to get the background of its story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man who lost the Russian Revolution...","review":"When I got my doctorate in history, I ever regretted the historians' tendency to slaughter every man who lost. And yes, the historians kill Kerensky. But the fact is that he lost only because he was never ruthless, like Lenin. He was never murderous, savage, violent. Indeed he was a humanist. The historians say he had \\"naivete\\" and so wrote when he died in the early 1970s. But it is far better to be allegedly naive than to be the first of the great mass murderers of the century, like Lenin.Hitler once laughed that if you win, history will endorse you. I wonder if the swine were correct. In truth, history concedes much to Lenin, and nothing to Kerensky. But that tells us more about us than about them....This book rehabilitates Kerensky. It has a dry style but deep research. If there is one better on Kerensky I do not know it.Respectfully,Will Brownell, PhD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steelheart is excellent","review":"I think steelheart is the greatest band from the 80's.

In short, I don't think Morrison's review belongs here.My impressions of this album: The recording quality is decent but not great. The violin and viol playing are OK, but there are better examples out there. The cornetto playing, on the other hand is quite good. Toss in organs, regals, and archlutes, and you get a wonderful tapestry of sound.Also good is director Roland Wilson's attempt to reconstruct pieces from the incomplete books 2-4 of the Ludi Musici, pieces I assume haven't been heard since Scheidt's day."},{"rating":"2","title":"One gem of a series","review":"The series is cleaver and fun and many feel this was it's best year.

It comes with two tips and a splash guard and the entire thing comes apart for cleaning which is great. Metal is thin but of adequate construction for its purpose. Although it has its purpose, I don't care for the tip with the rounded as it tends to block wax from exiting the ear when as the water rushes out. I believe it is intended for those who are worried about puncturing an ear drum but if you are placing the end that for in the canal you shouldn't be using it. We opt for the straight tip and find it works much better.I have only two complaints about it:1) The threads on this product are very fine and close together. It is easy to cross-thread if you aren't watching what you are doing.2) If I ordered it again I would go with a smaller size.

Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe do manage to scrap together a few (and, I'm talking very few) laughable scenes. But for the most part, Curly-Joe (Joe De Rita) is a total dork. At least Joe Besser had his moments - sort of wish he'd filled the role of Curly-Joe in the six Stooges feature films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective exfoliator","review":"This product is awesome; nice texture, great tingling feeling, and very smooth/clean feeling after use.

Not quite as good as the better-known 'The Death of the Heart', but well worth reading.There are two aspects to Bowen's work which attract me. First, her language. On almost every page there is something to leave one breathless. Here's a sample:Their tide had turned and was racing in again: here was the universe filling up -- all there had been to be, do, know, dare, live for or die for at the full came flooding to this doorstep.That's writing of the highest sort.Also, unlike many second-rate writers, her novels center around the relationships between the characters, not only what type of people they are, but how they know each other and how they are related. One feels they are real people, not just devices to fill up space in the plot as dictated by the author, and as with real people, things are rarely nice and tidy, and feelings get hurt. This gives her work a third dimension which is crucial to the unfolding of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unconfortable","review":"I photography wedding in my free time, and have been doing event photography for over a year.

The strap works fine, and can give an extra level of comfort when holding the camera without the neck strap on. The only issue is that mine and my wife's hands are very different in size, so we're constantly readjusting the strap back and forth. The positive being that the adjustments are easy, and hold well when in use. The downside is that for the Canon T2i, the card slot is right under the strap, so when tighter, it can be a little tougher to get the card out.

You may be more familiar with John McLaghlin's name but all of their individual complete technical masteries of their instrument combined with their collective musical art and peerless musicianship will spellbind you even if you are not familiar with or particularly attracted to guitar music. If you are a classical music listener (or classical musician as I am) get this and their other available albums. I was fortunate to hear these guys live in Boston and Providence in the 80's. As outrageous as this may sound I was as amazed and gratified by their perfomances as I was by those of Horowitz and Richter and Segovia and Parkington. They are jazz chamber music of the most virtuosic and musically creative kind.

It comes with a screen protector and click wheel protector, but I just used the screen protector. There is actually a hard plastic screen built into the case covering the ipod screen for added protection, which I thought was a cool feature, but there were specks on it. Not a big deal, but slightly noticeable, it probably doesn't come like that with every one but you never know. Overall, I am really happy with it and it looks like it will last for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case. Love the color.

Expecting a big surprise from all the other equipment Scrapper is disappointed to find out that the only thing special about the day is having to watch his baby brother (a Bobcat loader). Keeping an eye on his baby brother becomes a big job, more than he can handle. He wishes that he didn't have a baby brother only later to find out that a baby brother is a blessing to have to have.The sound and picture quality isn't as great as with new videos.

Unfortunately, this didn't do anything. No increase in supply, nothing. It's an expensive product and if it worked, I wouldn't mind, but it was just a waste for me.Maybe it helps for some, but I think sometimes you just can't fight mother nature and the pregnancy hormones that may make your supply dwindle.

While it starts off promisingly enough, it soon begins to flounder along the way. It's just not exciting nor as challenging as an assassin's mission should be. Save for some novel quirks, and a few thrilling moments, 'Space Assassin' is little more than a collectors item. Another thing, I found the end paragraph extremely disappointing - as if the author had become bored and detached from writing this gamebook altogether.

A new battery didn't help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and reasonably priced watches for boys","review":"i bought this watch to replace my son's watch that he lost last summer. He liked it so much that he specifically asked for this exact watch again. And his brother decided that he wanted the same one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"so the watch is just like it looks. its lightweight and looks good. i really like the timer function as opposed to just a stop watch function. the buttons are a little hard to press and the timer function i mentioned earlier is difficult to use. not very hard to set it or start it but difficult to clear it and start again. i dont put the watch underwater much but it withstands day to day tasks like dishes or hand washing with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women's or children's watch, definitely not fit for Men in any way","review":"The description is misleading for sure. This is not truly a \\"unisex\\" watch. The band is entirely too skinny for my liking and I do not have a big wrist. Previously bought a different style of the Timex 1440 sports watch that was listed as men's and it is more appropriately sized for Men and works great for me. I'm sure this watch will function great as mine has done but I returned it almost instantly after opening it out of the box. I would not recommend this to any adult male and possibly some Women as well. More appropriate for someone petite or children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swim Fan!","review":"I was worried that the band would be to small when I ordered it, but I had no problems with the size. i love that I can use it to time laps when I am swimming. My only complaint is that it doesn't change time easily - or like my other timex watch. Wish me luck, I lost the directions and am off to google it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch for the active kid","review":"Christmas present for an eleven year old boy and was a big hit.

After wearing it for a couple of weeks though he developed a rash around his wrist where the band touched his skin. This kid has never been allergic to anything in his life. He is so dissapointed because he loves the watch but can't wear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap watch of low quality","review":"This product has the feel and quality of a very cheap watch (don't let the picture fool you). Although the Amazon price seemed great, the watch isn't worth half the price. Save your money or spend a little more and get a higher quality watch. We returned this to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad warranty policy","review":"I bought a kid's Timex watch for my son. It broke after 7 month of use (even though the kid is very neat). To get it fixed or replaced, you have to mail the watch and also include $8 return postage fee.

This watch really fits the bill. It has nice large numbers as well as a date. It's very useful and comfortable as well. The price? Can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is not a unisex watch, the dial is too narrow. It's clearly a woman's watch. The band is narrow too. Would not get for ANY male."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"My son is 9 and he loves this watch. He is able to set the alarm, so he always gets home from friends house right on time. Indiglo works great too. He wears it 24/7. He also likes that it is waterproof, so he can wear in the tub or shower or in the pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, tough, watch, great value.","review":"My son, 11, has this watch. He wears it everywhere, including in the pool for swim practice and for all his scouting campouts and activities. The watch has held up well and still looks pretty good after over a year's constant wear.For the price, I highly recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch for the Price","review":"I needed a watch that I could use while traveling and doing outdoor activities. This watch more than fit the bill. It's very comfortable, easy to read and the instructions were easy to follow. My DH liked it so much that he's asked for the men's version for his birthday. For the price you can't beat this watch. Excellent value for an excellent watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Five minutes after setting the time, the watch had already fallen behind by two minutes. We reset the watch and waited ten minutes and the watch was behind by five minutes! Now it is behind by a full twenty-four hours. Also, the numbers would randomly flicker and disappear. Very disappointing for our eight year old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for a 9 year old boy!","review":"I loved the way my Grand Son's eyes lit up when he saw the watch.And, his first comment was-- I thought it was going to be too big.Oh yes, it's the perfect size watch for a child his age.After looking at many other watches, it was such a relief for me to find this watch from a trusted brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Unisex T5G8411 1440 Sports Digiyal Watch","review":"My grandson loved the watch.

It's easy to set. It looks exactly like the picture. Shipping was fast and the watch arrived in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pretty, but it works","review":"CONS:- Its small. I don't care what the description says, this is a women's watch, not unisex.- It beeps on every button press. Its very loud and you can't disable it.- Its not very pretty. The silver area around the watch face in the product picture is actually chrome plastic, and it makes it look really cheap. This is probably my biggest problem with the watch. The product picture makes it look better than it actually is.- Can't review your lap times on the stopwatch.PROS:- Cheap (you get what you pay for)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm a big man with a girl watch","review":"When I bougth it. the description was a unisex sport watch, but is so small that looks great on my 5 years old son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all great watch","review":"I will start off by saying that I wear this watch everyday and have had it for about 2 years. I am a nurse so I am pretty hard on my watches. I have always been very happy with the Timex digital watches except for the watch bands use to break easily. I needed a new battery for my old watch and came across this watch. You can't beat it for the price. About a month ago the colored part on the right side of the watch popped off. It still works fine just looks a little funny. I would say I most definitely got my moneys worth out of it. I wish that the month and date along with the day of the week showed up on the screen like the higher priced ones. For the price however I can get over it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better Quality","review":"We ordered this watch for our son for Christmas. It's his first watch and he was very excited to get it. However after just a few weeks, the upper right Start/Stop button fell off! The piece is so small he didn't realize it was missing, and he stopped wearing it because it wasn't working. We order our presents well in advance to be prepared for the holidays so we can't return it to Amazon ($^@*#) and Timex charges 50% the cost of the watch if we send it back to be repaired. Frustrating. A $20 watch should last a kid at least a year or two, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE~!","review":"This watch is a fake....nowhere on it does it say TIMEX....it's just a generic, cheap watch. Should have known...even TIMEX watches cost more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a man....","review":"Nice looking watch described as unisex. But when I got it, I decided that no self-respecting man would wear it. Gave it to my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a few weeks...","review":"This watch is simple, but I just needed it for a trip out of country and other basic uses. It held up well for a 2.5 week trip in Africa with only a few scratches on the front. I didn't pay much for it, so I knew it would have some bumps and bruises. It also served as my alarm every morning without fail.Upon returning and going in the pool a couple of times the glass began to fog up. A day later it is no longer working. It switches between setting the date and time. It will give off periodical beeps, and none of the buttons respond when pressed. Although it is an inexpensive, I expected it to last for more than 3 weeks of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"like all computers, this one involves a learning curve when trying to find out what three buttons to push and in what order to do it when one wants to change a setting on it; and that can be a big pain in the butt---- but once you get it, the thing tells time accurately, reminds one of what day it is, and has another time zone for when one travels (which comes in handy if one remembers what button to push, and how many seconds to hold it in order to switch it to that setting). It's attractive, accurate, and very very cheap (which, of course, means it is made in China-> those wanting the Chinese central bank to let the yuan float and who want home grown industries to pop back up on American soil might want to stay away...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not water resistant","review":"We bought this for our son for his birthday. He used it in the pool, and water entered inside the case. It stopped working shortly afterwards. It worked for one month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"It is what my son wanted. He uses it every day and does not need to take it off during his bath time or swimming pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch, it works, but looks cheap","review":"I give these watches to less fortunate kids because the cost is low. I buy may brands and styles from time to time. This one just looks cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother loves it!","review":"I bought this watch for my brother's birthday last year and must've ordered two by accident, because he tells me now (a year later) that he got TWO. Turns out it worked for the better, since after he lost one, he just took the second one. Now, he goes everywhere with that watch. To sleep. Even in the shower. He looves how its waterproof!Great purchase overall :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moisture","review":"The watch is just what I wanted for our camp so that I could have a waterproof watch for the beach. Unfortunately during my 1st time wearing it to our beach last weekend while floating on rafts with some friends, they asked what time it was to rib me about my \\"new water proof watch\\" that I \\"bragged about\\". Well it was working fine and I smiled with satisfaction. However that evening, when taking it off it was clouded up. I was shocked...my arm was draped in the water up to my wrist....so where was the 400' protection? I'll give you all an update when I see how good this company handles defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unisex?","review":"I'm sure the watch is fine. I don't know, I'll never use it. It's called a unisex watch, but the face is really small. I think they should go ahead and call this a woman's watch. I showed it to friends and they agreed. Again, a fine, cheap sports watch, I'm sure. But, if you are a guy, I would keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Watch","review":"I bought this watch for my grandson and he absolutely loves it. It is very stylish looking, yet also durable. Recomend this watch for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a great watch","review":"This watch was purchased for my son who seems to be following in his fathers footsteps!

I couldn't put it down! I went over my friend's house for New Year's Eve, and I ended up reading this book for most of the night! Their love for one another seemed so real! I felt like I was Julie! I was bawling by the end of this book. It left me depressed, in a good and bad way. I keep referring to Luke as if he were a real person! I love the part where Julie finds the flowers Luke planted in the football field and they spell out \\"I Love You\\". This book was a perfect 10! I definitly recommend it, even if it was extremely SAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"When i read this book i was 14. I fell in love with this book and since then 2 years ago i have red her books non stop. i have almost all of them to date. I wish that sometimes i had the unpublished ones. Though the one thing i learned is that nothing can be minor in life. Everything is something.When Luke got sick and Julie stood by him the way she did i thought it was sweet. I hope one day if i ever have to endure something like that, which i may since i too have medical problems and i hope that if i have to get it corrected i have a close \\"friend\\" like that to stand by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!","review":"Lurlene McDaniel has wrote mant books but of all that I have read this one was one of the best.

But while Luke undergoes chemo, Julie stands by her sweethearts side, and is glad to say she loves Luke Mudlenhower. This brilliant novel shows how much one couple has to go through, and there fight to rid this evil war going on in Luke's body. Lurlene McDaniel has truely outdone herself. This novel will make you cry like a baby, but on the last page, you know that everything will work out.
