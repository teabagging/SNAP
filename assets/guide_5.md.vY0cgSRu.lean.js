Their story starts out with the usual light conflict that is expected in Romance novels, but drags the reader throughthe heroine's endless humiliations and physical abuse because of her husband's very heavy-handed manner. There is no pleasure to see a young woman cowering at every turn, but is it especially repulsive to see her accepting this abuse as her fault, and still trying to please this beast. There is far too much spousal abuse in our culture, and to read a \\"Romance\\" where such brutality is condoned is very upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did spouse abuse become a \\"Romance\\"?","review":"If I could give less than a One Star rating, this sorry excuse for a \\"Romance\\" would get it. The slow-moving story of a young woman forced into an abusive marriage just drags on and on. There is the usual amount of friction between the two main characters in ther beginning, but that quickly turns to the young bride being subjected to continuous humiliations and repeated physical punishment at the heavy hands of her loutish husband. However, the most upsetting aspect is that the poor thing actually believes that everything is her fault, and that she deserves the cruelty!! I only finished this book because I thought that, at the conclusion, Adam, the husband, would see the error of this actions, be remorseful and seek to change his behavior and allow his wife with some dignity and kindness. That didn't come about, and I was left with a disgusted impression of the whole mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd also add....","review":"I'd also add that in addition to the physical abuse, I found the hero's behavior to other women deeply disturbing. When the heroine arrives at her new home with her husband, she finds one of the sixteen year old maids is pregnant by her husband. The child is working as a maid at the keep because she was thrown out by her family after the hero seduced her and left her with child. The hero makes no provisions for the girl or his illegitimate child except allowing her to work in the keep, and nothing more is said about her welfare or the outcome for the baby.Even if this did happen in ancient times, (and lets be honest it still happens today) I don't want to read about it in a romance. It's not heroic behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song My Way alone makes this a great CD.","review":"This CD is not especially packed with to many of Sinatra's greatest hits yet this is a powerful CD.

This may also be due to the extreme amount of reverb on his voice and the fact that on some songs he's in dead center in the mix.

People complain that O Yeah! is missing some essential songs such as \\"Train Kept A Rollin',\\" well this does not have it either. They have many of their hits, but there is no reason to get this.

Is it a hits compilation for casual fans who don't want to delve into the albums? Well, seeing as Geffen only owned the band during the second stage of their career, it couldn't be definitive, and the single-disc best-of \\"Big Ones\\" covered the Geffen years quite nicely already. Is it a rarities collection? There are quite a few b-sides and previously unreleased tunes here, but it's mostly re-packaged material from their Geffen albums. Even the live tunes are straight from their recent live record, A Little South of Sanity. So the hardcore fans will have to have it, even if their paying mostly for material they already own - and a few casual fans might pick it up confusing it for a greatest hits collection. Still, it's little more than another contractual obligation of marginal value."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE","review":"I bought this because it distinctly stated in the description that the program was compatible with the Vista OS only to be disappointed to discover that it is not.

I did use it as an iron for little bit till I gave up and stopped carrying it.

What I did was to let this product shipped to my Aunt's address in L.A. and have her sent it to me here in the Philippines. I've been using this product since last month and so far it's working just fine with my clothes. I could also bring Rowenta Steam N' Press during my travel because it's handy enough.

I was so excited that I opted not to buy it online,and instead I headed straight for Target to purchase this iron. I am not sure who gave this iron a great review but I assume that it had to be the marketing staff of Rowenta, because this iron could not even get the smallest of wrinkles out of my cotton shirts.

It's more of a hand held mini iron than a steamer. When hitting the steam button, steam spits out erratically (leaving wet spots on clothes) and water drips down the handle (kinda putting the user at risk for electrocution). If you remove the plastic brush cover (to use the sole plate for ironing), you have the let the unit rest on its side. The container which holds the water is too small.

It constantly leaked water over our clothes, floor, selves when in use, 3. It was always REALLY DIFFICULT to get it to steam, requiring repeated, fast presses of the button until our thumbs were sore, 4. It finally just died today--stopped working for no reason.

The exotic places where the cruise ship stops are a fun escape from the norm, and are populated with stereotypes that reflect the average unseasoned traveler's attitudes towards tropical locations at the time of filming. Although, I feel that only adds to the film's charms as it is essentially an escape into a different world for the average 1940s American. The character actors throughout the film are a snapshot of things as they were before unapologetic stunt casting removed these types of artists from mainstream work. A breezy classic romantic comedy where no amount of mishaps and misadventures can keep the main characters from being happy in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this in a box, tie it with a ribbon, and take it home!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Doris Day!!!

These are all great albums, but the argument could be made that \\"Perfectly Good Guitar\\" is Hiatt at his best. Hiatt always infuses his songs with a sense of fun even when singing about the pitfalls of life, but he really seem to cut loose on this album with some terrific guitar work and some of his most clever lyrics. The title song is one of Hiatt's best - a rock anthem that would be rated with \\"Born to Run\\" and other legendary rock songs if Hiatt got the credit he deserves. This is as good an album as any to pick for an introduction to Hiatt - his clever lyrics will captivate \\"newcomers\\" and leave them wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn up the volume!","review":"John Hiatt's loudest album, you've got to be in the mood for it. When I'm not, I just pick out the exceptional tracks and leave the rest for a loud day. The title track is one of those: a quintessential Hiatt song with howling guitars and sassy, unusual lyrics. \\"Old Habits\\" is the best song on the album though, and almost worth the price on its own. Hiatt gets into an unmatched swamp-groove on this track. Perfect. The rest are mostly good, if sometimes uncharacteristically lacking in light and shade. Only \\"The Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari\\" makes me want to skip on to the next track. So, if you like the Hiatt style, and can stand the extra noise, you'll probably like this well enough, but it wouldn't be my choice of your first ever Hiatt album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiatt's \\"rock\\" album","review":"This is probably the most rock-oriented album John hiatt has made. There is a sloppy, hard-rocking, Crazy Horse feel to a lot of the songs. He also mixes in a few slower songs, and there are his usual clever lyrics throughout. The title song and \\"Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari\\" are both a lot of fun. \\"Old Habits\\" is a great bluesy song that seems ripe to be covered by one of the blues greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Value Investing","review":"This book was not what I expected; may be this geared for the guys starting in investing, this not a good book for advance or intermediate investors who already know the basic of value investing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Simplistic View of a Complex Strategy","review":"This is one of the most useless books on the topic.

Who has a cassette player nowadays anyway. SOOOOO, I can't utilize the purchase. The seller was pretty rude and condescending in his email to me and put the blame on me. The package was torn up pretty bad (he states it was packaged just fine) and it the inside of the plastic baggie the tapes were contained in smelled like cat p***. I had to put it outside in the garage...a month later it still smells like cat p***! THe seller said return it (at my cost). It's not worth my time and effort and the gas money to travel 60 miles to and from our post office (live in a rural area). I ordered a book, not tapes. My invoice even says it's a book!

The book reads as if the author is writing for himself rather than for the reader; the most commonly used word being \\"I\\". Collectors may find some valuable information though the presentation makes the book a below average and boring read. There is a copy of the original 10/22 patent, which is interesting, and some \\"blow up\\" shots showing the firearm parts and assembly in detail. These are the only pluses in the book but can be found in other 10/22 manuals which are much better written than this book. In short, if one is looking for a little history, and some collector information on the Ruger 10/22, this might be a book to consider. If one is a shooter looking for details on how to use, repair or modify this firearm, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASP Fundamentals - Not worth the money","review":"THis isn't even a real book.

However this one, for some reason that I cannot understand, is not a blues album, only a hint of blues put in a sort of soul-pop-rock dish. If you're expecting something in line with the works mentioned above, I strongly recommend, as M. Bernocchi does, to give this CD a listening before buying it. Soul - pop audience might love this album, but for a blues purist like me it falls short of my expectations. When Sean plays blues is really such a big pleasure that I hope he will come back playing true blues very soon.This album is a mixed bag. The tunes \\"Take it easy\\" and \\"Peace of mind\\" are very good in my opinion but not the expected Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not my cup of tea...","review":"I was really impatient to receive this CD that I ordered months in advance as soon as it was published on the Amazon's catalogue. The main reason being that I am a big fan of Sean Costello and I own all his previous albums that I rate, without doubts (all of them!) 5 star. Unfortunately for some reason that I cannot understand this one is not a blues album, but a sort of soul-pop-rock (with a hint of blues) - radio friendly, kind of music that is just not my favourite gender. So if you are expecting, as I was, to buy something in line with his previous works, I strongly suggest you should give this CD a listening before buying. Having said that, it could be that soul - pop audience will love this album. Sean playing is still top-notch and I hope that he will come back playing the \\"blues\\" very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cool New Blues!!!!","review":"I love this new Sean Costello record!It's a cool hybrid of Soul and Blues.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album works","review":"How can anyone be disappointed with this Sean Costello offering? Is it traditional blues? No. But the blues has different sounds and form and this CD, with its up-beat tone, tough chops by Costello, pounding drum rhythm, works ... and works well. The blues don't need to be sad, they can make you want to dance, too. You'll bop your head up and down to this CD and mimic a bass player or a drummer if you like. It's catchy and fun. C'mon guys, lighten up. Clapton, Costello ain't. Why would anyone put the two in the same sentence? He's Sean Costello not trying to be anything but. Give it a whirl, it's good music, done good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a lovely book. Everything in it was period-authentic - even the typefaces used.

So it would be much easier to just buy another mp3 player (at the same price as the Zvue with a 4gb memory card[total of about 180 dollars or so]) at the same price and get 8gb or more and you could probably get a better video player on that mp3.

I like the SD card so later we can swap out entire libraries (or keep videos on other cards indefinitely). Were I to have purchased this for myself, I would have bought the ZVUE 260 for it's looks, but the heavier case seemed appropriate due to his age. My favorite feature is the two headphone jacks.

It's an alternative to reading a 50-page article over the Internet, for example.

Who was the author writing this for? Of course, since I don't know, I speculate. I hope it's appropriate to speculate here on an Amazon review. My speculation is that this author wrote this book to enhance his career. That would make sense and it would work. Few people read books on technical subjects and therefore authoring such a book would be career enhancing without inviting much scrutiny.

The text is somewhat difficult to read aloud in an interesting manner. While the short stories are clever and creative, they are too complex for an average child to comprehend in one reading. The concept of using the absurd to illustrate the proper is slightly abused in this book. The inclusion of the word \\"stupid\\" was in poor taste.

Third time's a charm, because it was at that point that I figured out it was the iron blowing the fuses.

But as you read through the book you see that the author is offering his own perspective based on his own research.I am also curious as to who exactly cooperated with the author on this book. He states that there are many sources that cannot be identified.

Christopher Anderson has written a book that captures the final months of Diana's life and includes comments and quotes from friends who shed light on the Princess' romance with Dodi Fayad and the shock of all those close to her when they learned of her death. Very interesting is the reaction of her former husband, Prince Charles, but also the completely unsympathetic reaction of Queen Elizabeth, who appears to be more concerned with royal jewelry, than with that fact that her grandsons' mother is dead. The book is a fast read, but fills in many of the blanks surrounding the death of Diana. If you were moved by the death of Diana, this is a MUST HAVE book"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was transfixed, but skeptical.","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book. The author covers not only the actions of Diana and Dodi before their fateful night, but the actions of what everyone else was doing at the time of the accident and at the time of her death. This is an easy read, as it reads like an article in the Enquirer. And yes, I found myself transfixed, against my better judgement. I have some questions about the authenticity of some of the information in the book. After all, who is really going to tell the author that Prince Charles was wearing blue pajamas at the time he received the call about Diana. And, I admit to learning more about the actual accident than I wanted to know. All in all, I would recommend the book, but keep in mind that not all the information may be fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking A Novel Approach to Diana's Death","review":"If you are a true Diana admirer and read everything about her that you can get your hands on, this book is a must! Truly captivating! However, I was a bit concerned about the credibility of some of the sources quoted, and when I read something in the first chapted that I felt I knew not to be a true statement, I continued to read the rest of the book as if it were a novel based on fact. I enjoyed it this was very much, and didn't bother questioning details as fact or fiction after that. Thus, the four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth what I paid for it!","review":"A prior passenger had left (probably intentionally) a copy of Anderson's work in my airline seat pocket. With nothing else to occupy my time on a long flight, I read the book. I can't imagine anyone other than a devout royalophile enjoying this tabloid-esque sort of missive. Strictly for \\"Enquiring minds.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"This book took me all of 30 minutes to read...actually, I should say skim. It was like reading an enlongated version of a \\"National Enquirer\\" article. The time spent in the library scanning its pages was worth while only in the sense that I was waiting for a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic pack of hersay and guesswork","review":"In short this book is laughable. If the author is to be believed then he has contacts with every possible person connected to Diana and her death. If this were fiction, it wouldn't be very good fiction, as it is, it claims to be fact, which makes it laughable in the extreme. You'd be better of spending your money on Sleeping Beauty - at least you know that's real fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"Why do people flock to a book like this? They think its a tribute to Diana while they miss what it really is; yet another chance for an otherwise talentless writer to cash in on the tragedy. Her death is now a money making industry in and of itself with every would-be-author jumping into the ring to pump out a quick book and grab some cash. Spare me the \\" it was a tribute\\" or \\"a labour of love\\" excuses. It's greed. Pure and simple.My advice, if you really honestly love the lady and everything she stood for, is stop funding these hack writers, put away your Elton John single, and move on with your life. Just because it has a pretty cover doesn't hide the fact that it's tabloid journalism. Or if you remember, the very thing that helped drive the princess to an early grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much more than was on 'Good Morning America'","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this book and am sorry to say that most of what I read was already talked about on TV or in the papers in the reviews. Although interesting reading, I didn't come away satisfied and still felt I wanted to know more. Realizing that we probably will never know all of the facts, the book does offer interesting commentary from various sources. I question the validity of some of the material presented. A quick read but don't consider it one of my more memorable Diana books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Jackie after Jack.","review":"I had just read Jackie after Jack and was looking forward to this book because I've always been interested in Diana. This book was a waste of time; there's very little that was new in it. Knowing that the Royal family doesn't give interviews, I was very sceptical about some of the scenes described.I think the author has tarnished his well-earned reputation for 'Jack and Jackie' and 'Jackie after Jack' with this book.Diana fans, this is not the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book offers very little new insights into Diana's death","review":"Diana fans will be disappointed with the rehash of material from previous books about her life including the often repeated courtship, marriage and divorce stories that don't mesh with the title of this book. The amount of new information offered here could be covered in a magazine article. I expected something equivalent to The Day Kennedy Was Shot by Jim Bishop. A better book covering Diana's death is Death of a Princess:The Investigation by Sancton and MacLeod."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Swing and a Miss","review":"Christopher Andersen writes one of the most gripping and emotional first chapters I have ever read. However, Andersen needlessly defuses the emotion by rehashing already known facts of Diana's life with her parents, the Royal Family and Charles. Only after wasting lots of pages going over old ground does Andersen get back to the point of the book: The Day Diana died. It would have been a much stronger book had Andersen stuck to his premise, and wrote a day by day account about how the Media, government, public, and Royal family dealt with Diana's death, and how their actions and reactions affect the way the public views Diana, the Royal Family and the media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating - in a National Enquirer Sort of Way","review":"I read the book very quickly, its an easy read. Especially on an interesting subject. It had the potential to be a good factual documentary on one of the most important times in British Modern History.Very National Enquirer-like though, due to the extensive knowledge of details in conversations between, for example, the Queen, and Prince Charles, when they were alone. Also, how does the authour know what colour pyjamas Prince Charles wears? Amazing!By the end of the book, I felt sickened and sad that I had put my money to such a publication. Once again, someone is quick to capitalise on The Princess of Wales' death.I hope her sons never see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Save My Soul","review":"Okay, let's cut to the chase - if you are here, you are here for a reason. Save His Soul, definitely stands out from the rest of the Blues Traveler albums. Although not necesarily for the best, the album rings of a undefined, inquisitive nature. It feels more of an attempt rather than a natural offspring, but nonetheless, still rocks and excites the listener. Trina Magna, Whoops, and Go Out Side & Drive are the principal driving forces off this one, while the harmonica on Fledging is simply beautiful. Some of the songs though are better live - Love and Greed - NY PROPHESIE - for example, and Love of My Live is grows more valuable with each listen. Overall, much more focused delivering the point of J.P. through writing, but essential, to me, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely slow shipment","review":"when I was ordering this book, it mentioned 5 to 7 business days. then after almost 1 and half months, I got this package.

Being the handy guy I am, I sodered the antenna back in place and reassembled the toy. It flew perfectly, for about 7 more flights, and then the engine started cutting out completely after a second or two. This time it wasn't the antenna, and I have no idea what part of the cheap cicuit board inside this flimsy piece of foam went south this time. You know it would have been cool if it had at least survived one day's worth of play, but it didn't! The returns phone number, which is stuck all over the Hovercopter on stickers, was busy constantly, and when I got through they said I could return it, and they would send me a new one for $8.95 shipping and handling - Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... Not bloody likely with this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought this toy","review":"I bought this toy for my son who has been wanting this for over a year. I got it for him and gave it to him for christmas, he played with it for maybe 10 minutes and it broke, to say the least I will never buy a product from this company again, this toy was a total let down and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"Watching the TV commercial for this, you'd think it was both more durable and easier to control. The remote for it is almost useless, it doesn't control what direction the hovercraft goes, only the elevation. My son was SO looking forward to this, now I wish we'd never have bought it. The foam that the copter is made of isn't made for durability, and you have to be sure the surface you launch this item is FLAT.. or it won't have the lift to get into the air. In short, WASTE OF MONEY...."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was fun while it lasted","review":"well i got this and it was sooooo cool when it broke it started to go side ways all the time i think idf your getting it you need to get the more expensive one"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I got one of these hoover copters for Christmas. Took it out of the box loaded it up with the batteries it wouldnt even fly the controler was apeice of junk. Had a hard time getting the toy store to take it back. Wasnt worth the 20 that was paid for. My friend got on too his did fly but after a few min the propeller would slip there for it wouldnt fly. My opinion it was a worthless peice of junk. Dont waist your money on this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"We cannot even get this toy off the ground. My son really wanted this and when we tried to fly it the thing would go all over the place and crash into everything and when we took it outside we didn't realize that the motor was not even protected and it went upside down in the snow and went crazy. My son is really disapointed. We are returning it and getting something else, save you're money and the gas to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable...","review":"The toy was a lot of fun but would loose charge somewhat quickly. Ok though cause the charge time was about 15min. Was unhappy though when the plastic teeth / gears stripped in the motor or something. So after about 2 days of playing with it it's now somewhat of a very expensive piece of trash. My little one was also very disappointed that it had broken so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junkie but cool","review":"This product only lasted for 1 day! I played with it 10 times and it stopped working. Then it worked again. Then it broke! Two days later I threw it in the garbage!!! Don't buy this thing. I made a mistake. I'm getting the Air Hogs copter instead. Also, this isnt made by Spinmaster. It's made by some company called Overbreak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, overpriced toy","review":"Very short flying time, made very poorly, very shotty toy. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a spined toy?","review":"We never see it spin.We bought it this moning. Follow the manual, we charged the hovercopter for 15 mins, the light on the hovercopter can be twinking, but it didn't spin. So we charged it for 15 mins more, it still can't move. Then I test the 9v battery in the controller. It is in good condition. So i charged the hovercopter for half hour. It still liked a sculpture.After discussing with my 4-years-old son, we agree that this might be not a spined toy. so we will reture it tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but good","review":"It's definately a unique toy. My son and I had lots of fun with it. Three flaws is that it's hard to use under the slightest wind conditions. The head cover isn't durable enough and the play times are short. It does just as advertixed with the 30ft up, but whenever it falls it always lands on it's head. Since there's hard surfaces around housing areas, it's gonna land on it sometimes. CRACK! Good thing is it still works. Then there's the playtime. It only needs 15 minutes to charge, but u only get about 8-10 minutes of pure flight time before time to charge the copter again. It's worth trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"My 10 year old loved this toy, however, we have only had it two days and already have returned it twice. The first time it just stopped going up and down (which is really all it does) for no reason after a few uses. The second time, it landed on its side (which it often does) and it again stopped working. Luckily, we live close to the store.Don't waste your money unless you enjoy standing in line to return it time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly made","review":"Add me to the list of people whose Hover Copter broke without reason.

Fragile construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"We saw this toy in a store in NYC, and we thought it was awesome. We got home and ordered it, and it's a piece of crap. The thing only holds a charge for a few minutes! It barely flies at all, and can only fly up and down, not to the side. My 7 and 8 yr old played with it for two minutes, and then got bored. It crash lands so hard, it's almost impossible not to damage it. The only part my kids liked were the flashing lights. Not only do you have to charge it up with a power cord, but the remote takes batteries and so does the copter itself, so powering it can cost a small fortune! I read the reviews, and went ahead and bought it anyway, and I'm sorry I did. It's totally not worth the money. Don't make the same mistake I did in getting your kids' hopes up. Pass this one by.

The mix of comedy and mystery is really unique. You don't see stuff like this that much. Also Jeremy Davies (Yes, the Dr. Daniel Faraday), is hilarious! I really liked him in all of his movies like Saving Private Ryan, CQ, etc. and this performance is right up there. Funny, charming, and you care about him. Supporting cast is good all around. It is shot well. And the dead cold winter of new york city is a perfect metaphor for the hidden coldness of people and the decisions they make.

While not as incredibly as intense--or heart-rending--as Rabbit Boss, his previous novel, this is a gripping story with fascinating characters and puts wartime jingoism and xenophobia into an intensely personal light. This is a writer who pulls no punches and can be utterly unsentimental. He has an exceptional command of detail and pulls the reader along into a complex but believable web of intrigue. Sanchez always avoids cliches (I wish I could!) and avoids a polemic, making his point in an engaging and thrilling story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not unless you are on a desert island...","review":"... should you be tempted to read this book. The subject matter, WWII, Los Angeles in it's \\"noir\\" heyday, the Zoots, the California cults, and a gumshoe, all make it sound pretty intriguing. But Sanchez does not have control of his material, it does not cohere, the \\"center does not hold.\\" Even though the bare-bones plot could work and Sanchez has a good grip on the Los Angeles of that era, his characters are not even as dimensional as cardboard. And Sanchez gets quite carried away with his verbal pyrotechnic assaults. It's another book that makes one long for serious editorial guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Christmas Gift","review":"My son started paging through this cookbook right after he opened the gift at Christmastime.

Having read Adrianas \\"JB the art of cooking\\" from the library, buying this book from editor Gene Ray was certainly the best way to go. The book is similar to, but more accessible than, the Critique of Beuys from the tate series. It contains however, the vital \\"Twilight of the Idols\\" by benjamin Buchloh which, if nothing else reveals some of the misconceptions and horrors that beuys provoked...but it offers another article by Buchloh, written 20 years later that acts almost as a retraction. the presentation and the much needed balance of argument makes this book an absolute must for anyone, from any level of understanding to purchase.

This is not a war story, but If you are interested in gaining a better understanding of the Vietnam war, I beleieve you will learn more from \\"Word of Honor\\" and \\"Up Counrty\\" than from any text book...

If you've read one of his other books, and are looking for your next one - you can't go wrong with this one! It's outstanding! There's enough on the storyline in these reviews, so no sense in re-hashing. Notice one thing...most all Demille's book's are in the mid 4-star range and reviewed by large numbers of \\"avid\\" readers. It's hard to find many other authors with that consistant of a track record (and, unlike Grisham, he knows how to \\"end\\" a good book!). His style and characters are unforgettable.

Just the best read ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of DeMille's best","review":"Nelson DeMille can be very inconsistent in my opinion, but this is one of his better books. Despite the fact that it's about a truly ugly subject, it holds up extremely well as entertainment. Furthermore, it truly changed the way I viewed it's subject... the Viet Nam War, and the people who fought it.The protagonist is a fairly obstinate and aggravating character - an ex-army lieutenant who commanded a platoon in Viet Nam, and is now a civilian and a married, successful businessman. He's filled with so much anger about the war, that he's unreasonable with everyone, including his own family, which often makes his behavor less than sympathetic. Believable, though - a very interesting read and a page turner. A good story, and a convoluted but credible mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and interesting experience","review":"This book is fiction, thank God! I'd hate to know something like that happened even though I know that it could have. I'm ahead of myself here, you need to know that this is a story about the aftermath of an incident in the war in Viet Nam. Although fiction, it gives a sobering look into the feelings and attitudes about that war and the effect it had on all of us. Maybe you would rather forget the war, but you'll find this author can make you smile with his wit, cringe at times but enjoy his style of writing while broading your knowledge of military justice. I have read other books by Nelson DeMille and will read more. He is my kind of writer, one who entertains while broading your knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointed DeMille fan","review":"This book is a let down. I like DeMille because his characters and well developed and true to life. The characters in this book are truly under developed and dull. In fact in the third part of the book there is almost no character development it is just a long trail with the same story told several diffrent ways.I waited for this book to pick up and be the usual fast paced DeMille I love, but it never did. Skip this and read The Gold Coast or The Generals Daughter instead. They are better reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of Demille but this was his worst effort, in my opinion.

I read it in 2009 after having read most of DeMille's novels that have the John Corey character. Basically, the lead character in Word of Honor (Ben Tyson) is a tough guy like Corey, but without the jokes. The guy is a sullen, humorless, self-absorbed jerk and I wanted to punch him. Totally unsympathetic character. I love following Corey around as he smart-alecks his way through the world and never backs down. It's hilarious. Ben Tyson is just an a-hole and the basic topic of this book is just not relevant anymore and there are better explorations of it by other authors, if you care to tread down that whole post-vietnam downer again. Basically, there's no reason to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word of Honor","review":"Different from his other novels. He usually has some humour but not in this book. A bit confusing at first but otherwise a good read. Makes you want to know more about the Tet offensive in Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for those who have forgotten the pleasure of reading","review":"I had the good fortune to see the film Caine Mutiny recently. Word of Honor has often been compared to this seminal work and while it is easy to see where such comparison arises I personally found Word of Honor to be better! Unlike Caine Mutiny, I found myself feeling a degee of empathy for all the characters in De Mille's book. Also, the author is highly insightful with regard to human nature and the way we DO respond to situations rather than the way we would like to respond. Combine this with a sharp wit and blistering narrative and you have without doubt one of the best books of the last decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY ON MY LIST OF TOP FIVE BOOKS OF ALL TIME","review":"I thought Charm School was the best Demille book until reading Word of Honor. This story is believable, intelligent, and totally engrossing. The only chance I get to read is on the railroad commuting to work. Unfortunately work interfered greatly with my reading. This book was extremely hard to put down. It made me laugh, cry and THINK. I have told everyone I know to read this story, but will not lend the book to anyone. I want to keep it in good condition so I can read it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Charm School and Gold Coast - This is his best","review":"My first exposure to Nelson DeMille was this book and it is, by far, his best.

It was lacking the action scenes you find in some of his other works, but it was more \\"thought provoking\\".I loved the characters, and the way he revealed the plot a little at a time to keep the reader going. I consider it a good sign that it was 700+ pages, kept my interest the entire time, and some plot lines could have been even more detailed.Overall a great DeMille book. Not my favorite of his, but I'd rather read anything of his than most any other author's best. I love his writing style, and his dialog is always flawless. I never have to reread a section of his text because I didn't get what he was trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding glimpse of history and our national soul!","review":"With some doubt about reading the novel I started and couldn't put it down. With present conditions balanced with literary flashbacks, Demille provides a continually unfolding understanding of the events and characters of the story.

I have read three Demille novels and I will read all of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER DEMILLE WINNER","review":"I implore u to read this book. It is terrific. 700+ pages and I promise you you will want more. Ben Tyson's wit, his lawyer, his wife, the need to know more...it's everything you can ask for in a thriller.

This book is poorly put together, jumps around topics, has confusing explanations, and the incomplete code segments don't help much... I'll think twice about buying another Sam's book.

I am a Project Manager and the information on security was worth the cost of the book. Once I was a Methods Engineer and the book talks about electromagnetic snooping and best of all it gives recommendations on a secure internet system.

Overall, it is fairly comprehensive, with discussions about portfolio planning, stock research, technical analysis, and stock market theories.

But that all changed with this cd, I took notice then, and now, it still holds up. It starts out rockin, with HEARTS DONE TIME, and MAGIC TOUCH. Both have a touch of \\"good\\" classic Aerosmith, with a touch of newness. But DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY has the Aerosmith feel all over it, it's hard not to play your air guitar, and strutt around on this song. It's right up there with DREAM ON, and WALK THIS WAY. ST. JOHN, and HANGMAN'S JURY, are slower songs, but not ballads, and come off nice and easy. Angel has the big the big power ballad feel to it. And RAG DOLL, has a good beat going for it. There are some stinkers on this cd, SIMORIAH, and the instrumenatl at the end, and I'M DOWN. But over all not a bad comeback cd, to my favorite part of their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT garbage","review":"Anyone who calls this album garbage needs to lighten up, or at least get a good girlfriend. \\"Heart's Done Time\\" is a great opener. \\"Angel\\" is a terribly underrated power ballad, and I DO mean \\"power\\", as in hard, pounding guitars. \\"Dude (looks like a lady)\\" is great, clean fun. \\"Janie's got a gun\\" is a masterpiece. Get this album, or at the very least, a hits collection with the 3 singles from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Am I the only Aerosmith fan who thinks that everything recorded after 'Live Bootleg' is complete trash? Sad to say it, but Aerosmith recorded their best stuff when Steven and Joe were completely wrecked out of their minds on chemicals...not that I wish they'd start up again, that is (even tho Steven can't seem to stop drifting in and out of rehab)...'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)' is the most nerve-wracking of the whole mess...the sax in it sounds like a goose getting its neck wrung. 'Rag Doll' is almost as bad...where's the heaviness of 'Rocks'? Where's the biting sneer of 'Hand That Feeds'? Some bands outstay their welcome because their legions of old-time fans either don't have the heart to realize that they have become completely irrelevant, or their newer fans don't know the difference between the classic stuff they recorded and the rehashed and inferior stuff they record today. Aerosmith has gone on for about 15 years too long...say goodnite, boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerosmith or Air Supply ????????","review":"If this what you get when you stop doing drug's, I've got one thing to say.

GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh.....NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't believe that this album is what helped them regain their popularity again. It just baffles me. This album goes against everything and I mean EVERYTHING that Aerosmith stands for. It does have a \\"few\\" pleasant moments though. Hangman Jury, Heart's Done Time, the Movie and probably the highlight of the record, I'm Down; which of course is a cover of the Beatles song, which is almost, note for note, identical to the Beatles. The other stuff is just WAY too pop and polished for my Aerosmith taste.

With this huge hit cd. It had no less than 4 big hits on it. 'love in a elevator' , 'angel' and 'ragdoll\\" and the huge hit 'dude looks like a lady\\". But this one just zings through will lots of wonderful riffs and a band who were obviously having fun. This isn't hard metal but rather great hard rock or just rock songs that have the hooks to lift you up! I like it much better than 'done with mirrors' and that was not a bad cd in the least , it's just that this one is far more well made and played and everythin is firing here like a well oiled machine made up of five guys who know how to make good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language.Sex.Violance:Other? Other What?","review":"I truly believe that there is no other band out today that has the raw energy and talent of the Stereophonics. I have followed them from the beginings to LSV:O? Kelly has a distinct and beautiful way of writing,structure, and thought of melody that compares to that of the famed duo of Lennon & McCartney.Change is enevitable ofcourse, and some would say, the root of a successful band is diversity. However, this CD is not the Stereophonics I think of. Where are the melodies? where are the stories within the lyrics? where is the passion behind the music? The title of this CD is quite apt, with the ending of \\"Other?\\" because that is what I am wondering. Please give me something \\"other\\" than what sounds like a bad day stuck in an elevator with this playing for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp progress","review":"The band is in great form here, fans of mellower tunes may balk a bit, but I feel this is the CD they will rise with. Great guitars and as always super vocals from Kelly Jones. I have not stopped listening to it since its arrival. Buy this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereophonics new direction","review":"I think this new Stereophonics album is relly good but it is quite different from their 4 previous recordings. Kelly Jones has taken the band in a new direction with his lyrics and a harder sound this time. \\"Dakota\\" is the one song that has the most familiar style to some of their older material. For anyone who has become a fan of their music and liked the sound of earlier songs, it may take several listenings to get used to the new tracks. Stereophonics are like any other band, trying new things and experimenting to stay fresh and avoid sounding too predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rocking joy.","review":"There's some great stuff on this. Some of it's a little poppy, like Dakota, but for all out ball crunching rock, take a listen to Deadhead or Devil - Devil's just superb.

Terrific stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Okay, I bought it for \\"Dakota\\", which is gut-wrenching and makes me sob. The rest of the tracks are different, but awesome. His vocals are incredible. And the guitars. Oh, my heart skips a beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crunching. Breezyness. Some Catchiness. Other?","review":"They're Welsh, and listening to their music, you can tell--which makes it seem a lot more attractive than it really is. It's distant (\\"Devil\\"), and sentimental (\\"Rewind\\"), and breezy (\\"Dakota\\"), and sometimes pretty (\\"Lolita\\"), and sometimes it's almost catchy (\\"Brother\\"). So I'll like it, sure, but it's going to be hard to take seriously an album with the lyric \\"Suck my banana/Suck it with cream.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Before You Buy","review":"I had never heard of the Stereophonics before Live8 but was taken by the song \\"Dakota\\". Regrettably, I raced out and bought the album without listening to the rest of it first. I am not saying this is necessarily bad music but, if you are expecting to hear an album full of songs similar to Dakota, you will be disappointed. The album obviously appeals to some but I found it monotonous and lacking variety in sound and song style. The sound has a hardness to it and seems under-engineeered with louder passages becoming a matter of volume over quality. You may love it but go and listen to the whole album first. In retrospect, I should just have bought the single of Dakota."},{"rating":"1","title":"LANGUAGE,SEX,VIOLENCE,GARBAGE","review":"Ouch.i just bought this yesterday.i really regret the 19 euros i paid for it.thankfully i also bought The Beautiful South's Miaow for 1.05 euros too..The latter was a lot better than this garbage.Theres only 2 decent songs in here.Dakota and Lolita.Guys it's time you split up.once you were a great alternative band.Now you're a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese Junk!

Possibly not the best for a complete beginner, but if you've seen a little Python before, it does a wonderful job.

If you have a two belt system in you car, like most cars today (lap & shoulder all in one) they both have to go thru the loop on the harness making an uncomfortable harness even more so. I finally took an old collar of my dogs and ran it thru the little steel loop on the harness, then thru the shoulder portion on the seat belt. The harness is hard to adjust for fit and is hot for the dog. My Chihuahua just hates it. I used it twice & it will probably now go to the Goodwill store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"It might just be my dog, but this thing did not work for me at all.

I bought one thinking I'd save but in a long run I lost, because it is so inacurate that it becomes a joke. The reading greatly depends on how far your lips are from that hole that you need to blow in. Here's an example: first time I blew 0.9, a couple seconds later it became 1.7 and the third time it was 0.6. I cannot imagine anyone trusting this kind of reading. I think I'm going to invest into a little bit more expensive model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"I get different readings every time. This is true within seconds of one reading.

I would never drive on three beers anyway, but I wanted to see how my light 160lb body handled three brewskies. Apparently I had plenty of room for more! The readout said 0.00 as though I hadn't touched a drop.Amazing! I wondered how many I would have to drink just to register a number, any number. Quite a lot I found out later. But even then I failed to reach anywhere near the legal limit according to the AlcoMate. Maybe I just got a bad one.

I met with some friends at a bar and we proceeded to start testing the device, following the directions to the letter, -and despite that- the readings would vary depending on not only how forcefully you blew into the sensor, but also how far your mouth was; even varying minor distances. This product is NOT fit for consideration or for accurate readings, not to mention the cheap quality feel of the build materials. Thankfully I was able to return it, but for those browsing; the device shouldn't be trusted for more than a dollar; and even then the money would be better spent towards another pint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping safe","review":"I want to enjoy life.. but do not want to be over the legal limit...

If you're one of those people, Enterprise Integration Patterns is an important addition to your toolkit.Chapter 2 takes the reader through the integration efforts of a fictional enterprise to demonstrate some of the patterns in action.

The biggest limitation of Vol. I was its lack of the original Latin text used in the translation. Vol. II remedies some of this shortcoming by providing a very detailed itemization of Latin sentences against the translation.

To me every song works and flows gently into the next, revealing additional layers of depth and beauty to Van's journey. The production here is warm and inviting, and the musicianship top-notch, punctuated by Mark Knopfler's tasteful guitar and Mark Isham's pipes.Although there are other Van albums for other moods, ones that may have more upbeat songs or more spirited performances, it is Beautiful Vision that to me holds up and warrants repeated listens.

What astounds me is how they managed to talk a couple of decent actresses into even being in this thing!! Frankly, this movie is SO bad, it makes Ishtar look like Casablanca.

I like raunchy comedy, but this did not even qualify. I got to the scene of the perverted puppet wizard - and deleted it. Somebody thought that you can throw some foul language, gross comments and bad jokes together and come up with a good, raunchy comedy. Well, a swing and a miss on this one.

McBride and Franco tried to add humorous delivery to not-so-humorous lines, and Portman gave us her best buxom badass babe impression. In the end, I only laughed at this because I'm a complete fantasy nerd, and even then I found myself ready for the credits. Some great one-liners, a few good funnies, but otherwise a pass.

The cast, for the most part seem to be phoning in their performances, there's even one guy playing a barbarian whose acting is so terrible his one and only line sounds as if he's reciting a shopping list.

It worked great for making an exact copy of my DVD's. The only problem is that it seems to have a problem finalizing the disks. If you are burning to DVD+R or DVD-R's this is a big problem. A regular DVD player won't play a DVD+R or -R unless it is finalized. THe + and - RW's work fine.After trying this software, I downloaded DVD CLoner to give it a shot, and I was impressed. It is not anything special, but if you jst want to make cpies of your DVD's, and don't care about the flashy software, then go with DVD Cloner.

While the program is relatively simple to use, you don't have complete control over everything, like taking out separate audio or video streams in order to fit everything on 1 disc. It seems to me like 321 Studios just didnt try hard enough, and it can be extremely frustrating when the program tells you that you have to make a second dvd disc to include a 5 minute special feature.

The problem is not with the program, it is the type of DVDs used in the originals.Notice that the movies that fit onto one disc were older movies. These movies were put on DVD before the newer, double-sided/double density DVDs were being used. Now that they are being used for newer movies, the movie companies are able to put more information and better quality movies onto one disc. However, the DVD-R's that you use to burn a movie are only single sided/single density. That is, they only hold about 4.7 GB of data instead of 9 GB.

John Fulton Reynolds who, while commander of the left wing of the Army of the Potomac on July 1, 1863, became the first general officer killed at Gettysburg. Brother William was then a Navy commander and senior officer afloat at Port Royal, SC under Admiral Dahlgren. He was to go on to become an admiral and even acting Secretary of the Navy--twice. This book contains his letters home during the 4-year U. S. Navy Exploring Expedition (the Wilkes Expedition). It also interweaves entries from both his official and personal journal and responses from home--mostly from sister Lydia. Anyone with an interest in the pre-Civil War Navy or even social life (in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, his home) will find this book extremely informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"Just got back from 3 months with this book in SA...Plusses:Great Maps...LP maps are the best guidebook mapsLots of Choices for Hostels/Restaurants...they aren't too detailed but do typically offer a lot of places, while Let's Go will offer 4 or 5 per city.Everyone has got it, you'll find a lot of people to hang out with when going to their recos.Minuses:Everyone has got it, perhaps you don't want to run into a lot of gringos.Doesn't cover lots of small towns which are great to visit...yes of course this is a book that tries to cover a CONTINENT so it's not going to have everything, but I found Footprints SA book to be significantly more comprehensive.A bit out of date...new one is forthcoming, I believe.Overall I would recommend Footprint's SA Handbook instead, although the maps do leave a bit to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"tools","review":"These were not what I expected and could have easily bought an impact set that was deep throat to serve the same need"},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"The dress is really pretty, but it's too long for it's size.

The clarity of the picture was really good, the sound was excellent...we thought we had made a great choice.Unfortunately, after carefully storing the system away in it's original packaging for a few months, we took it out to use for another car trip. Not more than 20 minutes into using it for only the second time, the second screen stopped working. It just went black and that was the end of it. After attempting to figure out if we had hooked it up wrong, we finally gave up and decided to use just the one screen. About 45 minutes into the movie, the screen became very dark, too dark to see anything that was playing, though we could still hear the audio. So, it was useless to us for the entire trip.

Protein and starch in the big slot (i.e. meat loaf and mashed taters). Small slots get a cooked veg, fruit, and a salad or raw veg. We're not much on desserts, but the smaller middle slot would be helpful in portion control for someone who tends to overdo on the sweets. Couldn't be happier with these. They clean up so easily I usually just hand wash because I don't run my dishwasher that often.Amazon must have noted the negative reviews due to breakage.

It doesn't take skill so much as patience. The reason why is because you can't control camera angles which goes all over the place, from birds-eyed view to a full shot of your character running at you. Useless camera angles are detrimental when you're trying to jump or manuever around. Since depth perception is off at times, some things take multiple tries to succeed. My son enjoys it, but I don't. Unfortunately, I have to manuever most parts for him. No matter how smooth I perform, I usually get nauseous because of the jumpy camera angles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Kids and fun for adults too!","review":"When I bought this game for my kids, I had no intentions of everplaying this game myself.

It certainly features Adams' best songs like \\"Run to you\\", \\"Somebody\\" and the ever famous \\"Everything I do (I do it for you)\\" (This song actually made the top 100 of the best songs of all time).

Above all that the frame rate is awful, every minor load will slow or stop the game for 1-3 seconds, the audio from time to time will feel off, sometimes you'll hear an explosion from your grenade well after it already blew up. Overall this game had serious potential, i wanted to love this game, i waited since june for this release and was very disappointed.Pros: Current story with elements of the war on terrorism,The Shooting controls work well.Cons: Framerate holds you back from enjoying the game,the squad commands are not well utilized, Short campaign (6-7 hrs)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"I bought this game for the PS3 and let me preface that by saying that many magazines and websites said that the PS3 version was the best release.That said this game is horrible. It's virtually unplayable even on the PS3 because the frame rate is terrible. Any little sort of action and the screen slows down and becomes choppy.Not only that but I played it for about 3 hours and I'm halfway done. Let me see, I played GTA4 for 40 hours and I'm only 50% finished. Probably played 1/2 Life 2 for 20 hours to complete that.So my point is that to begin with this game is only average but factor in the frame rate problems and the length and you have a 1 or 2 star game at best.One thing that really upset me was that Blacksite wasn't even as good are the original Area 51 for the PS2 in length, story quality, and graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"raising Able","review":"I found this to be thought provoking and plausible.

Now that he's on his own and making a name for himself not only as a drummer, but an incredibly talented musician, I can only be grateful this record is already out. \\"reminder\\" is filled with plenty of moody ambiences and rhythms, and the songs are gourgeously crafted to fit the proper feel of the album. The music reminds me of a darker NIN, like something off of The Fragile, only moodier. It definitely has a dark and grim feel to it, and is perfect to listen to at night or on a very rainy day. This is one of those few records you can play over and over again and not tire from it. The songs are relatable to human emotion, and if there was a theme to the record, it would be just human emotion. It captures it nicely.This is by far the best purchase I've ever made, and look forward to hearing more from Mr. Dillon in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NIN spin-off","review":"Richard Patrick had filter Chris Vrenna had tweaker. Although somewhat entertaining, these groups never sounded really GOOD. Now Jerome Dillon has nearLY. First off, I feel I should give some background. Long long ago, on a web site far far away, there was news of a project with Trent Reznor and 12 Rounds dubbed Tapeworm. This project never came to light and left many with drool in their hands. Secondly, I should say that although I love Nine inch Nails, I was immensly disappointed with the new album \\"With Teeth\\". It felt lackluster and immature.Now with \\"reminder\\", I feel that not only has the Tapeworm project seen light, but also I feel that this is more of a NIN album than the last actual NIN album.nearLY is beautiful, with moody arrangements, and structures found in Reznor's best work. It is also a co-project with 12 Rounds front woman Claudia Sarne.Jerome may have just been a drummer (mostly for tours), but on this release he proves that he is much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work!!!","review":"Hi, I'm from Poland, I've been a huge NIN fan since a long long time.

It's got witty dialogue, a wonderful ensemble cast, including Pegg and Frost but also Jason Bateman (I just laugh looking at him at this point and I mean that in the best way possible) and one of my all-time favorites, Kristen Wiig, who is slightly underused in this movie, yet she shines. The bonus features alone are worth the money. This being the unrated version, many scenes are fleshed-out much better than in the theatrical version as well. Fun little weekend dvd to have around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quote possibly one of the funniest movies I've seen.","review":"Simon Pegg can do no wrong. He expertly blended dry British humor with the brasher, slapstick-level American comedy in Paul, complete with dick jokes, people wetting themselves and the mocking of bible thumpers. The extended version is worth it just to see Jason Bateman say \\"Check that\\" when speaking to what's her name's father. His deadpan humor, while playing the same character in everything he's in, is spot on every time I see it. I can't help it; I love Jason Bateman and his execution just doesn't get old for me. As much I loved the pure British wit of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz Pegg got it right in Paul, playing to audiences on both sides of the pond. I laugh my butt off every time I watch this movie. I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and fast!","review":"Got this movie brand new and it only took a few days to receive it.

Some I could deal with but there was just too much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I bought Paul on a whim as I like science fiction and liked Hot Fuzz. I was not in the least disappointed. I loved it and have watched it several times now and each time I pick up on a new insight of Paul's character and the quirks and gestures of Seth Rogan that in each viewing makes it even more funny. I noted that the majority of negative reviews are based on religion. \\"You just can't win with these people.\\" If you are religious this movie is not going to change your views. Sometimes you just have to \\"roll the dice\\" and go with it. Enjoy it for what it is. Paul is not real, although I surely wish he was."},{"rating":"2","title":"So freaking funny","review":"I saw this in the movies and I begged my husband to take me to see it again every night for weeks after.

This movie tries to be a buddy-nerd bonding movie and it fails in that sub-genre. To be a movie about nerds or geeks the characters have to have dialogue that is ecclectic and esoteric. The characters have to say things that other geeks and nerds would understand and find interesting but that most people wouldn't. In this movie there are no references to STOS, STNG, STV, Star Wars, Soylent Green, Planet of the apes, Thunderbirds, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker, et al. There is one running gag about a fictional writer. There is also a long diatribe agianst Christianity(although oddly nothing about Islam.) For a movie about UFO's I wonder why they didn't have Art Bell do a cameo. The protaganists in this movie might be geeks but we don't know because they never talk about anything that would be vaguely interesting to another geek. They never mentioned D&D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul the movie","review":"After watching Paul I decided I wanted my own copy with all the extra's. This fit the bill and the wallet.

Shaun of the Dead did it for the zombie genre, Hot Fuzz did it for the cops genre, and now comes Paul tackling the genre of alien films. Funny, smart, interesting, all in all a great movie, with a great cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has moments of potential","review":"The british actors aren't strong enough to carry the movie, and neither is the kiddie alien.

Very Funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul - Great Comedy From The Shaun Of The Dead Crew","review":"Paul is an enjoyable comedy/alien film from the minds of Shaun Of The Dead. There are indeed some parts that are stupid, and some objectionable material. But overall it's a fairly good movie worth a watch. Are there things that might offend religious people, yes. But they have been offending intelligent people for centuries. Anyone can sit down and write a good fiction Book. This is relatively good sci-fi. Watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"I saw the movie Paul at a pre screening and enjoyed it so much I purchased it. I felt the movie was done in good taste. There was a continuous flow in the movie. They picked the right voice to play the part of Paul. It is hard to belive that the animated alien and the humans weren't really in the scene together. There was no time that you didn't believe they were together.

Biggest joke was about a female alien with three .... - and that joke was repeated throughout the movie. Horrible script. Rogen's character was crude and unentertaining.

Greatest sin of a comedy is being unfunny and mean. I am a big fan of Hot Fuzz and Sean of the Dead - both of which are very funny because they retain just a bit of warmth. This one is cold and silly in an unfunny way. The treatment of american religion is grotesque."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"aliens are awesome.

It is definitely adult humor though. I'm a fan of X-Files and UFO anything, so this was a very fun time for me. I've watched it several times and each time I catch more of the humor. The unrated version is quite different from the version I saw in the theatre. It had alot more homosexual references, which made it go down a notch for me. But other than that it was a very funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Must See!\\"","review":"Once a year some fabulous movie comes along,that you have to see.Well this is it FOLKS, \\"PAUL\\" is a must own DVD.

Childrenand Adults will get a kick out of it. THANKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda anyone?","review":"I enjoy comedy. This movie had lots of funny bits in it and the crass humor that i expected for this genre of movie and all was well until the introduction of a \\"Christian\\" female character in the movie. The movie suddenly became less about a foul mouthed alien and more about God bashing and pushing an atheist agenda. It also portrayed Christians as imbecilic and fools. As a Christian I love to laugh and i really enjoy comedies. This movie had some of my favorite characters in it but i simply couldn't get past all the bashing of the belief in God. 95% of Americans believe that there is some form of God, and i believe that this movie could have been plenty funny without flagrantly calling us all fools. It was very offensive to me and i simply stopped watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"One word can sum up this film...disappointment.With \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost broke the mold for zombie-comedy films. The gore was ancillary to the development of the characters and to the two main characters' friendship. You really wanted those two to survive.\\"Hot Fuzz\\" broke the mold again. This time for police comedies. The humor was most often very subtle and natural.What the heck happened with their new collaboration \\"Paul\\"? We went from character development and ingenious humor in the previous films to bathroom humor and bigotry. In addition, the film was so long that any interest in the final scene was roughly grounded away.I do hope that Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost will join together in the future for another production...this time minus the toilet humor, toilet banter, toilet gags...and bigotry.Skip this flick and watch \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"just a dumb movie.

This is neither. If you enjoy a retread of the most banal \\"humor\\" summer teen movies have done much better, and you love to bash on entire groups of people--Southerners and Christians, in this case--in a hate-filled, demeaning manner, this may seem like entertainment to you.I attended the movie with people who are not Southerners, and they felt uncomfortable at the sweeping and continual condemnation of those who are different from themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a much better movie, but...","review":"The makers decided to turn it into an anti-Christian rant.

There have been a few good ones and many many past flops. If anyone could do it, I was sure it would be Seth Rogan. I've loved almost everything he's been in and with this current streak, I thought he couldn't lose, but with Paul, he did. The story was original, but it was so out there that it crosses the line from funny to stupid and then doesn't go far enough to get back to funny. Paul is supposed to be this humanized alien, whose raunchy and outrageous, but the truth is he was like a hyper-active 12 year old. As for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, they are dry and confusing, nothing new there. The only thing of interest in this film is really the cameos, so a I'd like to give a big thanks to Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch, Sigourney Weaver, Blythe Danner, & Jeffery Tambor for adding something of interest to an otherwise awful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like sci-fi you won't get it","review":"As a life long sci-fi fan, this movie was hilarious. Just about every sci-fi movie in the last 20 years was spoofed, and you'll be laughing out loud at all the references. On the other hand, if you didn't watch all the sci-fi movies and tv shows from the 80s and 90s, you won't get it.

The word \\"fag\\" is used at least four times that I counted in the movie's duration. Even Sigourney Weaver says it. The alien Paul is pretty annoying and I got no laughs from him whatsoever. Really, Kristin Wiig is the only bright spot here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A religion bashing comedy?","review":"I am not a Bible thumper holier than thou kinda guy, but this movie was not funny. I never did laugh out loud or even smile at this movie. I enjoyed all the other movies with these two actors in, but this was just plain bad writing. I am glad I just rented it. If you are curious I would suggest renting before buying. The whole religion bashing added into the middle of this movie does not add anything to the film. I think they put it in there just for the little bit of talk time/interest it would provide. There whole argument against religion is basically religion = Idiot non religion = smart cartoon alien. No smart funny banter for pros/cons of each belief. The key word in that last sentence being funny. rent this or just skip it there really nothing to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, love their other movies... I am not a Seth Rogen fan(other than Knocked Up and Superbad) and his director friends just seem to wanna carry his shtick for as long as they can, even if its animated. You can really see he tries to hard and has to swear even more to pry laughs out....Other than that, he does not necessarily drag the movie down, its pretty much the most unfunny movie of the Pegg and Frost movies. It has laughs here and there and unfortunately I laughed harder in one scene without any of the 3 main stars. Its a rental but don't get your expectations up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny.","review":"This is one of the dumbest Sci Fi comedies I've ever seen. I can laugh at slapstick and silly jokes but this wasn't even funny ever. This could have been a really great comedy but the jokes got old after about 4 minutes and seemed like they were the same jokes over and over and mostly vulgar. Can anybody make a comedy today without resorting to being vulgar? Seemed like this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on Pegg's recent popularity. Well not so popular anymore. If you watch the trailer then you'll see ALL the funny parts, seriously that is all there is. If you like really dumb, stupid and vulgar comedy then you will certainly enjoy this movie. If on the other hand you are looking for real comedy then skip this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is so much more than ROLL TO ME!","review":"Twisted is a great album, as are all the Del Amitri albums. This album contains many great songs. I think the opening song, Food for Songs is one of the Best opening tracks I have ever heard on an album. Tell Her and Here and Now, and Driving with the Breaks on are some of the most beautiful songs Del Amitri has ever recorded. Never Enough captures the mood of being a lonely commuter to a tee.

I usually just end up holding the thing for her, don't know about your kid but mine hates wearing backpacks for long anyway!The design is hard on their bodies because the book is so flat, and with extra books in the backpack it's very hard against the back.The backpack doesn't hold many of the books, I can fit maybe 2 in there.

Mr. Page went on to be a Montana pioneer and surveyor. The book was very controversial when it was published, but to his dying day Mr. page stood by what he had written. It is quite a contrast to the generally accepted view of Andersonville Prison. Possibly, the prison conditions were not uniform at all times or in all places of the prison. The rather antiquated, but clear, prose alone is reason to read the book and get a taste of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement Supports","review":"I have two Suv's that i have replaced a total of eight supports and all of them fit perfectly and function great.The glass and tail gates open all the way and slow down at the top so they don't damage the mounting points.Both of my trucks are nine and ten years old so i got a lot of use from the original supports so time will tell if these will stand the test of time.I looked at other web sites and the same supports are warrantied for two years but i am not sure how long Amazon warranties these but at half the cost of other sellers i will take my chances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book for the Beginner","review":"If you have never hunted but think you might like to, you need this book.

All the characters was engaged in some sort of drama which forced you to keep reading to find out what happended next. However, the most troubled character was Sterling.

The point is that is novel is substandard. It has been a long time since I have read a tale that is so superficial. There is more name dropping than the law allows! \\"One Better\\" is more like a cheap, old-fashioned Harlequin Romance. I know that fiction is an escapism but COME ON! I know...this book reminds me of a Judith Krantz or a Jackie Collins novel with the people reincarnated into African Americans and that doesn't really appease me! As an African American woman, I found the way she wrote these characters offensive. DIDN'T LIKE IT! Please, find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"I found this to be primarily an unsatisfying read. All of the characters were unsympathetic, not well fleshed out, and found themselves in improbable situations that challenge the reader's ability to empathize.

Oh and we can't forget Spice, but thats a nickname, I was disappointed that no one was named Sugar. I read this book and still not sure if I even liked it, I guess this one has to grow on you. But I was sadden that other than Spice's love for Carmen, nobody really loved anybody. Talk about dysfunctional families. If you are the nosy type and like secrets, read it just to find out Carmen's.

I normally do not write reviews but after reading this book I just had to. The characters and the plot are both very underdeveloped. I felt left out of the novel and could barely finish. I don't feel that Ms. Mcmillan fully gave us a picture of her characters; she didn't make us love them. I felt like they didn't even love one another. I think the idea behind the book was a good one, just poorly written. I have noticed that a lot of reviewers are comparing Terry and Rosalyn. I am not. They each have a seperate style and deserve due credit. With that said, I am basing the following on Rosalyn's effort in this novel alone:this book stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good effort.","review":"Knowing was less than average. One Better is an outright dog. It completely failed to capture my attention. Rosalyn is living off the name of her sister, but her talent is far less.

The love making between partners was outstanding and left me breathless. It was hot and steamy, and extoic Rosalyn McMillan is the best. Rosalyn please keep up the excellent work. Thanks for making me a almost dalily reader. I also read KNOWING it to left me wanting more, I was laughing at the two Aunts and other family members and Jackson was wonder I was wishing I had him or someone like him. He had his problems, but he did love his wife. And of course the lovemaking was truly wonderful.

And upon reading it, I found myself laughing incredulously at the very unrealistic situations that the characters were involved in. I mean, of course, I'm one of the people that sincerely wishes that I could have it like that, but come on - how many people do you know that are involved in all that and rich and successful to boot?

The excitement of the novel didn't appear until the very end, which made this novel hard to get through, I kept putting it down.

It also fell apart on me, spilling peppercorns everywhere. Sure am glad I have wood floors so they could go shooting under every possible appliance.That was when it was grinding, at least.

The book describes many antics that those in the industry get up to, the incidents that occur on flights and the somewhat casual approach many crew have towards their profession. A lightweight yet enjoyable read that provides an insight into many of those incidents that all air travellers have experienced from time to time at airports, or in the air but couldn't quite get a grip on.

The only reason why this movie would even get one star is the saving grace of Eva Longoria, who provides some comic relief which is still few and far between. I was excited to see the movie because I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Eva Longoria but have never even heard of Lake Bell. When I actually started to watch the movie and Lake Bell was introduced I was hoping she wasn't the leading lady. WOW! She is horrible!! Not nice to look at and definitely not a good actress. She brought down the quality of the movie single handedly. I hate to be so hard on someone but Lake Bell deserves much worse. Her performance was torture to watch and half way through I wanted to turn off the movie, I hoped it would get better but by the end I was just upset that I had lost the time in my life watching it. Its such a shame they used such a horrible actress as Lake Bell.... seriously... anyone would have done a better job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend the time or money on this one!","review":"I love Eva but this movie was disappointing. I am addicted to Desperate Houswives and a big fan but this movie (+ her acting) did not do her justice. She looked like she had the worse fake tan and the movie just lacked humor and romance! So much for a romantic comedy!This is just a remake of \\"Just Like Heaven\\" featuring Reese Witherspoon, which had a better plot and acting. If you are into these kinds of movies I recommend that one over this one.I don't know how anyone could rate this movie higher than 1 star!Sadly, it was a waste of money and time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This movie has gotten a lot of bad reviews, but I liked it a lot.

Maybe it would be ok if you have a dog that never pulls and doesn't run around like a maniac. I am afraid he is going to snap the ends off it one of these times when he pulls on it, and I swear he can get this thing tied in knots in under 5 seconds. Because it is so flimsy, it is like spaghetti to try to untangle it.EDIT: I lowered my stars on this one, because less than a month after receiving it, the plastic coating is peeling off the cable in spots, which is what causes the cable to rust and fail. Also, one of the clips is starting to pull apart. Will not order this again.

First of all, there is no way a six year old can knot the blanket, you are not given enough room to knot with smaller, child-like fingers, the material is not that great on two sides of each square and if you were a child you would pull to hard and rip the blanket.

The material is thin and many of the fringed pieces unraveled when we pulled on them to tie the knots.Also, the fringe is so short that it is hard for my 8 year olds to tie in a double knot.The girls made the best of it and worked around the mangled pieces, but if I had known what a low quality, poorly made product this is I would have bought fleece and cut it myself.My daughters would like me to add, \\"This is a rip-off.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a super project!!","review":"We gave this kit to our 9-year-old daughter for Christmas this year and she has been so busy with it ever since.

Now, it's very warm and my daughter loves it! I used embroidery thread to pull through at all the four-corner areas.

I bought the product because my older sister had said \\"AMAZING!! I LOVE THE RESULTS!!\\" However,this product is so hard, even to tie a knot. The fringe is BARELY long enough to do so. The toy is a project and I understand the point of the product is to have a hard project, but for the younger ones it should be at least doable. What I wanted to know before I bought the product was if it was too complicated or not.

The quality, as stated in many of the reviews, is poor. Depending on the color of the square, you get varying lengths for tying. Unfortunately my 7 year old got the yellow - the shortest of all the colors. After 20 minutes, she quit in frustration. I've been working on it for two hours and am no where near finished. The fabric begins to fray almost immediately after the tying process begins. I'm glad I purchased this on sale, but it would have been cheaper and of a much higher quality to purchase fleece from a fabric store to make your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor execution","review":"This looked like a good project for my children, who have learned to tie things. But upon further examination, and trying it myself, I have to conclude that this is not a good project at all. The fringe is way too short for a child to manipulate into a knot - in fact, it is difficult for me! If this quilt is to be finished, it will be me doing it, because the tying will be too hard for them and they will lose interest very quickly.

The material is hard to knot. It seems that some of the ties are a little too short and you have to fight with them. Certain colors really stretch out when you pull them to tie them. Its a good idea, but too much work in concept for the average 6 year old. I was looking for a fair independent project for her, and I ended up doing all the work.

There are a ton of knots to tie and my 6 year old is still learning to tie them. Even if she was good at tying knots I don't think she'd have the patience to tie all the knots.

My daughter has found other creative uses for the squares, which I am pleased about, but the intended use (and $30) got made into a pile of scrap material (which I could have gotten more scrap material for my money at Wal-Mart).

As a dealer, I am always trying to explain to my customers how to differentiate between one bangle and another. Now I just tell them to buy the book. The pictures alone speak a thousand words.Would I agree that there is an area of subjectiveness regarding pricing? Absolutely. But there is also a realistic price or perception as to what people see in a piece. In my experience, people are only willing to pay what they believe is a piece's value. Anyone can put a $500 price tag on a Diane Von Furstenberg bracelet, but that doesn't mean that it will sell.As a dealer, I'd rather my customers have a realistic price guide as opposed to a self-serving \\"off the charts\\" price.

After another use or two, that mug cracked, across the bottom of the mug and almost all the way up the outside, but not at the handle location.Now two of the remaining three have cracked in the freezer after several uses.

Vocalist Speech continues his politically-aware lyricism without resorting to outright preaching, lending the album the wisdom that arrives only with maturity. Since the Last Time may not have the chart-climbing hit that brought Three Years into public consciousness twelve years ago, but taken as a whole, the latest effort compares favorably from start to finish.Speech and Arrested Development have aged remarkably well, and seem more determined not to save the world, but rather improve upon it slightly, one listener at a time.

It should be used, if at all, for general informational purposes only. There are huge inaccuracies in in book, even describing trails which are faint or even non-existent. Trail signs mentioned also in some cases do not exist. This book could get you killed, in case of heading out on a non-existent trail, getting lost and having bad weather.Perhaps, when the author wrote this 9 years ago, maintenance of trails was better. Maybe the non-existent trails actually existed back then. Who knows? Who cares! If so he should post here an appropriate warning, or pull the book off the market.You should be an expert with map and compass (not just a GPS) if you are going deep into the Beartooths.

I finished reading it in one day - I couldn't put it down! At the end of it all, the reader gets a sense of not only Ms. MacGraw's personality and intense feelings, but also of the spiritual and emotional journey she has undergone. It's often brutally honest, and delightfully so; from her addiction to men, alcohol and sex, to her deep love for her son, MacGraw lets herself go and allows us to see her - imperfections and all.

I only take 5% useful from all this pages. I consider this book the same fluffy wicca started by Scott Cunningham.For youngs who want start in practice of wicca, very well, but only for start as curious and a dedicant, this can't show you what wicca really is.It is a joke to sincere seekers, is an outrage to elders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiral Dance Junk","review":"I would have given this a zero rating but it wasn't an option I could select.

The input of the seventies and especially America's particular brand of feminism has had a huge influence on the originally British concepts. Reading Starhawks Spiral Dance 20th Anniversary Edition, with her current thoughts and footnotes on her seventies self's spiritual journey (which influenced and continues to influence thousands of young Wiccan's today), gives added insight and understanding to the path taken by Wiccan's today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful... Excellent.. Yet not for Beginners","review":"This book was highly poetic, it did not talk down to readers, it was not a school 'how to' text book, and it has much highly useful information. The book cleared me up about 'polarality' and it explained all female covens and co-ed covens very honestly. The information in the back is helpful and so are the books that Starhawk has used.It should be noted that she is an ecofeminist before readers venture to this book. And if one does not have previous knowledge about Witchcraft they are likely to get lost. I don't see how this book 'bashes' men and though Starhawk does get very opinionated she is open and unlike many other authors make it seem like her way is the 'Only right way to do things' as many other traditions do. Overall, every Witch should read this book, though it is not perfect (not that any book is) it clears up many issues and gives a different and brighter perspective on the Craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every Wicaan!","review":"I put off reading this book because although I heard about how important and influencial it was for Neo-Paganism, there were many complaints about rampant sexism and politics.I wish I had ignored the negitive reviews and read this book much sooner. It was so beautiful and it really inspired me! I can understand how this book started so many covens and brought so many people to the Goddess.Read this book, and read the updated footnotes.

For example, first stating that a society shouldn't be leaded and certainly by no men and then later in the book stating that men's role is to limit and restrict females, behaving a sort like Lord Shiva in Hindu literature, dancing the dance of destruction. The book in essence seemed to be more a political book than a book on a religion system flavored with Starhawk's own anxiety - not a good way to promote a religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"What a disappointment and waste of money. I'dbought the book figuring I'd explore other waysof magick, and this book came highly recommended.Instead, I found it pontificating, verbose, andin a style that made me feel like an old school-marm(no, no reference to Hecate, for whom I havethe utmost reverence) was about to beat my fingerswith a ruler if I didn't do things exactly her wayor feel what I was \\"supposed\\" to feel. I don'treally think the Universe, Goddess, or God gives adarn about performing a ritual precisely -- rather,it's the intent behind it that counts. I'd send itback, but it's not worth the time and the postage.*sigh* After reading the late Scott Cunningham(mayhe rest in peace beyond the Summerlands), Sybil Leek,Crowley, Patricia Telesco, and others, this was a reallet down, in my opinion.

It's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"good in ways, irresponsible in others","review":"_Spiral Dance_ would be a fine introductory book for people interested in Wiccan and neo-paganism if Starhawk had the discipline to confine herself to the topic. Unfortunately, this eminently public pagan author considers it acceptable to use this opportunity to preach her particular version of ecofeminism. The implication for the person new to paganism is clear: \\"These are the orthodox social, political and ecological attitudes of the modern neo-pagan, and if you want to be a pagan and they aren't your attitudes, you'd better acquire them.\\"This is as much a socio-political book as an introductory treatise, and I'm disappointed at the disguise. She has written other books which are unabashedly political and with these I have no quarrel.

This rates top of my Somewhat Experienced list (not quite Beginners but to much of the basics for Experienced). Every female should own it. Males will benefit from it too.

She recounts experiences with her San Francisco coven that shed a very creative and pure light on Wicca. Most of the books that are available to the curious or those studying the Craft are chock full of correspondence charts, numerology, astrology, herbalism (all very excellent fields and thorough resources on any of them are indespensible); mostly left-brained cut and dried facts that leave no room for interpretation or expansion. The Spiral Dance, however, is a much more meditative work, allowing the reader to create a world within themselves that will allow true Magick to flourish. If you are tired of books that are all spin-offs of the same novice theory and practice and you feel ready to delve into more intermediate realms of the spiritual, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"spiral dance","review":"I really liked this book because it gave me a way to experiance things that I thought I had felt before but hadn't. For example,, one of the excersizes is sitting outside in nature and feeling and just listening to your surroundings, and that seems to be simple enough, or boring which ever way you prefer to think about it. But as you sit there you feel this feeling that you are one with everything, something that is a very important experiance in my opinion, and audio-wise you hear things flow into this rythmic song, even a car honk fits in with it, and i never realized how balanced everything really was. So I totally recommend this book to anyone, even if its not for just that reason, but because there is alot to learn and so much information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic and Practical","review":"This book is a wonderful entry into the realm of the Goddess at any level, whether you're just beginning your Goddess growth, or secure in your Goddess strength but just looking to bask in Her beauty. I actually don't consider it to be sexist, because yes it acknowledges differences between men and women, but we are different, if we weren't, what would be the attraction? In her 20th anniversary edition she addresses the issue as well. I enjoy this book thoroughly every time I read it. Any time you're just looking for some peace, its nice to have it around. Also the rituals don't require a run to the store for the right color candle or herb, they are simple in supplies, and rely on the poetic words and feelings instead. It's a must-read for women of the Goddess in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excelent book.","review":"THE book for anyone interested in learning about witchcraft.

Starhawk's Spiral Dance inspired a huge number of young women to become Wiccan but with a price. Wicca is a religion of harmony and balance between God and Goddess, it is not a \\"Goddess religion.\\" Nor is there a real place in Wicca for feminist men-bashing and separatist misandry. For two decades many people believed that Wicca was a \\"women's spirituality\\" rather than a balanced and harmonious religion for everyone. What was gained by the beautiful writing and poetic mysticism is lost in the divisiveness and misdirection. The original edition of Spiral Dance wasn't as polarized and hateful to men as later works by Starhawk or the more recent revisions of the Dance. If one can get past her misandry she has a lot of creative vision. It isn't another spell book, and that part is good. But in the end she has never given up being Jewish."},{"rating":"2","title":"critique of this book in a magazine","review":"I have not read this book, but I did recently read an article about it in the January 2001 \\"The Atlantic Monthly\\".

I have read many books by male wiccan authors and none of them have ever come close to the sexism that I encountered in this book. I am a woman, and i was offended. My boyfriend is pagan, I have more male pagan friends than female ones, (which I realize is unusual.) This book makes me sad because I, personally, have seen more men passionatly dedicated to the Goddess than women. This book, and ones like it, made a few of my pagan friends just not want to be pagan anymore. They said that they felt there was no room for them in Goddess religions.

I was concerned that it might be too politically correct, but in fact she has examined the ways in which women have accepted and cemented positions of power. Her analysis treats on a wide historical range and does not limit itself to the familiar figures: Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria, etc. Her style is informative but not difficult and pleasant without being overly colloquial. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in how women present themselves in order to attain and hold power and to people interested in learning more about some histories they would probably not otherwise come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempted read","review":"Perhaps I expected more from this book than was present, but I could hardly get through the first few chapters and I am an avid historic biography reader. I found her methods tiresome and boring, having the preference to recite found facts rather than compile and share, she reads like a card catalog. I now know exactly what to read if I do wish to learn something of these women she eludes to, but after having put this book down, I feel I am less wise to the subjects then when I started. I need a chronological telling of a person and their movement, not a forty-three page explanation of exactly who has written such things in the past. Perhaps, I stopped reading three or four chapters before it got good, but I doubt it. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject matter, however...","review":"I was excited to jump into this book because I find the subject matter interesting, but I was repeatedly brought to a stand still by Fraser's laborious prose. I found that she continuously sacrificed clarity, succinctness, and organization in order to indulge in unnecessary drama and lyricism. The latter should never come at the expense of the former in a history book. Furthermore, in my opinion, the constant psychoanalytical references to various syndromes in application to the historical figures themselves was tiresome and sophomoric.I would recommend trying to get the information elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than mediocre","review":"This game looked great.Going through warzones with cool weaponry and some driveable vehicles here and there.I then bought this game and this is what a realized:the graphics are outdated looking,the aiming is horrible,the team commanding is not that fun(you feel like you barely even have a team.)Also the bullets look like lazers going across the screen.This also looked cool because you could be SAS and Delta Force:the only difference was SAS had British accents, and Delta Force had American.I would recommend SOCOM II or Ghost Recon over this bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This game was great! I don't remember how i stumbled upon it,but I'm glad I did. The multi player co-op is the greatest feature about the game. The graphics were...ok.... but graphics don't matter when there is a game as good as this one. Im still waiting for a war game, with 1'000 people on either side, on line or bots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I just got through playing Splinter Cell. This Game was a complete let down. The movement of the soilder is choppy and un-responsive. No realism what so ever. As an arcade shooter its probably OK. If you've played S.C. Don't expect much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"conflict on the system,big time!","review":"OK i might be the only one here but I really do think this game sucks Iv tried to deny it for so long but I cant hold it in any longer!#1 This is probably the worst game I have ever played graphicly(belive me Iv played alot of those).Its like \\"why does everyone look the same?\\".Although I must say there is a pretty nice array of weapons but they feel so repetetive, I think one weapon in the entire game is silenced!Also I think this game could be pretty good if your squdmates werent such idiots,they dont even follow your commands!but 2 player is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saddam was too nice","review":"In this game, Saddam never used biological or chemical warfare on his own people. He never shot wild SCUD missiles at neighboring countries. He never kidnapped families of dignitaries to try and end embargoes. He was never seen contributing money and equipment to al-Queda. The enslavement of women was not portrayed in the game.The portrayal of Saddam was just too kind to be realistic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feed your thirst for OIL WAR","review":"At first when I saw this game I thought, wow this is great, this is going to be SO realistic, it's an awesome idea to put out a shooter set in Iraq! I mean, it'll be just like Desert Storm.Well, it's not exactly like Desert Storm. First off - there are no protests whatsoever featured in the game. It would have been more realistic if I had to politically \\"buy into\\" an Iraqi oil war. Second of all, after a few missions, my soldier didn't get either Gulf War Syndrome or even Post-Traumatic syndrome! I'm disappointed, the X-box architecture definitely could have supported a feature like this.Look at the timing of this release. Look at the state of US foreign policy with Iraq. Then decide if you are being manipulated."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"Your first clue as to how bad this game will prove is when you begin a 2 player multiplayer game and one of the players sits able to do nothing in a prison cell until you spend 15 minutes finding the prison. The graphics are horrid and the game play is lame with mindless searching in circa-1990 graphics representing a sand storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome soldier game","review":"i am a soldier in iraq right now and my wife sent me this game at first i thought it would be [bad]. but when four if us started to play it was. awsome. i think it is one of the best games that i have played on xbox yet. the mission were chalenging but not imposible. we could use read squad tactics in the game that we use in real life here in iraq. i recomend this game to anyone who like multiplayer games."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAME","review":"This is THE funnest war game I have ever played. It has pretty good graphics but they could be better. It has pretty challenging missions that take you a little while to complete and their really fun. Another good point is the fact where you can play your own soundtrack during the game, so while your blowin the Iraqi's heads off you can jam on to LinkinPark! But it does have few bad points, the controls are a little confusing and it takes a while to get used to it. But besides that it is so cool!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Storm 2?","review":"After playing Halo for a year any other game is well, just a game. I rented DS and liked it from the start. I say this dispite the fact the controls stink. The mess you have to go through to choose another weapon is tough, esecially when you are in battle. I enjoyed the ability of controling the other soldiers. It's a good concept and if the makers could assign a single button for weapon select it would be much better. I also like listening to my own music while I play so the soundtrack feature is cool. Rent it first, then if you can stand the controls have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen First!

The problem is if you have to work with your hands at all, this ring is not practical for everyday use. It just feels heavy and in the way. It has a very thick band, not feminine or pretty, just utilitarian. I threw the ring watch in a box a few days after I got it. I hate to say it, but I was disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch band broke after 2 weeks","review":"The watch was very pretty. The battery lasted about 3 days, and then i spent $12 for a new one, almost 1/2 the purchase price of the watch. I have small fingers and the band was a bit too big, so the watch didn't stay on tightly. After a couple of weeks, i snagged it on a grocery sack and the band broke. Would cost more to get the band fixed than to just buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but not with these spices","review":"This is a really good idea, and I hope the other sets from oxo work well. We got this for a wedding present, and I used it successfully a couple of times. Then it jammed. Now it jams up a lot. It takes a lot of fiddling to unjam it, since it doesn't come apart. I don't think its the quality of the grinder. It seems well made. I think the grinder just cannot handle hard spices, such as cinnamon bark and allspice berries. Too bad, because freshly ground cinnamon is yummy. This same idea probably would work on smaller, softer seeds, like fennel, cumin, coriander, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great stuff!","review":"We love this stuff.

Since Max let their flood insurance lapse, he looks for an investor to help save the restaurant--it needs a great deal of repair to rebuild it to the majestic landmark that it once was. He finds Davis Kepler, a smart businessman with a shady past. It was a stressful few months, and Vendora is finally rebuilt and reopened. But...now that the financial situation has changed, Max wants to end the partnership. Davis, along with his movie-star girlfriend, Lara, Max, and Camille go on a cruise to celebrate their new successes, but secrets begin to unfold and tragedy strikes. The Granville's spoiled-rich daughter blames her mother for some of the recent events. Camille must make decisions to save her family and the family legacy. Anita has written a mystery filled with suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Police.","review":"Honestly, I don't think I could sit down to dinner with Sting. The politics, the environmentalism, the ego.... but I love the music. I've been a fan of the Police since the early 80's and all else aside they made some great songs and they are all here. I had the opportunity to see them live on their reunion tour and thought they were fantastic which inspired this purchase. Well... maybe I could have dinner with Sting... we'd just have to stick to talking music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete and definitive Police collection.","review":"This box set is truly a must-have: it has every track from all 5 Police studio albums, plus a collection of b-sides, live tracks and rarities. I can finally toss my worn-out 45 singles, which had such b-side gems like \\"Shamble,\\" the jazzy \\"Flexible Strategies\\" and \\"Someone to Talk to\\" which features Andy Summers on vocals. Thanks to this collection, I can now hear these rarities in a remastered sound that's fuller and richer than the vinyl editions ever were. Plus, there's a booklet which nicely summarizes the Police's discography. So my advice is simple: get it. Even if you own all of their studio work, it's still worth the investment to buy this package, which has every song in one collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this collection.","review":"Lot's of familiar music, but it's the less-popular tunes that are worth the price. I play this all the time still, even though I bought it more than a year ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only flaw is organization","review":"The sound quality on the remastered discs is very good. However, splitting Regatta de Blanc across two discs is inexcusable, and including susbstandard non-album tracks between albums is distracting. I recommend using a CD recorder to reassemble the 5 original albums onto separate discs, and creating a 6th disc with the bonus material that you can stand to listen to. Some of the bonus material is genius; some is dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Lesson","review":"Greatest Hits albums always show you the shining moments of each band, often while leaving out some of the bands' own favorite songs, in favor of the commercial hits. This is a complete portfolio, warts and all, that demonstrates the evolution of the band as musicians, songwriters, and people. True fans will appreciate this aspect as much as the songs themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAN \\"Don't stand so close to me 86'\\"!!","review":"I just bought this set, but I am anticipating it to be really good. will be great to have all of these songs in one set! However, I'm planning to program my cd player to ALWAYS skip track 18 on disc 4, \\"Dont' stand so close to me 86'\\". THISRE-DOING OF THE SONG IS AN ABOMINATION! Please, if you are a person of any musical taste, always avoid this song. Participtate in this ban!! I first heard this piece of trash when I bought the greatest hits record back in the 80's--I always wondered why they put this song on their instead of the original, which was far superior and without any need to be \\"re-done.\\" Why did sting do this this?

The wife being at home being his support is like for me who is a carrer woman to read something from the 1960!It's not often I regret buying a book is more about how Ziglar has succeeded than how you can do it.

I knew all about it going in, and secretly hoped if anyone could make me a believer it'd be zig... but it just kind of got in the way. Good for him tho with his faith, and anybody else it helps!Def not my favorite zig work. Actually my least favorite by far.

I found the religious overtones to be off-putting and an impediment to enjoying the remaining content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Basics","review":"Zig Ziglar goes back to the fundamental beliefs that helped him succeed as a father, a motivational speaker, and salesperson. In doing so, he gives glory to God. Many \\"self-help\\" books center on helping secular people form better habits. The \\"chicken soup\\" series, Jack Canfield, and numerous other writers embrace a new-age self-salvation that never goes to the heart of the matter. Zig points to the Lord as the author of our lives, and the only One capable of creating true change.Better Than Good is about real change, not better habits. It is Bible-based, honest, and scripturally sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narration so poor, could not get into the content","review":"I downloaded this from Audible, and it was simply awful! I appreciate Mr. Ziglar's work but this was just really bad. How someone within his company or on his team could not tell him how terrible his reading of this content was is beyond me. I really wanted to get into the content of this book. But the narration was just awful. His speech was slurred, the pace was too fast. I tried slowing it down, which just made the slurs more pronounced. And the way he read it...it was just really bad. His tone. He did not use any kind of inflection, it was very monotone. Very bad. Luckily when I called Audible customer service, they were willing to remove it from my library and give me credit back. Thank you Audible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book is motivational, uplifting and fun to read.

So why do they call themselves the Blues Travelers? They don't sound like blues to me, with the exception of The Mountains Win Again. The rest sounds mostly like 90's pop music to me. I did hear The Mountains Win Again the other night on a juke box in a club in Austin... (Texas... y'all) and though that song was very bluesey. I guess when I think of blues I think of Buddy Guy, some Stevie Ray Vaughan songs, some of Ian Moore's older stuff, Omar and the Howlers, etc. So, to my ears, these guys don't really deserve the name Blues Travellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't too much for Paul Butterfield either","review":"I hated \\"Run Around\\", and \\"Hook\\" as they are too full of harmonica. I figured let's see what else is on here. I wasn't really all that inmpressed with this there was only two songs on here that showed any hope. \\"Faliable\\", and \\"Look Around\\". I just am very picky about my blues. I am more partial to Blues Guitar, and a Honest to Goodness Blues Shouter; this isn't even close. So my appetite for the blues is limited to Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, B.B.King, and some Robert Johnson. Harmonicas are too depressing for me, so Paul Butterfield, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, etc. would have a hard time making it into my record collection, and this one definitely isn't going to get in."},{"rating":"1","title":"sell out album","review":"This is for all those fans who never have heard of Blues Traveler until this CD was played on the radio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this album more and more every year","review":"I'm not a huge Blues Traveler fan, but I like this album more and more every year.

It is hard to make all of your songs sound the same, but blues traveler does it quite well. Only Weird Al's masterful work on the acordian can compare to John Poppers' masterful playing on the most interesting instrument out there: the harmonica. If I was stuck on a deserted Island, and had only one cd to use as a back-scratcher, this would be the one. Shine on you crazy harmonica blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 for \\"Four\\"","review":"Great, great cd. As with many people, this is when I became a fan. This album just screams to be played on those \\"spring fever\\" days. I think every track on here is almost as good, or better than the 3 hits, \\"Run-around\\", \\"Mountains win again\\", and \\"Hook\\". And I don't care how many times you've heard \\"Hook\\", it still sounds great when it comes on. BT does have a \\"hits\\" disc out for those of you that want most of the good stuff. \\"Live from the fall\\" is also essential for the BT fan. Whatever you decide on, you need some Blues Traveler to stick between your Black Crowes and Phish cd's. Jam on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Purchase","review":"I'm glad that I bought this album, but it doesn't make me want to buy another. I love songs like \\"Run Around\\" and \\"Hook\\", and I give strong kudos to the rest of the tracks, especially \\"Look Around,\\" \\"The Mountains Win Again,\\" and \\"Just Wait\\". However, this is primarily a CD that I listen to when I am in the mood to hear certain songs. The CD is great, but not incredible. There are it's down points that seem to drag excessively, but then there are also plenty of up points that make you want to start dancing. This is one of those albums that could have been great if it was just pushed a little bit further, and for the sake of BT, I wish it had been. However, all and all, this is a good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"the radio hits bring you back","review":"But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the rest.If they can write a song called \\"Hook\\" shouldn't they fill the whole album with them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I am a huge Traveler fan, and I must say this album is their worst.

Do yourself a favor and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good 90's CD","review":"If I was to name quality bands that started making music in the 1990's, I would most likely have fingers left on at least one hand. Blues Traveler is one of the those bands that makes the grade. Four definitely got them in the public eye and deservedly so. The energy is very high and Johnny Popper's Harmonica playing is excellent and as a rule I don't like harmonicas in music. The sounds like that come out of that Harp are incredible. Although the songs stick to a somewhat repetitive pattern, overall they are fairly catchy especially Hook, Stand, Runaround, Price To Pay, and Look Around. A very worthy purchase indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light or Serious, Blues Traveler makes \\"Four\\" worth a look.","review":"Alright... Someone has really struck a chord in complaining about Blues Traveler not having enough \\"blues.\\" One must just question why people can't just enjoy good music...Anyway, I must be honest and say that some songs are less than enjoyable, but that's all made up by the rest. From the well-known pop hits like \\"Run-Around\\" and \\"Hook\\" to the less-heard favorites like \\"The Mountains Win Again\\" and \\"Just Wait,\\" Blues Traveler's unique blend of pop and blues makes for an excellent trip, and the addition of the harmonica is a welcome departure from the usual pop scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book on Foreign Policy!","review":"Kissinger lays down a great detailed account of US relations with all corners of the globe.

Kissinger isn't the law, but he offers some interesting suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"feels somewhat outdated in light of recent events","review":"Henry Kissinger, the honored statesman, shows his stature and power of observation in this highly relevant book.....However, one very critical statement he did make was amazingly prophetic: an affirmation of American predominance is not in the best interest of America.The rest of the book is brilliant, with very good analyses of the regions of the world. My specialty is in Asia, and the section on Asia is quite insightful. The only other problem with this book is that everything is stated in very general terms. For anyone not familiar with international relations, this book can be hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come the kindle version is more expensive than the print version????","review":"This one-star is intended for the Amazon and/or the publisher, not the author. It does not make any sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry The Dissembling Fool","review":"There is little worse than Henry the Dissembling Fool and his rantings on American foreign policy, particularly given that his expertise is in assassination (Allende et al)and genocide (Timor, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc.)which require little policy, no thought, and no scruples. That's Henry. If he would write about his assignation with Pinochet, that might be of interest, but his lectures on what America should do in the world, a quarter century after he gratefully left formal power, are immensely irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"no apologies from a mass murderer","review":"Before reading this book read The Trial of Henry Kissinger by Christopher Hitchens. Kissinger assumes the modern foreign policymaker needs his advice. For example, he opposes the entra-terriorality of international courts...for good reason: he would be one of the first people tried by a real ICC. This book is a self-serving realist attempt to justify his (and others') past actions (e.g., illegal bombing of Cambodia)."},{"rating":"1","title":"666: The Beast Is Kissinger?","review":"Every word in this book, \\"Does America Need A Foreign Policy?\\" is a lie, meant to beguile you into seeing things in such a distorted way that you approve of the ideas Kissinger is proposing, ideas that he has in the past, and will in the future, go through with whether you like it or not. Henry the Beast? doesn't want you to hate him; he'd rather be your friend, (or at least pretend to be) but if not, he goes both ways, so children, be on your best behaviour, lest Henry- SNAP, went the dragons!An interesting aside...Hey kids, I've got something fun for you today! You can try this experiment at home if you want. The only danger is the implied one. Henry's last name is Kissinger. If we assigned multiples of 6 to every letter of the alphabet, starting with A=6, B=12, C=18, and so on and then add up the total values in the surname Kissinger, we'll get six-hundred and sixty-six right on the money: the mark of the beast. Make of that what you will. Have a nice day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING BIOGRAPHY!!!! A QUICK READ!!!","review":"I have read many biographies over the years, some were okay, others were boring, some were incomplete, and others were simply entertaining. This book I found so wonderfully entertaining, informative,and a real page turner. This author sets the stage with this book when it comes to biographies.Like many great books, the \\"thickness\\", as one reviewer mentioned, should NOT discourage you to read this book. You find that this book is a quick read. The reason is that this author does an excellent job in bringing you into the life of Guy Williams. It's not a book full of just facts, dates and places, but giving you insight of the man. You actually feel that you met the man, and you got to know him.Both Guy William fans and people who love biographies will enjoy this fascinating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good theme, bad soundtrack","review":"Literally every single review listed here gave this CD an abysmal review and said it sincerely sucked (it does), yet each one has 4 stars by it.

It dealed more with her struggle for identity and survival, and it brought across easier how someone who actually lived in that culture would think and feel. Every little detail was amazing, and Tanith Lee carries the story across like she actually vacationed in Four Bee , 4 boo, 4 Baa. At the end of the book, I felt like I had went there. This book is expertly planned out, not to mention incredibly witty. It had a very strong voice and I felt like I could hear the narrator speaking. Read this book, you have no idea how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look for it under its new title.","review":"I loved this book and its sequel. I just wanted anyone who might be out there looking for it to know that it's now printed under the title \\"Biting the Sun\\" (that book contains both \\"Don't Bite the Sun\\" and \\"Drinking Sapphire Wine\\" under one cover). \\"Biting the Sun\\" is available here on Amazon, and my review of the books is under that one.

I think they're awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Reinforcement of Growth Investing Fundamentals","review":"I settled in on my couch for a closer look at this work by one of Babson's finest. By the time I stood up, I had finished it. It provides a solid reinforcement of NAIC (strategic long-term) investing principles. Brad Perry suggests a strategy of analyzing companies as business enterprises and their valuation in the stock market. Complexity breeds confusion - and often failure - in this seemingly difficult field. Perry presents a common sense outlook, shaped with healthy skepticism, that demonstrates that the factors for investment success are actually quite simple, and that investors should focus on some basic principles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

Nice soft leather, surprisingly roomy for a bag that looks as small as this one. However, all of that being said, I ended up returning the bag. The strap wasn't very comfortable at all, and it was awkward, constantly falling off of my shoulder.

Mr. Leff has done a wonderful job of creating his own world and allowing us a brief tour of it. The story has a great hook and wisely allows us to sympathize with all characters, both the good and the bad. As a first time author, Mr. Leff has started out far above many other authors first time works. This reviewer can honestly say that he finds The Nine Lands to be a better first time work than that of Terry Brooks, there is much more maturity and well rounded lines of thought. As first works go, this book is certainly on the right path. Mr. Leff treates us as adults and not as a reader who needs to be guided by the hand through his world. It will be lovely to watch the growth and progression of his works as he continues on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This excellent first novel caught me off guard with how good it was","review":"Let me state first off that I do not like fantasy novels. I'll read good quality sci-fi, but fantasy has always gotten on my nerves.Enter \\"The Nine Lands\\" by Steven Leff.I found this book to be engaging, entertaining and well-written. I wound up reading the book in three days because I had trouble putting it down. The imagery that Mr. Leff creates is very vivid, and his characters truly seem to have personalities and internal struggles beyond what is directly written on paper.Bravo, Mr. Leff. You have me awaiting the eventual sequel.One word of advice - a new editor is needed. Don't let the typos get to you - just enjoy the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"surpirsing","review":"I read very little fiction and almost never read fantasy, but this was recommended by a friend who's opinion I generally agree with.

It is an encyclopedia of every single TV appearance Lucille Ball has ever done. Everything from commercials, variety show appearances, Award shows, guest appearances, and, of coarse, her four television series: I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and Life with Lucy. The book is filled with tidbits of information which will make watching an episode as if it were the first time. Mr. Fidelman's writing style is easy to read and filled with humor and wit. This is a really fun book to read! If you need a reason to watch a Lucy program for the one thousandth and one time, this book will provide more than a few.

I dont remember much else, but i know that these classic books make for good reading up at the lake, in a thunderstorm. If you are a good reader, you can probably read one a day.

I was a voracious reader and I read the entire Boxcar series because it was recommended, maybe because I LOVED the Narnia books, and the Boxcar series also stars four siblings.The characters are flat, prissy and dorky, and their dialogue always struck me as very unrealistic.These books don't hold a candle to the Narnia books, and it's unfair to compare them.

This two cd set , comes from. two differnt times in the Police's career. Disk one from early, when they were more of a Punk rock band, and disk two, when they were superstars.Disk one is boring, the numbers are dragged out, and unless your a big Police fan, you may not know alot of the songs. Disk one I give a 1/2 star. Disk two, the songs are tighter, sound better, and at times they almost seem to be having fun. One draw back to this set,is that 4 songs found on disk two, are on disk one. Making this really a waste. Disk two 3 1/2 stars. Overall 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"did't play","review":"I tried it in a cd player dvd player computer came up blanknow i've givin upthis is the first time this has happend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc Two is the highlight of this set","review":"The Police have been hailed as great musicians, great songwriters, and, well, hitmakers. It really shows Sting's songwriting abilities and The Police's ability to capture the attention of the crowd. The second disc is the one that has most of the more recognizable songs on it. With such hits as Roxanne, Syncronicity (I and II), Every Breath You Take, and Don't Stand So Close to Me, the second disc is a great one. The first disc was recorded before The Police were as big and as good as they would be in the eighties. The sound quality is good throughout both discs, although the first is a little more suited for a band playing at CBGB's in New York City (a haven for punk bands). The cds are amazing, and because of them (a suggestion by a friend), I have become a Police convert. Very good, and some of the best live music I've heard in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"One star down for disc 2...","review":"I love disc one. It is fantastic. It actually got me back into simple rock n roll after years of listening mainly to more complex jam rock and jazz. I put it on my stereo one night when I was just sitting around my apartment a few years back, and I was bouncin round the room (to quote Phish). Since that time I have gotten back into this kind of music (elvis costello, the clash, etc.) while still listening to the other stuff. The Police were a punk band, I don't care what anyone says, and they wrote some clever, catchy tunes.Now disc two is another matter. It sounds nice, well-done, but doesn't have that spirit the earlier music had. Alone it gets 2 stars from me, but disc one gets six so it averages out somewhere in the middle, I go with four. Disc one is more than enough to justify the price, however. I urge you to buy it, and wear out that first disc!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!","review":"This tape covers the police in the early eighties and sound is great !!!

Both the performance and sound are good, but for your only live album, it should be excellent. The song choices are fine, but two cd's of two shows is too much. Unless you're a fanatic, one disc of live hits and fan favorites would be better. Actually, I usually just listen to disc 2 for that very reason. Of course if I was more of an optomist, I'd say it's two cd's, of two shows, full of all the hits and more.

Also, I would need to press the advance button several times sometime to get it to work. Maybe I need more practice, but it was just something I couldn't take a chance on for the web presentation.

Le Tombeau de Couperin has the magnifcence that requires a work composed to honour Ravel's friends killed in war. Magnificent and misterious interpretation of La Valse, Karajan is the only one who attain a real viennese vals spirit mixed with the caothic character of the work, originaly named \\"Vienna\\".The weak point of the recording is the sound quality, particulary in Bolero and Alborada del Gracioso. The microphones are placed so far that some sections of the orchestra sound in the background. Skip these tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Ravel","review":"Karajan was a decent Ravel conductor. I find his Ravel in later years on the Deutsche Grammophon to be much better than this recording. There are several problems with this recording besides the obvious: the audio quality. \\"Le Tombeau de Couperin\\" sounds like a jumbled up mess. \\"La Valse\\" sounds like it was recorded from outer space.Audio quality aside, the performances and interpretations are incredibly lackluster. The last movement of \\"Le Tombeau de Couperin\\" is taken way too slow, which I think causes it to loose it's appeal. This piece is actually supposed to be performed at a moderately fast tempo.I like Karajan, but I think with all the Ravel recordings available, that the potential buyer should look elsewhere.

Its singleplayer experience has been extended 1000%, with dynamic story missions and tons of challenges. There's tons of cool stuff to unlock. The game is extra smooth and lightning fast, no framerate drops to be had. It boasts one of the most complete first-person shooter packages to date, it is easily the best console shooter yet. My only complaint is the Map Editor is still quite limited, with few improvements over TS1, most especially lack of extra space for bigger levels.It has the timesplitters feel with a throwback to the old Goldeneye days on N64. There's no better game this year for frantic gunslinging mayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it today!","review":"Timesplitters 2 is a great game. This game reminds me very much of Goldeneye on N64. And anyone who has played Goldeneye knows, that it was a great game. The graphics are great. Not quite as great as Halo, but very close. I keep hearing people griping about the controls but the controls are just like Halo. They just take a bit of getting used too. I love the variety of weapons, there are many guns including a flamethrower. For each time period you are in, the guns are matched for that time period. What I really like about the game is that you can play game modes such as challenges. These challenges are pretty much just like multiplayer. So if you are looking for a great game, even if you don't like first-person shooters, you will enjoy this game.

I finished the game in roughly the same time it took to sneeze, and yet I'm fairly certain I still spent more time on the game than the designers did. Please protect yourself and rent it first if you are even considering buying it. This is the worst X-Box game or even computer game I have EVER seen. It was just mind-bogglingly awful.

This stuff is very open to doctoring and I highly recommend adding at least 12oz of ground beef. Not a huge fan of the rice but I found it to be hardly noticeable. It's a mild chili, so for spice add either cayenne powder or chili powder. About two TBL of cayenne powder whisked in added a nice additional kick for my batch.

Nada."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING: This book is warped!","review":"Warning: This book is warped, and your mind may be too after you've finished reading it. _Cosmic Banditos_ is an examination of the wonders of quantum physics, couched in a South Ameircan drug-runner's quest for enlightenment. The physics is accurate. I know. I have no personal knowledge about the bizarre lifestyles portrayed, nor do I want to. The combination, though, of physics and somewhat insane crooks is unforgetable. This is not a book for the culturally timid, but it is an absolute treasure for those sufficiently off the wall to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly amazing trip","review":"Well, what to say about this book? All I can say is wow. It is funny, easy, and makes material(quantum physics) that would otherwise be almost impossible interesting. Simply stunning, it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it a BIG BANG!","review":"I have a copy of this lovely book! I really hate that it is no longer being published.

Whatever IT is...the writing Bandito has created it for us to ride the tide along his side."},{"rating":"2","title":"LaughingBandito","review":"Anyone who has read the intro to this edition will appreciate my first exposure to Cosmic Banditos. I whipped it out in the airport on my way to the Gulf. Yes, I can see the appeal to military folks. I can understand just wanting to forget where you are for a little while. Weisbecker offers a vacation to Never-Land with the help of witty humor, the transcendental quality of a primer on physics, and characters who have decided to follow there own rythms in a very believable central american world. I just bounded along all the way as it spun farther and farther out of control. Weisbecker wields narration format the way Harry Potter handles a new wand. The characters refused to be confined to the page; they lept out in pandemonium and started reading over my shoulder. Too much of this book may give you a hangover. Best to read it once or twice, and immediately pass it on to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Aaahhhh!\\"","review":"This book is currently my Favorite Book of All Time. It has everything--Tequila, Doggy Sneese Attacks, Nymphomaniacs and Albert Einstein (just to mention a few). It's laugh-out-loud funny, but is also deep and personally reflective at times. I think anyone who reads this book will have their Worldview shaken up. If you know someone who takes themself a little too seriously, this book could be therapy for them. It makes me wonder what my life would've been like if I had never bought this book. Maybe somewhere in another dinension I am wandering around without \\"Cosmic Banditos.\\" That would be a shame.I definitely recommend getting your hands on this book...... Good luck banditos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love stumbling across little gems likes this one!!","review":"On a non-related Amazon search I stumbled across this book. I was compelled to read it due to the excellent reviews it had received. And after reading it, I am glad to report that Cosmic Banditos is one of the coolest books I have ever read. I am not one to normally laugh out loud when reading, but this book was the exception. I couldn't keep the chuckles in! The author manages to meld two completely non-related subjects of drug running and quantum mechanics into a seamless and captivating tale. This book is a must buy for people who enjoy out of the norm books, or those who just want a change from the more serious titles usually found on best seller lists. Heck this book should be a must buy for ANYBODY who likes to laugh, period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold your razr up straight","review":"This device keeps your Razr charged and held up straight so you can read its screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the candy lover!","review":"Bought this as a Christmas present for a candy lover in his 50's.

I figured that I would go with the 70's box since that is really more indicative of her childhood years. She loved the assortment of candy and said that it was all fresh and delicious.

Even though he wrote as they dance for political reasons, it is still a great ballad. Find out what the political reason only brought the CD closer to my heart.

It made such a big impression that I've been his fan ever since. I consider Sting to be one of the most intellectual and prolific song writers of this century.

Totally not worth the time or money for this application! Wish I'd seen a review like this before. I was very excited to see the larger circle sizes, most only go to 1/2\\" and smaller.

I, as a parent of a 13 and 16-yr old, do not want my kids playing games that teach them how to kill with graphic, real-life cartoon characters. As a nation, we should be promoting peace, not war, to our children. Those who profit from such games, and desensitize our children about the horrors of real war and death, should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"obvious manipulation","review":"This game, released only a few months before the ill-named Operation Iraqui Freedom, is an obvious manipulation of public opinion and propaganda. The fact that this game is intended for people as young as thirteen, who don't have any real knowledge of what is happening in the Middle-East is astounding and makes it apparent that it is just another attempt to reinforce the status quo of America=Good, Saddam=Bad, while the truth is and will continue to be America=Bad, Saddam=Bad. Save your money and don't buy into corporate produced, highly patriotic games which only reinforce the notion that war is a game. The use of video footage from the battle field, the jargon of \\"smart bombs\\" and video games such as this one are an ill-concieved, yet seemingly effective strategy to take pressure off of the real situation, one in which you can't just continue after you're shot.

After playing it for a few weeks, I have decided that I will not buy take the advice of this friend anymore.This game is OK but it just feels lame and I wasn't able to get into it. I had great expectations of a war game where I would be able to blast Iraqis. Instead, I got a game with a cheesy plot, poor controls, and low quality graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"realistic as you can get!","review":"When i first started to play this game, it took a bit to get used of the controlles but once i did, i couldn\`t put it down. controlling your force was the best idea they could come up in a game. the graphics are outstanding- from city to desert sandstorms. it would be more challenging if you got to control more than just 4 guys and you got to use more armored vehicles. other than that i really enjoyed the game.it\`s worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great action","review":"This is an excellent game with intense gun battles. With a wide variety of weapons, you get to control four squad members and battle against relatively intelligent ai. You can individually control any of the squad members. Easy and good control of squad member allows you to make sound tactical decisions. The controls in the third person are a bit tricky and take a little getting used. The graphics are good. The game is a bit short, only ten to twelve hours of play providing you dont die to many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Army of Four","review":"Some play is a little choppy, and that's the only thing wrong with this game in my opion. The 5 star rating is for fun and realism (not that I fought in battle). If you play this game to it's full potential using all it's features and strategy... it really makes you FEEL like you're part of a real squad and you personally get hooked with each individual character and his special trait. To lose a character and have him replaced by a rookie has mixed emotions: 1)you have this green new guy who's gonna just walk in and replace your fallen comrad. 2)you feel sorry for the new guy and have to protect him, yet give him some real experience. Thing is... watch each others back and complete a mission without losing anyone.

Avoid it like the plague","review":"I was in the mood for a change of pace from first person shooters, so I rented Conflict desert Storm thinking there might be a little more strategy involved. Much to my dismay, this has turned out to be the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are pitiful and the animation is choppy, the load times are unforgivably long, the controls are a joke, the combat is just unbearably terrible, and, basically, this game is just terrible. I only rented it, and I felt like I had been [taken].

The main problem is the graphics and framerate, the player models and textures are terrible and the gameplay is anything but smooth and consistent. As far as the actual gaming goes apparently the iraqis have super eyesight because the can see you from the moon and have the accuracy of olympic sharpshooters while you're left shooting at a single pixel of in the distance with little idea what your shooting at, where it is, and if you're hitting anything.

I got it as a supplement to SOCOM because my mommy won't let me get M rated games. Me and my brother played the Awesome Co-op mode together. It ws fun for the first two days, but got boring and repetive after that. We ended up playing it though and beating it, which must say something for the game. But it was really short. NO REPLAY VALUE! You can't go back and replay the missions you beat. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Rent it. You can most likely beat it in 3-5 days depending on how much you play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great, Great","review":"I just love this game. It is fun on xbox and ps2.

However you can tell that the effort stopped with the announcement of said confict. The game just seems unfinished, and lack of polish in gameplay doesn't cancel out the fairly good graphics.

Again, this will work, but it's hard to imagine people finishing it. But if you're truly dedicated, and mind numbing exercises work with you, give it a try. Think of it as a slot machine.

You cannot use your sword unless you have obtained level of power or some stupid thing which is so lame because the sword is the best weapon he has. You must use the right analog stick to do hand-to-hand combat when you run out of ammo, which makes you throw punches and kicks all over the place not knowing if you hit anybody.

I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality","review":"I purchased plenty of these in the past and they were a good product. But something has gone wrong at basic magic and now the quality is terrible. The outer frame is now so flimsy it is like trying to fold jello. Before, it was a snap to fold, and the shade stayed up on its own. Not anymore. I would gladly pay double for something that worked. Time to shop for one that works right."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after a few uses","review":"I should have listened to the warning I saw in another review. The same problem happened to me. The metal band punctured the fabric one of the first few times I folded it, and now I have a nice long, sharp piece of metal sticking out. I have to be very careful to not scratch the car (or poke my eye!) while deploying or folding. It's also more difficult to fold now because the metal ring no longer maintains a fixed length. These are junk, stay away! I knew I should have just bought a set at Walmart so I could at least return them if this happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Nicely","review":"I have looked for years in stores for a window shade to fit my Grand Caravan.

It is easy to use and folds up pretty compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of magnetic recording for the engineer.","review":"Wang and Taratorin present the best technical overview of magnetic recording I have seen to date. What I found especially valuable is the extensive discussion of both the characteristics and measurement of the principal non-linearities impacting magnetic recording. These include such things as non-linear transition shift, hard-easy transition shift, MR assymetries, and self erasure. The books focus is on the recording/playback processes, but also includes a reasonable introduction to coding and partial response channel design. For readers who want more details on the codes used historically, Mee and Daniel's works are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different story","review":"This 1991 movie Wizard of Oz: Danger in a Strange land is good but the story is not like the book or movie. On this VHS there is two storys one is about Glinda looseing her powers and the Wizard has lost his memory. And it is up to Dorothy and her friends to stop the Wicked Witch of the West from rewriting the History of Oz. The 2nd story is about The Day that music died which is a very strange story about Mistros baton. Overall the movie deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review","review":"Extremely self-serving and somewhat amateurish autobiography.

All you hear is Vocals, literally!!!What should have been an incredible document of a pioneering Punk band turns out to be a collossil mess.At least we still have the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good DVD Of A Great Band","review":"This dvd gets a bad rep, and I honestly dont see why, The picture quality is extremely good for an 80s punk show, Remember folks this was a Black Flag show not a Pink Floyd show, So anytime you go to watch a punk rock show on dvd that was from the 80s you cant really expect perfect picture quality, But the picture quality on this dvd is not bad at all, Its actually quite good, And the sound isnt bad either, Sure Henry Rollins vocals out power the instruments but I would rather have vocals out power the instruments instead of the other way around, Even though the vocals out power the instruments a lil bit you can still tell exactly what songs they are playing and hear them well, If you are looking to buy this dvd dont listen to all of the negative reviews, Buy it, Its a great performance by the mighty Black Flag so what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a true Black Flag fan do yourself a favor and buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY....","review":"sorry to say,but BLACK FLAG sucked after DAMAGED(and that didnt suck ONLY because a lot of the material on it had been around for a while BEFORE henry rollins joined).rollins thought himself a rock star even back in 1984.gimme a break......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars - it's Black Flag people...come on.","review":"I don't know what would be expected from a DVD of this nature. DTS? 5.1? THX LUCAS sound effects? Whatever notions you may have in your head, get rid of them. This is Black Flag. It sounded just like this at shows, at least it did when I was growing up and catching them live. You're just going to have to deal with things not sounding pristine, difficulties with imbalances in levels, etc. All in all, it sounds fine, images are fine, and it's Black Flag in their glory, captured at a time that will never again be captured. This is the true stuff people and if you have even a slight appreciation of the band, you should not hesitate to get it. I truly can't recommend this highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound quality","review":"It could have been so much better with good audio. It's a vintage Black Flag performance with Hank on vocals, but it sounds like it was recorded with one mic, the one Henry sings into. You hear the music, then when he sings you hear nothing but the vocals. The sound is so bad it's painful to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad...","review":"It's a real bummer that they had to mess up the sound on this DVD of this awesome band. Henry is way too loud and you can't hear Greg and Kira at all!Another bummer is that they cut out the time in between songs, when the band interacts with the crowd. So you can't really call it a whole concert but just a bunch of cut up song's put together. The set arrangement could have been totally different and you wouldn't even know it.On the up side: The video quality is good and you are actually watching Black Flag perform live!On behalf of the sound and editing: it is truly a shame. Especially since live Black Flag performances on tape/DVD are so rare. Oh well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Black Flag Live DVD","review":"I have never before seen a live dvd of Black Flag live. I must say even though the camera work is very improvised and new wave looking the director got the right shots. If I correct it is the only live dvd of the Flag ever. It is great watching Henry Rollins singing like a crazy person. I would recommend it for any serious fans of the Flag. If you are new to the Flag you might not like this dvd. To really injoy it you must know the histroy of the Flag. SO YOU SECENE KIDS BETTER STAY AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one!","review":"Hate it, hate it, hate it. Nothing larger than a teaspoon or small fork will stay in the cutlery container without easily falling out of the top, and after a couple of years the rubber coating on the rack starts to crack and the rust starts to show. I've been annoyed by Rubbermaid products, and particularly this dish drainer, since 1971, so this isn't a brash review. Do yourself a favor, pay the price and buy a fantastic dish rack on Amazon.com like the simplehuman KT1025 System Dish rack (pricey but worth every dollar) or OXO Good Grips stainless dish rack and sink mats. Their designs are attractive and will blend with any décor, and they are well made and will last for years. The money you save now on the Rubbermaid product will soon be spent on frequent replacements and on aspirin for the headaches this cheap piece of garbage causes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper quality","review":"I was disappointed in this purchase. I have used Rubbermaid for years and up to this purchase products maintained quality. This drainer was made cheaply. Thickness to make it tough enough to last is no longer there and drainer is smaller than my last LARGE dish drainer. This one fit inside the old one. Rubbermaid not everyone uses dish washers and there is still a need for a quality dish drainer. I'm disappointed and will look at other manufactures for my next replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% RIDICULOUS!!","review":"Clearly this price is completely insane!

Gone are gratuitous drug references, and \\"SATAN-SATAN-SATAN!\\"-isms, in favor of expanded studio trickery, and suprisingly personal lyrics, behind all the usual action figure imagery. Dare I call it a sign of maturity? More like a reason to beleive in this group's career longevity.

It enabled viewers to discover the history of mucis from the outlook of the insders of those who produced it. The actual music that was performed in the video was nice and one only wished that there was a soundtrack easily available for the movie. This video would be most recommended to those who appreciate the history of gospel in a unique way and also like to appreciate the music from the 30s to the 70s and early 80s. It is video that can be watched by the whole family along with those who are great enthusiast of gospel music."},{"rating":"2","title":"one great sound track","review":"I don't buy soundtracks regularly, only the ones I really really love like Braveheart, all the Rings music, Name of the Father and Raise the Titanic. So this ranks up there with my all time favourites. It's a wonderfully romantic, spirit lifting soundtrack, with Brian Adams marvellous lead Have You Ever Really Love of Woman. This is a soundtrack I just do not tire.So if you loved the movie, I am sure you will enjoy all the wonderful tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a one song soundtrack, unfortunately.","review":"Bryan Adams is good and the Mexican tunes are great, but let's be honest: this is a single not a soundtrack. The best song by far is the Mexican version of \\"Have you ever...\\", but it is a paltry two minutes long and clipped short at the end. Come on folks, what's the deal? Was the CD running out of space or something, or did Bryan A. not want to be upstaged? I was very disappointed and cannot recommend this soundtrack/single!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one song soundtrack? I don't think this is Titanic buddy!","review":"This album is full of pure and beautiful spanish and mexican music played with an acoustic guitar full of catchy melodic hooks and the beautifully written ballad Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman which was a monster hit in 1995. The rest of the album is nothing like that though it's a musical score of the movie soundtrack, it's not a bunch of tracks from pop artists, you'll have to check out waiting to exhale, another successful movie soundtrack of 1996 for that. If any soundtrack is a one song one, it's Titanic cause honestly what else is good on that soundtrack other than the overplayed my heart will go on?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Adams aside, gorgeous spanish melodies, don't miss","review":"I bought this after seeing the movie, at times the music was the best part. The spanish version of the Bryan Adams title track is to be played over and over. There are a couple places where the music is just filler from movie moments but nontheless engaging. Imagine Flaminco dancers, ladies in tight red dresses, roses scenting the air, Sangria... This is a perfect candelight dinner, evening drive, bubble bath choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"Its ok but wat really makes me upset is selena quintanilla Perez sang songs for this album but was not released on album when it should've been I understand she died but its not right to leave it out.I recommend u watch the movie to hear her sing in Spanish"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful listening experience.","review":"I've never seen this film, maybe never will, and I didn't buy this because of the Bryan Adams song (although I've got nothing against the man or the song).I simply bought this based on a review I read at Filmtracks dot com- and I am not disappointed.I've listened to it about five times now, always with my headphones while down at the boat docks, and it really just gets better each time (I didn't load the pop song onto my player, just the score music).A wonderful pseudo-latin beach vibe, very romantic and melodic.This is such perfect sea-side relaxation music, the album cover should have palm trees in the sunset on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The music is consistently beautiful and supportive of a charming story. One can re-live the scenes through an mp3 player and a pair of headphones.

This is not a book, Its barely a manual!, It has the size of a printer manual, both in height, width and number of pages. When I pay more than 40 bucks plus shipping the least I expect is a serious book.2. This book was written when Netscape was still alive!, I mean at least the author could have updated it to talk about Firefox and Opera, but the examples remained.3. It's oriented for people who don't know much about computers, if you're computer savvy, it's probably best that you skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good companion reading for an instructor certification course","review":"Our instructor certification course is heavy on skill building.

First off, the book is boring - there is not enough of the clever conversation that I know Ms Darcy is capable of. And the Heroine (Allegra) is not just dull, she is rather stupid and WAY too full of pride. I did like her sister though and wish the book had been about Hilary instead! Sir Derek was so arrogant that I was rooting for Allegra to fall in love with someone else. But what I disliked most about this book was that Allegra and Sir Derek spent almost the entire book misunderstanding and fighting with each other. I enjoy it when the main characters banter with each other but I hate it when the banter crosses the line into sniping as it does in this book. Not reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living with Pamela Stephenson","review":"I thought I was going to read about Billy and his adventures. However, for a book supposedly about the Big Yin, three quarters of it is about his wife and her adventures. When she does talk about Billy's childhood, its impossible to believe anyone could remember such detail. I found myself skimming through the 38 pages devoted to HER trip to India while Billy was home nursing a bad back. There is also too much detail about everything BUT Billy, such as the history of their home in Candacraig that dated back to the 1500's, flyfishing, the South Pacific. Pamela's first book \\"Billy\\" was great but I found the sequel to be a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining look at a \\"year in the life\\" of Billy Connolly","review":"Arguably one of Scotland's most famous exports, Billy Connolly's life and adventures have been well documented in print, in his stage acts, and television shows created for British audiences. While not so well known in the US, he has been a huge star in Great Britain for decades.This book, lovingly written by his wife Pamela Stephenson, seems to take Billy's familiarity for granted. Rather oddly constructed for a biography, Bravemouth gives an interesting insight into their marriage and into Billy's evolving relationship with himself as he ages, cleans-up, and \\"embraces\\" Hollywood. The book focuses a great deal on their trips and in particular on Billy's extravagant 60th birthday party.More a \\"year in the life of\\" rather than a true biography, this is a witty and winning look at the irreverent Billy Connolly. Full of color photos, this will be a welcome read for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"I love these headphones I have owned 2 pairs of these over 3 years and I must say the things that make these headphones worthwhile is comfort and lightweight.

One of the only criticisms I can make of Roald Dahl's novels is that they often tend to read like a collection of marginally related stories. (For example, \\"Matilda\\" was an excellent book but some entire chapters could be removed and the novel would have remained essentially the same.) Here, the book IS a collection of short stories, and so this flaw is irrelevant! Everything here is written with the touches that make Dahl's work so much fun: the flashes of mature wit among the whimsical storytelling.

I have no idea how durable it is going to be because I have no experience with this juicer. I think the motor is foreign made. American made motor will cost more. Also the heat rating of the motor is the lowest. As long as I don't use it commercially, it will be fine. The first time I juiced 20 lbs of carrot in one hour., the machine gets hot.I only used moderate force to push down the carrot. So it is not for commercial use. Clean up is quick. Operation is neat. Juice on one side and waste go other way, so you can continues;y making juice till the machine feels too hot. Even though I think the component used in this machine is different from the old one, but the quality is acceptable and serves its purpose. And the small manufacturer managed to sell it at an affordable price. It is an achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this one","review":"I bought my Champion Juicer in the 70's.My juicer has been PERFECT from day 1.

No sugar added,no fat.I read the bad reviews but they are wrong. This juicer is a workhorse and will last forever.This juicer has never faltered or overheated anything.

We buy apples and carrots from Costco for about 70 to 80 cents a pound, add some ginger and drink. It revitalizes us and I miss when I travel and can't have my juice.More expensive to buy than others but well worth the additional cost.

It is an amazing treat that looks and feels like ice cream or custard.Buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design and performance problems","review":"I just received this juicer, and have tried juicing two batches of mixed juice. It's pesky to clean, difficult to attach the \\"body\\" to the cutter shaft (dealing with the screen is very awkward), the juice comes out slowly, and the screen clogs to the point where you have to stop and clean it out before you're done with your batch. And also one thing I'm finding--it takes a whole lotta produce to make a couple small glasses of juice. Juicing is not a cheap proposition. This morning I juiced 6 carrots, 3 beets, one apple, and two big leaves of chard, to get about 8 or so ounces of juice. Plus there was a whole lot of foam which I couldn't blend back into the juice. Champion is supposed to be first and foremost, but I think I'm going to look around at different models.

The pieces are easy to clean and it makes sorbet at the flip of a switch and some frozen fruit. My husband froze coffee with honey and pumpkin spice in ice cube trays last night and put it through with this morning and it made an amazing frappuccino in seconds! I wished I would have had this when my kids were babies because I could have made there baby food very easily. Also, the juice is VERY clear and tastes amazing. We could not be happier! The only thing I would say is less convenient is that you need to cut up the fruit in smaller pieces than we did with the old juicer, and we put it through a little slower, but the results are worth it, and the clean time is nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice for juicing","review":"Juicer leaks out juice when used with blank for grinding only for use with a pulp press for final juice extraction.

Because one you try it out a couple of times, I can guarantee you'll want your money back. It gets dull fast, and its AWFUL, just awful, for leafy greens. And I also read in one review that someone had the clean up timed to 3 minutes. Why did they feel a need to time the process? Because it is an arguably LONG and irritating process. If you get some sort of routine down, it can be done faster- but there is no denying that as an every day task, cleaning up this monster = TIME SUCKAGE!

In fact, a whole page is dedicated to someone trying to clue him in. For example when Roy was told his whole department was let go he didn't get it. Even though all of the furniture, computers, and cubes were gone Roy was still wondering when he was going to start his new job as the boss of a department that was missing.

I kept reading and reading waiting for the suspense to happen, even in the last 50 pages I still held out hope, but NOOO... This book reminded me of a bad made-for-TV movie. The epilogue-like ending (don't read further if you don't want it spoiled), was ludicrously unbelievable as the main character shoots the antagonist between the eyes then gets a $250 dollar fine for disturbing the peace. What a waste of time. This was my first Abrahams novel, read because Stephen King had recommend four of his books in \\"On Writing\\" (not this one). I'll give him another try - hope he has something better to offer than this wretched scribbling that would never have gotten published by a no-name author. Simply awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood Novel","review":"This is certainly not a typical Abrahams suspense novel. I feel it is more of a mainsteam novel with strong satirical and historical overtones. It addresses rifts in our country that have never healed, and how gaming gets out of hand. I found the novel highly charged and highly symbolic, and quite underrated. If you're looking for suspense, read another of Abraham's novels; if you're looking for a a thoughtful and subtle read which works through suggestion, this just might be your cup of campfire coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"One of the worst books I ever read, if not theeee worst. It started out with a lot of promise. The author does touch on some good issues and why the war started. But he bogs down with poor character development and an even worst ending. (...) Absolutley the worst job ever. I felt robbed cheated and let down. The only thing I can possibly think is that the author wanted me to feel as bad as the Rebels when they surrendered. The writing style is so annoying. The main character is a moron. I thought of Homer Simpson the whole time. I mean the guy was clueless throughout the entire book. It started to piss me off. I had to force myself to continue. I strugggled to finish it believing you should finish what you start. Too bad the author didn't.

Instead, Barton argues that the country was founded as a Christian nation, and that the framers meant to establish a government where government leaders would continually consult Christian leaders (presumably people like Barton).Barton also makes the odd claims that most of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were clergymen. Only one of the 56 was an active clergyman, and that was John Witherspoon. Witherspoon was a Presbyterian minister and president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).Only 1.79% of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence were clergy. Does Barton actually think that 1.79% qualifies as most?Or is Barton (as so many REAL historians have judged him) a historic revisionist and shameless liar?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to David Barton","review":"David Barton's \\"Pastors & Christians\\" was very informative and gave me information to share with my Pastor who was not aware of much of the information contained therein.Kudos to Mr. Barton for putting this in a format easily read and understood.

Shortly after purchase, the hinges became very difficult to open and shut. I called the company and found out they had been recalled. They told me if I sent mine back they would send a free replacement. I got the new bag and it worked great for the first couple of months. Now the hinge on the new \\"improved\\" one is getting difficult to open and shut too. This time I think I'll just look for a different brand. I love the way it works, WHEN it works, but they need to get the hinge problem fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm here for my second!","review":"I think this is a great pouch. The fact that you can use the included belt or the clip makes it really convenient for hands-free training. I've used mine nearly every day for about 11 months. The pouch still functions to hold treats, but the brackets on each side have both come off within the last couple months and the velcro on the front pocket is useless and has been since about the first month. It was definitely worth the price and I'm here to buy another one as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bait Bag Hands Down!","review":"I've used several bait bags (treat bag) and this one is perfect. The belt isn't much to speak of, but I don't use it anyway. It has a great clip on the back that is easy to get on and off, comfortable, and clips right to your waistline. The large bait pouch pops open easy and stays open until you are ready to close it again. The large opening makes it easy to access treats... no strings or flaps to try and work your hand through. It is also quite which you need when training. The smaller pouch on the front is perfect for carrying dumpling bags... on the back is a great zipper pouch too. (I carry my business cards in it) The back also sports a key ring which I use carabiner keychains to hold clients keys. Fantastic product. Well built... works great. I had the first one for two years. Now it started to squeak a bit when closing the hinged treat pouch. Just replaced with same model. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog is glad I bought this","review":"This is very comfortable to wear. It's great to have a \\"pocket\\" that opens easy and snaps shut easily. I don't have to fumble in my pants pocket anymore for treats.

I should also mention that the little pouch in front of the main one is great for carrying my phone while hiking with my dog. I do recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient treat pouch","review":"This treat pouch does everything I needed. It's easy to open and close with one hand.

This product seems to be made of good quality material and the 'spring' open/close feature works well. I also love that my cell phone fits in the extra pocket with a velcro closing. I am giving it four stars instead of five because the clip is made of plastic and not very functional, you will need to use the belt option or it won't stay on. With the clip, anytime I leaned over the whole pocket would fall off. But at least the treats stay in because the closing mechanism is secure. If you don't mind using the belt with it, I highly recommend the treat pouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and VERY handy","review":"Great product. Used it last night in obedience class.

I watched the DVD first and Joe's Personality is his own and you respect that. He is not really a passionate guy when he talks and his singing also lacks passion. That was the biggest disappointment for me on this record. I never expected Tyler style vocals on this at all....but Joe's voice is best on softer tunes and I really don't think it fits in well with most of the music here.

You have to take it for what it is, and what it is, is an amazing collection of songs produced from old guitar riffs. Its ok that Joe's vocals are not like Steven Tyler's. Joe is doing the best he can vocally and the emotion in the song should shatter any bad feelings you have about the album. Joe makes his guitar sing, the vocals are just a bonus. Great CD, way better than the project. If you know anything about music, you'll look beyond just the vocals because we all know its about the music as a whole.

He is an okay songwriter...a decent guitar player, but vocalist? Sorry, Joe. He sounds like that guy next door who can play guitar and fiddles around singing songs. NOthing you would want to pay to hear and I am sorry I did!

The vocals are horrendous,except for \\"crystal ship\\", the lyrics are so cliche' and immature it is beyond belief and the production is bad. There are a couple of musical ideas that are somewhat interesting. I grew up idolizing joe as a guitar player and I expected to hear something that was fresh and imaginitive but that was not to be.

One song is just noise behind a slow drum beat. Eject has some heavy guitar work but is more like dokken or Led Zeppelin heavy, that's as heavy as it gets. Blow away Limp Bizkit? only if it's a soft rock rap contest!!! People like myself from the school of Metallica and Megadeth will find this CD to be a rap CD nothing more.

They isolate the sound better and have better sound quality than the over-ear monitors I was using. They are also much more comfortable to wear. These things are very comfortable and nice to wear.I would definitely recommend these to anyone. I would also add that if you have more money to spend, try upgrading to the UM2 or UM3.

Fanny had a dream to marry a prince and have a life of ease and luxury, waited on hand and foot. But the reality was that she married a simple farmer, just like her. They had a good marriage full of happiness, but also a life of hard work and the occasional disaster.

No more. No less.What Styx did, and did fairly well, was standard commercial radio fodder for the mid 70's to early 80's. Judging such by today's standards isn't entirely fair, but such is always inevitable.Great art is was not (not by any stretch of the imagination) and while the vocals of Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw were not always pleasant to hear, the band had a modest way with the hooks that could overshadow such oversight.In other words here lies some entertaining, but hardly consequential music, and this album represents a time capsule of American pop culture circa 1975-1983. It isn't likely to be played in music appreciation classes in the year 2100, but some of it will probably get you humming along today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corprotate sludge, pure and simple","review":"The musicianship is dull and sloppy.

I love me some classic, but it's time for Styx to go the route of Toni Basil and just go into choreography. I liked the behind the music because they really had some good, solid conflict. I keep hearing their songs everywhere and they are kind of wimpy. I love Mr. Roboto because I too, have dealt with the inner workings of a japanese robot society. It's not something you share with the group and I'm someone who works and plays well with others. I don't have a problem personally with styx because I admire the guts it took to wear some of the satin outfits they did. If I programmed VH1 classic, it would be Toto, toto and a side of more toto. Can you get enough of \\"Africa\\" or \\"Roseanna\\"? It's like a dang chinese buffet to me in that I know I don't \\"need\\" more General Tsao, but darned if I don't pile another load on my plate.

From the power ballads (some of the first ever made) to the rockers this CD falters little. The only let down, from my perspective, was the inclusion of the newer Mr. Roboto although many did like it. If I remember correctly it was a top 10 song.A very good retrospective of a very good, many times underrated, band.

The press hated them, fans loved them and the band was one of the true superstars of the mid 70s to early 80s.

The 16 songs on this CD helped to define music in the '70s and '80s. The songs show that Styx has breadth (with diverse tunes from Babe to Miss America to Mr. Roboto)and depth and substance (tunes such as The Grand Illusion, Crystal Ball, and Show Me the Way). Plus it has flat-out rock classics like Renegade, Blue Collar Man, and Come Sail Away. It's guaranteed that there is something on here that you will know and like.

This is a truely great CD. If you listen close to the words of Dennis DeYoung, you can see how Styx is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. A true collection of hits with the mix of hard hitting guitar and the feeling and emotion of the ballads. Styx keeps their legacy of great albums going with this one. Styx has put together a scrapbook of music that takes you through the 80's and delivers you straight into the 90's, virtually unharmed by Michael Jackson or Madonna's huge cones.

Turns out one of the gears inside is made of a soft plastic and wears out easily. When I called customer service to request a replacement I found out that my warranty was void because I sharpened a colored pencil in it! I was politely told that I couldn't buy a replacement gear, but could buy a whole new pencil sharpener if I would like! I paid nearly $80 dollars out of my own money to get a decent pencil sharpener only to be disappointed by the horrible customer service.

So I would not waste my money on this product. However, on a better note, Amazon did deliver this product quick. No reflection on amazon, but the product is just garbage. Don't buy this sharpener.

I removed the cutters and called the Bostitch company to order some new cutters. Much to my surprise I was told that they do not sell replacement cutters for any of their sharpeners and that dull blades are part of normal wear and tear on the sharpeners. Their recommendation is to but new ones. That I will but they will be Elmers/Xacto models that have replaceable blades from now on.

Unfortunately my hopes were thoroughly dashed the instant I first tried it out. All I can say in its favor is that it's powerful. Despite my every attempt at control, each pencil quickly ended up over-sharpened with an off-center loppy irregular cut to a uselessly sharp pinpoint. If the user doesn't keep a tight on the pencil the sharpener spins it out of your hand.

It sharpens the point so it is half wood and half lead, like I now see in so many reviews. DO NOT BUY! Based on the customer service reports in other reviews, I'll not expect them to replace it. It is clean inside but the problem is that it does not align the pencil properly. POS.

The motor seems wimpy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpens On One Side Only","review":"This sharpener is rather unpredictable. Some pencils come out well, but the majority of them are just sharpened on one side which makes the pencils unusable. Once this irregular sharpening occurs it's very difficult, if not impossible, to correct the shape of the pencil tip. I've tried everything to get the pencils to consistently sharpen well and nothing seems to work. I returned my first sharpener, and the second one was even worse--it sucked the pencils into the sharpener and jammed itself. I'm going to try the X-Acto brand and see if that one works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not take the beating","review":"Paid the big bucks out of my pocket to get this for my class room. Almost lasted the year, but it did not. I took it apart to see what broke. The unit has a motor that looks like it could run a tank. Unfortunately the driven gear is a very flimsy nylon unit and it stripped out. If this was a metal gear, this thing would be unstoppable. I'm trying to find this part, but have had no luck so far.

Now, just today it got stuck in the working mode, so I unplugged it. It has been making a HORRENDOUS clanking sound while it \\"worked\\".I would not recommend that anybody get this that uses a sharpener regularly (read daily) for heavy use. It just did not hold up.

And it certainly can chew up a pencil quickly. But when it's all said and done, it gives an uneven point. I understand that some pencils are cheaply made and could leave to an uneven point, but this wasn't the case. I tried the same pencil in a small hand sharpener and my old bostitch that will barely run. But in this sharpener, the point is off center with the wood of the pencil almost to the point of the sharpened pencil. I can turn the pencil 180 degrees and move the off center of the sharpening. So I've returned it and am looking for another sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faculty Asst.","review":"This sharpener is a HUGE disappointment! We are currenty on our 4th one in 3 school years.

While it does provide that, the instruction could be better. I am pretty good at picking up choreography and was struggling a bit with this one. The moves aren't that tough it is just Michelle's timing is a bit off. I found I was spending more time trying to get on the right side/foot and less on working out.

(And that is high praise!) Her charactorization is very convincing, weather the charactor is a reoccuring one, or just someone encountered in passing. The mysteries are well-constructed and difficult to solve before the end--I may like the middle ages, but if I've figured out the who-done-it before the end, it's still a disappointment.

I can't wait to read the next one. Characterization is superb, you grow to know these people and care about them. The story is based on real historical facts, but honestly I couldn't care less because I get so wrapped up in the characters. My only wish in this book was that the author had put her loyalties with the reader in regard to Alice Perrer and let her fall from grace and give us some juicy vengeance.

We love you but yea craig"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply great","review":"If you don't know about Wallace and Gromit, well it's a pity. The series is limited to few episodes, but they are gems in their genre. Do kids love it? yes they do a lot. Maybe the British accent and setup make these movies more imaginative and fantastic than any other movie for children that I've ever seen.My daughter is 2 and she prefers Wallace and Gromit to Chicken Run. Their episodes are shorter and fit kids' ability of concentration. The stories have several layers and can make happy kids of all ages and can be replayed several times because there is always something they have missed. Overall a great set of short movies. It's a shame there isn't a larger supply of such movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wallace & Gromit Trilogy are the best movies ever!","review":"These three movies are the best you will ever see. They are about a dog (Gromit), and his owner (Wallace). They are clay-animated, and are about their adventures in life. The Wrong Trousers, one of the movies, is about a penguin who rents a room in their house. Can they trust this mysterious paying guest? When he wakes up, is new invention puts him in his new gift to Gromit called Techno-Trousers. But now they have a mind of thier own! There are 2 more great adventures just waiting to be seen.

THE WRONG TROUSERS is probably the most consistently funny, but A CLOSE SHAVE has moments of extreme hilarity as well. A GRAND DAY OUT has less side-splitting humor, but is charming and has some very funny bits of its own. These films wear extremely well under repeated viewing. You may end up inviting people to watch them who have never seen Wallace and Gromit. Watching people experience the delight for the first time is a grand treat.Park also directed CHICKEN RUN and a wickedly funny short animated piece called CREATURE COMFORTS.Would you like some CHEESE, Gromit?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Academy Award-winning work well worth your time","review":"It's easy to mistake this as children's material. But fortunately this is a case of a piece of art being genuinely for all audiences. It's appeal to children is somewhat obvious, but it's attraction for adults is all in the filmmaking. Don't let the claymation fool you: this is a *film*. Camera angles, lighting, scripts, shot composition and cinematography are all as carefuly crafted as the clay figures themselves. Humor easily works on several levels, and within seconds you'll be lost in the world of Wallace and Grommit--whether you have kids or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly funny, Incredibly amazing.","review":"So many people have said everything that needs to be said. The incredible adventures of Wallace and Grommit are all incredibly funny and amazing. As funny as it is The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave still top Nick Parks full length feature Chicken Run. If you have any doubts as to how good these films are, the Internet Movie Database had a list of its best ranked films of all time. Of all the movies in the history of film do you know what was the number one film two years ago? It was the Wrong Trousers! You won't find it there now because they dropped it as it wasn't a full length feature. But if you check the ratings it would still be in the top twenty. Don't let your life go by without seeing these films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for all ages","review":"I discovered W & G at the age of 22 but I would have been equally fascinated with them at 2 or 102. A Grand Day Out - 3 stars, The Wrong Trousers - 6 stars, A Close Shave - 6 stars, oh can't we have another one Nick?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy sound quality","review":"The original short cartoons by Nick Park are, of course, excellent. But the quality of this DVD does not do them justice. One of the main reasons people buy DVD's is for the excellent sound and picture quality. However, on this DVD, the sound is so muddy you can barely understand the dialogue. (The picture is fine.)Also, the Closed-captioning is hideous. I tried watching with the closed-captioning on, and the captions bore little resemblance to the dailogue. For example, early in \\"The Wrong Trousers\\", Wallace wants Gromit to make breakfast. He says, \\"I'd like a three-minute egg.\\" The captioning reads, \\"I've got three minutes, eh?\\" After suffering through several such mangaled lines, my brain hurt so much I had to switch captioning off.The original cartoons are excellent. This version, this DVD, is terrible. Hopefully someday a good version will be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best animation one should own","review":"Intiligently funny plot for all three episodes. The movies are so well that it's hard to believe that they were made by only a few persons (details of the making is also fun). Must have in collection for every family,I am really glad it came out in DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where a BIG HIT starts","review":"The three first adventures of Wallace and Gromit. The first adventure is not as good and as I try to isolate the reason why I think it is because Wallace's mouth is very small and you cannot see his big smile and teeth. The music theme is very catching and my two year old son is already humming it. The humour is soo wity and no matter how many times you watch the three movies you will discover something new. Everything here is hand-made which makes me appreciate even more this three movies. I highly reccomend it as family entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer fun!","review":"I saw these 3 clips at the movies and liked them so much that I bought the video. They are even better the second time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This was a gift my kids picked out for their Grandpa. He loves Wallace and Gromit. If his glee was any indication, and I think it is, this DVD is excellent, filled with some very funny stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Set with the Classics","review":"I bought this a few years ago and could never be happier. The first Wallace and Gromit film I saw was The Wrong Trousers. After that, I hadn't seen the others before at all. You can tell the age of A Grand Day Out, but it's still great! The two compliment each other- Wallace is the genius, while Gromit is the friend who pretty much knows what Wallace SHOULD have done to avoid an accident or explosion in one of his experiments (lol).The set doesn't include any of the really new films, but these three are a great watch, no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy 20 years!","review":"They just turned 20 and I only recently discovered them while in England and loved em!had to get the video in USA format!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracking-good videos, Gromit!","review":"This set is a must-have for anyone!

Once we watched one we were hooked. We have watched these videos dozens of times and each time is as much fun as the last. My kids and I love these videos. I just ordered 5 sets for friends.

I can't wait for more W&G videos!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment, check out the DVD","review":"I won't waste time saying how incredible the art and animation of Nick Parks is. Rather I'll try to encourage the proliferation of the DVD version of this set as it is far superior. This 3 pack is only three 30-minute videos, but the DVD contains Wrong Trouser behind-the-scenes footage (30 minutes) and several little tidbits that make it a must for W&G fans (see my review there to learn more about the extras)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful","review":"Be careful. Yes, this is a DVD, and a great one to boot, but you can buy the VHS tape in any $1 store anywhere.

Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it just for the Cracking Contraptions!","review":"While this is a great DVD, the thing that makes it really special is the inclusion of Cracking Contraptions! These are 10 shorts that highlight Wallace's inventing skill. Wallace and Gromit at their finest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent short stories of Wallace and Gromit","review":"This DVD contains 3 short stories of Wallace and Gromit plus a series of about 10, 2 minute skits. All are from years before the Wallace and Gromit movies and while they are not as \\"polished\\" as the movie, they are just as good. Two of the short are excellent, while one, the first one, it not up to the same standard but still good. The short skits are very funny. Great for kids when you don't have time for a full movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great program - bad DVD","review":"First of all, let me just say that the above rating in no way indicates how I feel about the \\"Wallace & Gromit\\" shorts, all of which are superb pieces of animation.My rating applies only to this slipshod DVD release, obviously intended to capitalize on the upcoming W&G; \\"Curse of the Were-Rabbit\\" feature, and lacking all of the wonderful extras of the previous BBC version.Gone are the Nick Park commentaries, the behind-the-scenes featurettes or the cute scrapbooks or photo galleries. In fact the only \\"behind-the-scenes\\" material collected on this disc applies to programs OTHER than the main W&G; films. A true disappointment.So, my advice is ignore this release and do your best to track down the old version. It will be well-worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed with Dreamworks for editing the Wallace and Gromit shorts","review":"I give the ORIGINAL Wallace and Gromit shorts a 5 stars! They are funny, intelligent, wry, and perfect for persons of any age.I wish I had read the excellent Wallace and Gromit review above by Mr. J. Lee (first review when I posted my comments) before purchasing this DVD. I was very dissapointed with the editing imposed on the originals by Dreamworks.To add to Mr. Lee's list of edits to \\"The Wrong Trousers\\" I also noted that Dreamworks deleted an early scene in \\"A Close Shave\\" where the sheep go into the mincer and then get packaged as Preston Dog Food. These deletion results in \\"A Close Shave\\" being a bit incoherent at the conclusion due to the lack of reference to this earlier scene!Shame on Dreamworks! I can only hope to locate a version of the undedited Wallace and Gromit shorts on DVD somewhere and sometime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius!","review":"I wish that the makers of feature length films would put half as much thought into detail as the makers of these 20 minute \\"shorts\\" did.

I love this album as much or more than anything I have ever heard! It's uplifting most of the time. The slower sad songs are still just as good in their own way though. Certain songs always give me a burst of energy, even after 50 plays or more. Musically, they do sound much like the first Sundays album. For fans of ethereal, dreamy, happy (most of the time), jangle-pop, and dream-pop. The guitars chime a little like The Byrds. The vocals really have a child-like innocence to them. Karin Peris almost sounds like a little girl singing. She never sounds syrupy or girly.

There both really good bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album will help you get some.","review":"I was introduced to this album by a girl whom I was beginning to date. We are no longer dating but she left me a great present. She left me 'Glow'. I have used it over and over, with varying degrees of success when inviting a girl over to my place.

Good luck..............Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should Own This Album","review":"I have never found better music anywhere. Brilliant simplicity, beauty found nowhere else, innocence for sure, and the desire and happiness in life that exudes from this music: it's unmatchable.

It definitely GLOWS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!","review":"Well...\\"Bright As Yellow\\" had been stuck in my head for a good 3 years before I finally bought this album. I'm a huge fan of Sixpence None the Richer and The Sundays,and enough comparisons to both bands persuaded me. Wow...what an amazing,thought-provoking,spiritually challenging, beautiful album!!! Karen Peris has a voice that touches something familiar in all of us...emotion. Her delivery is honest and delicate,not attacking you with her lyrics,which also hit home right now for me. The melodies are subtle but gorgeous,and they really have a \\"sound\\" without sounding the same on every song. I can't wait until their next album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best pop album of the last ten years","review":"Original, catchy melodies, beautifully recorded and produced, this is the best pop album since Prefab Sprout's \\"Two Wheels Good\\"(1986).

Would anyone consider Natalie Merchant's voice to be childlike and innocent? I think not. Paris's lyrics are more haunting and heartbreaking for this very reason (on Glow especially.) This album, musically brilliant as well as vocally, pulls at your emotions with the girlish voice telling childish stories about relatives' houses and kid's games played around the \\"library lions.\\" The authenticity of these situations combined with her small voice (bravado as it may be) make for a beautiful tour of youth in a lovely country. Natalie's a bit on the older side (figuratively and sonically.) Maybe she's like her older sister or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Albums of All Time","review":"I have never found better music anywhere.

I have to say that it has turned out to be one of the best CD puchases I have made. All of the other reviews have celebrated Karen Peris's beautiful vocals and evocative lyrics, and the ethereal, sonorous music, and I would definitely agree with them. When I listen to it, it feels like I'm quietly leafing through a photo album on a rainy afternoon. It's a great album to listen to when you just want to relax. As others say here, this is a great album from start to finish, and though I have listened to it countless times, I look forward to each song every time I listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"I don't have this model, but the one with the blue bubble shower cap, and it doesn't seem to matter when reading the other reviews of this model because the mildew problem is still the same! What were these manufacturers thinking?! The design leaves MANY crevices where mold develops (under the flip top, the spout area, in and around the inside..). I have to clean it out every week if that, and even then, some of the crevices are too small for even a toothbrush to reach, so now I will have to resort to soaking it in a diluted bleach solution.The only positive to say about this spout guard is that, yes, it does protect your child from bumping his head, but when they're toddlers, you will cringe to see them try to drink water out of the flip top and suck on it if there is MILDEW growing on the duck! All in all, this is a horrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit our spout ...","review":"If you have a newer spout, this product may not work for you. It did not fit our \\"standard\\" spout (installed 3 years ago).You may want to skip this product anyway.

Jann Arden is a master of words; a lyrical genius. Her songs talk to the heart and come from the soul, and her voice is angelic beyond description. \\"Insensitive\\" is not a song to listen to when you're in a great mood; I am near tears every time I listen to it. \\"Good Mother\\" is a beautiful and up beat song about a woman who has everything, but has \\"never wanted something so bad.\\" The only singer out there that can compete with the lyrical value is Melissa Etheridge.

Found the CD in a used CD store, so I bought it. I've just about worn it out. Jann Arden says one of her inspirations growing up was Karen Carpenter. Mine, too. Arden's voice isn't as velvety or as purely perfect as Carpenter's. Certainly the arrangements aren't as lush. But Arden's voice is more immediate. She seems more worldly, been-there-done-that, though never too jaded to sing her signature \\"Good Mother.\\" If you enjoy Karen Carpenter, Joni Mitchell, Dar Williams, Sara Bareilles, Anna Nalick, Beth Orton, et al, you will probably enjoy Jann Arden."},{"rating":"2","title":"I attended a Jann Arden live concert on Thurs., Aug. 07, 2007!","review":"The concert opened the Fergus(Ontario) Highland Games.

Tunes like \\"Unloved\\", a great duet with Jackson Browne, and \\"Good Mother\\" are just two of the many pleasant sounding hits from this artist.

I use it mostly when I travel and hike. You never need to worry about unclean water no matter where you are. It is an easy system, doesn't require any more work than a normal water bottle and is the same size as a normal waterbottle. I just warn you about one thing: if you change elevation (ie hiking in mountains or especially on a plane), the pressure in the bottle changes and when you open it, water will squirt out at you... but there is an easy solution, open the bottle with the straw in your mouth. I also think that the bottle could use a lid of some sort to keep the straw/mouth piece clean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Good","review":"The filter works well, but I gave 4 stars because the new filter allows more air while sucking than the original filter that came with the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found the book very enjoyable.","review":"Took away one star because this book did not give enough information as to where the trivia facts came from.

Not until I approached the end of the book did I realize how full of hate I had been in the past because I had poorly processed past emotional injuries. By the end of the book, as I became increasingly skilled at processing past negative experiences, I realized that anger and hatred had been replaced by compassion and love for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, A Disappointment","review":"The book is helpful in identifying anger in all its forms. You may be surprised, as was I, to learn how deep and strongly felt anger is in your life.

I picked up on this when the series was being shown first run. (I am a real antique.) Lucy in Peanuts once asked Linus if he was ever aware of his tongue. After two wordless panels he says \\"AAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH\\" or something to that effect and runs off. It is sort of like that with Gale's one way hyper-ventilation. Once aware of it, you can never listen to her talk again without being driven to distraction.Having established that, where the hell is Topper (the series) in which we learn that Alexander Waverly was a banker before becomming head of U.N.C.L.E.? Also, is anybody else cognizant of the fact that Stephen Sondheim wrote some of Topper's scripts? And where is The Man from U.N.C.L.E.???

I'm not a fan of wireless mice, the lag they all seem to have always creeps up at the most inopportune times. When I discovered this mouse was actually made by Logitech, it pretty much sealed the deal for me. It works great, is comfortable in my hand, and if you ever complain that the other Logitech mice are (or feel) too small in your hand, you won't feel this was about the Labtec.My only complaint is that it feels a little cheap at first, as the \\"rubberized\\" grips are really just painted plastic -- they do feel a little different, but not like rubber, which is what I expected from the advertisement.

I bought it because the movie was great and the soundtrack killer! However, when I brought it home, I found I did not know so many of the songs.

Those songs include, the amazing 'Video Killed Radio Star', the song when Warren comes in shotting up the place, when Cory is preparing Rex's lunch. Not to mention Amore, Amore, Rex Manning's song, itself.Gin Blossoms, Edwyn Collins and The Martinis are included which were good songs. The first two names are the only well-known names on the disc. The songs included were good but, it seems that the songs that were draw more buyers were forgotten. I would also have preferred to hear Rene Zwellenger sing, 'Sugar High'.

The best song on the soundtrack is 'Til I Hear It From You'.'Sugar High' was raw in the movie, but its a different version the disc and it sucks; the one from the movie was so much better. You're better off not buying the cd. Buy the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"i won't give it a 5","review":"because its incomplete. The great thing about empire records is that its got an excellent soundtrack with funny performances that roll along with them. (that and its a time capsule movie to one of my favorite decades)They knocked out so many songs making this album that it fails in comparison to the movie. When they made the soundtrack to forrest gulp they made it a 2 disc soundtrack, why couldn't they do it with this one. I have it on cd and on vinyl but either way its played the magic is gone. Its got some great songs and Id get it if i didn't have it but its missing the best songs in the movie. If you don't like it on cd your not gonna like it on vinyl either.

Just not what it should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"One of the best soundtracks ever!

There are also a some songs in the album that are shouldn't be there.something i liked about the movie is that they mixed some alternative songs with some rock classics and some heavy metal. that made it a great soundtrack; but in the cd you can only find the alternative ones.the songs i think are missing are for example \\"if you want blood, you've got it\\" by ac/dc, \\"video killed the radio star\\" by the presidents of the usa and \\"romeo and juliet\\" which is one of my all time favorites by mark knopler and in the movie it's pretty well covered by indigo girls. there's also that song that mark puts at the beginning of the movie when he gets the turn to use the jukebox at first, that's a neat song and it's also missing.i enjoy some of the songs like sugarhigh, 'till i hear it from you, a girl like you and some others, but it would be nicer if it had the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"dancing on the rooftop","review":"the song that has the accordian-like intro is called \\"This is the day\\" by The The, it's also sampled on the \\"become an M&M\\" commercial.

The only dissapointment is that there are so many other great songs from the movie which weren't on the soundtrack.

Well all in all this is a fantastic CD and you should definitely buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the essence","review":"This is an awesome soundtrack, but there are so many songs that weren't put on the CD that deserved to be. For example, the song that plays when Corey is fixing Rex's lunch is classic, and what about Rex's song itself?

As far as use of music goes, it's right up there with \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Rushmore.\\" The problem with this CD soundtrack, though, is that it contains some of the least memorable songs from the movie. Instead, they use songs by more well-known artists that were used as background music during dialogue scenes. I was listening to this earlier and I had a very difficult time placing where the songs had been in the movie. It's an abosulute crime that the song \\"Seems\\" by Queen Sarah Saturday (the song that is played when the kids are opening the store) does not appear on this disc, as well as \\"Rock n' Roll EGA,\\" and \\"I Shot the Devil.\\" Instead of buying this, I suggest hunting down the songs individually."},{"rating":"1","title":"This really sucked!","review":"What everyone else is saying about this soundtrack is true.

Half of the one star that I allocate here is for the energetic rocker 'Sugar High' by Coyote Shivers, but I was slightly disappointed to discover that the actress who sings the track in the film (Renee Zellweger) does not feature here. The other half of the star is for Toad and the Wet Sprocket's 'Crazy Life', which would no doubt become an alternative-melancholic anthem if it was given more publicity. As for the other tracks, yes, they do disappoint. So too does the fact that so many of the wonderful songs featured on screen (Dire Strait's Romeo and Juliet + an unknown song by the Cranberries) do not appear on the album. In their place are a shoddy collection of dull alternative 'tunes'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie was Better","review":"I bought this CD because I thought its version of \\"Sugarhigh\\" would be the same as the film, but it turns out to be a disappointing version by Coyote Shivers alone--dirtier, less uplifiting, and far less fun and entertaining.

Now I know what is wrong with this world today. I know its music and free speech, but why would people want to read or listen to this. Really, its about killing and drugs and calling girls bitches. Do people really live there lives this way. What is so cool about killing someone or using drugs or even stealing from people. Really now, there are better things to do with your life. I am not even going to send the book back, I think I will just burn it. I do not think this is creative work. It just blows my mind that all these peole write these reviews and how great it is.

Sorry Dale, but this is the first of all your books I couldn't be bothered finishing......I was continually trying to work out why Patrick was still alive considering all the mistakes he was making. On the street...and I know.....brains and experience will never be replaced by technology, no matter how good it is.

This was my first and last Dale Brown book. I was expecting something better. It took serious effort to stick with this book to the finish. The dialog made Clancy look good. So cheesy.

Find a better way to spend your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Tin Man's Heart Is Barely Beating","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this cartoonish effort that would have been more appropriate on Saturday mornings viewed by youngsters as they scarf down their morning cereal. Brown attempted to combine drugs, bikers, neo-nazis, military, high tech, and police and was never able to present a realistic, suspenseful plot. The story crashed and burned shortly after it began. I tried to get through it and after hours of struggle I laid it to rest after chuckling to myself that this Tin Man should have stayed in the Land of Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty light-weight for Mr Brown","review":"I'm afraid I don't think this book is up to Dale Brown's normal high standard - the action sequences are okay, but the plot is fairly far-fetched, and the premise of a Brigadier-General running round in a super-suit that could have come out of a Harry Harrison novel is just a bit silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating read.","review":"I could not finish this book.

It was a good read, not great. You want this kind of mixture-- thriller with a science edge, try SYNBAT, a book by Bob Mayer about Special Operations troops caught up in a very intriguing chase. Mayer's other special ops books are quite good also. Another author to try is Robert Doherty. He has special ops guys caught up with X-Files type stories with THE ROCK and his AREA 51 series. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of Superheros","review":"It appears that Mr. Brown is tired of writing books on a topic that has been successful for him. Instead, he yearns for a world of superheros, since he has developed a new one to save, if not the world, as least Sacramento.

Now, out of the blue, he \\"writes\\" a book that has nothing to do with aviation, and it is not good. Oh no, not good at all.

If you are old enough to remember those old movie serials with the Hero in the aluminum suit, and the bullet-shaped aluminum helmet, then you will understand what this book is about. And there were enough scenes where someone almost gets killed only to make a miraculous escape to provide fodder for at least an 18 week run in serial form. It is no problem for this guy to be blown up, shot point blank with really largecaliber weapons, or to jump off of a building and land on the rotor blades of a flying helicopter, glance off, and get up fighting ! Even the meth cookers were super high tech.

It starts off as a decent, if formulaic thriller, then quickly deteriorates into a state of complete un-readability. The inane plotting, wooden dialogue and non-existant character development combine to form a shockingly lame final product. This is only book I've read by Dale Brown, and if he indeed does have talent, then this wretched offering must be a source of considerable embarrassment to him.

The interesting premise, the bad guys covet a revolutionary fabric with military and economic advantages, is buried under thick layers of stilted dialogue, improbable plot twists, and one dimensional characters. I have read and enjoyed several of Mr. Brown's other books, but this is a slap dash, third rate effort that is as much an embarassment to the author as it is to his editor.

At some point - I am sure (and this is based on trusting the author) this will turn into a typical Brown action thriller. But so far I am completely bored with the tedious explanations of child birth, Dr. Laura advice for the lovelorn, etc. ad nauseum. It seems like Brown is trying to attract women readers at the expense of his historical and lyal audience. Maybe I'll get past another two pages tonight. Hopefully I can reutrn to give this the ususal Brown glowing review - but not so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I don't find the actions of either side to be those of individuals of the intelligence they are portrayed as having. Furthermore, his blatant disregard for the realities of armor in the protection offered by his BERP are a continuing disruption to the reader whose sees it's impossibility. Even if it works as described, he would have died at least twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wannabe trying very hard in other genre","review":"I found this novel quite repulsive and tasteless. There is no need to detail the process of making drugs unless you're blindly grasping the faith of freedom of speech. Making an announcement in the very beginning advising readers not trying to make the deadly drug, but almost provided the necessary ingredients, piles of raw materials copied from his narcotic retiree wife, adding more stereotyped but on the other hand, highly unlikely plot and scenario derived and misinterpretated from some current news or some whimsical ideas provided by some wannabe writers from the readers through the emails, have become a pathetic mode of Brown's recent books. Even worse, some totally unbelievable hero obviously originated and combined from some comic and sci-fi books--the rocketeer+shadow(or ghost?)+spiderman+whatever you name it. Not quite a good way to bind up a so-called thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The beginning of the story is intriguing, with some character development. However, as the book progresses I have the impression that Dale Brown's publisher called to say he had two days to finish the remainder of the book. The last half is vague, undefined, and sans characters that you can clearly envision or care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to authors usual standards.","review":"This book was very disappointing to me in its lack of depth and vague plot machinations. I am used to a much higher standard being met by this author. If he is not going to do his homework, I would suggest that he stick to B52's and the Air Force. He obviously knows enough about those subjects to be convincing. The \\"authors name\\" sold me this one but I will definitely look closer at his future offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dale Brown is a technoignoramus.","review":"\\"Tin Man\\" is written by a man who has a tin ear for science and technology. Hydrogen explosions in air are chemical reactions. They are energetic but hardly frightening in open spaces. Dale Brown thinks that when hydrogen burns in air it is the same reacion as the fusion of hydrogen to make a nuclear reaction which is the basis of the hydrogen bomb. This is nonsense. This book is silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh? I nearly shat myself...","review":"Oh boy.Thanks Dale, I'm writing my first novel at the moment - a financial thriller.You have given me hope - yes! - I will be published if there is any justice in the world!What's even more surprising is the number of 4/5 star reviews...Sorry Dale - all writers make mistakes, but as another reviewer said pehaps these weren't yours?Back to the charity shop tomorrow I'm afraid...PS Loved your early stuff.PPS thanks for the laughs - priceless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK-read, but not unforgetable","review":"I am a big fan of Dale Brown's action-packed, aviation-focused novels. As such, I decided to venture out of the aviation world for once, carefully following Brown's lead through his \\"Tin Man\\" novel.The action is OK, the theme is interesting. But there are no aircraft in it! Plus, the science side of the explanations Brown gives of the technology behind the supermen-like powers is both weak and hardly credible at all... In fact, the whole book reads more like a \\"common\\" police action book with a soft science-fiction edge than the mix of military aviation, armrest-grabbing novels I am used to reading from Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The difficulty in starting with a top first effort is that following efforts have much to live up to. Unfortunately 'Tin Man' doesn't.Although many of the same characters appear, introduction of new characters gives them a limited dimension in Tin Man. The limited dimension limited the enjoyment and buy in for me. I'd looked forward to this, I less sure about the next.This tin man should have stayed in Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-realistic and shallow","review":"I was disappointed with this book. Did no one else seem to notice that the execution of the drug gangs has NO connection to the terrorists final mission? This book was thrown together, with little attention to content."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read!","review":"I have now read three books by Dale Brown, and have concluded that he is the best fiction author in the world! His great attention to detail in his novels is why I like him so much! Tin Man is the perfect combination of action and suspense. He talks like he knows exactly what he is talking about. With all of the details you can easily paint a picture of the scences in your head. All we need now is one of his novels to be made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Brown, go back to writing about flying and dying.","review":"I've really enjoyed Dale Brown's previous books but this one is not in the same category. He used the same names as those of characters in previous books but they weren't the same people. I was really disappointed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD ALL YEAR","review":"This CD is the best thing that has come out this year. Speech has done it again.

If that's how you review CD, books, etc, then step away from the keyboard.You have no way of knowing if Mos wanted to make a CD like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for libertarians","review":"The Rothbardian brand of libertarianism can be somewhat extreme, but if anyone could explain and sell every page of it well--it would be Murray Rothbard. Anyone interested in really breaking down libertarian philosophy, this is an excellent starting point. I do no recommend this book for people who aren't familiar with the philosophy though, this book can be a bit heavy and somewhat confusing for someone who doesn't have a good foundation of knowledge to work with.Eventually though, and at one point or another--this books is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near miss.","review":"Rothbard argues like a great trial lawyer. I was reminded of Bugliosi's book on the OJ trial more than any of the philosophical books on ethics I have read. I much prefer the clarity of Rothbard's writing to the rambling and gratuitous use of logical argot in Nozick. At the same time, I think Libertarianism needs a better approach to ethics to counteract the work of scholars like Rawls, who,following Kant's Metaphysics Of Morals, argues pursuasively for a more collectivist view. Fortunately or unfortunately, I think Ayn Rand was closer to the the mark with her ethics as expressed in Atlas Shrugged and Capitalism the Unknown Ideal. It is sad that more critical approaches to objectivist ethics have not been attempted by non-devotees. Still, the discussion of property rights as fundamental is priceless, and should be required reading for congressional staffers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of The Best","review":"This is an essential read for anyone who wants to understand liberty at its most fundamental levels. Does NOT get bogged down in abstract concepts and flighty philosophical language. Instead this text delivers clear and logical explanations. I would recommend this at the top of the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Work, From a Brilliant Author","review":"This was the first work of Rothbard's that I found to be highly displeasing. It is a mix of poor philosophy and legal construction. While the author is a brilliant economists, one of the best in the twentieth century, this work on philosophy takes away from his overarching beliefs as put forth in his other writing. Don't read this for an argument on natural rights. He admits that is not his purpose. Don't read this for a picture of a legal system in a free society (see Benson- Enterprise of Law). Instead, go to the best defense of Anarchy, which is Rothbard's \\"For A New Liberty\\". The only reason to read this is if you want to be familiar with a book that is referenced ubiquitously by Austrian sheep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorado Summit Fever","review":"As with most 2nd editions the authors have enhanced their publication. Route descriptions are more concise and easier to follow. Plus, they have added a multitude of new photos which help you navigate your way to the Colorado summit.

I used to attend this festival in my college days and have friends who've worked behind the scenes, so I really wished this book showed some actual guts. Where's the sex and the drugs and the seedy backstage goings-on at the festival? Why is there no mention of the festival's universal stunning decline in quality in recent years? Why is there no accounting for all the animators that allegedly refuse to submit work to, much less even speak to, this festival anymore? That's the book I'm still waiting to read!

The very bottom bead in the picture is a very pretty pink-ish color and that's what I was looking forward to when I ordered these. Well, the earrings I recieved had more green on the bottom bead than pink. I didn't like the fact that there was more green than pink and I didn't think it was worth returning them so I literally got out a bottle of pink nail polish and just painted them the shade that I wanted.

When they say that it's unrated it's true, they show the guys in the movie butt naked, thowing up, and more. Now I will admit there are some very funny parts in this movie but I would NOT suggest that you get this and watch it with kids in the room younger than 17.Pros: It can be very funny at times. There are 4 or 5 parts in the movie that will make you laugh.Cons: There is a lot of cussing, guys butt naked,& doing thing's that should be kept private.All in all if you have t see this movie go out and rent it don't buy first off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Golden Classic !","review":"Anyone seriously interested in the subject matter, and this means you dear reader, because you would not have gotten this far without being serious !, will find this book a gem amoung the literature on LSD.

Now I know not all white folk worship Satan, but most of them do and that's what makes this a bad film. As matter of fact I haven't even finished the movie yet and I already know what's gonna happen... Look! Brother has a bee hive on his head! And what's up with Ebony's foot? It's like a frostbitten Sasquatch foot. This movie would have been given a better rating if wasn't for all them crackers summoning demons and such. Does Amazon sell Sasquatch foots?I was right!

When I heard the song I dreamed we fell apart, I knew I had to have this cd. The only downside to this cd is Amy isnt there with the stars harmony sound. That would have given it a 5, but since it ist a stars cd I cant really complain. Its simplistic and enjoyable and well crafted for most of the songs. I agree with the other reviewer before me but feel its unfair to say that Amy doesnt contribute to the stars songs. She put that cd out as a \\"solo\\" record so I would never expect it to sound like stars.Anyways, if you are a fan of stars then don't pass this by.

He loves it and can walk back and forth and spin around but unfortunately he has gottem bruises from the toy. No pinched fingers or toes yet but there is an indent in the front of the seat under the cloth and my son has gotten a horrible bruise on his chest from leaning forward to reach toys. The bruise is so bad that there is a hard lump underneath it. I freaked out when I saw it and took him to the doctors because I had no idea what caused it until I realized that the indent is in the exact spot as his bruise. It upsets me because he really does love the toy so I have been putting a small pillow there to cushion his chest. I am however concerned about the pinching now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of entertainment","review":"My son was given this when he was 6 months old. He had already mastered his walker and hated the megasaucer. I was worried that with not liking the megasaucer, he wouldn't care for the this also limiting his movement, but he loves it! It has so many types of toys attached to it and different sound options, it's great. The tray that is removeable is actually one of his favorite parts. He takes it out every time and loves hitting it against the other parts, or just holds it in his hand as he moves around. Funny how the slimpliest things are the best fun for babies.It does take up a fair amount of space, so be prepared if you're limited in that area. Another reviewer said it didn't have height adjustment, it actually does have two settings. There's a clip under the material seat that will help raise the entire seat up one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy","review":"This has been the best purchase we've made since our son was born 7 months ago. I've read others comments about it not being very appealing and even a little dangerous. Well luckily, I don't have ANY complaints. This toy has been nothing but helpful. I can hang up clothing when we come home, I can actually use the bathroom and do other things I had difficulty doing before he became \\"walker\\" aged and before we bought the Step and Play."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE WATCH OUT!!!","review":"My daughter got her arm, wrist and palm of her hand pinched in the track when she moved the seat sideways. At first, I thought it was a fluke and continued to put her in the toy. Then it happened 2 more times...once I had to pull her hand out...the skin was pinched between the seat and track. I called Fisher Price and they were very apologetic and will be sending UPS out to pick up the toy and reimburse me the retail cost. I really did LOVE this toy and so did my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Red thing can hit baby in head.","review":"My baby loved the mirror and the attachments, one day I watch her play and she had a hand on the red thing and turned and then finally let go and it smacked her in the head hard.

If it had soft toys I would love it and I know that my baby would love it more since she loves to chew on the toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disinterested","review":"I purchased this item when my daughter was 3 months old. At first she would sit there and reach out for the toys, it seemed like she enjoyed the music she was creating as well as the challenge that the toys created. Now that she is seven months old, she can walk in it, turn her seat around and all the toys are at her reach. But she is more interested in her 20 dollar walker then she is this toy, which with taxes ran me close to 100 dollars. Bottom line is that it is just not worth the money, and the toys are really not interesting for a baby over 6 months. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy a cheaper stationary entertainer and your wallet wont hurt so bad when baby prefers another toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lasting toy","review":"We purchased this for our daughter when she was four months old. At that time she loved being in the seat and playing the music. She loved to babble to the mirror amd grab the microphone. She is now 11 months old and still loves to play with it. We have taken the seat out now so she can walk thru it. It is still one of her favorite toys. I would highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"We bought this toy when our daughter was 4 months old. I was hoping she would be able to use it right away however, she is very small statured and now at 6 months still cannot play the foot part of the toy. Also when we first put her in the seat for it she couldn't even reach the instruments. Now that she can reach the instruments she absolutely loves the toy and would play in it forever if we let her. I recommend highly however don't be fooled by all the other reviews that say babies as young as 3 months can enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent!","review":"My mom bought our daughter this for Christmas. She was only three months old at the time and could not reach the bottom, but enjoyed it even still. She is now six months old and LOVES this toy! She smiles every time she sees it. It gives Mom and Dad a break for a while! It is so neat to see her discover a new part of this toy. Whether it be the flashing key board buttons, the mirror or the rolling balls on the side. I would say this has paid for itself 10 times over! The music is not too loud and annoying either. It seems to be so much more entertaining than the other entertainment centers on the market. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"make sure your baby likes it 1st","review":"make sure your baby likes it 1st and make sure you have the space(dose not fold up at all)!

There are so many interesting activities to keep him busy and to help him learn. My only suggestion to Fisher Price would be to add some teethers to this toy. My son does like to chew on the plastic tray, but it would be nice if there were some teething toys attached. I have never had a problem with my son hurting himself with this toy. I wish that I had bought this for him sooner, as I think he would have enjoyed it as soon as he was able to hold himself upright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy, all ages!","review":"I got this for my 8 month old who didn't use the seat very long, however still plays with it (she's now 23 mo's).

Very much worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it.","review":"The only bad part is you have to be careful when taking baby out of the piano seat.

She used one at a friend's house and cried when I took her out but got all happy again when I put her back in. It entertains her for long periods of time. My baby is 25 inches tall and we didn't have a problem with her being able to reach the keys. The only helpful hint that I would recommend is that your baby have shoes on or be barefoot so their feet don't slip on the keys. When she has her shoes on, she can move back and forth along the keys quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do I play with first?!","review":"I purchased this item after reading several reviews of this toy in this web site. My daughter is 4 1/2 months old. The look on her face was priceless when we put her in the seat. She didn't know which toy to start with first because she was so excited. The only disappointment I have so far is the trumpet has to be shaken quite hard to get the mechanism inside to make it's noise. Otherwise, each day is a delight to watch her discover new things. I wasn't so sure about spending big money on a toy, but now I am glad we did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great","review":"I really liked this toy and i knew my daughter would she did and then when she was moving she smashed her fingers thats the only reason i dont like it we took the seat out when she started to crawl and she loves it its a great toy!she sits in it while i cook shes only 5 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR for SAFETY!!","review":"BEWARE!!! If your child is teething and likes to put things in his/her mouth you must be very cautious. This device has flimsy, hard instruments on each end of the keyboard. My daughter tried to put one in her mouth, let go, and it flew back and smacked her in the eye! She received a black eye from the red toy which has a little wheel in it, and that broke the skin as well.We loved the entertainment it provided for her. However, I don't think it is worth taking the risk of your child losing an eye.

My younger sister put it together in about 20 minutes (she's 17 and doesn't read directions well), ignoring the pages that stated permanent assembly. We have a small apartment, but have found a corner that this fits well in. My son, 4 months, loves to push the pedals with his feet, which he stretches to reach (he's a short baby). He loves the lights and music. He hasn't yet learned how to move the seat, but we move him from one side to the other and he enjoys everything. There is a volume control which is also a plus. I am glad to know this is a toy he will grow with. You may even find yourself humming or singing along to the music and enjoying this toy as much as a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! This thing can pinch!!!","review":"My little girl absolutely loved hers, but we ended up taking it back for a refund. If you have one, try this out: The yellow plastic part of the seat can pinch their fingers/hands quite easily. All they have to do is put their finger slightly underneath the edge of it and then walk in that direction. My daughter got pinched so badly. I tried it out myself to see if this was maybe a one time occurance but found it easy to do. I took it back and the store said that they had similar complaints. Sooooo.... too bad. Because she loved playing in it!! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I was a bit hesitant to spend this much money on an activity center, but after much research I went ahead and bought it, and am so glad I did. My son has played in other activity centers and gets bored after a few minutes. This one he actually gets upset when I take him out. I bought this when my son was 5 months, it is now 2 months later and he still gets excited every time I put him in it. He is very tall, but the seat is adjustable, so it should be a while before he is too big. Another feature I really liked is that the seat can be removed when he is older. Also, I found this easy to assemble.Update: My son is now almost 6 and I have a 2 year old. They both still love this toy, so I guess it was worth the money. They don't make it any more, but if you are looking at a used one I would say go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TONS OF FUN!!!","review":"I haven't to this day find one draw back from the step and play piano. The only thing that I could ever say about it is my son cries when I take him out of it sometimes. He would play in it for hours if I'd let him and he's in it a few times a day and never gets tired of it.I got the step and play for him when he was around 2 months and he's now a little over 5 and still loves it. It's got 3 settings and when he out grows that the seat comes out and he can still use it. I know it's more expensive but it's worth the money.When I first got it I was worried he'd pinch his fingers in the sliding seat but it's never happened and he's a very active baby.I would recomend this for anyone especially if you have an active baby. And in a home office it's great you can still talk to your baby and get your work done."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most needed and used baby items we have!","review":"My daughter, who is 6 months old, LOVES this toy!

My husband put some duct-tape over the rough edge and we have had no more problems since. I would still recommed this toy to anyone. I would definately put this item on my top ten most-needed baby items!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it - Be very careful!","review":"At first my husband and I put this piano together and thought it was the greatest toy.

But the first time I took her out of it she started screaming in pain, because the buckle underneath the seat scratched her leg.

About two weeks later she was in it walking back and forth. When she started screaming again, her thumb got stuck in a tiny space where the seat slids from side to side. Immediately her whole thumb and lower palm was bright red and swollen. She didn't stop screeming and crying for about 30 minutes.

My daughter (9months) has LOVED it since she was 4 months old, however twice in one week she pinced her hand. At first we thought it was a freak accident, but the second time I was standing right there--that is how quickly and easily it happens. (As the baby gets older they are able to propel the seat more quickly, thus running over hands that are on the keyboard) The toy is great but the injuries (bruised hands) was enough to send it back. Hopefully Fisher-Price will redesign the product to prevent injuries...in the meantime mommies and daddies beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPROVED?","review":"I recently wrote regarding the sharp edges on the seat that can potentially scrap the baby's legs when removing them from the Step and Play.

He enjoyed it immensely and it gave us a place to put him where he could amuse himself without our having to worry about him. At first he mostly enjoyed the mirror side; then as he grew he began developing interest in the keyboard side. Eventually he learned to \\"walk\\" back and forth along the keys. Now (13 months) that he's outgrown the seat and is mobile enough to resent the confinement, he still wanders over to it several times a day just to play. Assembly was easy. Battery life is good.Two minor things keep me from giving it 5 stars: first, the keyboard floor is very difficult to clean. Second: one of the tunes it plays (London Bridge) has a wrong note programmed in. As musicians, it drives me and my husband crazy, but most people probably wouldn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy but be careful","review":"This toy is wonderful. I got it as a shower gift and put my daughter in it at 3 months. She loved it then and at 6 months old she still loves it and it keeps her attention for a long time. Be careful, however, when removing babies from the piano. There are sharp edges on the seat and I didn't know this until I pulled my daughter out and she started crying. Her foot was scraped and bleeding. Hopefully this will be corrected in the future, but until then, take caution when removing your child from the seat.

Also, her feet are reaching the bottom of the toy so comforatbly, she wont move from side to side as they show in the picture on the box. Coming to the educational value, there is nothing much to earn from this toy(this I learned after buying this toy). sometimes, she is stuck inside the seat and is crying when I am taking her out of it.

My baby is ready for the toy now. She outgrows things so fast, it doesn't make sense for me to wait a month because Fisher Price made a mistake.

It was even better than I anticipated! Our 5 1/2 month old son, Noah, loves it. His attention span is not usually very long with toys. He plays longer with his Step and Play Piano. He stomps the keys and plays with all of the toys. Even though this toy appears a little expensive it is well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step N Play Piano \\"worth it\\"","review":"It took me approximately 2-3 weeks to find this product. Either the stores had never heard of it or they insisted that I got the name wrong. I only found it at BabiesRUs under the walker section (Not Toys!). After lots of frustration I found it in the store (without the hassle of paying shipping & handling). It is very expensive. But fisher price does have a $10 rebate. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas (but early). She loves it. She's 4 months old and she loves playing with the mirror, and knick knacks above. I love that she can play with it until she is 3 years old. It was worth the hassle.

She loved it, she was tired of sitting in her bouncy chair. The only complaints I have is that it is hard to get her in and out of and also for more detachable toys. She loves the removable tray but gets frustrated because she cant remove other things, like the horn or maybe a little compartment to put things in so she can add her own toys. She has grown into it and can reach everything now (she couldnt at first and would get mad). She loves to pound her feet on the keys. Its a great place for her to hang out while I do things around the house and she can watch me. She loves it! A bit expensive but considering how much she is in it its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby item investment we've made!","review":"Our six month old daughter has been using the Step and Play Piano since she was 3 months old.

We use it everyday. She entertains herself for 20-30 minutes at a time easy.

Entries are presented in alphabetical order and give an explanation of each person, place, and thing in THE X-FILES world. There is a cool photo of Mulder and Scully (I've never seen before) on the cover (and on the binding) surrounded by the eerie X-FILES' green glow. I figure there must be over 2,000 encyclopedic entries in this reference book. If you're an X-Phile, you have to GOT to get this book.

The combination of Harris, Groth, Montelius, Komor and Arkana proves to be a match made in ebm/synthpop heaven. At this point, \\"Forever\\" is a club anthem that never seizes to amaze fans. One of the most beautifully written lyrics in the genre combined with one of the most passionate vocalists of the genre.

Frankly its partly my fault as I could kind of tell by looking at them through the plastic package at the store that they were not of high quality...but the other four brands were sold out...(now I know why!).

Also, they don't include a Lob Wedge cover..so it is uncovered in the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Iron Head Covers","review":"They cover the club and lock to the shaft so they protect the face and are tough to lose.

So I ring Handspring and get a replacement. This didn't even give me the chance to start playing with it - it was doa. I'm now awaiting my third one.Luckily I had a back-up module, and use it regularly as I may not be near a hotsynch station as often as my paranoia now requires. And where am I using this data?

The first 3 I purchased directly from Handspring. #1's backlight didn't work, #2's screen was not installed straight, #3 had a screw hanging out and would not slide into the charger. The next three I purchased locally at CompUSA. #4 would bring up the memo screen anytime a slight pressure was applied near the switch (as if the memo button was pressed), #5 had a sprung flip cover, and although the box was sealed, it had someone's data loaded onto it!, and finally #6's backlight didn't work.

That's why I carry an ultra-slim wallet in my right pocket and a Visor Edge in the left.For me, the choice between Palm and Handspring is black and white. Handspring is the clear choice with its USB interface, Palm OS and wide range of accessories.The Visor Edge is awesome. You've really got to handle one to realize just how thin it is. The only down side is that, when using a module, you double its size. Then again, how often do you use a module? If the answer is never, who cares?The Edge has a nice, high-contrast screen, rechargeable battery, and strong flip-cover (which adds no depth). The Edge has a classy touch and feel with its silver finish.

I tried a soft reset, then a hard reset. All my data was erased by the hard reset. The screen recalibration procedure started. I began touching the screen only to find the target continuously bouncing back and forth between two positions.

Plus, after nearly 8 years, the metal cover is still perfectly intact, except for one small scartch about 1/4 an inch long.

After 4 days, touch screen stopped working (actually, it brought up the properties/menu bars across the top of the screen no matter where I touched the screen with the stylus). Had to return it. From reading message boards on the Visor, I am not the first to have these problems.I think this problem is somehow caused by a short circuit/loose connection related to the Edge connector (new port on back that attaches to a Springboard attachment which attaches to a Springboard module). The problems with my touch screen occurred right after I took off the cover (for about the 10th time) and then replaced it.Handspring needs to make a more reliable product.

Personally I was hoping for a more personal account of what it was like working with Selleck, Hillerman, Mosely, & Bellasario, but those guys are rarely mentioned.

His sarcastic and occasionally abrasive humor shine though in the wild tales he tells, which make the tales even more \\"Manetti-esque,\\" and that much more endearing. Anyone who is critical of Manetti for being arrogant or an egoist in this book or otherwise...forget about not having a pulse, you probably have no soul. Larry Manetti shares a few personal facts about his life that will make your heart go out him.

Don't let the impressive cast (Gary Busey, Howie Mandell, Margot Kidder) lead you astray! This is a low-budget, lame script, cliche-ridden rehash of the old evil-UN, rapture, one-world-government stuff from Channel 23.The minimal efforts to portray the future are only topped for awfulness by a hideously syrupy soundtrack.Nick Mancuso makes a great anti-Christ but I can't think of another good acting job or indeed any good thing about this turkey. \\"Left Behind\\" is a WAY better movie bet on the same subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for a good movie...","review":"Oh, my, God!!! I can't tell you how long it's been since I've seen a movie as bad as this one. I feel sorry for the reviewer who paid $6 to rent it.It doesn't take too much to entertain me; a good storyline and decent acting will do. Well, I made myself (and my poor husband) suffer through it just because I like to finish what I start, but it was a waste of time and money.Don't get me wrong. I am a Christian AND love the whole Revelation-Apocaliptic genre, and even with that in favor of the movie I feel it was terrible all around. Bad Cast, bad acting, cheap production.Listen to me: Pick up a book instead. It's a little more work but you will be much more satisfied. (The Christ Clone Trilogy is excellent!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's think about this...","review":"I haven't actually seen this film yet. I caught the trailer for it on the Left Behind film (which was also a terrific effort from Cloud Ten) and was intrigued, but especially by what I consider to be the most important actor in the film - Gary Busey. Anyone who has heard Gary's testimony would appreciate seeing him in a Christian film. Anyone who has not should watch TBN or poke around on the Net to see if you can find it. It truly is a great example of God's ability to save the lost. I'm going to buy this movie, and I'll follow up with a review after I actually watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept -- terrible","review":"Simply one of the worst films ever produced since Man first shouldered a camera.A fascinating topic rendered ridiculous by a dreadful script, dreadful directing and perfectly awful performances from a shopworn collection of actors.Instead of intriguing me -- the non-evangelical person with a reasonably open mind -- \\"Tribulation\\" made me wonder if its really humanly possible that conservative Christians believe this simplistic hokum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribulation by name, travesty by nature.","review":"From start to finnish this direct-to-video film is truly awful with terrible direction, amatuer filmaking sensibility , weak scripting and lousy acting by billed stars Gary Busey,Howie Mandel & Margot Kidder not to mention rest of co involved. Busey's character Tom Canoboro is a chapter of accidents as a deadly earnest cop clumsily endeavouring to foil Satan(Nick Mancuso, whose debauched glee is ironically the only bright spark)in his attempted global dominance. Ensemble cast quote unconvincingly from the Good Book, but not even the Second Coming would resurrect such disordered rubbish. Finally before Christians get mad at this review I enjoy some programs such as TVs \\"Touched By an Angel' irregardless of my own personal beliefs and wished for my six dollars back after renting this overly preachy poor excuse for a movie from my Video Store, buyers beware strongly suggest rental viewing first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The point is...","review":"...the \\"prophecy\\" referring to the People Of Babel (Gen. 11:6) will in actuality have no part whatsoever in the actual Tribulation. And the fact that this whole movie was based around it being an actual prophecy that was eventually to come to pass really was a disappointment to me.The film gets 2 stars because, I'll admit, although the script was badly written, the acting was good, and the first half hour was quite intriguing until I found out what the whole plot of the movie revolved around.The real reason I think some people don't like it (as do I) is that these Christians are proposing that this prophecy will be true which will mislead any Non-Christian viewers of the movie into believing that it will happen. And because of that, I feel that this movie (as entertaining as it may be) should not be taken as a literal or accurate depiction of what the Tribulation will bring to the earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this movie, because.....","review":"I like this movie, because, even tho it's a little cheesey, and not scary at all, I just felt kinda endeared to Gary and Margot & Howie- I think they did a great job of stirring my emotions. I think Margot Kidder is quite a trooper; she's been thru a lot since her Superman the Movie days, and every bit of it shows on her face. I really think she's a good person, and I would like to meet her someday if I ever get the opportunity.(yea, right, like that'll happen!) The one thing that cracks me up about this flick, tho, is even after waking up after at least a year long coma, Gary's character has got very long shaggy hair, and matching beard, but he didn't lose one ounce of that excessive belly fat! Hilarious! I still love this movie, tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really hokey stuff in this film","review":"I thought the cast did a respectable job with what they had to work with. The real star of the film was Nick Mancuso as Franco Macalousso. Mancuso made a believable antichrist.However, this film had one very hokey part which brought the quality of the film down a lot. So the \\"image of the beast\\" is a virtual reality helmet. What in the blue hell were the script writers smoking when they dreamt that up, even when they dreamt it up in the movie's prequel, \\"Revelations\\"? How does a VR helmet burn a 666 on somebody's hand? How does a VR helmet cause a snakebite to appear on somebody in the real world? The whole VR helmet thing was really ill-conceived...okay, the VR helmet thing was STUPID."},{"rating":"1","title":"RBM (Really Bad Movie)","review":"Poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted.I was hoping for something more, and this movie did not have it.

Also here is \\"That's The Way Love Goes\\" from \\"Janet\\", and two new songs.

People who've bought all her other albums already have these songs. The only new songs were \\" Runaway \\" and \\" Twenty Fourplay \\". Everything else could have been bought years earlier. This collection picked some of Janet's biggest hits, but left out some of her best songs. It would have been better if others had gotten together to pay tribute to Jackson's ten-year career at the time instead of her releasing such a disappointment. But this effort proved better than the new albums Janet has made since.Design of a Decade could have at least offered some remakes to her hits instead of recycling old songs for a new profit.

For die-hard Janet fan like myself,this Album felt rushed and not a lot of effort put into it. I would recommend this Cd to those who know little about her legacy and want a nice sample of what they may have missed from that early decade. I believe all Janet's hits cannot be contained on one CD...when she finally retires from music, you will need a box set to fully appreciate what a true Icon she has become. I especially was disappointed that many of the tracks were edited versions of the original, though this is a small mis-step for newer fans, this is a major one for long-time fans who appreciate a masterpiece when they hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fans of the old Janet","review":"I loved Janet Jackson back in the eighties and early nineties, but not so much since then. As a result I was pleased to find a heavy emphasis on her earlier work. The newer stuff is okay, and the two new songs on this album are pretty mediocre, but it is definitely worth it for the stuff off of \\"Control\\" and \\"Rhythm Nation\\". On that front it is very complete and the songs are whole, not cropped as many songs on greatest hits compilations tend to be. Definitely a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits from start to finish","review":"This collection contains some of Janet Jacksons best songs and there is not one bad song on the entire album. Janet Jackson has always put together some of the best pop songs in music history. Included are Escapade, Miss U Much, Love Will Never Do,Black Cat, When I Think of You, and Nasty Boys, and a ton more. You are sure to find a few songs that will get you dancing.

Janet was recently crowned an \\"MTV Icon\\" and I couldn't agree more. She's got the looks, the voice, the music and of course those videos (Pick up the \\"Design of A Decade\\" DVD if you can). Having two failed albums prior to \\"Control\\", she decided to work with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (of Prince fame) who gave her that signature sound we all know and love. They were however diverse enough that each song never sounded like it was a carbon copy of the other. Janet crossed over into a variety of genres... Funk in \\"What Have You Done For Me Lately\\", R&B with \\"That's The Way Love Goes\\" and Pop with \\"Miss You Much.\\" While she has been pop leaning recently, I long for the days when she experimented on songs such as the rock-infused \\"Black Cat.\\" Janet Jackson is most definately an MTV and music icon and \\"Design of A Decade\\" is the perfect musical package for fans of Janet and her music. Highly reccomended. Overall grade: A"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet Is Almost As Talented As Her Brother","review":"What a great collection by a truly great musical talent. In fact, I can't decide whose act I prefer--- Janet exposing her breast in public or her brother grabbing his penis in public. This is the nadir to which popular \\"music\\" has degenerated.

Why is this? So the US public will have to spend even more money?I think this is a decent compilation for the casual Janet listener because it covers the major bases during the pinnacle of her and Jam & Lewis' most creative phase. \\"Runaway\\" is an excellent new track as is \\"20 Fourplay\\". I am also pleased at the inclusion of the much-needed remix of \\"Alright\\" although this is not the mix with Heavy D, unfortunately.Still it gets only 2 stars, due to the marketing gimmicks, for not including enough 7\\" radio versions as opposed to album cuts, and for excluding \\"If\\" and \\"Anytime Anyplace\\" when there was still plenty of disc space left."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time","review":"The book combines questionable statements (Al Kharizmi is a black mathematician),wrong statements (\\"mathematics is prevalent in almost all careers and professions\\"), and mostly trivial statements (\\"teachers must ...extinguish all negative verbal communications and interactions with the students\\").

If they can shorten 'biscotti' to 'bickie' and 'utility vehicle' to 'ute,' why couldn't the editor have sliced the first 1/3 of the book and got to the point?And what's with Cashin the cop not even seeing a reason to go upstairs to the victim's house to take a look around? You know, the house in which the victim was attacked? He only went up there so the stepdaughter could retrieve some items?Addition: I read the other reviews after I posted mine. I'm perfectly good with beautiful writing in a crime novel, in which the crime takes a back seat. I simply don't care for this author's writing.

The setting is actually coastal Victoria, the smallish state in the south-east corner of mainland Australia, whose capital is Melbourne. South Australia is a larger state immediately west. The specific townships and landmarks are invented, although an accurate sense of the coastal area between Melbourne and Warrnambool is evoked. (Oh, and it's a real good read.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three hundred some pages of nothing happening.","review":"Three hundred some pages of nothing happening. It's not too hard to discover the nastiness behind the motive, but to guess the murderer you might as well throw at a dartboard blindfolded.I suppose some will find the coarse Aussie dialog funny. And the finale is dramatic, but it takes so long to get there, it hardly seems worth it.Next time I'm going to make sure a book has at least 100 reviews before buying it. Less than that is probably because nobody is finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting view of Australia, but ...","review":"I've had one extensive vacation in various parts of eastern Australia, and found it interesting to read about the rural parts of the same general area.

Sort of. Set in Australia, the story is about Joe Cashin, a cop who is on disability leave, recovering from an injury. He returns to the town he grew up in and becomes involved in helping to solve a local crime. Cashin is an interesting character, and that makes for interesting reading. The past and present are both \\"present\\" in this story, and that, too, makes for interesting reading. The overall tone of the book is dark, not only because of the outcome, but because of the racism that permeates society (especially the police force) and the damage done to the environment. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dialog, Great Setting, Okay Plot","review":"The things I liked: Excellent character development. Great dialog -- Temple is an Aussie Elmore Leonard in that respect. Pretty good sense of Australia, Melbourne area. Some reviewers here thought the book accurately portrayed the bigotry and social tension in Oz, but that's not what the book was about. It's simply a good police procedural. You won't feel you wasted your time. I enjoyed \\"Broken Shore\\" and feel that those who compare Temple with Michael Connelly are not off base. This was my first Temple book, but won't be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. The book is not worth buying!!","review":"First of all the book is misrepresentated in its title and length of pages. The brief information on the book lists that it is 52 pages when actually it is only 45 pages, including the five blank pages in the back of the book for taking notes. The title is even more misleading in that it gives the potential buyer the impression that they will learn everything they need to know to begin loan signings. This is far from the truth. The information in this book was no more helpful for beginning signers than what could be found for free on various mortgage websites. Needless to say, this book is in NO WAY a \\"Field Manual\\" and is EXTREMELY overpriced for its content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a book, its a pamphlet!","review":"Very disappointed! I paid nearly $30 for a self-published booklet with less information than what is available over the Internet or looking at my own mortgage papers. Forty-one pages of large type, in mostly outline format, that could have easily fit on half that many pages. The only illustrations are of tax forms that are available at almost any library or govt office. I bet you can probably download them from the IRS website as well.

Last week I took it with me on a trip to Atlanta. At some point, even though the watch was kept in my pants pocket, one part of the clasp just diappeared. I assume that, as I took the watch out to look at it, the now missing part of the band must have fallen off. Once again, I couldn't be more diappointed in the watch.

As the countdown to detonation to proceeds, a small civilian plane, piloted by a couple of strong-minded women, searches the darkness for clues to a mystery that will surprise and probably scare you to death. Reading The Atomic Express is like watching an action movie, but the subtext is totally surreal.

It looked silver on her (she was a pale lady) and it looked more of a gold/bronze on me (I'm olive-skinned). I loved the color on me anyway and decided to order it. The only cons are that it chips pretty soon if I don't use a clear topcoat (all my Orly's do that), and Amazon.com can't ship it overseas where I live so I had to ship it to my mom who held onto it after I decided I was going to visit, and I found it cheaper at Sally's."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite polish.","review":"this is a wonderful nail polish-- it can be painted in one thick coat for a hurried day, or layered in several thin ones for a lasting application. very wonderful viscosity; it seems to completely coat the nail without any effort. even my clumsy self can have well-polished nails.the color is one of my all time favorites-- a pale, solid gray that looks great with pale winter skin or with a summer tan. it seems to match everything, and adds a touch of flair.definitely worth a try if you're looking for a color a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite neutral nail polishes I have ever came across.","review":"I originally bought this color in the orly cool romance collection which had this and 5 other amazing colors, however; this is by far the best.

Yes, the manicure doesn't last as long as it would with OPI or Essie. Yes, the brush is too small and causes the polish to go on streaky. Yes, these are not good attributes, but WOW is the color amazing. Not a single photo on Amazon can relay what a pretty soft pink this is, and the fact that it is NOT sheer makes me love it despite all these negatives.This is a pale, seashell pink. Two or even three coats are required for streak-free coverage, but the extra time is worth the wait. Use a good thick topcoat like Seche Vite and this will be a beautiful manicure or pedicure.It does have a tendency to chip or peel but that is after about 4-5 days with the right topcoat. Without a topcoat you can be sure that your nails will be scuffed and missing paint.If you want a beautiful SOLID pale pink, I would definitely recommend this color."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, but...","review":"The shipping was fast.The packaging is really smooth and pretty.I really like the foggy (matte) effect when I first put it on, but it wears out pretty quickly and started chipping off little by little.The matte effect becomes unclear and shiny rather fast.I like this product in general, and it's not really expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neon Orange","review":"LOVE this color.

It arrived quickly. As soon as I received it I tried it out. Applied it on a Friday and it began chipping a few hours later. I am not rough with my nails...the only reason I can think of for the quick chipping would have to be that since you can't apply a top coat (it will defeat the whole purpose of buying a matte finish/leather polish) then it has no protective layer.

Bharati Mukherjee contributes an Indian immigrant's view on consumerism, which hints at the lack of concern or comprehension about hyper-consumerism held by the population of one of the world's largest developing countries.

For reasons that escape me, the talented and creative Dallas duo traded in their sparkling mix of acoustic and electric guitar for a more dry and contained mix. The result was supposed to be that they combined forces with a band and were now legitimate entity in the music business, ready for all that could come their way. But in the end this recording feels like Jackobox (Jackopierce in the box). Like other reviewers, it pains me to say these words, but do yourself a favor and check out Bringing On The Weather.

I blame the record company for this one. They were obviously pressured to play a style that would be easier to market, but it failed. All in all, there are a few really good songs on this album. The hidden track of Trials is the best song. Is It The Sun is not very JP like but still is a good song. Hmmmm....you know I have every JP album and those are the only 2 off of this one I can say I actually ever listen to. Hmmm....I guess this album really does stink.

It doesn't inspire the least bit of enthusiasm in the listener. Jackopierce's other albums are among my favorites, especially Live from the Americas and Bringing on the Weather. However, JP must have decided to plug in the electric guitars in a last-ditch effort for popularity. The result is a sound more like Seattle than Texas. It speaks volumes about the album that a \\"hidden\\" track, an acoustic version of \\"Trials\\" (performed w/electric earlier on the album) is the best song on the album--and its \\"hidden\\".

Although Aristotle expresses the highest standards a play should have it can be used as a guide or premise in which to follow in thier own writings. Declaring that Sophacles' Oedipus the King as the perfect play, which would be a good companion to this piece, Aristotle demonstrates how every play should have these attributes, namely a 24 hour time limit to disclose the plot and mysteries of a story. Among other things, which would be too lengthy to go into any review, Poetics stands as a classic guide and should be continued to be practiced and be in any writers library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this translation!","review":"I feel that this is a horrible translation of an otherwise great work of literature. This translator felt the need to re-arrange pieces of Aristotle's work, and completely relocate some to an \\"Appendix.\\" If you find this appalling, then you need to find another translation. However, if you are fine with the butchering of another person's work, by all means, order this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and confusingly organized.","review":"This book was dry, and the way it was organized often left me confused. I picked it out to do some background reading on Turkey before traveling there ... It was not good for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOVE OVER YaYa's","review":"This was my first Crusie book and it definitely won't be my last. I plan to take my next one with me on a cross country air trip. I know that if the flight is bumpy, I probably won't even notice. Crusie has a great style, fun characters with eccentricities real enough that I squirmed occasionally, and a plot quirky enough to make anyone forget they are flying at 30,000 feet in little more than a giant tin can. Consider me a new fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT SUMMER READ!","review":"I have not read any of Jennifer Crusie's previous books. I really liked this one! It was funny and the love scenes were entertaining. I admired Nell's ability to be free to do what she wanted and to go after what she needed. The mystery seemed like it was added on, but it didn't detract from the story. I found this book to be a fun summer read. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written thriller!","review":"I hadn't read a Jennifer Cruise novel until now. I have been told that her writing is unique and she has great attention to detail. Having read Fast Women, her new novel, I have to agree with those who recommended her books.Nell takes a new job as office manager at a rather old-fashioned firm. Gale, her boss, doesn't take the fact that Nell wants to redo his office surroudings lightly. However, things change in a drastic way when Nell and Gale begin a steamy affair -- an affair that takes some twisted turns when murders and mysteries begin to arise.Well written and entertaining, Fast Women is a reading investment. I am pleased with her work, and so I will try her earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast women","review":"Well here we are once again , disapointed. so far none have compared to her' Tell me lies'....Im sorry, but I just feel she's trying way to hard.and it just doesn't work.

I adored the characters, Nell was wonderful and she grew along with the book. The women intrigued me, and the men of the agency thrilled me. I laughed till I cried at some of their antics.Run, don't walk to pick up this \\"fast\\" read. Enjoy it for it's purely escapism story!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time I'll never get back.","review":"I'm not so enamored with this book as many other reviewers are. I reached the middle of the book before I realized I didn't care for any of these characters. I found the rest of the book a chore to get through. The way these family members slept around and who was related to who made my head spin. I don't know how this detective agency even made a profit-or even O & D Law firm. The book's title absolutely makes no sense. The pacing was mind-numbingly slow. Margie seemed like a shell instead of a real character. There was only one scene I thought was funny, the rest I kept rolling my eyes. The only character I found mildly entertaining was Riley. Plus, being an animal lover, I had a real problem with Nell stealing and keeping someone's pet. Twice she had the opportunity to return the dog, but failed to do the right thing. And the murder plots? I found them to be profound jokes as well as the author's obsession with china. Skip this one if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I haven't read all of Jennifer Crusie's books but did enjoy \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" very much. \\"Fast Women\\" was Ok. The book had momentum...I just expected more than I got. Uninteresting characters and simplistic plotting. If this was the first book of Crusie's I'd read, I probably wouldn't read another. Especially at hardback prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invest in Depends before reading!","review":"This has to be one of the funniest books I've ever read, hence the Depends warning. I related to the reviewer who was reading it on a beach.. I was on a plane, and I started chuckling, then I progressed to howling, with tears streaming down my face. People around me were looking at me oddly. I love all of Jennifer Crusies books, but this one is hysterical, with GREAT characters. Not to mention the dog. The scene with Nell dog-napping the dachsund was the one that did me in. My only problem with the book was it's threat to my bladder control. Too funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even done reading it...","review":"and I love it, I just have to recommend it! The characters are wonderful, the story line has humor, a little romance, and it's in all the right places.

Oh Lord! This was the wrong one. The characters were awful. I read it to get through, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The fact that the hero discussed wanting to seriously BEAT the heroine is not a sign of true love to me. I could go on, but it's all terrible, so why bother? I'm going to read \\"Faking It\\" to give this author another try, but if it is as bad as this one, I'll never waste another minute with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn . . .","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" and after reading some of these reviews, I'll try some others (\\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" and \\"Bet Me,\\" and \\"Faking It\\").BUT this book was pointless, no mystery that I cared about, frustrating to read of Nell's harping and temper tantrums, and just meandered waiting to be put to sleep or something. I ended up skimming the last third of it. Yawn ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun summer read","review":"I called it a summer read, but it's just a nice book to dive into, period. I saw another reviewer post it as a beach book. I just devoured it while my husband played video games. It was a fun, character-driven story. I liked the story line, and the smoldering romance was there but not in graphic detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big fan","review":"I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie but this book just didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad per-se but it wasn't very good either. I did finish it however I was tempted to quit several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Dog Lovers!","review":"Fast Women is hilarious. Jennifer Cruise has a remarkable style.I love dogs. When she describes Marlene's (the dog) wardrobe and attitudes, I just have to laugh.I also like the fact that the main characters are not 18. Ms Cruise writes about mature women with serious problems (somewhat exaggerated).The mystery was a little shallow. The hero did not sweep me off of my feet, but the rest of the group makes up for him.I found this story very entertaining. I became attached to most of the characters presented here. I have enjoyed all of Jennifer Cruise's work and this story is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly book","review":"I've never read Jennifer Crusie before, and I probably won't buy another one of her books, after reading this one. It is a silly book, with shallow characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time reading this book.","review":"This book was LOUSY. It lacked character, was stupid, far-fetched and had no point! I'm sorry I wasted my hard-earned money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Crusie Book","review":"I've enjoyed every Jennifer Crusie book I've ever read, and this one is no exception. The characters act like real people, and the story just zips along. Unlike some romance books, there's not a lot of time wasted on the characters getting mixed signals and going around and around trying to untangle all sorts of misunderstandings. In this book, they make mistakes and then they un-make them, without a lot of ... beating and blaming. The female characters are generally strong and know what they're doing, and even though sometimes they need a little bailing out, that doesn't make them weak--it just makes them human. The male characters are also interesting; they hold their own in this \\"woman's book\\". I can't wait for the next Crusie book. She's the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a cup of coffee...","review":"and sit down for this easy on the eyes, easy on the brain book. Crusie keeps the flow going and makes these guys grow on you! While it will not stimulate a rocket scientist.. it will definitely keep your attention and give you a smile. Nothing better for a rainy curl up in yer chair having a laid back day kinda read like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The earth didn't move...","review":"nor did it even shudder a bit when I read this rather vapid tale.No emotional attachment with any of the characters, a plot that SERIOUSLY strained credibility, and very bloated--a good editor could easily wipe out a hundred pages with no sweat. I have to give Cruise this: she does a good job writing steamy sex scenes. Other than that, the whole book was excrutiatingly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time and money","review":"How dissapointing after reading reviews raving about what a great author Jennifer Crusie is. This book was so tough to get into, it was a struggle to make it through to the end. With each chapter, I'd hoped it would get better, but to no avail. The characters are dull, and the hero and heroine have no chemistry. A real dissapointment for romance lovers. Do yourself a favor and stick with Susan Elizabeth Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"This book is trite as all get-out, with a gaggle of silly women to-boot. How can the owner of a detective agency not realize he's been embezzled by one of his employees? I made it to page 30 or so, and that was a chore. Maybe I should have given it more of a chance, but there are so many smarter books out there, so why bother? Sorry if you are truly a Crusie fan. I can usually find something good to say about a book, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Up until this book, I was a huge Crusie fan. I've bought & read all of her books & not regretted it...until now. I returned this one to the store when the heroine had sex with the hero's cousin within the first 75 pages of the book. Call me a prude, but that was a bit much for me. After this, I couldn't really respect Nell (the heroine) again, and I sure couldn't take to the hero, since he was so cavalier about the whole thing (let's not even talk about the cousin! He was in a relationship at the time.). Truthfully, this book has now turned me off of Ms. Crusie forever. I'll borrow her books if they're in the library, but I'm sure not spending anymore money on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"To date, one of my favorite books","review":"There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said already by the almost-200 reviews But honestly, if this was ever made into TV show or movie, I'd be in seventh heaven!Crusie is genius and this book in particular showcases her amazing grasp on portraying humanity in all its messed-up, comedic glory. If you're looking to brighten up your holidays, I highly suggest reading this by all the twinkly lights while sipping on some boozy hot chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Women","review":"Great story with everything you look for: romance, laughs, mystery with real people living their lives. Loved this book! Jennifer Crusie always delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as much fun as I expected. I wouldn't recommend it.","review":"I didn't enjoy the two main characters as much as I enjoyed her characters in other books. I'm not sure why. There was some humor, but not enough to recommend the book. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 2001. Genre: romantic mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRUSIE WRITES EYE-CANDY","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFULL NOVEL, The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I couldnt help but compare it to WELCOME TO TEMPTATION, which was 12 stars to me, and every person I have loaned it to. FAST WOMEN was fast paced and the characters were full, consiouse beings, easy to get to know and care about. Crusies style of writing is SO good, after you finish with her novels you cant help but think, I WANT TO WRITE LIKE THIS WHEN I GROW UP. In the mean time I will keep reading her stuff because it is incredible eye candy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I keep trying and she keeps letting me down...","review":"I couldn't go much further after the heroine kissed her best friend before she kissed the hero of the story. And did I mention her best friend was NOT A GUY. How weird is that?Also, don't even bother reading the jackets of Crusie's books. They go into great detail about the supposed main characters who immediately take a back seat to the rest of the story. She writes in depth about her secondary characters. I just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy about Crusie...","review":"I have yet to be disappointed with any of Crusie's novels and have come to the point where I will pick one up sight unseen. FAST WOMEN was a fantastic mixture of comedy, romance, mystery and great sex. All I have come to expect from a Crusie novel. When I was not laughing at the antics of the characters in this book, I was feeling for them. Crusie has done it again where she engages us in a story rich in color, character, and realism...adding a splash of the absurd for spice. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sessions from a guitar titan","review":"We have all heard Wes Montgomery, either from the great man himself or referenced by Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan, who did a good approximation of Montgomery's signature octave picking.Of course, that's not all Wes could do. This session, recorded in a few days time, is precise, mindblowing and represents some of guitar oriented bebop's finest moments.\\"Twisted Blues\\" starts off with a friendly jump, and \\"Cotton Tail\\" follows with a nearly incomprehensible rhythm pattern that no novice should ever attempt without a safety net.The album is smooth and shows us what a well rounded guitarist could do for the instrument. Perhaps Montgomery's only real contemporary competition was Chet Atkins. Like Atkins, the chord knowledge and voicing is encyclopedic. No guitar player should be without this CD as a lesson for great rhythm work (not to mention lead work, too), and no fan of be-bop should neglect to have this gem in his or her collection, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect guitar sound","review":"Wes Montgomery always had an easily recognizable sound. His use of the thumb instead of a pick generated a distinctive attack. In some recordings his sound may have been a little more overdriven than he wished: I'm less sentimental about vintage amps than some.But in this album, it's just right. The acoustic sound of his big archtop guitar comes through, with just a hint of crunch from his amplifier. \\"I Wish I Knew\\" exemplifies this sound with one of the best ballads he ever recorded. Although (as another reviewer indicated) the style of mixing is a little dated, the band plays well. You can easily hear past any inadequacies in the mix.Overall, the album is a nice mix of ballad and up-tempo. It's not as market-focused as some of his later recordings, so you get a good taste of what this sensitive player could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick intro to Natural Church Development","review":"This booklet is designed to introduce a congregation or any interested persons to Natural Church Development in just 20 minutes. It covers the research project, the eight quality characteristics and the biotic principles in a quick and simple format that makes the reader feel as if they were talking with the author over a cup of coffee.Some churches buy this for the 30 people taking the survey. Others buy it for all the adults in the congregation to help them understand the Natural Church Development process.While this booklet works well as a quick intro, the pastoral staff and key leaders in a congregation considering the NCD process need to read the book this is based on, NATURAL CHURCH DEVELOPMENT by Schwarz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dark, matte, chrome.... LOL","review":"You see the picture of these headers and opening the details page, you see 'comes in standard finish'. WOW. Flowtech has a nice shiny ceramic or stainless appearance as it's standard finish! What a great deal! Alas, it is not so. Upon opening the box, you find headers with cheap black paint. At least the comparable Hedman headers clearly state 'painted black, paint not heat resistant'. What's the deal? Are we trying to intentionally mislead people here? How the heck is the average buyer expected to know what constitutes a 'standard finish' on Flowtech headers especially if the picture does not depict the actual item? Sorry Amazon, this one is being returned. Seems like they would have been decent, but I bought the Flowtech instead of Hedman because I thought I was getting a great deal on a nice shiny finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor, poor.","review":"There needs to be a rule made: Any person or persons tasked with putting together an artists \\"definitive collection\\" should be required to have at least a passing interest in the artists music. This was slapped together by Hip-O Records, which is a label under Interscope records that does nothing but put compilations together. If you're new to Dave Hollister, do yourself a favor and buy all of his CD's through Amazon's re-sellers. You will come out the same or cheaper, and then you can put together your own collection. If you're not new to Dave, you know I speak the truth. This is no more than a collection of the singles that were released with a few tracks thrown in from other periods of Dave's career.

Audio and video are outstanding but some of the effects have me wondering what Don was thinking. Perhaps if I smoked a joint I would appreciate it more <just kidding>. Wild Mick Brown deserved more video time and \\"Alone Again\\" needed George's unmistakable sound.

Second, whoever edited it should be fired. I like Dokken, but this video totally disappointed me. The numerous split screens and jumping all over the place got old FAST. If you can find it used on ebay for $... it's ok, but don't throw away your money on this poor editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 80's \\"Hair\\" Band By Far.","review":"On the positive side, the music simply rules. I saw Dokken twice last year in St.Petersburg Fl as the headline act with Great White opening up, and in Tampa on the Poison tour. This DVD is a must have for any Dokken fan and any fan of the genre. Reb Beach makes one almost forget about George Lynch. On the negative side, I cant understand why all the split screens and floating boxes?? Lets just see the band live on stage. After a while, all the fancy split screens gave me a headache. Also, why the band chose that particular venue (the Sun Theatre in Anaheim Ca.) is unclear. The crowd was pretty pathetic thus the minimum of crowd shots was understandable. Forgetting these issues, the band covers all the essential songs except for perhaps \\"just got lucky\\" and \\"when heaven comes down\\". Pop this DVD in your player,hopefully its hooked up to your surround system, turn up the volume, and get ready to do some Rockin with Dokken."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dokken fan dream come true.","review":"Dokken was one of those bands from the 80's that was kind of ignore by the critics, but not by the fans. A lot of the songs like \\"Alone Again\\", \\"In my Dreams\\" (one of the best songs on this DVD), \\"Paris is Burning\\" are still landmarks of the heavy/hard rock scene from the 80's.This DVD has superior quality in sound and images with a lot of creativity on the \\"sub scenes\\" featuring clips from their original videos. Also there are 2 excellent unplugged songs taken from the \\"One Live Night\\". The interview is also interesting which describes a lot of the turbelence behind the downfall of the band during the late 80's.Reb Beach (Winger, Alice Cooper) is an excellent replacement for George Lynch and in some ways he is even better!!!

The card installed smoothly, and comes with a ton of optional software bundled inside. It's worth noting that the included The Waldorf Edition won't install on Windows 7.Included with the drivers is a sound manager/mixer utility with effects built right in. The sound card processes all effects on its own hardware, maintaining the extremely low-latency input/output while outputting from the EMU utility. You can even use it to receive outputs from from or send inputs to ASIO or Windows WAV channels, making the whole process extremely flexible. Send your inputs to ASIO and then use a separate utility like Fruity Loops to record or process the signal, then do whatever you want from there. This card is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get SPDIF to work","review":"I bought this card as a replacement in my DAW for another card with similar features.

It has her concert from Hawaii...Hanging out with friends, dropping a suprise visit to one of her fans, Britney getting Hula lessons, etc. and her three jaw dropping videos...Oops! I Did It Again, Lucky, and Stronger. Yes she is the best female alive and this DVD shows it! A MUST for any Britney fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"Great video of her preformance in Hawaii along with a few others and some videos. Over all I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spears Live and More","review":"If you have seen her Fox Special in Hawaii and loved it then you should get this cool DVD. It has very cool never before seen footage and her new video \\"Stronger\\" and clips from her Staurday Night Live show when she was performing/host. Any fan of Britney should get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney \\"Did it again!\\"","review":"I really enjoy the Britney DVD. My favorite part is how you can do a video jukebox and pick songs from her concert or videos and they will play in any order you chose or just have it where the DVD will pick and play them in a different order from the normal program. The only thing I didn't like was the Saturday Night Live clips. I'm glad I got to see them once but I never watch them now. They are boring. Also I liked how she spent time in Hawaii with swimming with dolphins and etc. The scenery was gorgeous and I liked seeing her personality come through the segments. Overall I love this video and watch it or just listen to the concert music on the DVD very often. I think she sings great on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and More","review":"Live...and More is an entertaining look at Britney's trip to Hawaii. This VHS/DVD, depending on what you own, is fully equipped with videos, a live concert, personal time with Britney, and skits from her SNL appearance. I only wish that they wouldn't have cut everything up and mixed it around, and instead put on the full concert, the full SNL episode, then the videos with the personal Britney time afterwards. The downfall of owning the VHS is fast forwarding and rewinding through the whole video to find a specific performance or skit, which is especially hard because they are not grouped together. Anyhow, this is a great piece of Britney merchandise that should be owned by any Britney fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on Frame Relay","review":"The book is in two parts and each addresses Frame-Relay in a different way. The first part is a largely non-technical introduction to the subject. If you want to know what Frame-Relay is, why it is the way that it is, what it is meant to be used for and how it might fit into a networking system, then you will get all of that here.The second part is a technical description of the protocol. It goes into enough detail to allow you not just to understand the protocol but, if you have the coding and design skills, to write your own F-R stack and get it interworking with other networks.I did that using this book as my reference. In the course of that work, I spotted one small error in the book. One bit in the Frame-Relay header field is mis-described but apart from that, it was a great help.Not only is the technical content spot on but it is well presented. The layout and diagrams make sense and the English is clear and readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movies in their time","review":"I enjoyed these two old time (1930's movies). William Boyd before he became Hopalong Cassidy and Clark Gable before he became a super star. Tex Ritter was one of my favorites when I was a kid.

But other than that I recommend this laptop for anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows XP shut down","review":"Compaq 2701 does not work at the moment, because of some problems with Windows XP. It never happened neither to my previous Compaq Presario 1694 nor to the desktops I used. In addition, no restore cd, nor an application/drivers cd were included, so I can not do anything myself with this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A [$$$$] doorstop","review":"I owned a Presario laptop about a year ago, and swore it would be the last Compaq I'd ever buy. Why, oh why, didn't I listen to my own words. When I needed a more powerful laptop I foolshly decided to get a Presario 2700 since the price was better than comperable, competing brands. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for (who'd of thought [$$$$] would be low-end?) The first 2700 that I received had a CDR drive that died after 2 days. The computer was replaced with a new unit which was fine right out of the box. However, it soon exhibited sluggish performance, frequent system lock-ups, and nasty crashes and it continues to get worse. I spend more time fixing things than working with this doorstop. So, THIS is THE last Compaq I'll ever buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, moving, insightful","review":"Paul Linke's one-man-show is a most-private and intimate story: how he met, courted and married his beloved Franchesca. Then comes the devastating news of cancer and how they dealt with the crisis.This special piece is poignant, moving and insightful from beginning to end. Laughter and tears abound. Buy this video AND watch for the occasional live performance. Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Connects to dial up immediately....but that's about it","review":"After spending up to two frustrating hours each attempt trying to log on to my dial up internet service (utilizing a factory installed modem on my Dell computer), I was initially overjoyed with the immediate internet connection the Modem Blaster V.92 provided. This was short lived, however, because with this convenience came following new inconveniences: (1) MUCH slower speed opening web pages than promised (in fact, slower than Dell's factory modem); (2) Modem Blaster creates loud bussing on all phones anytime the it is plugged in to the phone line even with the computer shut down; (3) Complete loss in ability to listen to streaming web music.Don't let your wallet get blasted by the Modem Blaster V.92 and purchase a different modem that has a better performance and consumer satisfaction record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Modem","review":"Do NOT buy this piece of crap!!!!!This voice modem has the poorest sound quality that I've ever heard. Awful clicking sounds to boot!You can barely hear your caller's message.When receiving a voice meaasage, Modem Blaster keeps the phone off hook for at least an additional 45 seconds after caller's hangup.....quite annoying.It works OK for faxing only.Like another reviewer said, the software is Mickey Mouse at best. The drivers are not even Microsoft WHQL certified.It didn't even remove the Creative Modem Blaster Applet in Control Panel upon uninstallation. I had to go in and remove it manually.It also likes to take over the phone line even when you pick up the phone after only a couple rings. There are two obnoxious pickup/hangup sounds heard by both you and your caller.I cannot say enough bad things about this junky modem.I replaced it with an internal generic PCI Data, Fax, Voice modem. It works flawlessly.....thank God!!!!!!Creative should stick with sound cards only!!!!!!!I'm done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I Sure Couldn't Get It To Work!","review":"Creative Modem Blaster DE5671-1 (S/N ZSBF0122717000639A) sure was a wasted afternoon; for nothing. New drivers from the website, etc etc new phone cable, several different software packages etc. Never could get the caller id to work (my only purpose for the device). I tried the AT+ string posted here until my fingers were blue; no joy.Unless you enjoy rebuilding electronics, forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I've been building and troubleshooting computers since the early '90's, and I picked up one of these for a friend's almost new Toshiba laptop whose own modem was faulty. I spent a whole day trying to get it to work, nothing but odd error messages and stuff. And of course the usual too many programs that Creative wants to install (which I let happen just to ensure that it was a standard install). After about nine hours, I went back to BestBuy and returned this modem and got a cheapo Dynex pcmcia 56k modem for the same price. It worked on the first try.Creative Labs really isn't a name I trust anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Modem","review":"The auto-start feature for the CD-ROM did not work. Once you get past that and to the appropriate start files the modem installs easily. Good dial-up connection speeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT's junk just junk","review":"The one that I receaved just didn't work.I would have been happy if it would have done caller ID.Thats all I wanted it to do but it couldent even do that.Best recomdation I can make if your looking for a good modem look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiseido","review":"I love this product and cannot find any store close to me that carries it.

I have purchased it for my grandchildren and this classic has been loved by our family for generations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Childhood Treasure!","review":"When I was little, I remembered this show before I read the original Cat in the Hat. I was enanmored by the animation of the great late Chuck Jones and the wonderful vocals of Allan Sherman as the Cat in the Hat. If you see the credits, Theodore Geisel had his hand in the music. I recently bought the sing-a-long tape for my daughter, Grace, who is 3 years old. She requests to see it, so hopefully the new DVD will be a great asset if it has extra features such as interviews or even behind the scenes of one of the best animation short classics ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Don't buy this one.","review":"Buyers out there beware! This is NOT the 1971 animated TV version that we all remember. This is nothing but the book being read out loud with some pans and close ups of the original pages and 'animation' created by moving the camera. It looks like some home-made job and you'll be VERY disappointed.I got this one one by mail by someone who described the other DVD and shipped me this. If I could give it zero or even negative stars, I would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch","review":"I remember watching \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" on TV as a youngster. The great interaction between the Cat and the Fish and the songs (\\"Cat. Hat. In French Chat, Chapeau. In Spanish, el Gato in a Sombrero!)have obviosuly stayed with me. This video is not the one from my youth. It is a tremendous disappointment. This is simply an uninspired reading of the book accompanied by pathetic paper cut-out animation and poor vocal characterization. If you're looking for the video from your youth, caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this suck more?","review":"Yes, I think it could. Never have I seen a more lackluster comedic film.

It's made in USA, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop down Hitch","review":"I ordered this product on the description that it was a four inch drop. It is not. It is three and a quarter inch drop.

I measured to confirm this fact. This is the correct item identified at multiple vendors as having a 4\\" drop, Curt just calls it by the wrong dimension - well let's call a lie a lie.If your tow measurements can allow for 12.5% slop, then this a well-painted, solidly-built 3.5\\" drop ball mount.Until they correct the item description/name, I'd suggest you steer clear of Curt and try a more honest brand to get what you order."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i saw this band opening up for marilyn manson in 95 in new orleans,i was 15. what was really cool is that after their show they were walking around in the crowd on the floor signing autographs. i had a chance to meet to singer, she was really sweet, awesome, and very beautiful. this is album is completely great from the sexy screams in \\"i like you\\" to the dark lyrics in \\"go to hell\\" it's excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocked!!!!!","review":"I soooooo loved listening to this cd!

The music is obviously different frpom kmfdm, as would be expected, but she doesnt sound the same at all. The music is overall good generic hard rock, the songs near the end a little more offbeat, but Lucia's vocals... theyd be alright if she didnt do the uhuhuh thing at the end of almost every verse. Her voice has range, but theres no reason to jump it around so much, its annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated little jewel by Monk","review":"This is a great record make no mistake. Underrated and little known because there are no 'big' names on it. Thad Jones on cornet is great with a fat no nonsense sound and then Charlie Rouse on tenor! Listen carefully to 'Ask me now' a not so popular little jewel by Monk. Odd enough I don't know why the producers decided to put three takes from the same tune in succesion. Why didn't they put the alternates at the end? Beats me."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing but \\"sudden fun\\"","review":"The band is Matthew Winegar and Josh Freese. You may recognize both musicians names. Josh is a well known studio drummer extraordinaire.

It touches on the history of media, all they way up to the new, inspiring technology. As a Masc151 student, I definitely find it informative and easy to read. Also, the book comes with a compact disk, that encompasses all the information in the wonderful text book. It's an alternative study tool if you don't feel like opening the book. I highly recommend this book for any prospective mass communications major."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of information, needs an editor","review":"This book is useful as a reference and a detailed chronicle. For the average reader, it is far too wordy. It needed a good editor. This book should be half the length it is. Sadly, the overall picture gets drowned in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book based on it's title.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for a book on SS7 and SS7 over IP. This book is more of a chapter from a book. 21pages, mostly diagrams of signaling layers. This e-book does little to nothing to explain concepts in it's title. Unless you want to pay 8 bucks for a few good definitions of very well known technical words, don't waste your money. The only thing that I will say good about this book is that Lawrence Harte at least used his spelling and grammer check when writing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"We purchased four units for warehouse kiosks at our plant.The num lock will sometimes activate on these units for no apparent reason.

It is a tremendous help ergonomically to have the mouse in the lower, nearer position. However, the keyson this keyboard are small, and have a very light bounce to them, and it is easy to mistype. Adesso could do more to give the keys a distinctive feel, so you really know where your fingers are. But if you are a decent typist, and don't mind running spell-check from time to time, this can work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mini keyboard","review":"This is a nice mini keyboard that works well for me.I needed a mini USB keyboard for my Xbox 360 (it will get used elsewhere in the home but mainly as a keyboard for my 360). This one works great without any issues. The 360 doesn't require PC functionality like the F-keys or control keys but I have used these keys with this keyboard on one of the PC's in my house without any issues.I love this keyboard - right size, right price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some keys didn't work - sent it back","review":"The good: It is small.The bad: The layout of the keys was poorly thought out.The ugly: Numerous keys didn't work & I had to go through the whole RMA thing to send it back.

The cover is not attached at all to the pages of the book it just looks well used. I work with small children and this book won't make it passed the first day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual female lead","review":"I liked this because it was different than other detective novels I've read recently. Jack isn't the typical female lead detective -- i.e., she's not young, hot, and sexy. Instead, Jack is 46, going grey, and showing the effects of 15 years of chronic insomnia. And her latest live-in just left her for his personal trainer. She becomes a focus of \\"The Gingerbread Man\\" after he spots her taking charge of his crime scene. Not only do you get Jack's side of things in this story, you get his. The portrayal of the FBI here is pretty laughable and inaccurate, but I understand that it's meant to be comic relief, nothing more. I'll definitely read more books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Enjoyable. Great detective with no personal life though. Too bad job comes first for her. She needs some balance in her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I cannot understand all the glowing reviews for this book. Because of them I went out and bought it in hardback and I am very sorry I did. I recommend anyone tempted to do the same get it from the library instead. I didn't find it to be well written or original. The funny parts woven in were good I will admit but the rest (of what I could bring myself to read, which was not the entire book) was rehashed standard mystery stuff ( and I LOVE a good mystery). This just wasn't worthy of finishing in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nasty little pustule of a book","review":"Although Jack Daniels is an appealing, witty main character, I could not help but feel that I was reading a commercial \\"product\\" rather than a book. The repartee between Jack and her partner is great, but the plot, the criminal, the crimes and the structure are hackneyed, formulaic, and well beyond sensationalistic.The obvious ripoff on Stephanie Plum makes me give the book a low grade.The graphic depiction of sadism makes me reject it completely.How about subtlety? How about suggestion?It is a nasty little pustule of a book.Also, as a former galley checker, the research is bad. There are places and street locations that show that Ms. Konrath doesn't own a Chicago street guide. That is just plain lazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting author","review":"The author does believes that people being tricked into buying books on fake reviews is okay; it is not.

I enjoyed it very much but it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat like the three horror novels by the same author did. But overall I was pleased with my purchase. It was a fun read that held my interest from the beginning to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Need More Female Detectives","review":"And Konrath has delivered. This deathless genre takes another twist into humor with this wonderful debut effort.Kinsey Milhone has gotten us to a place of frustration with her Nancy Drew-ish plot devices and artificial descent into lawbreaking. \\"Ten Big Ones\\" did not sparkle like Janet E's other stuff, which might telegraph that she might be Plum out of new ideas.So we need more female detectives. Konrath walks where angels fear to tread too: he's a male writer creating a hard-bioled female character. I think he did a fine job, creating a lively, amusing and smart woman who has problems just like everyone else. He does convey, though, the sheer delight in the chase and the capture which any good cop must have in abundance.Looking forward to the next one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and creepy at it's best!","review":"This was great! The characters are marvelous, the dialogue is crisp and funny, and yet the killer is creepy and terrifying. The story is fast paced and doesn't let up; it's a definite \\"don't bother me, I'm reading\\" book, but you might want to read it during the day as the villain is that awful. It's a wonderful balance in contrasts and a very good read. I've ordered book two, and I'm ready for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I've never read a book like this before. Not only is it so funny you laugh out loud, but the scenes with the serial killer are so scary that I had to stop reading to make sure the doors were locked!This is a fast-paced and funny book, and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series.

This is a bad one. And the worst part is, it's the June '05 selection of our library's mystery club so I HAVE to finish it. I was shaking my head by the end of the FIRST PAGE!!! We go from descriptions of \\"Jack\\"'s wardrobe to yukky descriptions of the murders that Richard Montonari did a lot better in HIS newest, \\"Rosary Girls\\". I wouldn't insult Stephanie Plum by comparing her to Jack Daniels. Nothing about Daniels seems real. She's tries waaaay too hard to be \\"tough\\". Patricia Cornwell tried the same thing, but Kay Scarpetta came off just a little masculine and more vulnerable than anything else. Jack Daniels reminds me of a third grader on the playground trying to bully down the first graders. I probably shouldn't dis this book because I'm only on page 30, but it REALLY stinks. If anyone sees anything good in this book, please let me know. I really want to like it, but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty","review":"First time with this author and this character.

A waste of paper and money!!!!","review":"What in the world?! All the glowing reviews above have GOT to be from friends and family This book was horrible: it takes every cliche known to man and throws it into one book dumbed down and mediocre in both plot and writing. The cliches about the female protag are particularly offensive -- I can guarantee you the author is a man hoping to catch a ride on Evanovich's coat tails. Even the title and protag's name are forced, never mind the auhtor's idea of what \\"tough\\" women are like. Ugh. I would recommend virtually ANY other female detective/P.I. series over this crap. Shame on the author and the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I liked the tempo, the writing, the schtick, the main characters, the supporting characters, and the story. *whew!* That's a lot to like in one little book!

Otherwise, GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I am a huge fan of the strong female protagonist and I believe the world needs more of them.

I don't want to read about how females get cut up into pieces. Not my style and certainly not like the Plum books which are not graphic at all. You can tell this was written by a male writer.

It recounts an interesting time in South Carolina history when prohibitionist compromises helped to create one of the most corrupt government-run businesses of the time. The dispensary idea was sold as both a means to control the flow of alcohol and raise revenue for the state education fund...an interesting parallel as South Carolina currently embarks on building support for a state run lottery, also \\"to improve education\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful; there were many inaccuracies","review":"Alas, I found many inaccuracies in this one.

If any one knows of the second coming of Jesus, or wants to know, then this is the movie for you. The movie is played out in biblical context, keeping with the writings of the Book of Revelations. But, it also has a new age twist to it. Since no one knows the method that will be used to convince people to take the mark of the beast. The writer uses new age technology in the form of Virtual Reality. In which the person is forced to wear a helmet that transports them virtually into a dimension to talk with the anti-christ. where he either persuades the person to take his mark or kills them.

One of Williams' best!","review":"After I saw the movie at a press screening(a few years ago), I ran out to buy the CD but it wasn't available for another week. When I got the CD, it was everything I hoped for and more. It's been a few years and I listen to it now, this music is TIMELESS. It WILL put you in the mood for love and romance. This score reminds me a little of the Witches of Eastwick soundtrack, whick Williams did. But while that is more whimsical and scary, this is romantic, breezy, haunting at times. Sting's 'Moonlight' is a killer. This score and song got nominated for 2 oscars but failed to win(happens, Williams won too many already. Might have won some Golden Globe or Grammies.) Look, everyone here at Amazon gave it five stars, I've bought three(gifts). So take out your credit card and get this CD. It is one of the best CDs I have and you will not regret it, even if you like punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully engaging...","review":"The \\"Sabrina\\" score is elegant, classic, and haunting- I listen to it all of the time and it just creates a beautiful mood. I have found that the best time of year to listen to this cd is the fall because the melodies are soft and twinkle, like falling leaves. However spring and summer are also quite lovely, especially with the top down. Number thirteen is worth the money in my opinion. This is the perfect score in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL & SOPHISTICATED...","review":"...just like Sabrina herself. Loved the old standards that are included, and anytime I can hear a tune from Sting I think it's great. Beautiful, lyrical melodies and just pure pleasure to listen to.

The moonlight, sung by Sting is a very stylized piece with a visible Bossa Nova influence.The album is very comfortable and easy listening. The highlight piece is in my opinion, the lovely chained set mixing admirably immortal songs of the popular memory such Stella by starlight, Call me irresponsible and the Shadow of your smile. Pollack with the humbleness of the world wanted to pay his quote of admiration to Billy Wilder' s original version.In the moonlight is a very elusive piece with touch of memories. The main theme of Sabrina is a very charm piece that rides between tenderness and the mystery. Growing up in Paris is a beautiful melody which describes the slow awakening of a blossomIn sum, a gratifying CD that will fill those special and required special moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite romantic movie soundtracks","review":"While I just adore the songs \\"Moonlight\\" by Sting, \\"How Can I Remember\\" and of course the classic \\"La Vie En Rose,\\" I really wished that the Stevie Wonder song \\"Love's In Need Of Love Today\\" was included...then it would feel like a more complete soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"same tune over and over","review":"I was dissapointed in the Sabrina soundtrack. it was pretty much different variations on the same tune.

The song is terribly muffled. The sound quality is awful! I transfered the song onto my iPod. It is impossible to mix it with the other songs. When \\"Moonlight\\" plays, it necessitates that I turn it up to hear Stings' words and then the next song comes on too loud! Argh! And what is even more annoying is that the other songs on the CD are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive musique de Sabrina!","review":"Let the music of Sabrina thrive! The musical score from 'Sabrina' is excellent and memorable. The music constantly haunts you, but a nice haunting, even hours after you watched the movie, or listened to the CD.

Excellant, and thank God for John Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best","review":"I still listen to this score regularly after buying the CD on its initial release--and it loses nothing over time. Williams has, incredibly, produced not one but three (!) beautiful themes for this charming and beautiful score. The piano solo on the main theme is a distinguished work by itself. And the golden standards included are a perfect fit. Although best know for bombastic epic themes, Williams is also a master at the romantic and this is a prime example. Now all we need is the release of Williams-scored smaller film scores on CD like '72's Pete 'n' Tillie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and really good","review":"While listening to this soundtrack by John WIlliams I was simply awestruck and inspired.

He was a great Herbert West in the reanimator films and when he gets creepy, he makes a film fun. I also love Ellie Cornell and have from the first time I saw her in Halloween 4. I saw Jeffrey and Ellie together and thought that this was a can't miss movie. The movie started out okay then Jeff and Ellie got killed in the first 5 minutes and a totally unsympathetic cast ensemble took over. The film did actually have a plot however, and there was a real reason why zombies were running around the town so as far as that goes, it had a step up on most zombie movies, but I just could not get into it. The actors were not very good and the characters they played were not too bright. Oh well, it was diverting for a while so it is not a total waste of time. Rent it though, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great actors..in a dreadful movie.","review":"Let's just get this out of the way. I hate this movie. In light of all the other terrible, terrible movies I've watched I probably shouldn't hate this one as much as I do, but there's just no other way to put it. I love low budget fare. I'm fine with an independent movie with no budget and a cast of first time actors that winds up being a little lack-luster. To have this lavish a set, and respectable veterans like Jeffrey Combs, Danny Trejo and David Keith, and still make such a dull chore of a movie, I find it inexcusable. I feel a great deal of my dislike come from how poorly written it all seems. The story is riddled with plot holes, the main characters come across as extremely unlikable, and with nearly every action they make, you're left asking \\"Why? Why would anyone do that? Did anybody read the script and ask whether it was a good idea?\\" As a zombie movie fan, I just can't steer you far enough away."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T KEEP A GOOD ZOMBIE DOWN","review":"One has to admit that out of all the horror genres, zombies are the weakest lot. Ever since George Romero trotted out the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD movies, attempts keep coming to top him, but ALL SOULS DAY isn't one of the better ones (try SHAUN OF THE DEAD instead). Credit should go to the writers for at least coming up with a reasonable scenario for the undead's return: revenge on the greedy man who was responsible for their extinction. The movie's problem lies in its incredibly slow pacing, and mediocre acting from its leads. Even brief bits by Jeffrey Combs, Ellie Cornell and David Keith can't make up for the posturing of Maria Ramirez, Travis Wester and the others. Laura Harring sleepwalks through her role as the mysterious innkeeper and the plot's inconsistencies wear thin after a while. ALL SOULS DAY won't be remembered as a classic zombie flick, but it isn't any worse than the other recent films of its ilk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever.","review":"Even BAD acting would have been an improvement to this 'film', in which you are lucky to see ANY acting.Truly horrible, don't waste your time.

Practical is shopping in [local store] and buying groceries in[local store]. The days of the corner grocer and little hardware store on Main St are long gone so I was curious about the opinions of the author and his neighbors. This is a great story - it seems to be unbiased and does provide good background info on the town without making it boring. The author nicely weaves little stories about the town or tales of the neighbors into this \\"documentary\\" to keep the story moving.

Most of the actions of the authors in Celebration were to try to force Disney to do something. Their position seems to be that Disney should be more regulated and contribute more.

But after repeated listening, I found myself humming some of the tunes on this album, which is usually a good sign. In a word it's cute. Sugar, sweet, poppy, whatever you want to call it, it's different and it catches your attention and puts a smile on your face. Bossa nova and brazilian jazz it ain't, but who cares when your ears are being tickled? This CD would appeal to listeners who like both indie-pop and world music, not necesarily hard-core MPB or bossa nova fans. In short, a great second effort that should capture some deserved attention and open the door to other great Brazilian sounds. I can't wait to see them live.

When I buy an Otis Spann CD, I buy it because I want to hear amazing piano playing. Unfortunately, on this CD the piano is burried deep in the mix and covered by loud guitars, drums, etc. It's almost like Otis is a guest or backup on his own CD! In fact on many songs, other people are doing the vocals! I would say skip this CD. If you want Otis at his best, I would recommend Walkin' The Blues (the sound quality is excellent and has a few piano solo numbers), Bottom Of The Blues, and Best Of Vangaurd Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...","review":"My boss purchased this saw as an extra saw on site. Most of the crew own DeWalt circular saws, but quickly found faults with this one. First, as mentioned, the base is missing a corner for some unknown reason. Second, the base is cheap plastic, and I can guarantee that it won't last more then a month or two. Third, it won't cut straight due to the slight wobble of the blade. Last, but not least, if you use the saw for more then 30 seconds, it smells like burning wires. I'm shocked that DeWalt puts their name on it.This is CERTAINLY not a saw that should be used by professionals or anyone who needs to rely on their cuts and the saw that makes them. This is really not much more then a weekend do-it-yourselfer's saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Saw On The Market","review":"I'm a NY framer who uses his saw literally 365 days a year.

I'm not a big fan of Skil..considering that their products are not made well at all and for a guy whos living is made based on functioning tools.....i scrapped the Bosch/Skil.

So I would hope that other customers keep this in mind before being misled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Creepy","review":"I love the description that another reviewer gave this album: Appalachian Gothic. With it's \\"roots\\" instrumentation and off-kilter lyrics, Sackcloth and Ashes is the dark side of \\"Oh, Brother Whereart Thou\\", invoking a strange and brooding \\"South\\" of hidden hollows and watchful people, a place that would be familiar to William Faulkner, not to mention Mulder and Scully. The music's not religious, not in the church goin' sense, but rather plays with themes of sin and redemption, heaven and hell, good and evil, that are such a part of the American past--and present. If you're open to travelling to a strange place, you could do much worse than Sixteen Horsepower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Swans with some rattlesnakes in hand","review":"Very impressed with this band.

I can only hope the journey continues past the most recent FOLKLORE, an album that mixes in a bunch of traditionals and is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what American music was supposed to sound like","review":"The best way I can describe this album is that it conjures images from John Steinbeck's novelThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)and like that great American classic, this album puts you under a spell and does not let you go until its over, leaving you exhausted but utterly satisfied. The band takes traditional American roots music and fuses it into a dark and intense blend of folk rock, the perfect backdrop for lyrics dealing with spirituality and human suffering. David Eugene Edwards delivers the vocals with the same ferocity with which I imagine his grandfather, a traveling Nazarene preacher, must have addressed his flock. I recommend their entire catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band rocks!!!","review":"I caught this band, really quite by accident, opening for Morphine in Charleston, S.C.

Being the self appointed Christian rock critic I am, I gave it a good listen. Except for a couple really strong hard rockin' tracks, their was really not much I was into.

I found this one laying around and it fit the parameters of a Book Challenge I was taking. Wow! Um....wow. The crime-solving plot was interesting. It was twisty-turning, making you look at all the suspects and casting blame this way and then that way. The love story, though, was completely implausible. A federal agent falls for the trophy wife he helped to put behind bars. The romance takes place over three days. What really, really bothered me though was all the out loud internal monologue.

I am 6' tall and tried to use this on a 2007 Camry. So I was plenty tall enough and a Camry is not a big car. I was having to lean up against the car just to get everything. Not user friendly at all.Minor complaints:Not very sturdy. Mine didn't break on the first use like other reviewers but it did feel like it could snap at any time. There are a lot of pieces which means a lot of potential for breaking.Overall:I am returning this product. It does not perform as advertised.

I was looking for something that would cut through thick ice, as well as lighter coatings, quickly and easily. I was hopeful for the IceDozer, but ultimately disappointed with the performance. It definitely does not clear large swaths in a single swipe, as the description claims it will. That was one of the things I was looking forward to. The way you can grip the handle to apply pressure is nice, but it does get awkward as you try to reach the center of the windshield. My bottom line is that it's not any better than a regular plastic scraper, with the downside that it's very large to store in your car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works in some cases.","review":"I haven't been able to peel ice with this guy. I experience mostly heavy frost and this took care of that pretty well until it dulled down (which was fairly quick). I tried breaking up ice as they show in pictures and videos, but nothing worked. The design also makes it impractical to clean the front windshield because it REQUIRES 2 hands to keep good pressure and to stabilize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"It is like a bulldozer. You cant break it. Most ice scrapers are pansy devices. You cant take them and smash ice. This thing is amazing. You can take it and smash it into your windshield and the teeth break the ice. Then use it like a block plane to scrape it off. The blade conforms to the shape of the windshield. There is so much incredible engineering in this thing if you examine it closely. It is like the better mouse trap, only it IS better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Ice Scraping Easy","review":"I bought the dozer after a bad freezing rain storm that took me over 45 minutes to clear the ice off of my car. 2 similar storms have came since I received the product.

It almost seems that the ice hasn't been as tough as the first storm. I havent had any problems with the quality or durability. I use the corner of the blade to expose a little bit of windshield, then let the full blades do the rest with a little elbow grease. Ice comes off easily.

Each little added feature fell off during the very first time I used it. The little brush came off first and I ended up using it as a separate tool for cleaning off my mirrors.

Hands-on experience makes me regret decision. Bought too far in advance of last winter so by time used, too late to return.Way too big. If you have rear seat passengers, must be stored in trunk. Then when it snows, opening trunk sends all snow into...?Better value/convenience? Buy a hand scraper with a soft metal (brass?) blade. It'll outdo this one and can be tossed on the floor in the back seat. Will last long time too.The detachable brush is a joke. For what? MAYBE brushing off rear-view mirror.

I was in the parking lot at work. Some of my co-workers had come out before me, started their cars to get the defrosters working, and then scraping with the old-style scrapers. I broke out my IceDozer and had all my windows cleared in less than 5 minutes. I was done, but my co-workers were still scraping away, but only making minimal progress on just their windshields.

But I watched the video and it's quite apparent that it was faked to mislead the potential customer. The ice in most scenes where the Dozer is being used has obviously been heated from underneath so as to loosen any bonding to the glass.

Got to finally use here in Virginia during the blizzard we had in February. It's ok for pushing snow off your car; it pushes great, but it's not long enough to push snow all the way off your windshield or roof. The scraper works as expected, pretty good. The long handle lets you get more leverage for that thick ice. The brush attachment is kind of a pain. It constantly falls off of my scraper when I am using it or the scraper side.

I will never understand why Cusack hates this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites of All-Time!","review":"This movie is probably in my Top 10 all-time favorite movies. It's an absolute classic. I crack up so much when I watch \\"Better Off Dead\\". Booger from \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" plays a friend of Lane's (Cusack) and is hilarious!! The scenes with Booger on the snowy mountain with Lane are classic. Other characters in the movie that crack me up are the Chinese guy who talks like Howard Cosell, Lane's crazy little brother, his neighbor Ricky (\\"RICCKKKKYYYY!!\\"), and the paper boy (\\"Two dollars! I want my 2 dollars!\\"). Lane's Mom is a horrible cook and makes up some rather nasty food (i.e. the jello-like thingie that crawls across his plate). I often find myself quoting lines from \\"Better Off Dead\\". A must-see movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD... You like DVD","review":"Simply the funniest movie made in the eighties.

I miss the 1980's decade ....it was a lot more fun than the \\"hyper sensitive/politically correct 1990's.\\" If you like John Cusack in this film, I would also highly recommend \\"A Sure Thing.\\" That too is a GREAT John Cusack 1980's film."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY A SIGHT TO BEHOLD...","review":"This film captures the essence of the confused, surreal blur that is high school. Ever feel like the only one in class that's completely lost? Ever feel like throwing yourself off a bridge when the love of your young life ditches you for someone more popular? Ever wonder what in God's name your mother cooked last night? Then this movie's for you. What's so special about this film is that it lets fantasy creep in just enough to elevate the reality to its most empathetic form. We've all felt the pain of our frazzled protagonist--but this movie actually let's you see a surreal extension of those feelings. Your'e not just watching it...you're invested in it.Let me also add that in capturing the 80's teen scene, this movie succeeds remarkably. Being a sort of \\"Fast Times at Ridgemeont High\\" on acid, this movie takes the excess of 80's teen living and paints a nostalgic portrait--mostly hilarious, at times wistful, and even poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressionist review...fill in the blanks...","review":"10) It be a SHAME when... 9) mother will be very displeased... 8) EVERYBODY wants some... 7) You stupid bonehead - I'm gonna activate... 6) it's got raisins in it...you LIKE raisins... 5) what's a little boy like you doing with... 4) please god dont let it be... 3) everybody's going to be wearing one... 2) take out your homework assignments... 1) moppishness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite movie - disappointed with DVD though","review":"First off, you have to see this movie.

If you want a movie review, read the excellent posts by Jeffrey Ellis or Joshua Lai.Second, my low rating is based on the actual DVD. I waited, and waited, and waited for this movie to come out on DVD. Considering DVDs have been around more than 5 years already, I'm truly amazed that companies still put out VHS quality works in DVD format. I could have sworn I was watching a videotape (on my HD monitor with progressive scan player).

If you laugh all theway through a film, then it's a great film. It didn't do it for me, though. I bought itbecause John Cusak is very good in everything he does, and the Leonard Maltin bookgives it a fair rating. It's funny now and then, and some of the visual gags are very funny, butthe writer/director just isn't clever enough when it comes to humor, I'd say. A better writer could havemade this a much better film. But it's interesting to seeJohn Cusak in this early film, when he was a teenager.

His study is a very young John Cusack and his obsessive crush on the ultimate blonde idiot, Beth, who only finds him attractive until she falls for the school ski director, and resident bully. Beth, who is played very well by Amanda Wyss, shallow as she is, decides to break up with John's character Lane, as calmly as she picks her hair spray. Thus begins Lane's decent into hilarious attempts at suicide and trying to win her back. Holland's directional and writing debut is a little rough, but very real and keeps you watching to the very end.

The arguments made in proofs are often not really clear. The exercises don't help much in understanding the material on that section, they are sometimes just irrelevant.The author defines a \\"Ring of Remainders\\" for a given polynomial and it is really disturbing when you know that the same ring arises much more naturally as a quotient ring using the ideal generated by the given polynomial.I think the book also lacks somewhat in motivation, especially compared to books like Ian Stewart's. I had to purchase Stewart's book to understand the subject better while I was taking the course actually.Overall, I really don't advise this book.

The band is at its peak here. Steve Bartek's awe inspiring guitar work, Danny Elfman's darkly humorous singing, John Avila's rock solid basslines, Vato's speed drumming and of course, the imortal horn section. And let's not forget Warren Fitzgerald's palm muting and pich bend guitar work. Crank up the cd, feel the energy of that last Holloween show.From the tribal \\"Insanity\\" to the comforting \\"We Close Our Eyes\\" the 2 cds span a wealth of musical styles.

When I received it, it functioned as promised. However, that changed quickly. As dishwashing the board was safe according to the manufacturer, I placed it in my trusty dishwasher. Unfortunately, the board warped significantly with washing, causing it to bulge towards the back side. Now, it grips my granite countertops worse than regular cutting boards. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warping...","review":"This cutting board has been hand washed only, but is still warping and will not lie flat on the counter.

My original board lasted a really long time so was looking forward to this one. It is fine as a cutting board, but I got on onion juice on the rubber grip backside and I can't get rid of the odor. Over time it has diminished, but I think the rubber is too absorbent. I do like that it stays put on the counter and the fingerhold is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cutting board","review":"This is a really good cutting board.

Out of the box it looked promising. After one wash it bulged upwards so that only the four corners are touching the counter top - at least it bulged this way, otherwise it would be useless. Instead it is just annoying. There needs to be a \\"hand wash only\\" notice with this board. I suspect that the cause is the dissimilar materials of the board and the dimpled non-slip backing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as touted!","review":"I had very high hopes for this cutting board due to the recommendations from Cook's Illustrated. It does everything they say EXCEPT it leaves knife cuts easily AND it warps in the dishwasher. I suppose as long as You use dull knives and always hand-wash it, it would be acceptable BUT not at this price! I think you are better off buying a bunch of cheap polypropylene boards and just toss them when they wear out. Also if you put a damp paper towel under a cutting board it grips just as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cutting Board","review":"I love these cutting boards. I have two large and two small boards in various colors and use them constantly. My oldest one is about 8 years old and it is still in use. I put them in the dishwasher often and haven't found that they warp, although I did buy one that was warped out of the package once. I have to have more than one so that I can have two in use, or in the dishwasher at once. Seriously, at $15.00 each, I am not expecting them to last a lifetime and can afford to own more than one. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read through the reviews of this product carefully before buying, and the only common negative was that sometimes dishwashers can warp the board, possibly owing to excessively hot water. Being my own dishwasher, I figured that I was safe and ordered one. Amazon's packaging appeared to be more than adequate, i.e., large box, lots of cushioning, etc., so you can imagine my dismay when I removed the board from its retail cardboard enclosure, placed it on my counter, and it wobbled. In fact, I can spin the board freely on a flat surface despite never immersing it in water of any temperature. This is especially annoying as the price means that I'm now stuck in a situation where return by mail will probably cost as much as ordering another board. I'll probably give it one more try, but I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless when it warps","review":"This cutting board is great when it's brand-new. But after it's been through the dishwasher a few times (with NO heated drying cycle), it warps so the bottom becomes convex, and it completely loses its grip.

I was extremely disappointed when each one warped the FIRST time I put it in the dishwasher. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I now have cutting boards that \\"rock\\" instead of sitting flat. Even worse, the cutting surface is now a bit concave so that I can't easily slice all the way through without having to use an exaggerated sawing motion to make sure the cut goes all the way through to the board. The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because I think these would be very nice if you were willing to hand-wash/sanitize them instead of putting them in the dishwasher.

The new board (same brand, model and color) does not lie flat on the counter, weighs 22% less and \\"gives\\" when you put pressure on it while cutting. I'm tired of finally finding a good product, and then having the manufacturer reduce the quality in order to save production costs.

Wrongly accused by the music press of being Stone Roses wannabies, The Bluetones have made an album of their OWN music. Sure, it's not groundbreaking - how many first albums are? But it has ensured that The Bluetones have a strong and loyal fanbase which ensured the success of their second album (Return to The Last Chance Saloon).'Expecting to Fly' is the kind of album you can listen to in full over and over again. Standout tracks are 'Slight Return', 'The Fountainhead', 'A Parting Gesture' and 'Cut Some Rug'.This album stands alone as a classic of the nineties. But don't be put off by the 'Britpop' label. This label was a term invented by the music press to encompass bands like Oasis, Blur and Pulp, which are bands with almost nothing in common.Buy it. Now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"The debut album from the Housnlow band is just a wonderful specimen of British guitar rock in the vein of the late, great Stone Roses. The opening track, Talking to Clarry, is 6 minutes of psychedelic beauty. Slight Return and Carnt Be Trusted are other examples of this stellar band taking off into the realms of dreamy-jangle pop. Other great songs like Vampire and Time and Again, give the album a dreamy yet scarily-undercurrent feeling. Just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly real characters!","review":"Saber and Shadow is remarkable in its plot and setting as well, but I found the characters to be its main strongpoint. Megan and Shkai'ra are very well-developed characters, and the authors did not give in to the trend of making the main characters disgustingly idealistic. This book, as someone once said of the Illiad, \\"embodies all the ethical untidiness of living people.\\" Three cheers for realistic characterization!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first book in this series \\"Shadows Daughter\\" was excellent, this book however is not. But it also, except for the name of the main character, has almost no relation to the first book at all. The break in characterisation and culture from the first is completely jarring. This is an action book from start to finish and Stirlings heavy hand is all over it. Not that I dislike Stirling, when he is on form he is a good writer, but this book shows him almost at his worst. It was, I think, supposed to be a collaboration with Meier, but ended up being just another Stirling battle and gore fest. As a stand alone Conan with a sex change type novel it is only bearable. As a sequel to an excellent beginning novel it is simply trashy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack and Slash Desecration","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, since it continues the story of the \\"ethical thief\\" created by Shirley Meier in Shadow's Daughter. Shadow's Daughter portrayed the development and maturation of Megan Whitlock, a girl making the best of her life when trapped by poverty and subject to the whims of uncaring royalty. However, Saber & Shadow takes a complex character and turns her into a typical moral-free warrior, gleefully maiming or murdering every innocent that crosses her path. This book creates an adventure story interchangeable with that of hundreds of others, composed primarily of bloody chases, \\"political maneuvering\\" notable only for its unreadability, and enemies who could have stepped right out of the pages of an \\"Encyclopedia of Fantasy bad guys.\\" I would classify this book as yet another example of why talented writers should not turn their creations over to authors unable to measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legend In His Own Time.","review":"On CBS Sunday Morning, I learned that it is not 'hip' to be a Neil Diamond fan, and never has been.

We wandered back to the little dumpy club in New York where he got his start at $50 a night performance.The summer I visited my son's 'family' in Chicago, he asked if I liked Neil Diamond and was surprised when I admitted that I do. My introduction to this incredible songwriter was the movie, 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' and then along came his rendition of 'The Jazz Singer,' which I loved. Now, he has out a new CD, 'Twelve Songs' with the way he sounds today -- not much different from the early years. I missed his rock songs as I was never into the rock music scene with the drugs and confusion. My music of choice was pop with the baritone Eddie Fisher. Neil still has his melodious baritone (though strained) sounds and is as good now as he was forty years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"So upset!","review":"This album is not the original (although the jacket looks the same). I wanted the same album with the same music that I had back in the 70's and it has been reworked. Different songs. Some are the same but not many. I was so upset.

I still have it,but, through the years, it has gotten . . .well used. The CD brings back all the richness of the beautiful beat and sumptuous sounds of the African veldt. I sa Neil D last year in Austin Texas, and I prayed he would do \\"Solaimon\\" - hope I got the spelling right. When he did I went nuts! The album is a must for Diamond-heads! Glorious music ahead of its time. One of the only albums, and artists that both I and my dad agreed upon as I grew up. I'm 55 today and my dad passed on 15 years ago at age 71. I know he still listens to this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fo all ages!","review":"This is a must if you have a CD player in your car and you have kids.

There are a few errors that I can explain, but one I can't: \\"mtoto mazaliwa\\" should be \\"mtoto amezaliwa\\" (a child is born).

They work with respect to dryness. But these pullups have baby powder in them, and that irritated my child's bottom. The irritation got more and more red before I finally realized what was causing it: the baby powder.

They have plenty of stretchm so they're really easy for her to pull up and down, very absorbent and I love that the sides are velcro, so you can refasten them if necessary.

For months I have purchased Pampers by the case for my granddaughter; you can imagine my horror when the last order of Pampers Easy Ups trainers had the new (but unmarked on the wrappings) dry-weave formula that resulted in second-degree chemical burns! We had been warned by other users to avoid dry-weave, but, this came out of the blue. The first purchase of the Easy Ups were fine - not these!

Hopefully we will be potty trained soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for narrow butts...","review":"I bought these because they are slightly cheaper than Huggies Pull-Ups, but I'll just have to pay a couple extra bucks for the Pull-Ups because these things are leaky. My 2 year old little girl is pretty big for her size (in the 95% for both height and weight) so I bought size 5, but these things do not fit her bottom. They are constantly off-kilter and leak in the back where they are supposed to go around her cheeks. If your child is narrow in the behind these may work for you, but if she carries a little junk in the trunk be ready for a leaky mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe good for some but not for us","review":"I purchased the Pampers EasyUps because I have always been very pleased with Pampers products. They are generally the \\"Cadillac\\" of diapers. These diapers fit my daughter great and were easy for her to pull up and down; however, since we are in the beginning stages of potty training, she had regular \\"accidents\\". She did not always report that she was wet and if she sat in a wet diaper for more than a few minutes she would start to get very red and her skin would become sensitive to touch. After several days of use, my daughter ended up with a red, bleeding bottom. It was dramatic for her. I would just say watch your kiddo's skin closely for a reaction so it doesn't get too bad if your child is sensitive to these diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product and an even sweeter deal!","review":"Great product! \\"Leaks\\" and \\"spills\\" are rare and they don't get bunched up in \\"baby bottom\\".

DO NOT order these from amazon, it is a waste of time and energy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves them!!","review":"We started using the Pampers Easy Ups Trainers about four months ago and my toddler and I both love them. If you have a wiggly toddler always on the go these are great no more fighting to get the tabs latched before they try and make a run for it, and no more naked baby when they undo those tabs. We have also tried to Huggies Pull Ups and my daughter seems to prefer the Easy Ups. The site 2T-3T is a size 4. The only downfall I find is that unlike Pull Ups there are no already attached side tabs so there is no wrapping the diaper up tight if your toddler makes a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Ups over Pull Ups","review":"I switched from Huggies Pull-Ups.Pull-Ups has detachable plastic side bands which irritated and scratched my daughter's skin.Easy Ups are softer and seems more comfortable for the skin.My daughter also prefers Easy Ups over Pull Ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is way off","review":"I ordered the 2T/3T which is what my daughter had before.

By far, I have had the most success with the Pampers.The other \\"cheaper\\" brands appear to be more cost effective, but if you do the math, they are the same price as the Pampers brand (if you buy in bulk). Also, as expected, the cheaper ones do not absorb nearly as much urine and I was going through them faster than diapers.The Huggies Pullups were my second choice and I love the velcro sides, but they are more expensive than the Pampers brand.

I also tend to have more petite children, so I have found that the Easy Ups in a size 4 fit better than other disposable training pants. My daughters love the Dora characters on the Easy Ups.The only negative to using an Easy Up is the lack of \\"easy open\\" side fasteners. I don't mind tearing the occasional messy one if needed, and the wet Easy Ups can just be pulled down and off like underwear. I think it is the lack of \\"easy open\\" side fasteners that helps make the Easy Up fit so well.

I wrote to pampers who denied that there was anything different between the 4 and 5, even though I could SEE that there was.

They haven't ripped and they hold a few pees.They don't hold as much as a diaper though. For her early stage of training, I'd love to find a pull-up type of diaper rather than a trainer but these encourage me to be more on top of her training which is good. However for long car trips, diapers are more worry-free. NOT absorbent enough for overnight.My main complaint is that they STINK of perfume.

Only benefit is you do not have to lie your child down to put them on like a diaper, otherwise, they are just a diaper only more bulky. My daughter would see no difference between these and a diaper so she would simply wet in them and continue on. You can't even roll them up in a small ball to dispose like a regular diaper. I used them a few days then switched to regular underwear and old school rubber pants. My daughter is now trained. I bought these despite my gut feeling that they were just a marketing ploy but will not be buying them again when our second baby starts training."},{"rating":"2","title":"no leaks","review":"great, inexpensive diapers that really hold up my crazy kid. very absorbent and she seems to be quite comfortable and at the price you cant beat them"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Easy Ups!","review":"After years of buying Huggies Pull-ups because I thought that a more expensive price meant a better product I decided to try to save some money and order Pampers. My 4 year old son put them on and just raved and raved about how soft they are. I instantly felt guilty for having him wear scratchy Huggies for so long. The difference was very obvious. They work just as well, are softer, and better priced. I've been buying these for more than 2 years now and for 2 kids now. They both love the Dora and Diego (for boys) design and the comfort of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No velcro tabs to hold rolled up dirty diaper together","review":"I am beyond surprised that there are no Velcro tabs to hold the dirty diaper together once you've rolled it up. Throwing away open diapers will make the diaper pail smell even worse than it already does with closed up contained diapers. Would also be a pain if you can't dispose of the diaper immediately or if you're out. I am disappointed because there were a number of things I did really like. My daughter wears 3T and 4T clothes and the 3T-4T size is a perfect fit. They are soft and thick and my daughter loves the Dora print. Unfortunately, the lack of velcro tabs is a deal breaker for me. Back to the Huggies easy ups for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"all around great information","review":"From preparing the soil, to designing the space, to collecting the harvest, and finally to using your herbs, Dorothy Morrison has covered everything. She gave me ideas for planting, composting, and crafting that I had not thought of before. Whether you are a beginning herbalist, like I am, or experienced, I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't find good ideas. I especially liked the fact that the herbal recipes were for cooking, cleaning, crafts, skin care, and other uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"greeting card doggerel","review":"This books mixes the kind of gardening advice you could get from the most superficial coffee-table gardening book, with singsong rhymes the likes of which are found in mainstream greeting cards. Is the author sincere about her status as high priestess, or is she laughing all the way to the bank? We may never know, but if you like bad writing you will get some utility from the book. My favorite part was where she advises putting a small statue of the Goddess into your Goddess garden, because it makes \\"an excellent Goddess symbol\\". (Used copy for sale!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is what I've been looking for!","review":"I cannot state this frankly enough - Dorothy is one AMAZING lady; who has finally written the book I've been looking for. A great, fun read - full of magic, inspiration and education. If the goal is to entertain and inform, she has done it with grace and style - even making me EXTREMELY late for my moving date. I've read quite a few books regarding herbology, magickal herb use and natural home remedies - *nothing* has come close to this. Simply put, I can't wait for my ground to thaw - I've already bought some new herbs and plants for my apartment! Thanks Dorothy for the inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Architects!","review":"Having ordered (and returned) the book i have to say, that this book is not at all a helpful handbook for architects planning in hot and humid climates. The book shows a lot of black&white photographs of buildings all over the world that should not be taken as great contemporary examples for tropical architecture. the book shows briefly and only the very basic principles of designing with climate, that are found better and cheaper in other books. in the last years there has been great new architecture in hot and humid climate that uses basic architectural methods as well as high-tech-installations. there's not one single building in this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, though very technical","review":"Of the many books I have read on the subject, this is the most comprehensive on passive solar design that I have found; an excellent resource for professionals.

Not only is the four man band not representative of the music on the \\"Tanscendental Blues\\" audio disk but it is not representative of the man and his music. At the very least there should have been someone working a sound board to balance the music with the vocals. Earle's music is powerful but if you can't here the lyrics it is a waste of your money and mine. You can't here his wonderful lyrics on many of the cuts on this DVD.One example: The song \\"Copperhead Road\\" on the audio disk --live at the Bluebird Cafe-- with acustic guitars is superior to the version done with the combo on this DVD. I was really looking forward to hearing this song done electrified with his combo. I'm Disappointed. Hope future live DVD will be professionally recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Staring Steve's bald spot and comb-over (the camera angles are very unflattering) Steve and company run through mundane versions of a mundane selection of songs.

Her songs are incredible, lyrically, musically, and spiritually. I recently went through a divorce and can't imagine having gotten through it without this CD and Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". Her lyrics are not as accomplished as those on Dylan's masterpiece, but please construe my faint damnation as praise, and note that Dylan doesn't have her voice.

There's nothing like an acoustic CD to show some raw talent, and she's got it...If I had to compare her to others artists, I would say she's a mix between Bonnie Rait, Allison Krause, Stevie Nicks, and Jewel, based on her sound and style...she reminds me each of these artists on different tracks.My personal faves on this CD are 'Let Him Fly', 'Mad Mission', and 'Poor Man's House'. If you like folk/rock with a touch of blue-grass, then this is the CD for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD I own","review":"There is little more I can add to all the other glowing reviews other than to say that I own over 700 CD's and this is my favorite and has been since the day I bought it.

It's amazing what one woman can do with just her (fabulous) voice and an acoustic guitar. The songs sound remarkably different from one another -- in tempo, melody, theme etc. Not repetitive.

I had the privilege of seeing Patty on the Concert for a Landmine-Free World tour. Despite being on stage with stars like Steve Earle, Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, Bruce Cockburn, and Mary Chapin Carpenter, Patty stole the show. I was completely unfamilair with her before the show, but I came away with 2 reasons to believe I had just heard something special --1) Earle had to follow her in the rotation, and at one point simply reacted to her song with a \\"yikes\\" and 2) my ex-wife hated her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept getting it as a recommendation....","review":"So I finally bought it and found out that on at least one song, she yells! That is not signing. Some of the other songs sound OK, but that yelling song grates on my nerves and is making it hard for me to be objective. Singers shouldn't have to scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This album was a demo and the label liked it so much that they did no work on it. It sounds crude and raw and that is the charm of this album. There is no sense of tinkering or \\"commercializing\\" with this album.

This ablum deserves to be in any collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not well known, but a hidden gem......","review":"Not a clunker song in the bunch....I bought this CD completely on a whim knowing little about the arist or the music on it. I can only say this is a tremendous piece of art, and a songwriter/singer of great talent. Simple, but powerful. A lot of great music can come from nothing but the human voice and guitar. This CD proves it over and over again. For anyone who likes a CD which puts the music first over overproduced studio albums should give this a listen - - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"I've owned this CD for a few years now and it's as magical now as it was then.

Certainly NOT the kind of sardines I'd devour in one sitting...in fact, I had to force myself to come back to the can and finish it so it wouldn't go to waste.As soon as they came, I opened 1 can and ate it. The first thought I had about it was, \\"where's the flavor?\\" and then as I ate more and more of it, buyer's remorse crept in as I knew I couldn't return these and I was stuck with 23 more cans of it.So, I was pretty disappointed with the flavor, or lack thereof and will probably stick to getting the King Oscar kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality of product --great customer service","review":"We have ordered this item before and have been quite pleased.

First of all, I was lucky, and I had no problems and it works very well. And it is well worth the price. The only thing that I wish is that it had a cd rw, but you do pay for what you get and then some. I suggest that if you are going to buy one, you should put out the extra 250 or so dollars and buy the 4 year replacement plan. So if it goes bad you can get a new one.

Changing tubes would take well over an hour - mount, inflate, not seated properly, delfate, remount, inflate, not seated, etc, etc, etc. Once you got it, the ride was fine and the tire was quiet.

The house is on a 50 x 150 lot, pretty typical for a midwestern suburb. I would say that I saw about 2 plans (out of over 200) that could conceivably be placed on such a lot. Almost all of the designs wouldn't fit on a 50 foot wide lot. And those that would typically had the garage facing the long side of the lot with a full 35-40 foot wide house facing the short side of the lot. This would only work on a corner lot, unless you have a back alley, which seems pretty rare these days. So if you're dealing with a typical city/suburb lot, this isn't a good book at all.

Not only does he introduce the reader to an interesting destination, he competently contrasts the place and its people to his own culture. The resulting information has more depth and clarity than a mere travel piece. \\"Looking For Class\\" reads like a novel, with interesting characters and situations, while illuminating the educational systems of two of the world's most prestigious institutions.

It is the most comprehensive treatment of the basic theory of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids that I know of.It contains a lot of interesting material that is not treated in elementary texts and is dispersed in the research literature, and the authors present it in a rigorous but engaging manner. What I value most of the book are the insightful comments and discussions throughout; it gives one a proper perspective and a deepened understanding of the subject. The book is not suitable for a first course in fluid mechanics, but it should be an excellent text for beginning graduate students -- both engineering students who want to learn the mathematics and mathematics students who want to understand the physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Because I am a big fan of previous works from one of the authors, it came as surprise to me how disappointing this new book is. The book contains a lot of material and discussions that are irrelevant to the science of Fluid Mechanics. In many occasions, the clarity of the theoretical expositions is overshadow by lateral discussions that cannot be justified on a book of such basic level. The reader is left wondering if there was agreement and understanding among the authors on the content selected for the book. I read the book and got the feeling that the book contains parts that are original and interesting. The problem is that they never coincide: when they are interesting they are not original - when they are original they are not interesting.

OK, we got the point the first time that she's a working mom. It does not work to pretend the mainstream press is ignoring severe weather changes; and the only ones in the know are the scientists at NSF, who never talk about it directly, just post interesting news stories in the break room so they can complain about it.

FORTY is almost 400 pages long and it takes 180 of mindless, useless, pointless drivel before starting to tell the story. I read and read thinking \\"This is pointless\\", then \\"what is this book about?\\". I reread the brief book discription on the back cover again. Sure enough..pointless drivel! About 240 pages in, my mind is yelling \\"THERE IS NO POINT, STOP READING\\". I thought that it had to get better. It did not. Perhaps the last 60 pages got to the point...sort of. All in all FORTY is mindless and pointless. I don't know if I can read FIFTY now but then again..could it be worse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - too much like real life in DC","review":"Government jobs, NSF jobs, red tape, DC traffic.Gee, if I didn't have a government job and get stuck in DC area traffic it might be news to me. Nothing actually happens and I can't even finish the book. Such a letdown from RED-GREEN-BLUE Mars. Repeat - NOTHING HAPPENS. Boring boring boring. Some things you will find odd though. One guy seems to really want to imbibe his wife's breast milk. Also a character from the west coast (same guy - can't recall) seems oppressed by the amount of trees in the DC area. He longs for the open space of California where everything is brown and dead. Well excuse us for having growing things here.........jeez.I just skipped to the flood at the very end. Still boring.BTW, no one is letting all the animals out of the zoo in case of a flood. What one earth gave the author an idea like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Kim Stanley Robinson may write good books(I wouldn't know, as this is my first go at reading his work), but this is not one of them. The premise is interesting, certainly, but the plot is non-existent. The high point of the novel is a severe rain storm that floods the DC area and it occurs in the last few chapters of the book.I choked down pages and pages of rambling on about how the scientific community chooses which ideas to fund and promote, more pages about how the evolutionary theory informs human behavior and yet more pages about Buddhism in the hopes of finding a point. Something! Sadly, it was not to be found. The most interesting character in the book is a two year old, who-in one of KSR's more startling tangents-may be a reincarnated lama. No, really. I have no idea what that particular idea is doing in this book. Skip this, unless you live for committee meetings and the political sides of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough to deserve a reading","review":"I expected more from KSR in this book. His Mars trilogy book were slow but had a clear theme. In this case, I do not recommend this book.Main reasons for my dissatisfaction are: slow construction of the story, weak characters, dialog not always realistic, non-exciting finale. Many times it seems the book was written to become a blockbuster movie, and I am not sure it would even make a good one.Overall, the story is in the near future, the world is warmer, sea level is rising and scientists are concerned. It really takes a long while in this book to reach a climax, which is not even that. I may read the 2nd part of this series (whenever I have time) and if I see a reason to read this, I will update my review. In the meantime, I suggest you read a Stephen Baxter book instead (if you want good sci-fi)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried really hard to like this book","review":"I love end-of-the-world stories, especially those with a solid scientific foundation. Unfortunately, FDOR is missing a key element of the end-of-the-world series, namely the end of the world. The story is dull, slice-of-everyday-life, too preoccupied with traffic jams and baby minding to really engage the audience.It's also grossly misogynistic. Nearly every female character in the story is introduced through the eyes of a male character admiring her curves. The lead scientist is praised repeatedly by one of the main (male) characters as doing science like a man, as opposed to like a woman, and she's constantly shown throughout the narrative with a pump attached to her breast. Robinson, I appreciate that you included female characters, especially female scientists, as strong female characters are still very much lacking in hard SF. But your treatment of these characters completely undermines the benefit gained by their inclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"very preachy","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed the \\"Mars\\" triology. The character development, the interplay between characters with different viewpoints and differing goals, all set in a sci-fi backdrop.Too bad there isn't any of that here. The entire novel seems to preach about a socially liberal fantasy world. I just can't tell if it is a nightmare or Utopia.In the end I just didn't care about any of the characters or the situations they were in. Even though most of the book, as the first of a trilogy, is given to character development I still couldn't connect with them. Maybe this should be called caricature deveolpment instead.I might check out the second book from the library, but I won't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Politics","review":"Robinson is a good enough writer to keep my attention, but he gets way too heavy handed with his politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on Story, Heavy on Politics","review":"I went from Rice & Salt directly to FSoR. I'd agree with most of what the other lukewarm reviews say.The only thing I would add is that i don't read science fiction to be beaten over the head with a political agenda. The not-so-subtle jabs at what would seem to be conservative beliefs were not offensive to me, but did detract significantly from the story.It is one thing to have some characters believe in a particular political position, it is quite another when every character does. That's not interesting, it's just dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, waste of time, waste of good opening paragraph.","review":"Short and sweet: Interesting premise, well written intro, and the rest was worthless.It could have been a fabulous forray into our \\"there's no such thing as global warming\\" executive office position. It could have been about coping and reversing catastrophic envirmonmental changes. It should have been anything beside the long-winded drivel it was.Definite garbage material. Author, editor, and publisher should all be embarrassed. I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas","review":"Alas, Robinson is an excellent writer, except on those occasions when he lets his sense of self-righteousness run away with him.He can't seem to imagine that anyone could disagree with him unless they were wicked or stupid, and the sock-puppets he's substituted for characters here show the same disagreeable trait.This got old in the \\"Red Mars\\" series, but you could put up with it for the good bits.Here, Stan the Soapbox Man has overwhelmed Kim Stanley Robinson the writer; the good bits become vanishingly scarce.Don't bother. Get one of his older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a balanced perspective","review":"If you are a leftest, who can easily be led to believe that various Republican administrations and Christians are soley responsible for global warming, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for even a modicum of objective scientific perspective on what caused past ice ages, interwoven within an interesting plot, however, don't waste your time, because you will find neither in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a really fun book that raises many very important points. This trilogy mixes reflections on science policy, science and climate change politics and everyday life choices. Driven by the stories of a few characters dealing with their everyday life, this is an absolutely wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages, not enough happens","review":"Reading along in Forty Signs of Rain, I kept having flashbacks to the Niven & Pournelle classic Lucifer's Hammer. It wasn't until I got to the end of Forty Signs that I realized how apt that comparison really was.This was a disappointing book. So many pages for so little to happen, especially when compared to Robinson's Red Mars, where he got us to Mars early on in the first book of the trilogy. We get pretty much nowhere in this book.Niven & Pournelle did all they needed to do in one nice, fat book. I'm not interested enough in where Robinson is going to see if he does a comparable job in three books. Definitely not his best moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my kind of read","review":"Not my kind of genre to read. I had to buy it because I am in a book club. Unless you are in to sci-fi, I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"how much patience am I expected to have?","review":"I consider BOOKS as sacred objects. But I will cast a particular book aside if its author does not grab my attention or my interest (he had it from my opening the book and reading the blurb). I hate to say it, but by page 90 something I just gave up, whatever I was waiting for I stopped waiting for. The author was indulging his need never to throw out pages he's written, at the expense of the book it finally found itself in. Wait for the author to issue a re-write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept","review":"I'm a little disappointed with this book as it is a little technical for pleasure reading. There is a lot that doesn't seem to have much to do with what I perceived as the theme of the book ie global warming. I have about 30 pages left to read, and did buy the second of the series, so am hoping for something a little easier read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemical novels don't have to be this tepidly contrived.","review":"This is a poor excuse for a novel but there's enough that appeals that I read it through to the inconclusive end (which was irritating). Stay-at-home dad and environmental lobbyist in D.C. and his cohorts expose the contradictory functioning of the National Science Foundation and the worse functioning, or lack thereof, of the U.S. political machine on Global Warming. Highly polemical but that's not its problem; writer didn't have a plot or story in mind so much as an expose. Best bits in the book are the visiting buddhists (who just might be poaching a new Pachen Lama) and the dad's relationship with his almost two-year old son. Polemical novels don't have to be this weak. You can have a point without ... being ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photos and gallery.","review":"150 pages, Full color photos throughout the book, good gallery in each chapter. Most items are single piece (except necklaces). Well written with clear instructions but I haven't made anything from this book (just not my style).

That would be the Coen brother's bit in this film. I'm not a fan of theirs, at all, but tried to keep an open mind. I'm done having an open mind about the Coens. It would be hard to pic a favorite story. Each one is so different and almost all of them made me laugh, or at least smile.

After 3 or 4 the cliches start piling on and it's boring. They might as well have filmed this in Kansas City as far as learning about or even simply seeing Paris. Apparently there is absolutely nothing to see or do in Paris It's just like any other nondescript city in the western world, and it's extremely violent and unfriendly. If this is truly Paris I don't want to go there. I love French movies as I am French myself but this one is simply phony. Out of the 20 French movies I have on my shelf this one goes right to the bottom of my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris tu m'ennuies a mourir.

Not to mention how trite and nauseating the politically correct clichés are.I've been to Paris four times and I was expecting this movie to bring back some beautiful memories. Au contraire! It reminded me about the very few things I don't like about Paris.Honestly, even \\"Ratatouille\\" did a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic but pointless, absurd, and disconnected","review":"This movie has a non-linear storyline like Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel; but unlike Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel the stories in \\"Paris, Je T'Amime\\" no connections at all, which makes the film pointless and meaningless, and Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel the stories in those films have a lot connections between the stories, which give the films a purpose.

The version I saw at the cinema shown the two gay men in Gus Van Sant's segment hooking up towards the end of the movie. It was an intimate bedroom scene, very tender.Other than that, Paris Je T'Aime is one hell of a ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I expected this to be about Paris, not about people on the verge of; or, in love.

The various mini-films are directed by, and star, an interesting global cross-section of talent. Steve Buscemi is perfectly cast as the hapless tourist who becomes the victim of a jealous boyfriend, Catalina Sandino Moreno breaks your heart as the young mother who leaves behind her own baby every morning in order to work as a nanny for a wealthy family. The majority of the episodes, set in different neighbourhoods of Paris, succeed on all levels, there are a couple of weak ones, but overall, this meditation on love, in all of its forms, is a real joy to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"What can I say? I've recently developed a slight fascination with France, but this film really turned me off. It is a collection of (very) short films supposedly highlighting the quirks of everyday life in Paris. Each story takes place in a different part of town and I suppose they are intended to show the many faces of the renowned city. Personally, I just thought it was weird. Most of the stories seemed completely inane, and just when I thought something was going to happen, they would end abruptly and move on to the next story. The first few installments were slightly interesting, but they seemed to get worse as the film progressed. As for the content, what can I say? Parisians are strange people. I'd like to think I'm more open-minded than many Americans, but I just couldn't relate with most of these people. Maybe the target audience was those who already know and love Paris, but if they were trying to win over new admirers, they certainly didn't succeed with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Bi-Lingual or Deaf Only","review":"The only english subtitle track is for the deaf, and includes subtitles for the english as well as the french.

The world's most distinguished city represented in 18 vignettes that lack even the semblance of a script. Steve Buscemi could've been assaulted on the DC Metro for all the 'effort\\" that the Coen Brothers put into writing this vignette for the Paris Metro. Bob Hoskins and Ben Gazzara were scripted and acted like zombie extras from \\"Shaun of the Dead\\". Why precisely was Gerard Depardieu talking about crabs on a dinner menu when Ben Gazzara was just having a drink? NO continuity QC?An incoherent, disgraceful mess - worse than Altman's pretentious and equally lazy \\"Pret a Porter\\". Does nothing to eulogize Paris - the acting and the sense of Paris in \\"Ratatouille\\" were far superior - as, in fact, was Remy's acting. Perhaps actors and directors are lulled into a sense that with Paris as a background, there's no need to practice their trade.

The only complaint I have is that since I was working on a laptop, some of the screws are too small to be used by even the smallest screwdriver in this set. That can be easily remedied by a $2 eyeglass repair kit from a local drug store, though. I really liked the yellow tool that allows you to pull small screwdrivers out of their sockets when unscrewed.

He goes down there every chance he gets to forage for food, or chew something, or go trash picking. He's very smart and listens for when someone leaves the room and doesn't close the door. So I bought the Scat Mat, and the extension, hoping a few good zaps would discourage him. He got zapped once, he barked, then added a little howl of dismay. He sniffed it, then backed up, got a running start and nimbly jumped over the mat and the extension mat. He figured it out in about 30seconds. Epic failure.

I removed everything from my desk including the mat. Checked the snap connections on the battery pack (which the feet of the pack did not fit the cutouts on the plastic mat (small yes I know, but for $60 it should come close)). I placed the mat alone on the table with nothing on it. It blinked non stop saying activity. I set the mat on the floor and it was okay for about 2 minutes, when me walking around it set it off, indicating activity.

I thought the mat would deliver a slight uncomfortable static charge- but it does much more. It nearly electrocutes them. And there are no \\"levels\\" - it is just set on HIGH.Also, I thought the mat would assist in training so that I could use it for a week or so and then remove the mat. But pets are not that dumb - they will just avoid the couch when and only when the mat is in place.

It is unreliable under a blanket and worse yet it goes off continuously with it on top of the mat. With it on top of the bed, the dog quickly learned to avoid it. She either hops around it to get to the other half of the bed, or she bears the shocks to get to the other side. There is even drool on the mat so she must be resting her head on the edge!

But I'm so glad I spent the money. This finally did the trick. It really does work wonderfully. Sure, you have to wonder how much it hurts the pet to step on it and get shocked, because I've accidentally sat on it a few times and got a heck of a shock, but pets can jump off the thing a lot quicker than a person can. It's definitely not going to hurt them. It's only powered by a 9-volt battery, after all. And like I say, this thing solved the problem. My cat has never gone near the chair again."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"I have the \\"live\\" scat mat and it works great. Two shocks and the cat seemed learn the lesson.

I had it on high power, and to me it felt like a strong static shock."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Stay Away sprays worked great for a few months, but then one canister after another broke (even with new batteries--they just stopped working). The sprays worked well enough that the cat stayed away from forbidden areas for about a year.Have not had the ScatMats a year yet; will update this review if they stop working. Meanwhile, they certainly do the job. The 48 x 20 does not quite cover the length of a couch but covers the width perfectly. Also covers a kitchen counter perfectly.My cat comes from a family of teensy cats and weighs less than 5 lbs., so I use the lowest setting. She's definitely more fearful of the mats than of the sprays. Giving four stars instead of five because the mat makes me feel guilty and slightly cruel. On the other hand, I continue to use it.The cat now perches on the top (or back) of the couch instead, which is cool with me. If your goal is no cat on the couch at all, one or two strategically placed sprays probably would work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This item eliminated the need for an ugly gate.

I did notice that she lowers her ears when she walks over it, so it she is getting a charge, but Jack's can be determined dogs. I just ordered a large mat, to use on another doorway.

She always figures out a way to get to it. So when we heard of the ScatMat, we bought it immediately. It didn't work. Day after day, we left home with the mat set on high and every night, the garbage was strewn everywhere. A few times, we even caught our dog standing on it. We do have cats and it does work on them. One step and they're running in the opposite direction.

But no more since using the PetSafe ScatMat training strip on my counters for a couple of weeks. I purchased the extension, and velcroed both to my counter in one 8 foot strip, so that the cats could not avoid making contact by going around it. I witnessed a couple of cat contacts with the strip, and then quickly saw that behavior dissappear, with no harm to the cats. Next the older male took to sleeping on my dining room table, moved the strip there, and within a couple of days, that behavior has stopped as well. Highly recommended for cat training when using other behavior modification has failed. And the best thing is you don't even have to be there to witness the behavior, the strip does all the work, and the animal does not associate the delivery of the mild shock with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Own two labs that can challenge any type of barricade or gate, this works to keep the, confined and can be moved anywhere in the house.

I could have saved thousands of dollars worth of furniture if I got this produce sooner. The cats respect the mat and know exactly where it is but it did not hurt or traumatize them because they will lay right next to it. The cats also know as soon as it is not on the furniture. After a contact or 2 the mat will do the job even when not turned on. Well worth the cost"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mild, HUMANE reminder to our cats!","review":"I don't believe that the Scat Mat is inhumane at all. We set it on low and touched it ourselves, and barely felt a thing. Medium is only slightly more noticeable. It's just enough of a \\"surprise\\" when the cat steps on it to get their attention. It doesn't actually hurt a bit. It does keep them off of the kitchen counters (where they could potentially get badly hurt) or from running out the front door (where they could get killed). Having unsuccessfully tried every other trick in the book, these mats turned out to be the perfect solution.The only down side is if they can see the mat, you have to leave it in place forever or they will know when it's gone and it's safe to jump up on the counter again. :) So hide it as best you can so they can't tell whether it's there until they hit it.I do have to say, they are a bit overpriced!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"We were hoping to use this mat to train our two dogs to stay off our new leather couches. It does not shock them or beep at them. Our 55 lb dog just sat there and hung out and the mat just sat there too. Our other dog didn't set it off either. I even put magazines under it thinking that would help create pressure by being on a harder surface. It didn't work. It didn't even work on our hard wood floor with the dog sitting on it. If you push your hand up to it it goes though. So basically, in order to train our dogs through shocking, we also have to get shocked. This product is being returned tomorrow. It doesn't work at all.

The mat has three setting, Low, Medium and High. The first time he jumped up and landed on the mat(I used the low setting)he went up in the air and re-landed on the mat with all four paws. He did not go into the kitchen for a day and we bribbed him with treats at that. He stood and staired at the counter but did not jump back up. The mat has a mild shock on low and we have leaned on it ourselves and gotten shocked but it is enough for him not to jump up again on it. It takes some time to break the habit,and I have other counters still to do. But it works great. The only down side it when leaving on the counters everytime you need to use the counter you have to turn off the mat and move it.

It gives out a small shock, sort of like the static shock you can get from dragging your feet across a carpet. It has 3 \\"levels\\", Low, Med, and Hi, but we haven't had to turn it on higher than \\"low\\". It is VERY effective, and I don't think any of my cats have been \\"stung\\" more than once each. (My children, on the other hand, enjoy getting a little shock, and will play with the mat.) I know it is not hurting the cats in any way, but it sure does surprise them! The only problem I have is that it is pretty expensive and to really train them out of their naughty behavior, we need more than one mat. The cats have gotten very good at determining where I have placed the mat, so they just avoid that area and get up onto a \\"mat-free\\" area.

This product is the only solution I have found to protect my car and is well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"First of all this product is very expensive for what you get. Also, it discharges itself constantly even if it isn't in contact with anything. Just holding the unit by the battery pack up in the air and I can hear it discharging. That means that it will shock the pet, but the pet has to be touching it when it goes off and the recharge cycle is maybe 10 seconds as opposed to it just going off when the pet touches it. I'm very surprised that someone can't come up with a better implementation of this type of product because as a dog owner with a dog that can actually open a completely shut metal trash can it would be very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 75 pound Golden must have thought it was a joke.","review":"I bought the 3\\" by 46\\" to try to keep my Golden from jumping up on the counter to try to get food.

The first time she put her paws on it, it didn't tone...and I assume it didn't Stimulate either because she kept her paws up on the counter for a good 10 seconds. I guess her paws did not span the two wires that give the shock, even though the wires are only 1 1/8\\" apart. I know the unit was working because I tested it after she got off, and I got a nice surprise.

It had a smaller sized controller and it allowed you the option of emitting a loud beep either along with shock or on it's own. I've found that the sound alone has been enough to deter my cats from touching the mat and sends them scurrying. And if that didn't work, I had the option to turn on shock mode. So it's a step in the wrong direction by this manufacturer IMO. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"The ScatMat worked the first time I used it.

My cat just stood there, looking at me with a \\"What?\\" expression as I stared at him with my mouth open. In other words, it was shocking him but he just stood there. Thinking it was a fluke, I set it up anyway. Many days went by and nothing. I rearranged its position so it would be mostly hidden. My dog isn't exactly an idiot as she knew something was up there so she wasn't taking the bait. I came home one day to find fur and drool marks on the mat, which means like my cat, it did absolutely nothing to deter her from jumping on the couch. I gave up and returned it.

But I was shocked to see my new watch stop working in 5 weeks time. However amazon gave me a refund of the money. It is definitely worth the price if it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"I GOT EVEN THE REPLACEMENT BUT EVEN THAT DOES NOT WORKI HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND SOFAR.WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch didn't work","review":"We ended up returning this beautiful watch because it didn't work. We took it to a battery store to see if it needed a new battery and the manager said, \\"Oh, a Skagen watch. I won't dare touch it because they open in a special way and I could scratch it.\\" So rather than risk scratching it and finding out that it wasn't a battery problem but that it was defective, discouraged us from pursuing this matter further and so we simply returned it. I don't think I would order another Skagen watch again. We did return it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received a non-functioning watch","review":"Received a non-functioning watch. I lost my $10 gift certificate, since when i returned the watch, amazon only returned the actual amount i paid. The only thing i received is disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"This video is only for the basic beginner. If you have heard of After Effects, then don't even think about buying this. You already know more than this video can offer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No statistical logic behind this book","review":"I bought this book because it was published so recently, and I was disappointed. The only good thing about this book was the section on Internet casinos, and the card counting drills listed in one chapter. This rest of this book is filled with superstitions and assumptions and betting progressions that have no mathematical proof whatsoever, and pretty much that the game cannot be beaten unless you buy his system that he sells. If you are a beginner, this book wont hurt you, but I would reccomend buying a book from a real blackjack author who doesn't have a system that they are trying to sell you throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you Jerry Patterson for the above bullsh review.","review":"At one time, years ago, Jerry Patterson was a respected author and purveyer of legitimate information on Blackjack. Unfortunately, he now hawks a worthless BJ scam based on groundless \\"theories\\" of voodoo Blackjack known as TARGET. Don't waste your time. Get the real stuff from respected authors such as Bryce Carlson, Don Schlesinger, Stanford Wong and Ken Uston."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are too lazy to help yourself, well...","review":"...no book will be good enough for ya. If you are ready to be guided with love and humor into exploring yourself in useful ways, GET THIS BOOK and GET TO WORK! You'll love it! Practical ways to get to the answers inside us, the Big Ones such as what do we really want in this lifetime? What must be given up so you can move forward (it's different for everyone.) It is a practical step-by-step, \\"keep you from fooling yourself\\" kind of guide.And did I mention it is fun?Consider also, \\"You Can't Afford The Luxury of a Negative Thought\\"...a book that has helped my husband (among many others) tackle his depression sans pharmaceuticals (after 48 years of major struggle) AND become an active participant in his own life! He is happier than he has ever been in his life, and that makes my world a lot better, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is NOT Your Father's Celtic Music!!!","review":"It rocks!!! It probably belongs more at the X-Games that your local pub (actually they love it at my Irish pub).The music ranges from a jazzy piano opening on 'Wing-Stock' to speed-Celtic on 'Devil in the Kitchen' (you'll know what I mean when you hear it).I heard an MP3 of 'Wing-Stock' and it absolutely blew me away. I ordered the CD right away and was ecstatic about the rest of it. It is a must buy regardless if you are looking for alternative, rock or Celtic.If you buy this and like it check out Brigid Boden too. She is another alternative Celtic artist. If you know of any other artists playing this type of alternative/rock with a Celtic twist, please let me know!One note of caution: Ashley's other albums are nothing like this one. They are traditional Celtic Jigs and Reels. Don't get carried away and order his whole discography until you have sampled them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, if you can't see him in concert . . .","review":". . . you still have to buy the CD! The full Ashley experience can only be had live, but this is the next best thing. When he revs his fiddle up to a fevered pitch, just imagine a whole lot of stompin' going on. Mr. MacIsaac learnt his fiddle playin' from the King of the Faeries, and the energy in this album proves it! Here you have the hit single, \\"Sleepy Maggie,\\" sung in Galic but all about \\"sex and dancin'.\\" And there's \\"The Devil in the Kitchen,\\" a no holds barred, take no prisoners, gritty, grungy Fiddle Fest. In the middle of the album, the humor of \\"What An Idiot He Is\\" sneaks up on you; it's one of the funniest, wittiest songs I've ever heard. Point is: the album's all good. You've moshed, you've banged your head. Now learn how to stomp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not traditional, but really good","review":"I love traditional Irish music and had never heard of Ashley MacIsaac but learned about him from a Canadian friend. This is a great CD - he is a wonderful fiddler and there is a lot of humor in the songs. It's not very traditional, but I tend to like cross over stuff and found it creative and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and Diverse","review":"An article in The New Yorker prompted me to order this from Amazon.com (I had never heard of him before), and it was one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.MacIsaac backs up a tremendous fiddle with piano, spoons, drums, rock guitar, whatever, for a truly original and diverse sound. I even liked the vocals he offers on a few tracks -- hoarse and slightly off-key but captivating. And he changes pace throughout the CD, following a quiet fiddle or piano instrumental with a real rocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKE CELTIC AND FIDDLE THIS IS IT..........","review":"I CAME ACROSS THIS CD QUITE BY CHANCE....I HADN'T REALLY CONSIDERED GAELIC ROCK AS A POSSIBILY AS AN OUTLET FOR MY GAELIC ROOTS.....NOW IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND AFTER HAVING SEEN ASHLEY SET HIS FIDDLE AFIRE LIVE AT THE FOX THEATRE IN BOULDER, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE HIM STEP OUT ONCE AGAIN FROM TRADITIONAL MUSIC AND SET THE STAGE ALIGHT WITH PROGRESSIVE STYLE.........AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW HE IS TODAY......."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hi How are You Today\\" is excitingly original and unique.","review":"... It's true that traditional Celtic/Anglo songs have been combined with rock before, but MacIsaac brings to his music elements of jazz, with exciting harmonies and progressions. Truly original, creative, artistic, avant garde!!! Plus he's the probably the best fiddler in history, certainly the fastest. Don't miss tracks 8-12, equally as good as 1-6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"This is a wonderful book for any believer or non-believer of reincarnation. If you believe in it, this book will fill you with warmth and some healing from any lost loved one. On the other hand if you don't believe, it gives many many examples of stories that are hard to dismiss but would be interesting to discuss. It is a wonderful book for anyone interested in expanding ideas on the subject of reincarnation or just the curious mind looking for an interesting easy read. This was the first book I have read by Carol Bowman but will certainly look into any others based on how much I enjoyed this one! It will no doubt encourage you to listen more intently to all those little things kids say as they start talking and beyond..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Thought Provoking","review":"WOW!!! \\"Return From Heaven\\" is a beautifully written, thought provoking read re: cases suggestive of reincarnation within the family unit - in other words, grandparents coming back as their grandchildren's children, mothers coming back as their daughters/sons children, and children who died young coming back to be the subsequent children of the same parents.Although I've never experienced this personally (to my knowledge anyway), the personal stories shared within these pages, and the things we can learn from such experiences, really resonated with me. And, there is plenty of \\"scientific\\" evidence to back up the idea of reincarnation - with much of the research being done by Ian Stevenson (whose work is discussed in \\"Return From Heaven\\").Overall, I found this book to be a very interesting, eye-opening look at the possibilities of reincarnation - so, if you are at all interested in this topic, I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best on the topic","review":"I ordered 5 books from Amazon on this topic. This one was by far the best. Some of the others got really boring really fast, but this book had me captivated from start to finish. It certainly was a very comforting book to read. Since I got it over a year ago, it has not been in my house because everyone I know wants to borrow it! I hope to get it back soon to re-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not differentiated...","review":"You will hardly differentiate this album from many others sounding alike. Check Dan Siegel's Inside Out - same tunes, same tempo, same lack of feelings. It is like chewing a piece of gum that has no taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit more discription needed","review":"Delvery was faster than expected. Packaging was neat and enough. But there was no description of what a kind of the SCSI connector outside of the box the item packaged. The photo of the connector on the box was not clear enough to distinguish the type of SCSIs. Of course, it was the right one. But I want a clear description on the outiside of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple solution for SCSI adapter with VHDCI connections","review":"I needed to connect two external SCSI drive sets using two HD68 cables to a SCSI card that has two VHDCI external connectors. Using a VHDCI to HD68 adapter would only allow 1 connection because the spacing on the card didn't allow two adapters. Since my SCSI card has SCSI-3 68F internal connectors I connected one of them to this adapter bracket using an internal ribbon cable. This gave me the second external HD68 connection that I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels So Bland","review":"Chuck Mangione does play a pleasant trumpet.And the songs on this collectiona re reasonably soothing as background music. However, in Chuck's form of Jazz, there is very little pizazz. Like lets say Herb Alpert per se. Occasionally Chuck adds an inflection in his trumpet playing style but for the most part he toots along quite softly.The songs are kind of bland with a few interesting melodies but nothing that grabs and shakes you. The band of musicians on this compilation rarely distinguish themselves. A good guitar solo on Feels So Good and a few slick arrangements on Fun And Games and Belavia. Otherwise, the band just does not break out into anything special.All in all, I'll pass on this compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid disc","review":"i have always enjoyed chuck Mangione's music.feel so good is timeless.this is a solid collection of his greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"Why would anyone spend $8.99 plus $5.50 minimum shipping for nuts without knowing the quantity to be supplied? One wonders if it is 6 oz, 9 oz perhaps 15 oz (fast becoming the \\"supermarket pound\\") or even 16 oz. But the scant information supplied does not tell the interested buyer this crucial fact. I suppose we are expected not to care about such details.PS: They did not offer the option of \\"no stars.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking and easy install","review":"Item arrived quickly yet unexpectedly, since there was no tracking info. Heavy duty, basic instructions that make sense once you lift it up to the Jeep to mark holes for drilling. I haven't inserted the back side bolt on either side yet - might just use some silicone on them to make them look like they're installed. Those seem like more work than their worth. I love them - look great and very tough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original","review":"As noted by some of the other reviews, this book is basically a copy of \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and \\"Crimson Tide\\". It was pretty well written, but the fact that it was so unoriginal made it hard for me to enjoy it. I could almost tell where the book was going because I read \\"Hunt\\" and saw \\"Tide\\". I read this on a plane to Rome, so I was pretty much stuck with it, but given a choice, I would have stopped reading it and grabbed something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old","review":"As a first submarine novel, you might enjoy it provided you haven't read anything else yet on submarines.Otherwise its a hotch potch of crimson tide and Hunt for red october which are far superior books.I just finished reading it. Well written but seriously lacks originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a creative, original idea for a book!","review":"NOT. Have you read \\"The Hunt for Red October\\"? Have you seen \\"Crimson Tide\\"? If so, then it won't take you long to see exactly where the story for Robin White's \\"Typhoon\\" came from. Mix equal parts \\"Red October\\" and \\"Crimson Tide\\" and you end up with this book. The book is well-executed, but it's just impossible to get past White's wholesale theft of ideas and concepts from other \\"submarine\\" books and movies. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As a career US Navy Submariner, I found it difficult to stomach this book. Although the author has obviously researched submarine operations and gives the impression he has actually set foot on a US Navy sub, he really doesn't appear to understand submarines or the people who operate them. The characters are unrealistic. The author's descriptions of submarine operations are comically unbelievable. Save your money. Or better yet, buy \\"Hunt for Red October\\". It may be several years old, but it is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing but unoriginal plot","review":"I would agree with all those who write that the writing is good but the plot is unoriginal. I'd say, however, that it's a cross between \\"Hunt for Red October\\" and \\"The Caine Mutiny,\\" but it just isn't as good as those. If the plot had been less predictable and more original, I would have been able to give the book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"Another great book by Robin White. Having spent 6 years on subs and operating in the same areas as the book, it was interesting to see how acurately the author dwelt with what might happen. The idea that a sub skipper might not be able to handle anything that comes up is scary. The plot, I thought, was captivating throughout. Having a women crewmember and the problems it created makes one wonder what the navy is doing in anticipation of when women are onboard subs. There were lots of technical details that I found interesting, but even for someone who doesn't know anything about submarines, this is a good reading book with lots of adventure and it will keep your interest to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The book accomplishes its goal amazingly well with clear graphics, lucid text, and wonderful accuracy . Easily the best in its field, the book gives you a profound understanding and knowledge of the european wars. The chapters are well written and up-to-date. The bibliographies are clearly stated to give the reader further information on a given topic. This is history of war at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read since Bryce Courtenay's \\"Power of One\\"","review":"If you are tired of the mundane and looking for fresh and stimulating reading, then this is the one!From past and present day Australia to a Europeanmystery set against WW2, the story within a storywill keep you entertained and spell bound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who'daThunk?","review":"At the western border of southernmost Oregon and northernmost California, between Mount Shasta andthe Pacific Ocean, lies the Klamath Knot -- a \\"knot\\" being what geologists call a nightmare.For starters, the whole topography is upside down, as driven by plate tectonics.For teasers, the author convincingly portrays the Klamath Knot asthe most natural habitat of \\"giants.\\" Yes, Bigfoot.Thoreau himself could not have woven the Knot more authoritatively ormore poetically than Wallace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study of 1-2 Peter","review":"We are using this book in our ladies' Bible study at church.
