I was a little concerned at first that there were too many ads, but the content was interesting, and the photography is beautiful.I believe that I will end up reading pretty much the entire magazine -- not flip through and put it aside. It will take several issues before I know whether I would pay full price for a subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that great for the home cook.","review":"I enjoy cooking a hobby, and I love using the freshest produce, fish, cheese and meats in my region.

He is a former Gourmet subscriber who had that mag for almost 5 years. Saveur is an honest, earthy, lush magazine that will enlighten you about other cultures and help you to enjoy their cuisine. It is not chock full of ads like some other cooking mags. The writing is excellent and the recipes are such that you can actually cook them. The food is covered with an emphasis on authenticity and respect. If you love the unpretentious food of the world--the food of love-- you will love Saveur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life","review":"Cooking is life , life is Saveur. If you love to cook and eat the food of the world Saveur will inspire you to do both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied with Amazon's Renewal Process","review":"I was blindsided with Amazon's automatic renewal of Saveur Magazine. I did not sign up for the automatic renewal and was notified after the fact. I enjoy the magazine (no issues with Saveur) but usually find better subscription renewals offered by other sites. This was no exception. The automatic renewal for $19.95 is 65% greater than competing offers at $12.00 for 9 issues. I have e-mailed Amazon to cancel the order several times but have yet to receive a response. I like to monitor all my purchases and avoid automatic renewals or bill pay's as a personal preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good content, classy presentation!","review":"If everyone interested in cooking were to read this, France would probably disappear from the map as *the* \\"haute cuisine\\" destination. ;-)Seriously, this is good stuff, with reviews, in depth articles, tips, where to buy this or that (including websites - very useful when you don't leave in NY or SF!)It also doesn't concerns itself only with super complicated stuff. In fact, my favorite article was about cast iron skillets.The pictures are great too, and the magazine is nice enough to be proudly displayed on your bookshelves.This is fun to read and useful - highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic magazine with excellent photography and stories","review":"To me, Saveur is almost more about travel than it is about food. The articles tend to be about cuisines set in the context of their geographic and cultural origins. Rich photography and personal stories give you a flavor of the people and places behind familiar and new dishes. Articles in Saveur have inspired me to take several trips, to places I would not have otherwise considered, and seek out amazing little hole in the wall shops and restaurants.If you love to travel, cook, and eat, you will love Saveur!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Cooking. Magazine. Ever.","review":"I've tried most of the other cooking magazines, and I retain affection for all of them, but this is my fave. The articles aren't just about cooking - they mesh food with its sources, embed recipes in their cultural context, and feature tools from the sublime to the humble. They have a good section on hard-to-find ingredients, an issue every year on everyone's 100 favorite cooking things (from egg slicers to four star restaurants), and lists of cooking events.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultural Cooking","review":"I enjoy this magazine because of the articles about families and their traditions. Some recent offerings were an article about a family who canned tomatoes for friends and family, and a heartwarming history of Thanksgiving for a family in California who combined foods of India with traditional American foods. What other magazines would have such articles? I study the sociology of food. How what we eat affects and is affected by our environment, religion, income, etc. The articles in Saveur invite you in and then delight, exceeding your expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Intermezzo instead.","review":"I subscribe to several magazines--Bon Appetit, (ex-Gourmet), Intermezzo and Saveur. Saveur is lovely but there is a disconnect in its new direction---it used to be lovely and sophisticated (almost too sophisticated), now trying to be more hip and geared toward quick weeknight meals (like on their website), which is what I want from Bon Appetit, not Saveur! I like the simple yet sophisticated recipes in Intermezzo best, plus their travel and wine features are better than anyone else's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Fantasy","review":"This is the first book of a wonderful, undeservedly obscure fantasy trilogy.

The characters, especially Vilkas and Marik, are fleshed out and grow to surprising depth.The ending does wrap up the loose ends nicely, both for this novel and the entire series, but does have a bit of the dues ex machina feel leftover from Song in the Silence. Surprisingly, the Demonlord and Berys become some of the most interesting and fun to read characters in this final book.Definitely a easier book to fall into and more enjoyable to re-read than The Lesser Kindred, but still a few marks shy of the quality of Song in the Silence. Still, this book will have you pickign it up time and again, if only to satisfy that burning curiosity the first two volumes left us with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to an enjoyable series","review":"This third book was quite enjoyable, I believe it was my favorite of the three. The one thing I didn't like about these books was the way Kerner describes the love between Akor (Varien) and Lanen. It was just a bit too much for me. Luckily I can see past that and enjoy the excellent story that is taking place. I enjoyed the ending of this book, though it did leave a little left to ponder. What is the purpose of Varien/Akor's new ability? Perhaps Kerner will revisit this story in the future.

The story sounds boy-meets-girl, flick chick storyline. But the review I read stated \\"For instance, when Jason suggests that they make their relationship more intimate, she demurs. For her sex is an important step, indicating that marriage is on the horizon.\\" Sorry, but that isn't Biblical. Sex isn't for \\"indicating marriage is on the horizon.\\" So my beef is really with the review at this point. How sad to think people have so gotten away from the Word of God and bought into the world's thinking that sex is a preview of marriage--which is sin.

It seems to me that in the last ten years, most manufacturers want you to have to replacement everything every time, not just the blade -- more money for them and more hassle for consumers and more waste.I wasn't quite sure which little adapter piece to use, but I chose one that seemed to work. I installed it, but the blade didn't touch the window on the far ends. It would wipe in the middle, but would miss large strips on the ends.

After less than a year however, a rubber residue begins to deposit on my Jeep's windshield. At first I thought the residue was due to my pitted original windshield but after having it recently replaced, the pitting continues.I've recently ordered the PIAA Silicone wipers to see if they're any better. Considering they're more expensive than the Bosch and have rave reviews on Amazon, I'm hoping they will live up to their ratings. I've typically had great experience with Bosch products (spark plugs, fuel pumps, even home appliances) but this just isn't one of those items.NorCalRoots"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't fit no matter how hard I hit!","review":"The blade looked wonderful - all shiny and new - and then I tried to put it on the car!This POS is best avoided!

This time they only lasted a couple of months before they started to streak. Looks like Bosch quality has taken a serious nose dive.

IT DOES NOT WORK!","review":"You would like to think designing a windshield wiper blade would be a piece of cake. Right? It's a plastic squeegy attached to the windshield. Not with this product. It is not designed to actually clean water off the windshield. The entire end of the blade (about 4 inches) does not even come close to contacting the window. i think Bosch misses the point of a windshield WIPER. It must actually come into contact with the window to work. I bought one with the problem. I then exchanged it for the same kind thinking the first was bent or something. Nope, same problem. Being that Bosch could not execute on this simple design, I went with another company. Now a can see out my window, no thanks to Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I agree with the previous review.

However, none of the 3 plastic adapters that come with the blade will fit on the end of the ~9mm wide hook style arm. I talked to Bosch and they suggested a 40810 Hindsight blade.

Think back to her first appearance in Season 4 with David Tennant in the Silence of the Library. It was so well done--fascinating and portrayed as a character with a lot of interest and class.

The author thinks you memorize everything in the previous chapters, and doesn't even show you how they got to certain points of a problem. I had to spend half an hour putting in different numbers and formulas in my calculator to get the exact answer as the one in the book, because the examples are not detailed enough. As for the exercises, the first few are exactly like the examples in the previous pages, but as you get to problem 60 or above, NONE of it was taught in the chapter.

It thus discourages readers from getting safe and effective help from real healthcare professionals.I believe this shows an utter lack of ethics on the part of the author.Readers would be better served by reading a history of medical science (e.g.The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine) or an introduction to critical thinking (e.g.The Power of Critical Thinking: Effective Reasoning About Ordinary and Extraordinary Claims)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Yeast Connection","review":"This book should have been thrown in the garbage not sold.

The rainfly pretty much prevented the rain from dripping directly onto the tent and thats it. I woke up in the morning to find that anything that was touching the side of my tent was soaked from condensation. And yes, i did have both of the doors open. 40mph winds did also roll through and the tent held up nicely. It was kinda scary, but nothing broke or ripped.

The writing is amazing and the historical details vivid -- but the main character is the most stupid, shallow, insipid creature I have ever come across. She leaves her faith and her people because she has fallen in love with a Christian prince. The main reason for her love seems to be that said prince has blue eyes and good legs. She loses her virginity to him after seeing him about three times, and then is shocked when he leaves her. The other characters are all stereotypes -- narrow-minded rabbis and priests, spirited, beautiful young women, and domineering wives. The latter two types of character persist despite the author's view that everyone in Renaissance Italy hated women and was comitted to subjugating them. This book IS a fast-paced page-turner, so it makes a wonderful read as long as you don't need any characters to identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Historical fiction meets romance.

The writing is too scientific and precise, and the use of Italian words for common words like \\"family\\" and \\"lady\\" is plain obnoxious.

Alas, the author has no knowledge of the matter she is writing about.

I didn't expect to be all that into the book, though, because I didn't think I would be interested in a story that took place so long ago. This book proved me very wrong. Not only was captivated by the main character, Grazia, but i also would like to think that I absorbed some of the historical information and learned much about Renaissance Italy and events in that time. The book brought history alive for me in the days that I was reading it. Ms. Park should be thanked for doing such excellent research and presenting us with such a wonderful gift of literature.

Although I am descended, on my mother's side, from the heroine/villainess of 'Grazia' I have to say I would have found it interesting anyway. It is a fun book.

I think this movie was suppose to be a psychological thriller/horror, but it came off more as just psychopathic. The characters spoke like salty sailors and the movie was loaded with f- and s- cussing. This was supposed to be a dinner party with a central character they all cared deeply for during Christmas time, but they cast aside all their civility at the drop of a pin.

Possibly because I didn't feel lost like so many others I've read, or it may be just the way these tie in at the end.

The iron works great for dry ironing, and I love the auto-lift. However, the steam setting does not work too well. Most of the time the steam won't come out unless I actually press the little steam button. I thought it might be confused with the Auto-lift so I tried it as a regular stand-up iron and it worked a little better, but I didn't buy the iron to use it like a regular iron.

It just tries to depict the Japanese in China using Chinese actors. Gross but doesn't really inform or advance comprehension like a home invading Michael Myers picarism.BUT there is a gem in this film and that is the cameo of one John Rabe who in front of the American representative, George Fitcher, handed the Japanese army the excuse to invade the refugee camp in the international section that the Japanese had agreed to leave alone by ADDING that there HAPPENED to be some disarmed Chinese soldiers in the camp and that he HOPED that the Japanese would respect humanitarianism.There is NO such thing as a GOOD Nazi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Sun - The Nanjing Massacre","review":"Acting and production is generally poor but the subject matter and 'real' footage is compelling and should never be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"How can I describe this dreck?

Everything I tried, the bulbs would keep blowing after a few hours. I noticed that the ceramic insulation on the bulbs would usually deteriate and crack off.

Other than that though, this CD excellently represents the range of this amazing and unique band that sounds like no one else, yet recognizably carries a tradmark sound. Songs like \\"Stone\\" are not just good enough for radio, they're better, and sound like what radio would play if it were more diverse and less corporate. Does anyone know what's up with this \\"Guadelupe\\" album Amazon is listing? I'm not familiar with that CD. Can hard-core Adamanians enlighten me?

The double shutoff connections that they've added will make cleaning it so much easier. 19 years ago, they didn't have these, but I may buy some extras.

The overall build of the filter does seem a little flimsy, I'm sure if your not careless with disassembly and assembly this filter could last a long time. Would rather they had separate baskets for the different media, this would make it easier to change out specific media if you needed to. The ball valves and quick disconnects work great, but they do trap a small but of water in between them so have something to catch it or use a rag. The filter is pretty darn quiet itself (The pump), and depending on how you set up the discharge it can be louder or quieter ( The water noise not the pump). The discharge doesn't add a lot of flow overall but it does stir up the water on the surface. Be careful when you cut your tygon tubing, measure twice cut once or you may be unhappy with the lengths. Everything seems leak tight as long as you don't overtighten anything and cut the O-rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low output with an in-line heater or CO2 Diffuser","review":"There is no reason to buy this filter over the 2213EHEIM Classic 250 External Canister Filter ? 2213.

Also the 2213 has a canister inside which makes removing/changing media so much easier. Pricewise they are about the same and it is absolutely worth it since the larger output makes a huge difference in the flow.

I unpacked the second unit and everything looked good until I unclamped the head unit. The piece of plastic that holds one of the four clips was broken. It seems to me that the plastic used to make this unit is easily breakable. All in all I can't comment on the performance of the unit, but as far as overall quality goes I wasn't impressed.

It will only turn over the water in a 55 gallon tank 5 times in an hr. The minimum in a saltwater aquarium is 6 times per hour. Not sure how anyone came up with that 92 gallon number. I am very disappointed at the low flow rate. Very little pressure coming out of the flow nozzles at all. Is barely moving the water at one end of the 55 gallon tank that I have. Only buy this filter if you have a smaller tank. The verbage on top of the item description page is false. Also, the instructions are mostly in German.

Overall, I would say, save a bit longer, buy the more expensive model and save yourself the aggravation and ultimate disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Filter","review":"I found this product to be defective upon opening the box. The tabs on the top of the canister used to clamp the lid on were broken on arrival. Frankly, they are far too small and flimsy to withstand such a high presure environment and moving water. Eheim should have designed this differently, so I just asked for a refund instead of a replacement. This would have been my third filter, but I've found my first one, a Fluval 303, to be the most rugged and reliable. Construction has gone downhill in the filter world and that is unacceptable. My advice: don't buy any fish filter without examining it hands on first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eheim=LEAKS","review":"This long time Eheim fan has thrown in the wet towel! After too many leaks to count and customer service that won't sell you a one dollar o-ring to fix a 30 dollar assembly (or even tell you the specification of that o-ring) it's my opinion that Eheim has lost their pride.

As soon as it gets interesting, the authors move on to the next factlet. This may be fun for \\"Hey, did you know that...\\" type of conversations, but as soon as someone wants more information, you're out of this book's depth. After a while, it gets frustrating to read - in fact, it's the only book of this type I had to force myself to finish. Plus, the authors' adherence to an apparent 5th grade reading level, with no order or clear chronology even within each entry, makes it even more annoying.If you want an outline of interesting tidbits, or if you're not yet in high school, you may enjoy this book (in fact, it wouldn't be a bad gift for some little inventor you may know, up to about age 13). But if you want depth, insight, and a touch of adult-level irreverance and humor, go elsewhere (personally, I'm a BIG fan of Cecil Adams)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Fun","review":"Forget what some negative reviewer wrote; this book is fast, fun and full of interesting factoids.

I didn't find that amusing at all, I hate that dude! I just wanted him to shut up and show the bands playing. Then it finally shows Nirvana and through every song the camera jumps around and it flashes to other stupid stuff so you don't see much of the band and what they do show is not the best of any of the bands. It's very unfortunate because it could have been a good video if they would have just filmed the bands playing and left out some of the other stuff.

There is a classic bathroom scene with Thurston Moore that is one of the highlights of this documentary. The most interesting thing about this film is seeing Nirvana before the explosion of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". It's hard to believe that at one time they were just three guys who were opening for Sonic Youth. Dinosaur Jr. plays a few legs of the tour and J. Mascis contributes to the humor of the film.

The second hand started skipping in two-second intervals (indicating a low charge) and shaking the watch back and forth as recommended in the instructions only keeps it working normally for a few hours.

We're reading the book, good chance we know from the beginning! I honestly couldn't finish it. I was so disappointed. I felt as though the publisher gave Christina a deadline and she just threw something together. In all fairness, I couldn't write even a bit of what she did, so I shouldn't complain.

Summer and Gabe are a splendid couple with their own little quirks and complications. Gabe, the hard Navy Seal, and Summer, the cold FBI agent, make an interesting match. I never really enjoyed books with combat talk and situations, but this one just reeled me in. From Gabe and Summer's first steamy encounter all the way to the shocking ending, I was riveted.

So I searched for some kind of detector to tell me if what I occasionally see is lice or just a dirt. I found this product and thought as the name says, Lice Detector. I immediately purchased it, but it came out to be just a lice comb. it vibrates while you comb the hair to kill the lice, but I'm not sure if the lice die because of the vibration or because you'll comb it out anyway. THIS IS NOT A DETECTOR as they say but a comb.

We have been treating our hair for months and finally got this. It did not detect any lice. I used it for hours on my hair and my daughters hair, too. Our heads were still itching.

This comb catches nothing. I have no idea if it actually zaps anything, but the little teeth on it don't pick anything up. Regular cheap metal combs do way more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Because my hair is baby fine and long, my infestation was hard to manage. Lice combs I had didn't get the nits so I tried this hoping I could get a head of at least part of the problem. I received extensive electrical burns to my scalp from the comb going off so often. Generally, the pain is tolerable but when the comb keeps going off in the same spots, your electricuting the same spot over and over, it hurts!!! My hair snagged on it a lot! I had relentless static hair from the comb drying my hair out. Other people have said its best to use as a detecting device. A possible different way is to use the robi comb then switch to the regular lice comb. Keep repeating the switching."},{"rating":"1","title":"RobiComb","review":"The first time I used it, it worked for less than a minute. After that, it would not even hum.

I saw this on the shelf and said, \\"let's give it a try!\\" and I couldn't believe how fabulous it was! I immediately called the school nurse to tell her, and she was glad to hear that they were selling it so close by. It is fantastic, and gives my son a thrill when there is no stumbling upon a critter! The first hour was not pretty! Tonight, it was sweet music! Have patience, stay the course, and just be vigiliant is the only advice I can give! It's a tough road, but this certainly makes it a little more manageable! Off to smear with oil!

Otherwise, it might pull hair. Second, this product is wonderful on live lice. However, the nits are another story. You need to use this product in tandem with the Terminator Lice Comb, designed for removing nits.This product when used correctly it fabulous and works wonders. It is so much easier than doing it the old fashioned way."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have straight hair then this is the product...","review":"It probably is a good product, but my daughter is biracial and has curly hair and this thing is terrible with her hair...It's hard to get through her hair and stops, not for a louse, but just because it gets stuck...I tried for an hour, but it was no good. The next day I thought I'd give it another shot, but it wouldn't even turn on :-\\\\...so I just brought it back...lol...So I guess if your child has easy to comb through hair, then it's great...You can't use it on wet hair and that's when my daughter's hair is easiest to comb though...so just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it within 1 hour of opening the box","review":"1) It does not tell you in the description that this comb reacts to dandruff the same as it does to lice. Therefore, with a child that has dandruff you are getting constant false positive results.2) within the first 10 minutes of use it broke down completely. We call customer support and got to speak to a person after 15 minutes on hold. We were then subjected to a 45 minute call filled with long pauses while the technician put us on hold to speak to a supervisor. Were told to \\"fiddle\\" with the battery contacts because sometimes they \\"get out of whack\\". Finally they gave up and we returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have...","review":"I have never had to deal with lice until my son started itching his head constantly! I checked it out and sure enough...he had lice. We treated with Nix, and I spent hours making sure I had all the nits out. A couple months later...lice again. Ugh! I had done everything I was supposed to do. This time, I treated with Nix again. The following day, we picked up a Robi comb. We ran it through my sons hair and came out with about 15 more lice. They were all incredibly tiny. The second day we found about 6, and today there was only 1. I plan to check his hair with the comb every day until next week. I figure that way I will catch any hatchlings I may have missed during the nit picking. Without this comb, we would have been back to square one in no time. The Nix definitely cut the numbers down, the comb finished them off."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable product","review":"while this product seems to have great reviews, I found that it worked about 4 times and then stopped working.

That's nuts. I had this book for a level 222 and it was a complete joke. There's a lot of good information and stories about what makes a good e-commerce site, I'll give it that. But there's nothing in here to really give you an edge as far as this stuff goes. The entire point of this book can be summed up in this statement:\\"Look at amazon, look at google and look at yahoo. Look for reasons why they're successfull and take note. Do the same practices in your online sites\\".This book is an interesting read, but for a bunch of stories and business jargon it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased this for a friend.","review":"My friend has wanted this CD for a long time.

I made the mistake of oiling one for my motorcycle and it sucked some in the MAF sensor. After drying it in the sun and wind for a few days no problems. I want to say my MPG and performance increased but it could be just in my head. The biggest thing for me with K&N filters is they can be cleaned and reused. Simple, easy. For any off-road vehicle, I would suggest buying two. That way you always have one if you need to change it out on the trail or one to run while cleaning and re-oiling the other. I prefer the drop in as opposed to the CAI (cold air intake) dust? mud? water?"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more expensive filters from Jiffy Lube","review":"I like that this filter does not need to be replaced. You can simply take it out, clean it, and put it back.I hate when going to Jiffy Lube they always recommend things that don't need to be done...at least according to the manufacturer.

News Flash: Ms. Coleman is setting a trend and its a dose of romance growing in the spirit! What a breath of fresh air! And it is definitely a testament to your talent!But, please!!!!

Sugar Rush caused me to reflect on decisions I made and positions I took as a young lady that, although difficult at the time, were God-directed and spirit led. I encourage women, young and old, to also journey with \\"Dolly\\" and examine their lives and decisions. This journey (book) is well worth the ride! Congratulations Yolonda. Continue to communicate through this medium, the realities of life as a Christian, single, young lady committed to maintaining high standards while also enjoying and experiencing life to the fullest.

I tried but I could not put this book down (only took a short nap). I absolutely loved it!!! I cried, I laughed, I reminisced, I connected, I understood and I thanked God.

Raw and real and I am definitely looking forward to the next project!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar Rush: Love's Liberation","review":"Ms. Yolonda did her thing on the first go around. Not many authors are talented enough to create a fictional story so debonair, so poetically sensational, so romantic, and so powerfully real on their first try. My hat goes off to you Ms. Coleman. It not only makes young women such as myself dream of a future husband with the characteristics of Gerald Washington, but it shows us that we don't have to settle for the nappy headed gang bangers that live next door.P.S., if you haven't done so already, rush to get this bit of sugar.

Unfortunately it appears that I have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion.Overall, there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one, but it did tend to blend things.As a blender alone: It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst. It was truly mediocre through and through.As a smoothie maker: the mechanism used for the pour spout didn't allow any chunks to pass through, and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks. So as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice.On the good side, the stainless does look nice... although it was a little tall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks leaks leaks","review":"The second time I used this to make smoothies, the spigot cracked and I had a sticky mess everywhere.

I have had the same problems with it as many others: The carafe will not stay attached to the blade assembly and leaks liquid out of the bottom. The drip tray vibrates and flies all over the place and the appliance is loud. After using it for a few weeks I discovered that two of the three tabs that hold the blade assembly onto the carafe had broken off. Clearly, Villaware needs to listen to their customers and initiate a redesign of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Tried this machine yesterday.. very loud.. tin plate slid around and was very noisy.. smoothie didn't come thru the spout.. only tiny drips.. don't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I purchased this item because of the powerful motor. I use a blender at least 2 times a day and wanted one that would last a long time. Everytime I tried to take the container off the base the bottom would fall out and the stuff would go everywhere. I tried several times and the end result every time was the same. This will be going into the trash!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - buy a real blender","review":"I just don't like this smoothie maker. I received it as a gift and it was so thoughtful because I love to make smoothies.The blades are not as tough as a blender, the pitcher is plastic (waiting to be cracked) and the spigot doesn't let through any of the deliciously thick smoothie! It works well otherwise, but I like my old blender better.(edited to add)This thing SUCKS. After two smoothie explosions all over my kitchen I gave up and threw it away. It's impossible to put the bottom back in and have it fit securely. You need to be really strong (ask a muscle man) to even get it close and then of course it leaks out and spews yogurt the next time you try to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this Item unless you like a mess!","review":"I bought this smoothie machine for it's powerful motor and look of durability. I have gone through 3 Back to Basics machines, buring out the motor or bending the blades of each one. We use them everyday. This machine is a wreck! EVERYTIME I tried to take the blender off of it's base it unscrews and smoothie pours out ALL OVER the place- everytime! It also bounces across the counter, the drain plate vibrates off- everytime. No matter how tight it is screwed together, it leaks or one parts gets stuck in base and the container comes apart. I have bagged this machine and sent it to the trash can and am shopping for something else. I'd rather get a Back to Basics again, if nothing else. Do not throw out your money on this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk. You can have mine for FREE!!","review":"Don't even think of buying this device unless you enjoy spending 15 minutes cleaning up after each use. The pitcher base detaches itself from the pitcher after about 5 seconds of blending making an ugly mess everywhere. After cleaning up that mess and screwing the base on tighter, it detaches itself after another 5 seconds...get the picture!Anything thicker than water won't pour through the spout, so that feature is completely worthless. You absolutely cannot walk away while turned on or it will vibrate itself off the counter and onto the floor. That is assuming that it doesn't self destruct and have parts and smoothie flying everwhere first.The only reason anyone would give this even a 1 star rating is that ZERO wasn't an option to choose from. You can have mine for FREE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of money","review":"This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek look - but don't even think about replacement parts","review":"Due to my own fault, I broke the plastic jug of my brand new smoothie bowl. This happened in September - it's now April, 7 months later and each time I've called Villaware to get a replacement jug I'm told by yet another sympathetic individual that they don't have it in stock and - worse - don't know when it will become available. I got a total of 6 uses out of what is now redundant machinery. It was quite noisy, but hey, it's a smoothie maker. They're *meant* to make a lot of noise. If I recall back 7 months, it did make nice smoothies, and looks kind of cool too with the brushed aluminium. It's just a shame that there's no way to get simple replacement parts. I'd recommend pretty much any reputable brand over this one. In my experience, most encourage you to continue to use their machinery by shipping replacement parts as quickly as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, poorly made, waste of money, 1 star is too much","review":"I don't normally review items, but this was such a waste of money I had to warn people. First of all, the cheap plastic container is not dishwasher safe...something that should be made clear on the box. When the motor is running, the plastic cannister vibrates, even when it is locked in correctly, this is REALLY loud. The spout leaked, and the smoothie itself was not mixed well at all. My cheap $15 blender from Wal-Mart was far superior to this piece of junk! This was my first and last Villaware product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I received this as a gift and yes it blends wonderfully, however, when I tried to use the spout it did not work. And then I tried to twist the container off so I could pour it out and the bottom came off everything poured out.

You are better off with a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Quality","review":"Used it once and the plastic jar developed a huge crack.

The people never came out of the book they were flat and pathetic. I am an avid reader, and enjoy books that include the supernatural. It is pretty hard to make a vampire as dull and numbing as this one was. If you are interested in something interesting with a twist of the supernatural I would recommend that to read Laurell K. Hamilton or Christine Feehan over this particular author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one goes into my recycle pile","review":"The book was not pleasurable to read through, as I felt much of the story dealt with the history between the evil contessa and our hero, Ragnor. The plot took much of the focus away from the love interest, Jordan Riley. I did feel the attraction of Jordan and Ragnor throughout the story, but the build-up about the two of them seemed to drag on too long. I eventually lost interest in the story before they finally succumbed to their desire of each other. At that point, I didn't really care anymore.I recommend the author's Beneath a Blood Red Moon if anyone haven't read it yet. Now that was a story that was enjoyable to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I found this book to be bland in the least. It seemed to drag on forever, then when it finally did end it was so abrupt that you felt like the ending was an afterthought. Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful..Simply Awful","review":"Where do I begin with what's wrong with this book? The writting style is as bland as old shoe leather. The plot is way to far-fetched to be believed. The characters are boring. Jordan and Ragnor could have been cut out of card-board for all the personality they displayed. If it wasn't bad enough, that the leads were horrible, but the book is further hampered by a cast of thousands that serves no purpose at all. Drake needs to get a better proof-reader. I'm positive that Ragnor's flashback to the Viking days was somehow printed out of order.This book was just awful. Is there anything good about it? No. Don't read it unless you want to fall asleep. This should work quicker than valium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is the first and last work of this author that I will read. It may have worked had it been cut in half, but I ended up skimming about half way through because scenes seemed to repeating themselves. Towards the end the author switches to Viking times to explain how Ragnor came to be a vampire, then all of a sudden Jordan is taking off for New Orleans where another set of characters is introduced. Maybe this is too harsh, but once you read Laurell K. Hamilton or Charlaine Harris, it's hard to go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed","review":"Having read the first two books in this series I was looking forward to the continuing saga. However I was disappointed by the lack of development of the new characters, the story line and the appearance of characters from the first two books. It was off to a pretty good start but Drake seemed to cut the story short wrapping things up just as they were starting to get good. There was only a minor amount of time spent developing the relationship between Jordon and Ragnor and there were serious holes in the story line. I would have liked to have seen more between Jordon and Ragnor as well as a better update on the characters from the previous two books, both of which I would recommend the first two books but suggest that you stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I loved the first 2 books of this series...But this third book... what a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just......odd","review":"I have tried to get through this story. Ragnor is a great character, Raphael is extremely funny and a great character. But, the history on Ragnor and Nari was way too late, and the \\"romance\\" scenes are too few and far in between. I am starting to wonder if this is a \\"Romance\\" Novel or a \\"Sci-Fi\\" Novel with a tiny bit of \\"romance\\" thrown in. I understand that there is \\"Sci-Fi Romance\\" but this one was all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say at this end of this book is, \\"What?\\"!!","review":"I've enjoyed reading other books by Shannon Drake, but this one was very disappointing. I admit that it was a page turner (I finished the book in one sitting) but there were many confusing editing problems, chapters out of sequence, too many characters introduced late in the story and the ending was so abrupt I was sure Drake must have a continuation in the next book in the series \\"Realm of Shadows.\\" Unfortunately any questions that you might have had about the Jordan - Ragnor storyline are not answered in the next book. I wish I'd read the first two of this series before starting Deep Midnight; I certainly have no intention of continuing to read this Vampire Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the first book of the series I have read. I had a difficult time following the plot because of the regressions back into the past. The reader was kept too much in the dark about the vampires.

YUCKY!! I THINK THE CONDITION WAS LISTED AS VERY GOOD, AND IT SURE WASN'T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great possibilities, but only a so-so romance","review":"As an avid Shannon Drake fan I was somewhat dissappointed in certain aspects of Deep Midnight. Drake's artful description of Venice and Carnivale is breathtaking and she successfully creates a paranormal storyline, but if you are looking for the passionate and almost obsessive love affairs of the first two books in this series then I am afraid that you will be very dissappointed. Jordan and Ragnor are not shown to be anything near to soul-mates and love doesn't even come into it. In fact, it seems like their relationship has even yet to start. Another dissappointment is the sex scenes. In the past Drake has used her skill to take our breath away, it is not so in this case. So, overall, the storyline was good but was never bulit upon and you are left wondering if they will even end up together or if they will break up next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange creatures have taken over Shannon Drake","review":"Interview with the Vampire this is not. Shannon Drake--or some other author of the same name--used to write interesting and even well-crafted historical romance. This is not a well-crafted anything...the \\"heroine\\" is boring and rushing headlong into \\"danger,\\" which is not particularly believable even if one accepts the vampire premise. Story line is thin, plot is thin, characters aren't compelling or fascinating. Read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half-and-Half","review":"I think that the Clara and Odette combo is great, but you can't buy them separately. Clara looks horrible in the individual one.

Thanks to Amazon the part was shipped quickly and arrived when they said it would. It was easy to replace (I downloaded the maintenance manual and followed it just to be safe) and everything works fine now. I have used Dorman products before and have found that they often work better than the factor parts. Especially on honda window regulators during that time period - Honda parts are traditionally very poorly made and break easily so this Dorman replacement is a solid upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Below OEM Quality/Alignment","review":"I installed this regulator and aligned it as best as I could to the track, but I can still hear it struggling near the bottom and top of rolling up the window.

But this one failed miserably. Most of the acting was terrible. I had it figured out early on who the killer was. The only redeeming things in the entire movie are the man playing Paul does some fair acting and so does his main friend. And the detective crying toward the end actually brought tears to my eyes. If gory photos are your thing , this movie has enough to make it seem the most realistic part of the entire movie. It was a good idea but short on acting and delivery. I don't know if this is the fault of the actors , the director or the writer. I would like to see this done by a better cast and crew and see if it redeems the movie. The book , if there is one, is probably decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Horror Begins Here","review":"After seeing two films from this writer/director Francis Xavier, two films that I enjoyed very much, Dodge City and The Tango Dancer and when I decided to watch some of his earlier work such as the controversial Johnny Come Lately, I had to rethink my thoughts of this filmmaker.

The publisher, Big Guy Books, was almost excessively responsive to my complaints, so I do heartily recommend the series -- but don't buy this particular paperback. The company who printed the early Big Buy Books was incompetent and Big Guy Books has since fired them. Do buy the hardcover instead, which isn't much more money. You can donate the hardcover and take the tax break later.The beauty of the series is the focus on readable adventures for boys. The books may be especially valued by boys who are struggling with reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulp literature","review":"Woodrell finds the best way of combining pulp fiction with actual literature. This, I think, is his best book so far. The noir feeling is mixed with a sort of Gothic-Faulkner that is incredibly appealing.Don't get me wrong, though, the pace of this novel moves unlike anything Faulkner wrote. The characters are rich and unique. The reader often feels as if a world unknown (almost a parallel world in the Ozarks) is being glimpsed. I don't know if there are Goomer Doctors in real life or is this is one of the author's creations. Either way, the novel feels authentic in a way I haven't experienced since reading Hemingway."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was an excellent book filled with bumpkin family values","review":"this is an excellent book in all aspects.

The exciting style along with a gripping tale give you everything you could ask for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive and Shallow \\"Politically Correct\\" Version","review":"I am a huge fan of the original Hugh Lofting Dr. Dolittle and not this shallow abridged version. A good part of the story is cut and the history is mutilated. The illustrations are obviously not complete Hugh Loftings even though they still bear his name. Many of his illustrations have been cut and pasted blending them with some weird Victorian style prints. The result is a jumbled mishmash. As a kid, I'm offended that they would take a wonderful piece of literature and trample it with political correctness jargon. There are things said in the original version that I understand would not be appropriate today. But it was a part or our history. And it gives a great opportunity for discussions with parents. As for this story, what is left? The character depth is ruined. The vocabulary is rudimentary. Utter trash. Don't waste your time. Original unabridged or nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic for all ages","review":"Dr. Dolittle is definitely a must-read for people of all ages, for children and for those who are young-at-heart. It is the story of a generous old man who seems capable of doing anything! All he wants to do is help, and he doesn't care if he loses all his money just to save monkeys in Africa from an epidemic. But the best thing about Dr. Dolittle is that he can talk to animals -- and this is probably every child's dream. And so read this when you're very young, read this to your children, and read this when you've forgotten what it is to be a kid. Because the quaint British way in which the story is told will keep you amused, while the crazy adventures of Dr. Dolittle and his conversations with his animal friends will keep your imagination rolling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, this has been adulterated","review":"Dr. Dolittle has fallen afoul of the PC police, well before they were so named.

The adventures of this delightful person who discovered his ability to animal-speak give young readers the opportunity to dream the impossible and have fun while doing so.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is poorly editted","review":"The story is cute, but the kindle version of this book has numerous errors. For example, the first sentence of the fifth chapter reads \\"Now, for six whole weeks they werit sailing on and on, oyer the rolling sea...\\" In some places the 'n's are 'ri's and other weird things like that. It seems that perhaps automatic software was used to convert to an e-book version, but no one bothered to check it, which is kind of annoying since it claims to be \\"optimized\\" for larger screens, and there are cheaper versions of this book available.

First of all it's hillarious! I found myself laughing pretty hard at some points the guys are really funny and have good chemistry on screen, and the little tasks they put the cars threw are really entertaining and funny. Second they really have a love for cars and the way they describe the details of the cars they are reviewing is really informative. Love the show and can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps it will improve with age... if it isn't taken off the air before any more seasons are filmed","review":"Not nearly as funny and endearing as the UK version. Showing the seeing eye dog peeing on the Top Gear emblem on the episode where they try to \\"teach\\" a blind guy how to drive was just disgusting and very unfunny. Also, when these guys buy an old junker why does no one empty the rubbish out of it before the show is taped? God knows what sorts of things are bouncing around in the old clunkers they buy. The feature is the car, not that the previous owner was some white trash filthy hoarder. Still, this show has potential and should be given the opportunity to find itself. Lots of very popular shows didn't hit their stride until well into their third or fourth seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Imitation","review":"This is a poor, poor imitation of the UK television show, Top Gear, one of the best shows of all time.

With a few dollars worth of flowers from the grocery store we made several examples from the book (with a few substitutions). We were delighted at how beautifully they turned out. I talked about the language of flowers and then showed everybody our samples. We had assembled a variety of ingredients and then each of our 15 members created her own Tussie Mussie.

I've been using it after every long run (over 1 hour) and all I can say is \\"It's been 6 months and I'm still going :)\\" The marathon is in 3 weeks.I really like the vanilla flavor. The only part I do differently is that I mix it with 1/2 litre of water (16.9 oz) instead of the recommended 12 oz...not too sweet/not too watery. Also, it's better to mix it a day ahead of time, and shake it a few times, because it take a while to dissolve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better next time!","review":"I have been using this recovery drink for several years now after cycling and tennis.

I recommend against the \\"fruit punch\\" flavor, though... it's nauseatingly sweet (took me nearly half an hour to drink to keep from throwing it up, to be honest). So if you already have problems eating/drinking after exercise (and especially if saccharine flavors make you sick) I'd go for a different flavor. I'm just gonna suffer through it until I get another batch. If I don't update, you can assume the vanilla is much better :-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready, Set ................

I am one those folks that can eat and exercise like crazy but cannot gain weight. Moreover, the more i pushed myself the longer it took me to recover as i would have tremendous muscle aches for next two days depending on how often i was at the gym. This not only made it hard for me to go to the gym often, but also diverted all my energy to just recover.I randomly picked this product with out a lot of research and I am happy with it. The lemon lime works just fine. Honestly, i dont feel like i have been at the gym anymore as I dont have the usual aches anymore.

Endurox R4 is a great alternative for the costly beachbody product. It has the same 4:1 ratio of Carb and protein sans the creatine. Creatine is not for someone like me who wants to loose weight, because creatine retains water in your body and weighs you more.Mixing is relatively easy with glass and spoon and it tastes great if you add like 6-8oz of cold water.So overall I am happy with this product.

I got it for Christmas, did it once & cannot bring myself to do it again. The cueing is non-existent and she talks WAY too much! I didn't mind her tongue-in-cheek remarks as much as I minded her inattention to the practice itself. If you are looking for an innovative approach to yoga that focuses on muscle tone, I'd highly suggest Exhale's Core Fusion Yoga. I rented that from the library and I was very pleased to get from it what I thought I'd be getting from Yogalosophy. No, no, & no to this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mix","review":"Good mix of yoga and strength exercises. I practice yoga often and I like how this DVD combines it with strength training. You do feel the burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout video","review":"I really enjoyed the workout in Yogalosophy. The background includes good music with a wonderful ocean view. Mandy is really cute and loses count now and then, but it just means extra lunges :) I was able to get an effective low impact workout. I will continue to use this video to supplement my running and soccer playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I love this video. Mandy is fun and the workout is challenging. She focuses on all the right areas and after a week I already feel more toned."},{"rating":"1","title":"no direction","review":"I agree with the above comments. There is not enough direction to her dvd. She moves from one pose to the next without any cues, so you miss a lot of poses unless you spend your entire yoga looking for the tv. Agreed, that she does talk to much too. There is one section I do like - the express yoga. If you are looking for a quick and good workout centered around yoga (but not totally yoga)then the express yoga section is good. And because she does talk to much, after about a week or two you will know the flow enough to switch to the option of just having music play during the express yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yogalosophy","review":"This is a good yoga video, and you can use it if you're a yoga novice or not. As other reviewers have said, she narrates a little irreverently, and she sometimes fails to narrate when she changes positions. There is an option to turn off the narration--at least for the 30 minute workout. I like the flexibility that you can select the full hour, segments, or the shorter workout. Regardless, you can get a challenge, and she has options for those with knee and back issues. I got it for a song, and only 2 weeks of use 2-3 times per week helped me improve my scores on a military physical fitness test. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"After buying many workout dvds that dont give you a good workout or a too hard to follow along, getting this dvd was perfect.

Love this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout, but definitely NOT yoga","review":"Too many things to dislike in this video:1. too many references to her \\"great ass\\" and how great she looks2. too many crotch shots in too-short shorts (seriously, I do not need to SEE your Brazilian wax!)3. outdated 80's philosophy of \\"feel of the burn\\"4. renames yoga poses to suit her (\\"This pose is called cat-cow, but I call it cat-dog\\")5. thinks \\"it's yoga as long as we stay connected to the breath\\", with no explanation as to what \\"staying connected to the breath\\" really means (and, obviously, what yoga really means)6. condescending toward yoga (\\"They say this pose opens the heart, but, <smirking> I don't I know about that. Well, I guess I 'feel the love' <laughter> \\"7. no instruction on entering/exiting poses, little to no cueing as to when to change poses/exercisesI could go on, but you get the picture.If you are looking for a workout video, go for it. If you are looking to enhance a yoga practice, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to say that I was very disappointed with this video. I have been practicing yoga for over 6 years and I was looking to carryout some of my practices with a guided video. Mandy Ingber uses nice flows however when you choose the complete workout she does not describe what pose to move into. So here I am in one pose and she's moved on to the next. It's rather hard to look at the television while you are in downward dog and know that she has moved on to the next pose. Well another video that will sit on my shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK to watch, but difficult to follow","review":"When i got this DVD, i sat down and watched the whole thing through, so i'd have an idea of what it's about. The next time I watched it, I was ready to work out. Five minutes into it, I realized that she doesn't do a good job narrating what she's doing, so I had to constantly look at the screen. There's a lot of fancy editing and voice over work, but if they just focused on a basic instructional DVD, this could be much better. And she should really keep the banter to a minimum. If I were to do this 3x a week (which i won't, bec i don't like it), her talk about her mantra or how good she looks in her shorts would drive me nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word....amazing!!!!","review":"Let me first say that this is now definitely my all time favorite workout!!!! Okay I literally JUST did it and still in my workout clothes and yes they're sweating but I don't care I just had to write this review!!!!! I am a yoga teacher and I really think this video is for everyone!!! Given the cues are not really great and I can see someone that does not practice yoga may have a hard time with sun salutations but just watch it a few times and you will be right on track!!!! It doesn't really matter if you have a spiritual yoga practice or just like for purely a workout this is a video for you!!! Spiritual people are spiritual no matter what practice they are doing and this DVD is not spiritual at all so it is perfect for others as well!! I just really cannot say enough great things about this DVD. If you are on the fence...... come to this side and buy the DVD today!!!! wooohooooo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!","review":"SHE IS THE MOST ANNOYING YOGA INSTRUCTOR EVER!!!!!I mean don't get me wrong she knows what she's doing, but I wish she would shut up and let me do the practice there is one where you can have he not talk but then the music is like the music you play when you want ppl to get out of your house. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with this video","review":"this dvd had hardley nothing to do w/yoga. i wouldnt classify it as yoga. i'd classify it as too much chatter, and to much emphasis on body image, and her ass. who really cares? yoga is supposed to be mindful, peaceful, learning to love and accept who you are now--i wont recommend it to anyone i know.."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Time Favorite Elvis Movie","review":"This is my single-most favorite Elvis movie.

This is Elvis at his best on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, too little plot","review":"This book had a multitude of characters, but none of them was developed fully. It was hard to keep the many characters straight. I had to keep referring to the earlier chapters to see who I was reading about. One of the major subplots was left completely unresolved. And the book was extremely preachy. I found myself skipping over a lot of the text to get back to the story. I can't help comparing this book to the Mitford books by Jan Karon, which are also about a small town and its population. Jan Karon is a storyteller. The author of this book is preaching a sermon. If that is what you are looking for, fine. But if you are looking for a good story, I would not choose this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"stock is fine but missing necesary parts","review":"I bought this to replace a pistol grip on my mossberg 500, but they failed to mention that the pistol grip bolt wasn't long enough to attach this stock to the firearm. the stock itself is fine, but a little heads up about the bolt not being included would have been nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap but works!","review":"Initially, I did not like this butt stock but the more and more I look at and use the gun, the more I love it. If you're on a budget, this is a great addition to your standard shotgun. I put it on my Remington 870 express and it has held up very well.Fits flush to the gun as though it was the original stock. The only problem that I have with it is the pad on the butt, it's useless. It isn't a rubber pad, it is a hard plastic.All in all it's a great looking and tough stuck but butt stock pad is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend.","review":"It looks cool, or would on my 870 tactical. But, I can't get the screws off that hold the recoil pad on. The Phillips head screws are supposed to be an X shape, well they're offset like a swastika. Now that they're rounded off, and also I failed to mention I had to cut slits in the recoil pad to get to the screws, the rubber holes they put on the pad to fit a screwdriver, are about an 1/8\\" off and there was no other way.So now I'm stuck with a 40$ useless paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk","review":"I ordered this product expecting it to have some semblance of quality. However what i found is quite the opposite, the screws for the butt pad wouldn't come out and when I finally gave up and cut them off(with the intention of replacing that POS recoil pad anyway) I found a complex assortment of spacers (with no instructions) and then another set of spacers to attach the stock to the receiver. So after several frustrating hours I finally get the stock attached to the receiver where the stock spacer's don't even line up properly, even after retching on the stock screw so hard that I thought I would break something, the stock was on. Then I left it on for three days came back to look at it again and to no surprise by this point the stock was lose and floppy. By this time I had enough and threw it in the trash.Stay away from this product I've seen better quality from UTG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great just not sure on the recoil pad.Maverick 88.","review":"So my Pa-inlaw picked this up for my Bday and I just installed lastnight it fits great and havent had a chance to shoot my M88 12 gauge yet.Im a little dissapointed in the fact I cant just buy a Limbsaver or a ATI recoil reducing pad because I like 3 inch mag slugs and they pack a punch. Does anyone have a view on the Recoil pad that came on this stock?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stock for Rem 870","review":"This stock fit well on my Remington 870 12ga using the adapter provided. This is the first time I'd removed the stock from an 870, and had no problems with the instructions and diagrams provided, took about 20 minutes all together.I've marked it down one star because it looks a little cheap - the grip is hollow and open on the bottom. Despite this, it is quite sturdy, I have taken it shooting three times so far, and after some 300+ rounds of 7.5 shot, it's help up. The rubber butt pad is comparable to the factory one for comfort. The strap attachment does not swivel, it is comparable to the factory stock as well. The pistol grip significantly reduces recoil felt on the shoulder, making my 12 gauge MUCH comfier to shoot, even more than my little 20ga NEF Pardner. My accuracy at the trap range did not change.I chose this stock based on price, and it did not disappoint at $40. I would recommend this stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"This was a great buy for my 870, it may be a little long for some shooters though, great for me but I am 6' 4\\" but other wise easy too install and looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Flossers Ever!","review":"These flossers are the best thing to happen to general home dentistry.

Unfortunately they moved production to China and their quality has suffered greatly. It takes about 2.75 of these to get through my teeth now (used to be about 1.25). At least they dont shred like the others I have tried, the floss just pulls out of an end.They deserve about a 3.5 star rating in my book; buy the US made ones if you are fortunate enough to find any."},{"rating":"2","title":"best","review":"After exhaustive cross comparisons I believe Plackers are the best out there by far. Seems like most brands I get through half my teeth and the string breaks! Plackers I will admit I use several times. I know some people will say thats gross but I use it and throw it on my desk or in my dash and keep using it for days till I just throw it out but honestly i could use it a million more times I bet! because the plastic is so tough it does not make the best toothpick on the other end but I have good toothpicks but great flosser is hard to find and this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible compared to Reach mint.","review":"Not sure how anyone could say these are good.

The grammatical and typographical errors alone are enough to make me giggle, but the rampant plotholes and other storyline inconsistencies are fantastic.

Additionally, the numerous spelling and grammatical errors fueled a great deal of frustration. Often I had to place this book aside and try to gather the motivation to finish it to the end, I despise starting a book and not completing it. I found it impossible to connect with the main character, Teflon. Instead of establishing credibility, passion, or empathy for Teflon's plight, I was enraged by his immaturity and disloyalty even to those closest to him. I did not find Cleofis to be charismatic, appealing, or worthy of the following that he mistakenly believed he had created. I would not have followed this character into a dog house. I also found it painful to identify with any of Teflon's unsuspecting victims. However, his cousin, Bruno, was somewhat interesting and offered momentary glimpses of hope for the book.

There is good footage of both rifle and bowhunts from the ground and from tree stands.

If all smooth jazz was the quality of Braun's Beat Street, it wouldn't have the sometimes elevator, saccharine reputation artists like Kenny G have given it. I have been paring down my extensive collection of Jazz, going mp3 library with those I like, selling off the rest; but Beat Street is NOT leaving my collection.This set has so much going for it: Unfettered creativity, sweet melodies, great guest appearances, excellent interplay between artists, interesting diversity, haunting sounds, to funky beats. Philadelphia is a deservedly widely played, popular track off Beat Street, but this is not the only top tier song on the CD. Most are. Most of the songs on this CD are better than the best on most smooth jazz albums.I haven't been that impressed with Braun's collected work, but on this one, it all came together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately 5 star","review":"Yup, its a \\"5 star\\" CD!

If only she could get more radio play...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD EVER.","review":"This eclectic blend of all sorts of styles is easy on the ears and seems to suit any sort of mood. She's also a great lyric-writer and the words on songs such as \\"Hello\\" show that she's really aware of the latest technology & isn't afraid to use it. \\"Fly Away\\" is a treat, and is just as great if you can hear her sing it in person.I heard that the new album is due June, so let's cross our fingers! (If you want to see what pretty Poe looks like, just play the video game \\"Apocalypse\\"!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely original","review":"One of the most amazing and diverse CD's I have ever heard. It is a wonderful piece of art that I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow, groovy, unique style.","review":"MTV shows one video from Poe, then forgets about her. Typical. I bought this album for \\"Angry Johnny\\", but I like nearly all of the songs, especially \\"Dolphin\\" and \\"Trigger Happy Jack.\\" This album grows on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only The Beginning","review":"Clever Lyrics and really fun beats, this album is great if you're looking for music with an edge. Poe's voice is lyrical and poignant. I really love this album...and unlike many \\"popular\\" artists they only get better from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe, please give us another album soon","review":"If you like trippy, jazzy ambient beats, coupled with tracks that rock, you should pick up this CD.I became aware of Poe about 2 years ago when MTV was playing \\"Angry Johnny\\" on 120 Minutes and the local alt rock station had a remix of \\"Hello\\" in heavy rotation. I was impressed by both tracks but never made it to the CD shop to pick up the CD.I bought it last week and have not been disappointed at all. I'm listening to it daily. Every track is solid, and the album is amazingly eclectic. Hard, jazzy and dancy at the same time. In addition, Poe's lyrics are poignant and fresh. Her team of songwriters is to be commended. Finally, her voice is heavenly. I especially enjoy female artists, and she is among the best I've heard.Hope she gets around to releasing another album soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello? Its about time someone like Poe came along..","review":"Poe trudged herself slowly and steadily through the years between her debut and sophmore efforts. I havent bought Haunted yet because i was completely unaware that Poe had released a sophmore effort. But back to the main attraction, Hello is a refreshing change. Poe may not be radio-friendly or a huge commercial success but she shows that she can make a very decent album. Although some songs, lyricaly and musically, may be utterly unbearable other songs I can't get enough of. Songs like Dolphin, Trigger Happy Jack, and Angry Johnny are absolutely incredible and Poe deserved much more attention for such a mind-blowing debut. Unlike other artists Poe put time and effort into crafting the best debut she could have possibly made, mainstream or not. In many songs the lyrics can be pathetic and distorted and the music can be quite the ear-whrencher (thus why I gave it 4 stars) this is still a very decent album and an excellent effort made by Poe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is Poe so perfect?","review":"Before I heard \\"Hello,\\" I wanted to give it a 4 because \\"Haunted\\" is such a masterpiece. But every song on this album is great (well, I'm not too fond of \\"Junkie,\\" but it's not bad at all).The song \\"Hello\\" is a great way to start a great album and a great musical career. If you haven't heard the rock version, download it from a file-sharing service! It's awesome. \\"Another World\\" is a great \\"jazzy\\" song, with one of the coolest samples I've ever heard (children laughing) spliced in with the music!Anyway, Poe's voice is completely amazing and \\"sultry\\" (can't think of a better word). She's very sexy, very talented, and a great songwriter. I've heard all of her songs I can find (album and non-album) and never heard a bad one.In conclusion, please marry me Poe :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"help for adoptive parents","review":"This book gave support and answers to help parents who have adopted children.

We are a strict, old school style parenting family that went through liberal reward systems and consequences for misguided actions and logic wasn't the answer.

With an extensive ministry living in a tribal community overseas, I felt pulled to complete distraction. Having successfully raised 4 birth children, we found this child nothing like any we'd raised; none of the techniques we had used worked. When home on furlough after four months of 'living hell' I ran across this book lying on a friend's table. It has become our 'purple RAD bible' ever since. It immediately gave us hope, but after starting to use the guidelines and techniques suggested in the book, we found that it really worked!! When our 11-year old came into our home, she was emotionally about 5 or 6 years old. Today, she is almost 16 and emotionally 14 or 15 and that without the acting out that many 'normal' teenagers go through. Thank you Nancy!! Thanks, God!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a huge fan","review":"I have three beautiful daughters. My oldest is 20, a college sophomore, doing well. My middle daughter was aopted at age nine. She is now 13 and doing ok. She has had her share of ups and downs, but I see a bright future for her. My youngest daughter was adopted just over a year ago and is almost 13. She is on a downhill slide and was recently inpatient at the state psych hospital. Amongst many other diagnose, she is now labeled as RAD. Several people suggested I get this book...it would change my life. I read it and mostly thought been there done that, did not work with my child. It is a simple read and wrote at a pretty low level. Maybe in a logical child it could work. My experience is these are not logical children. My child is struggling. I am grasping at any straw to keep her in my home, but this book was certainly not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book - needs editor!","review":"The over the top reviews author Nancy Thomas is getting here are very misleading. This is not an easy book to read. It's so badly organized, poorly written and grossly repetitive! It is heartfelt enough and may offer relief to some who have RAD kids - if they can get through it! It reads like a collection of post it notes, and forwarded email. She would have benefitted from an editor who could organize her thoughts and smooth her poor writing skills. This author may have a genuine contribution to make, but undermines her message in every way possible making it very hard to tell. Meanwhile I have very little time to waste as the mother of two of these kids to sort through the mess and get to her message!This book made me mad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and easy to read.","review":"I couldn't put this book down and read it in one sitting to the very last page. It is easy to read with no hard to follow medical jargon. Just full of useful and easy to implement ideas on how to raise a child with Reactive Attachment Disorder. We have already followed quite a few of the ideas and can see the difference already - especially with the 'pizazz' concept. This is a heartbreaking disorder and one which the child suffering from it deserves to be free of. We as adults owe it to our children to make this change for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Love is Not Enough","review":"This book saved our family. No kidding.

Begin to parent the child that you DO have, with help from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beneath Our Feet","review":"As an avid amateur, I found this book delightful. Beautiful photographs, and easy to understand explanations. In particular, the detailed descriptions of the thin sections were extremely educational. Most texts that include photographs of thin sections are way over my head. This book was easy to comprehend, and afforded me an insight to thin sections, and why petrologists use them. If you have ever been puzzled by what a thin section actually reveals, buy this book. That answer alone is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking beyond our feet","review":"This book is as much about the beauty of the Earth as it is about how the Earth is formed. It is not a classic-style text book, but a book that illustrates the more spectacular aspects of the Earth while providing a clear and well written explanation of how these rocks are formed.It is a perfect gift for anybody with a passing interest in geology, and in my case the family of a geologist, who often ask, \\"Just what is it about rocks that you like so much?\\" This book provides an elegant and beautifully illustrated answer to their question. Last year I bought a copy for each member of my family and they loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"I found this book to be almost worthless - no coverage of the subject, just a lot of glossy photos with no detailed explanations.

What I especially liked about the novel was how it spanned several years and truly showed Meredith's growth and the changing ways she viewed her parents. I thought the depiction of her mother and father was classic and right on. Katherine Tanney didn't try to sugarcoat or mask the inner workings of a not-so-perfect family, creating such realistic characters that I cringed at some of the dialogue and scenes because I felt how painful Meredith's life was. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wimpy","review":"Hat is scrawny and flimsy for the price.

Of course, not all large clans have the talent and connections that this group does: this is a really FUN album, featuring lots of great performances, not only by family members, but also by some of the top session musicians around, guys that have played with Chicago, the Stones, etc. As you would expect, the horn parts are great (very Chicago-esque), but so are the strings (especially the cello), and there's an amazing vocal duet by a couple of Michael's nieces who sound like a female version of Simon and Garfunkel. The thing I like best is that the there's a lot of variety in the production, the classics sound great, and the originals are nice too, like the excellent \\"Christmas Time Without You\\", and one which sounds like it could have been a newly discovered track from a \\"Christmas with Elvis\\" session. Pretty cool stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weir Family Magic","review":"Whether or not you're a Michian Damian/Weir Family fan, I believe this album will become one of your Christmas favorites. I bought it in the middle of the summer but can't quit listening to it. It is simply amazing the talent that is in one single family. Put them all together, and it's DY NO MITE!Michael Damian and his family are among the few who can take songs that have been recorded over and over and over and make them sound fresh and inviting. Then there are the two bonus numbers written by family members--very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Shot","review":"Excellent movie. Good for family.

How refreshing to read something by an author who loves words, makes them fly and sing, do pirouettes, and then lulls you with the beauty of their precision.It's also the rich, complex story of a woman who figures out who she is.

Well it follows the Thom Hartmann show and it is breathtaking to compare the intelligence and depth of the two shows-mind boggling really!!! I will read this book and indeed I will try to keep from expelling my stomach contents but I will read it.(I won't buy it for goodness sakes) I don't hate Mr Hannity but eventually the pendulum will swing to the other side and Thom Hartman's show will be on seven hundred radio stations and Hannity's will be on the internet.

And in doing so, he does nothing more than to further support and defend this idea - as long as those thoughts suppressed are liberal.I truly wonder who actually wrote this book.

Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system.

Can't you see the hypocracy of this administration?Also, Hannity's book is a non-starter for the following reason - what he incorrectly lables appeasement is actually diplomacy. Diplomacy, as any reasonable person would know, is ALWAYS the first recourse prior to war.

He weaves a vehement, flawed tapestry of delusions and presents it as an explanation for the \\"evils\\" of the world.His warped sense of morality, and liberals lack thereof, will no doubt appeal to the sanctimonious inclinations of hardened conservatives, as will his wrongheaded thesis that liberalism is commensurate with terrorism.However, throughout the book it is easy to suspect that Hannity himself does not believe the ideas he posits, and that what we have is the expert work of a consumate salesman. Using the capitalist system he so often champions, he sells the masses what they want to hear and giggles slyly to himself.For those who wish to fatten Hannity's bank account, this book is a must read.

He views the world from a perspective of absolutes. He doesn't waver. This annoys some people because they believe that everything, including morality, is relative. In fact, any moral relativist would find this book repugnant. Nonetheless, I think that his handling of the issues, as well as his treatment of both Democratic and Republican collegues, to be quite fair given the vast differences in ideology. I don't agree with many of Sean's points, particularly on certain social issues, but I do find his fiscal and foreign policy concepts to be rooted in the kind of reality that one cannot simply bend and shape. No, he's not particularly hip, like, say Al Frankin. He comes across as a little fuddy-duddy, and the title of his book \\"Deliver Us From Evil\\" smacks of a kind of throwback mentality, but hey, everybody can't be Bill Clinton...and thank God."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time someone stuck it to the socialist liberals.","review":"Proves that although the liberal socialists own print media land and television land, they still DON'T own the heartland, and they never will.

In fact his book highlights ideologues and provides arguments against their extremism. Of course, if you take on ideologues, you put yourself in harms way. Hannity seems to enjoy this and this book is open and honest because of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Sean Hannity!","review":"Excellent analysis of the current state of affairs. Mr. Hannity has laid out the folly of appeasement preached by the liberal democrats.

This is probably one of the most ludicrous and badly thought out pieces of political writing that I have read that sold well. Well, actually, there have been a lot worse. Suffice to say that I read about half the book without finding a single chain of thought that wasn't either obvious, obviously wrong, or extremely tenuous. Very nice that he basically hates liberals. Sensational title. Nothing new. If he could back up a single argument with any intelligence, he might have kept his self-respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Right Wing Lies","review":"What more needs to be said.

Goebbels would have been impressed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade School Political Science","review":"I never watch Hannity but I have heard of him so I read through the first few chapters. I begin to notice how simplistic his ideas are and how the book is written on what must be a 6th grade reading level. Now I'm intrigued, I must find out what Sean Hannity's educational background is and just as I suspected, he never went to college and it shows in his writing. If you dropped out of high school or struggled to graduate, this is the book for you. If you are going to be a political analyst the least you could do is be educated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of $$$$$$$","review":"Cannot believe this guy calls John Kerry, a war hero John Hanoi Kerry.

I always knew you ultra-conservatives were off your rockers but this just seems to confirm it!!! Until Sean Hannity can compete with the likes of Al Franken; Molly Ivins; and Paul Krugman, he shouldn't be writing such filth as this. Those on the right make a profession out of \\"running\\" with the first story they hear. There is NEVER a sense of logic or a sense of doing the necessary RESEARCH to confirm or deny what was put forth. Sean does a good job in disseminating his personal points of view, but there are no facts to back any of it up. This should heve been an editorial not a non-fiction book! Wake-up all you people on the right!! Take some advice. Until you can be credible on the paper and on the airwaves, knowledgable liberals and independents will not take you seriously at all!

I think he does a great job as a media salesman especially to those who are looking for simplistic leadership. And this book continues his product line in great form. However, this book is so slanted in view and opportunistic in the use of partial truths that is borders on propaganda. This book gets an A for segmented marketing strategy but presents overly simplified logic with a strong spin (to feed his audience).

Mr. Hannity's book lacks the academic and scientific foundations that would qualify it for even the most basic class assignment in one of my Introductory classes.

Pure and simple, Hanity is a tool of the RNC. I think we could even shorten that to Hanity is a tool. He bases his points on conjecture, never backs up his views with facts or figures and just plain makes stuff up. Wait a couple months and you can pick this one up for $1 on-line or look for it in any trailer park yard-sale after the election. You'll thank me later.

I'm not sure precisely HOW terrorism and liberalism are alike--or how despotism and liberalism are alike--nor do I think Mr. Hannity does either. I think he thought it might be clever and \\"provocative.\\"If you've listened to his show any time in the past few years, you will find nothing new here, unless you happened to miss the stolen documents he pretended to scoop the rest of the media with (where ARE those stories, anyhow?

I read the first 125 pages. It was impossible to go further. This book is filled with fabrications.

He still believes Bush was right about Iraq despite evidence to the contrary. He uses liberal like its a dirty word. Thank God most of America is middle road and doesnt believe this extreme belief. HOw the man can take Osama and think it applies to Iraq is unreal. Look at the best seller list and 1/2 of the books are anti bush.

Kerry bad -- Bush good; Rush is wise; the LIBS own the press and on and on. Orwellian in context and taking significant freedoms with the truth he has presented us with at least one more commandment: \\"Thou shalt not think.\\" It is only a short hop from Hannity to Big Brother and sadly it looks like millions are buying it. The post 9/11 world is increasingly populated by vendors of neofascism and as we see here if your going to lie it's always best to tell a whopper.

As far as recently published books go, check out \\"America Unbound\\" by Ivo Daalder and James Lindsey, \\"The Sorrows of Empire\\" by Chalmers Johnson, and anything by Noam Chomsky, particularly his newest book, \\"Hegemony or Survival.\\" Political fluff like \\"Deliver Us From Evil\\" (although it certainly applies to both the right and the left, as in \\"Dude, Where's My Country) should be treated as such: entertainment for the choir.

If he does realize it then he has a different issue altogether. In any event, people of this extreme should be obvious to the public as being of no good use...unfortunately, as it seems through book sales (however authentic that is), too many people are unable to identify this individual for what he is.

S. Constitution. In a desperate attempt to garner support for the radical right wing agenda that has been forced on the American people against their will since 2000, Sean Hannity weaved a fantasy that conveniently ignores many sad realities. The most obvious reality that is not stated in this work of fiction is that the greatest breach of national security occurred on September 11, 2001 because of the criminal negligence of George W. Bush who was attempting to be the first part-time President in history rather than heed the multiple warnings of the American and international intelligence community.

Somehow he neglects to talk about the 1st 8 months of the Bush administration, where Richard Clarke's recommendations (Jan 2001) to engage in Afghanistan and freeze terrorist assets and the Hart-Rudman report recommending a Dept. of Homeland Security (Feb 2001) went entirely ignored. All this administration did was REACT to an attack on US soil, a no-brainer. This book is dangerous twisting of facts...propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"2d Worse Book of all time","review":"At least it isn't as bad as his first book. If you like books with a \\"large print\\" kind of feel with absolutely no insight on the American Political lanscape, this is your book. It isn't simply bad, its mindboggling bad. Hannity spends most of the book trying to convince intelligent people that the reason we were attacked on 9/11 was because of labor union. Incredible. This guy is dumb as a rock"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and Rhetoric","review":"If you are looking for a concise, intelligent and well reasoned summary of everything that is wrong in the US today...look elsewhere.This book is more a work of literary self-gratification for the author than anything else.

Throughout this book it becomes abundantly clear that Hannity's is an extremist and a zealot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Alternates between incomprehensible drivel and baldfaced lies.

Great Job Sean and God Bless you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research","review":"Reading this book was quite painful. Sean Hannity's writing is terrible and he uses the word \\"evil\\" way too much. He lacks an understanding of history. Hannity generally distorts historical events to suit his point of view. The main problem I have with his book is the research. It's obvious he didn't research his book correctly. He lacks primary sources, and the ones he uses are limited to memoirs. If he had used more government documents he likely would have found his own beliefs to be challenged. As a college student I can tell you that if I had written this I would fail for having done such a bad job on my research. Don't read this, it's not worth it, and if you aren't polished on your history definitely don't read it. This book is so inaccurate it hurts.

The organization is fairly well done, but it could have been a little better, although I do enjoy the way the book is broken up into small parts, it makes it easy to just pick up and read one part at a time.

It is a typical 'I've got all the answers' book that Messers. Limbaugh, O'Reilly, and Savage among others like to churn out for the adoring masses who wouldn't think of going anywhere else for their political education. Everything is black and white-George Bush is a God-fearing, would never lie, WAR president. We would not have survived in the wake of September 11th under Al Gore apparently. Fact is, President Bush was asleep on watch before September 11th, and it was local firefighters, police and volunteers who dealt with the aftermath much as they will after the next attack.

I agree with another reviewer. Al Franken's book is a much better and worthwhile read. You will at least get humor and intelligence from Franken. Hannity can only give his readers rousing hate and they feed on it like sharks because hate spreads faster than love.

Can't you at least be honest about your right-wing bias, Mr. Hannity?I admit I didn't read the entire book, as there's only so much propeganda I can take, but it's clear that Mr. \\"fair and balanced\\" wrote this book for a specific audience.

Childish in its tone, boring in its style, he seems to try overly hard to tell the reader what the reader wants to hear. His logic is flawed; his facts, skewed. My students in poli sci would recognize it for what it is: pure propaganda written by a semi-educated TV personality. Sean, surely you could find a ghost writer who could bring some element of substance to this waste of paper.

Hannity gives specific factual examples on all of his accusations of the far left, so there's no possible room for question.Some people absolutely hate Hannity, why I'm not sure.

It's extremely informative, and a must read for anyone voting this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"It amazes me that for all of his pomp and \\"patriotism,\\" Mr. Hannity cannot see that by eliminating liberalism (which he classifies as part of the \\"evil\\" we must be delivered from) he is advocating a Republic form of government. Unlike Sean, I believe it's ok for people to have different opinions -- one of them crazy \\"liberal\\" ideas -- but for someone who claims his love for America with such fervency, it's ironic that he so clearly resents the most integral aspect of democracy: more than one voice. He equates 50% of the American population as on par with terrorists at worst, as opposition at best...I would argue that someone who loves and understands this country knows that the left and right are part of a system of checks and balances created in order to avoid one party having absolute power -- not enemies with clearly defined agendas of good and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overview of whats on his show","review":"He means well and is right on the money on most issues. What most people dont understand its not about left or right. Its about Emotion or Logic.Far left shoots from the hip and appeals to emotion. Resolving issues based on emotion alone is very dangerous (Far Left). Resolving issues based on pure logic (Far right) gives the \\"Spock\\" factor. Its much less dangerous but it steps on a lot of toes and seems cold. You have to learn to mix a little emotion with logic. Humans are creatures of emotion.

If you want to read a book that blindly defends all of the policies that have in the last four years destroyed the American Economy, alienated friendly nations who had been on our side since World War II, and destroyed many of the Liberties we have formerly held most dear in the last 225 years of American history, then this is the book for you. I couldn't wait to return this to the Library, and I would have felt severely ripped off had I purchased it.

It's written with the hate-filled intellect of a petulant second grader. It's obvious that he has no idea what's going on in the world outside of the one filled with the \\"usual suspects\\" in his incestuous circle of conservative pals.

To give him a fair go I gave the book a try but, just like that news channel, the outrageous self-delusion that it/they are ''fair and balanced'' makes me physically sick. How Mr. Hannity can spout the things he does with a straight face is beyond me. Believe it or not I am party-neutral. I detest hypocricy and stupidty no matter what you believe in. It just so happens that Mr. Hannity's fantasy world of self-righteous conservative thinking makes me want to throttle him when I read his book or watch him on TV.

Read this book and do the opposite and you will be OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Libs can't handle the truth","review":"After reading all of the negative customer reviews of this book Amazon chooses to print I feel obligated to tell readers this is a very interesting, very well written book. Liberals can't handle the truth & will attack anyone who holds views that are different than their views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go over with a fine tooth Colme","review":"I only have one question: when did Hannity get his lobotomy? He is without a doubt the stupidest commentator on TV; compared to him, Bill O'Reilly is a genius. This book is just more of his anti-liberal bias (we are to blame for everything bad in the world). Full of half-truths and spurious comments, it will no doubt appeal to the already converted. Anyone with an open mind, who can think rationally, will no doubt dismiss it as the cheap tripe it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rover barks for empire","review":"Comrade Hannity's list of three bad guys might have missed one, guess who? But the evidence has been so filtered in the patriotic mind control system that most Fox News fans wouldn't have read a bit of Chomsky on the evils of the number four, which has managed better than the others by keeping despotism invisible to the naked eye.This curiously trashy piece from the right wind talk show machine is an unpatriotic pastiche attempting the conservative impossible: preaching democracy to undermine it. Take a bit of moth eaten Magna Carta and regurgitated Tocqueville with harps playing on Liberty versus liberalism and the impossible turns a trick.From now on conservatives who denounce liberalism should be considered too stupid to read a bibliography on the subject or else be suspected of borderline fascism. This fellow bears watching. He could go through a red light and cross the threshold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrorism = Liberalism? I don't think so.","review":"I listen to Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, and Bill O'Riley each day. While Rush & O'Riley offer original views, Hannity seems to pound on the same topics. While I agree with many views, he comes off a bit phoney. I mean he won't let his 4 year-old kid watch Star Wars? My son has watched Star Wars since he could say DeeToo.Hannity should have decided what book he wanted to write. Terrorism is the biggest test America will face, but to compare it to Liberalism and poke his co-host in the eye with this goofy title is wrong.Hannity reminds me of the popular clicks in school. It you didn't talk, walk, and think they way they did you were somehow inferrior.Let Alan Colmes write the title for your next book. I must say this one makes you & Sweet Baby James look like pinheads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"A lot of the reviews on this page are bias, giving Hannity 1 star because of the idiocy of Bi-partisan politics (Congrats to simple minded people everywhere!).

Evil is behind everything we don't like, like terrorism and the democratic party. Why didn't anyone think of this before? It seems so simple once somebody points it out!Seriously, even though I am not a great intellectual and I dont have predictable politcail view (mixed views, I mean. I have mixed view), I have say that this book was insulting to me. These arguments simplify everything so much that they seem to be written for children (or maybe for adults who think like they are children). Teh fact that it is so successful makes me think there are either a lot of children buying this kind of book or (oh my God) so many adults who still have the intellectual background of children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The book caught my attention because of the inflamatory title, which I suppose it was intended to do. I wouldn't dare buy such garbage but a conservative friend of mine let me borrow it.The very premise that it is possible to prove that \\"absolute evil\\" exists and is present in our encounters with terrorism, despotism, and liberalism, is absolutley ludicrous. It's shortsighted and extremely slanted towards right-wing, christian morals. The opinion that the right is somehow morally superior to all else is suspect in itself.Conservatives like Hannity are all show and no go. They will use images (like the cover of the book) and declarations on their own behalf to claim patriotism and moralism just to make another buck. He and people like him get rich by selling lies to the public. They will tell you how to live and what is right...but it just doesn't apply to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair, Unbalance, Totally Untrue","review":"3 U's for Ugly is the way i rate this fiction.

I started reading his book the other day and fell asleep after about 10 minutes and the next thing I know - I'm awoken by a screaming dog YELP! YELP! YELP! I live next door and I've got to tell you. Whenever he has a bad day at work he takes it out on his dog Snowball. By me knowing his dogs name proves that I'm legit. He also yells at poor little snowball and calls it a Terrorist Liberal and kicks the poor dog out in the rain.

Seriously, the guy put terrorism, despotism, and LIBERALISM in the same sentence and seems to think them the same? Give me a break. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together can figure out pretty quickly he is advocating one party and one point of view in this country and that is NOT what this country is about. This is pure un-American rant.I forced myself to read the first 20 pages while sitting in a bookstore (I knew by page 2 I wasn't buying it). Yet another piece of drivel by someone who knows far less than he presumes to.*Yawn* Save your bucks and read the first several pages in the bookstore.

I would recommend for anyone that likes Sean Hannity's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most honest writer to come along in YEARS","review":"Sean Hannity tells it like it is. He blows the false face off of the appeasers of this world and shows how they try to politicize everything to make it fit their agenda. The liberal Democratic Party has become more like a spoiled brat child than a political party. The heads of the party lie, cheat, manufacture half truths, go back on their words, change their minds on a daily basis, and do everything but fall down kicking and screaming on the floor. Hannity finally tells it like it really is. WAKE UP LEFT LEANING AMERICA! Nothing wrong with leaning left, but for heaven's sake, be honest about it and proud enough of your convictions to stand behind them. Your leaders DON'T and that is proven in each chapter of this great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush Mouthpiece is Campaigning Hard","review":"Sean's latest book utilizes the notion of good vs. evil in the world along with a selective and revisionist history of the last 60 years to endorse Bush and denounce Kerry and the rest of the Democratic Party as extreme liberals, intent on passifying \\"The Terrorists\\" and incapable of fighting the \\"War on Terror\\". He continues on with his usual arguments: Reagan won the Cold War despite the liberals, Clinton appeased Saddam, and so forth...In addition to 3 hours on radio and 1 hour on television every day serving as a spokesman for the Bush administration, Hannity's new book is more of the same. Worse yet, he is currently on a book tour through swing states clearly campaigning for the president.While anyone is free to express his/her opinions, I find it disturbing that this man considers himself to be in the news business. Since when does a member of the news media actively campaign for a politician?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!!!!","review":"If someone wants to know what a real whacko is thinking then they should read this book. Here's a guy who never did anything but see something wrong in everybody that doesn't think the same way he does.

The gift, announced last Thursday by Secretary of State Colin Powell, in addition to other recent aid, makes the U.S. the main sponsor of the Taliban and rewards that \\"rogue regime\\" for declaring that opium growing is against the will of God. So, too, by the Taliban's estimation, are most human activities, but it's the ban on drugs that catches this administration's attention.\\"I would expect small government conservatives should be astonished to learn that the Bush admin's focus on expanding their governmental war on drugs was so great they literally gave millions to the enemy of the state. Wonder if any of that $43 million wound up in Osama's hands? I wonder.How many chapters would Hannity have devoted if this action was done by the Clintons? Again, I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's future is at stake","review":"Sean's book is an excellent explanation of how important the war on terrorism is to the future of America. He identifies the threats, the solutions, and the obstructionists who will enable the terrorists to destroy America. I also recommend that you read Charles Krauthammer's speech \\"Democratic RealismAn American Foreign Policy for a Unipolar World\\". It will help explain the US-view versus the World-view of this conflict and why Europe is not supporting America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time to read it!","review":"Yes, Sean tends to get excitable and odds are you are not going to change his opinion but he is a thoughtful, articulate individual whose writings are interesting and well written. He is passionate about his country and it shows in his writings and his speeches. This is the second of his books I have read and feel it is even better than the first. Read it with an open mind, you won't agree with every point he makes but I would be willing to bet you will stop and think several times throughout the book and this country needs people to stop and think for themselves, rather than become drones of the mainstream media constantly sipping Kool-aid and nodding vacantly at the evening news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many good ideas but ..................","review":"I am a daily listener to Mr. Hannity and I truly enjoyed this book. Even as a long time listener to Mr. Hannity, I learned much from this book. Some of the commentary at Amazon seems to be written by people who simply object to the provocative nature of the title and haven't read anything beyond the cover.I do think the title of this book is unfortunate. It probably helps sell the book, but it is more stident than necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are There TWO Versions of This Book?","review":"Looking over some of the other reviews of this book, I have to wonder if I read the same book as those who \\"panned\\" it. Mr Hannity makes some thought-provoking points that are worth contemplating, regardless of one's political and social ideology. When I hear about current events in the USA, I sometimes wonder if our nation is starting to become the \\"Great Satan\\" that radical Islamists frequently call us. With God's help, and with courageous and moral men such as Mr Hannity, maybe it won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliver us from narrow mindedness.","review":"Hannity paints the broadest of brushes, by lumping terrorism with liberalism. He misses the point of what true democracy is. Like other talk radio / TV pundits, he tries to limit the scope of the debate, by trying to discredit those with opposing opinions. He forgets that people with liberal opinions are patriotic Americans, too. They just disagree. Stick to the facts, make your best case, but drop the hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE PIECE OF WORTHLESS JUNK","review":"Why i tried to read this is beyond me.He is so up George Bush's ass with nothing to say.One sided arguments so easy to pierce..Fix your hair and stop writing horribly written inane books.I guess your dumb right wing Fox followers will love this crap.I don't get this guy at all.To me he is not smart, interesting or a good writer..I am glad he is one of the literary set of the right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliver Us From Dr. Evil - Hannity","review":"In this book, Sean Hannity says liberals are evil. He believes you are guilty until proven innocent, shipping jobs overseas is a good thing, over 3 million jobs will be created in 2004, the rich don't have to pay taxes, the deficit doesn't matter, trading immigration for oil is good, women have no right to choose, hate crime rules don't apply to gays, unprovoked attacks on other countries are ok, nobody can have WMD except us, and finally... there are WMD in Iraq.

If that was the case, sean hannity would not even have a job, he'd get laughed out of the media industry.

Does the war on terror have to be won...yes,do despots make the world a horrible place...yes, no one argues these points, yet Hannity thinks he's making some kind of revelation to the masses that only he is privy to.

Thanks Sean for giving us a source those of us who love this country can turn to for hope and wisdom. To me you are a lot more of a \\"Hero\\" than Mr Kerry could ever dream of being.

I recommend this book only for those who like hearing the tired Republican rhetoric repeated over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misconstrued understanding of terrorism","review":"Hanity believes that Terrorism can be defeated by simply inciting pre emptive war with other countries before they attack us. That's his philosophy but understanding a simple fact that terrorism is a tactic and not a people helps us understand first off that you can't stop terrorism because it's an idea that all enemies will use against us. Why do they attack us? Hannity believes that they attack us because we are free and prosperous. But the facts say that actually they attack us because we've been bombing Iran for 10 years and more. Let's help Hannity see the facts by showing how poorly he did in writing his political views for securing the nation. Our Economy colapsing is our greatest threat to our national security today.

I'll agree with Mr. Hannity that people like Hussein, Castro, Bin Laden, etc. are evil. However, when he calls other Americans (some of whom are among the most respected and beloved leaders in our country) he crosses the line. Also, unlike what the reviewer said, the partisan name-calling doesn't begin with the last two chapters; it actually starts on the second page (or title, depending on how you look at it). Still, for all of its faults, the book does contain a few reasonable arguements that hold up to fact checking, hence my two instead of one star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"Where are the facts Mr. Hannity?

He is an attack artist and then claims he (we) are being attacked by \\"the liberal conspiracy.\\" Stop being paranoid and hypocritical. If you are like Sean and you like a purely partisan one sided story, this book is definitely for you. For open minded people who like \\"fair and balanced\\" objective reading this is painful but again Sean is funny and it definitely had some laughs.We all know this guy is a former construction contractor with an electricians certificate and associates degree as his credentials.

His \\"irrefutable evidence,\\" as usual, can only be found in the recesses of his overactive imagination. He needs to take a deep breath and reconsider the misaligned hate he shows for liberals. This book is typical of the Hannity, Limbaugh, Savage mindless cult. Read this book to find out how the mindless right wing fundamentalist cults think. It's scary, if you were to compare Hannity's thought processes to someone from a fundamentalist Islamic militant group, they would be almost identical.Sad to see that people actually fall for this circus clown.

I'm sorry, but I am a Republican, and to say that we need to stop all totalitarian governments by unilaterally acting is a policy that the U.S. can, and should, no longer use.

Start reading news from Australia, the UK (and if you can speak a foreign language), Spain, France, Germany, Japan, etc. American news is biased. Forget right or left, but biased towards making America look good and putting band-aids on the fact that everything we've ever done in the world was not the best solution. And this goes for foreign policies under both Republican and Democratic presidents (Clinton was no saint either, see: Croatia). Broaden your horizons, read a paper or news source that isn't American and discover the truth isn't right or left, but usually somewhere in the middle.

Somewhere deep in his soul Sean must be thanking his lucky stars for both Bill Clinton's peccadilloes and Islamic terrorism--without them the only place his photo would be appearing would be on his Mom's mantel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chickenfeed","review":"I agree with a lot of these reviews in that this guy who never put on a uniform(To include all those rightwing talk show junkies)can sit back and give credit to the military and so phase it in such a way that you - the listener might be dumb enough to think that he, Sean Hannity ,had something to do with the victory in Iraq. With the Military we have in this country, a 5yr. old could of led it to victory over Iraq. He thinks that this is the greatest military conquest in History.

As a political writer, though, he swallows whatever bilge the Republican party says hook, line, and sinker. If George Bush (either one) and Bill Clinton took exactly the same action, he would praise Bush and criticize Clinton. If a president claims that invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 is somehow fighting terrotism, Hannity is there mindlessly cheering him on. As a conservative pundit, he lacks the intelligence of George Will or Thomas Sowell, the humor of Rush Limbaugh, the honest willingness to question his own party of Par Buchanan, or even the vemom of Ann Coulter. Hannity trying to write about politics is like a monkey trying to play Chopin on the piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Truth","review":"Sean Hannity exposes the lies, pandering, and appeasement that has led surpisingly to some of the darkest days of the last twenty or so years. The reference list indicates the long list of facts and data that back up the conclusions in the book. I'm not a blind conservative; I like to know what I agree and disagree about, but I can definitely say I've not found anything wrong with what I've read in this book. In fact, it is a wake-up call shining light onto the real agenda of those in the world who have it in for the USA, but also it shows how they use the extreme Left in this country (whether they are aware of it or not) against the interests of this country. If you have pride in this country and want to be armed to argue the great issues of our day, this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly liberals; don't you know Christ is for conservatives?","review":"It is hillarious how you self serving liberal wackos call on Christ whenever it suits your purpose.You have no core, no foundation, and no defensable position.

Are we Republicans getting more shrill or is it just my imagination?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliver us from Sean Hannity...","review":"Sean Hannity's \\"Deliver us from Evil\\" demonstrates that he fancies himself to be the next J. Lo of the Fox News Conservative Network, to the chagrin of Bill O'Reily. What will be next, the Sean Hannity movie? With broad strokes the author often manipulates facts and re-writes history to support his well known agenda and to pray on the weaknesses of his readers. Be cautioned, read this book only if you have a predilection to strong independent thought. However it is important that any person from the left or the right read the opposition's literature to more thoroughly understand their detractors. An educated national debate is a cornerstone of any democracy, and this is what I find so repugnant about the author. On \\"Hannity and Colmes\\" the so called journalist projects a unilateral view point, based on rhetoric and not on facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"what about Communist China?","review":"Yes, Sean...why don't you complain about China? A brutal, violent dictatorship which is filled with slave labor camps, political prisoners and death squads for those who openly disagree with their dictator's iron rule.Remember Tiannamen Square, Sean? College students were murdered for speaking out against Chinese communism. Millions of people are forced to work in slave labor camps their entire lives. No freedom for those people.Of course---George Bush, Sr. has business dealings with Communist China. He visits there often. And the dictator of China was recently welcomed at the White House.Conservatives like yourself love to pick and choose which brutal dictatorship they will become angry over. All others--you ignore. Why don't you cry a few tears over the enslaved Chinese for a change? Why don't you speak out for them? Why don't they even matter to you?In your next book, devote a chapter to the suffering people of China."},{"rating":"1","title":"that's a lot of money to spend on toilet paper","review":"I picked this book up in a Costco, which is as soulless and crass and consumptive as the author in question, whose bulbous, over hairsprayed head looks smug and smarmy and completely self righteouss on the cover. Deliver Us From Evil? Puh-lease I think the good lord Jesus would have knocked over Hannity's book table like so many of the other whorish moneychangers on the self righteouss right wing. His writing is purile, his circular arguments infuriating, his intellict questionable and his applause of BushCo's greedy administration is completely shameful. A sickening experience, without a note of truth or honor in its overpriced pages"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","review":"Having actually read the book I can say this book is an excellent read.

We have a duty to stand strong against those who would weaken us in the face of our declared enemies.Great job, Dr. Hannity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK !","review":"As one of Sean Hannity's many 4-hour-a-day radio and TV fans, I will say up front that I am majorly biased here. Still - I absolutely LOVED this book!Sean very clearly makes the case that when you side with certain liberal ideas that are generally regarded as intellectually viable, you are really siding AGAINST America. He doesn't need to specifically define liberalism; it is implicit in the definitions about what it is NOT - which is anything that will stand up in defence (yes, this is spelled correctly!) of our way of life.And don't worry Sean, I think that a vast majority of Americans are rallying and we will, in fact, politically defeat these liberals in pursuit of our greatly valued liberties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book!","review":"I appreciated Sean's frankness and knowledge of our country's military history. I learned more from reading this book than I did in public school. I agree with Sean's concerns about our policy's in the past and future and believe as he does that we need a leader like George W. Bush to deliver us from evil. That evil is continuning to happen on a daily basis in all parts of the world as I am writing this review in this democratic free society.I am so blessed to be an American! Again, everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it before you criticize","review":"I guess maybe that's not even enough... Maybe open your eyes before you read it as well? Ask yourself if Hannity has a point before spouting off what your liberal professor taught you?I'm sorry there's people out there who can't handle the lessons of history, like the great destruction caused by Chamberlin and Carter and the like. Thank God for people like George W. Bush who are willing to clean up the mistakes left by predecessors (including his own father) and for people like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh who continually remind us what you should've learned in your history books already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Liberal Response","review":"Isn't it interesting how liberals immediately become defensive when someone decides to expose them for what they are...Anti-Americans. Yeah, I said it.

It's time we stopped taking it on the chin and fight back. I applaude Sean Hannity for his courage to uncover the (blantant and obvious) double standard that exists in this country. He's a great American. Oh, and he's #1 on the NY Times list! Ouch, did you feel that shot? Believe me, it will keep getting worse. Why don't you liberals just throw in the towl and save yourselves the unnecessary beating. You can't win. The truth will always prevail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!","review":"Thank you Sean for this book.

If you have ever watched the American Propaganda Network(aka FOX news) you know what this book contains.He even attempts to play to the religious right with the title. Do not be taken in by this man attempting to make money off of you. There is nothing new in here, that you could not get by watching any heavily-leaning conservative right entertainment show.Really, donate some money to a soldier in Iraq, or help out the family of a man who is overseas.

COupled with what I've been hearing him say on his radio show anymore about gay and lesbian marriage just makes me sick. I'm not buying into this psycho babble from Hannity and Limbaugh anymore. We should take our country back from both the Democrats and Republicans. They are all out of control. And for God sake let gays and lebians marry each other. We need more loving couples in this country. If you're ready to hear the same old conservative bullcrap then this book is for you, but I personally give this a thumbs down.

One star is one too many.

I don't think anyone in the country would deny this assertion. This statement is not inherently about politics or government or any of it, and this is my main disagreement with this book. Hannity uses generalities to support his own, incredibly narrow view of politics in this country. His broad generalizations about \\"what liberals think\\" are absurd and completely unfounded. Given the tone and scope of this book, I don't think Hannity would give an admitted liberal the time of day, much less sit down for a cup of coffee to have an intelligent discussion about political theory. It is not unpatriotic to be critical of one's leader or state of government, nor is it evil. This kind of thinking is the true evil.I read this book in order to learn more about what and how modern conservatives think. If Hannity is the poster boy, then we are all in trouble, conservatives and liberals alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Brother would be proud","review":"Sean cranks out more double-speak and spin than Ann Coulter in a hot tub with Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage.More overly simplified 'shouting points' from the Bully King of Fox News Channel.Unintentionally hilarious.

Hannity simply cannot debate any opponent on any topic so he blithely talks over them, never hearing a word they say. Too bad Sean Penn didn't agree to come on his show and dare the lard-ass to call him all of those names to his face. It would have been sweet to see him get knocked on his 6-foot-wide waddling tub-butt. There is already a movie version of Hannity's tired repetitive typing session.

The subtitle for this book, which equates \\"liberalism\\" with despots and terrorists is all you need to know to see where he's coming from. What a light-weight blowhard!

His arguments are solidly based and his bases are acknowledged. All we hear elsewhere is \\"lies\\" and left field stuff which have no substantiation. It is very simple to say \\"lies\\" then follow it with nothing. Sean makes observations then backs them with current and historical evidence.

Funny how these republican Flag Waving Warmonger's are quick to send off American Youth to fight a war - based on Hyped intelligence - then will do everything to avoid admitting they where wrong.

The truth of the matter (such as I see it) is that people like Hannity never make a buisness or a country great, they are just over inflated egos who want to be the center of attention. Thankyou Fox and all your likes for exploiting the likes of Hannity. Even if you are a \\"not so intellectual\\" conservative this book is at best mediocre.

Sean's simplistic black-or-white thinking shows no real analysis. His proof always seems to be this is true because this is how I think it happened.

And this one feels like he knocked it off into a tape recorder over a coupla weekends, with poor research, horrible writing, and not one decent piece of insight.This book is about thuggery, misogyny, division, hatred, insult, and taunting, in short pure Sean Hannity.Don't buy this book, read the first chapter at your public library, and bemoan the state of this country because of people like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another arch-conservative wages \\"Jihad\\" against America.","review":"Flipping through the pages of this book--like any other book written by today's neoconservative--you can almost begin to fathom why George W Bush and his Republican junta are so reluctant to capture Osama Bin Laden (Bush's business partner).

And again, one must bear in mind that he is infinitely out of his depth when he talks about subjects like economics or that nefariously evil topic of \\"liberalism\\". Moreover, how can anyone expect an airhead like Sean Hannity to accurately define this alleged war on \\"terrorism\\" when even our own President Goober Bush consistently fails to do so every time he is asked about it?

I loved his first book, but this one is even better. Sean does an amazing job of setting up good vs. evil. That the acts of some leaders and politicians can only be described as evil. Sean, then takes the readers through many lessons in history to contrast the two basic approaches to dealing with evil: confront or appease. There is a very real difference between the appeasement of liberal democrats (Clinton and Carter) and the show of force used by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The results speak for themselves. Sean makes a very strong case and has definately done his homework, with more historial details and examples than I've seen since college!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He doesn't back down, that's for sure","review":"First, please do not let the 1-star reviews from those who never bothered to read this book throw you. Many are upset at Sean Hannity's #1 radio program and popular Fox News television program and are looking for a way to strike back. This is it.The truth is depotism and terrorism are the two most threatening issues America faces abroad, while liberalism is the prime force that threatens America's ability to fight depotism and terrorism - only this time, this threat comes from within. Hannity defends America's choice to liberate Iraq for the mutual safety of America and the Iraqi people. He supports George Bush's \\"moral clarity\\" and argues that democracy will survive only after despotism and terrorism are eliminated - hardly something to argue against."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God people like Sean Hannity are out there..","review":"Just finished the book and I must say.. In these troubled times when our country is under attack we have to thank God we have someone like George Bush in office and people like Sean Hannity to remind us what is really at stake here and why it would be bad for America if liberals were to regain power in this country.Sean goes into detail talking about the issues of our times and backs up his sometimes strong opinions with solid facts and leaves it up to the reader to decide if they agree or not. The book flows very smooth and is definatly worth reading..You won't be disappointed with this, whether u like the guy or not he speaks from the heart and is a real American hero.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let us join together","review":"Hannity has done a great job of looking at the evil in our world. He recognizes the great job our President has done. Those who detract do not believe they are evil but they are encouraging those in the world who would destroy us and make us nothing more than another third world nation. Thanks Sean for helping to Deliver Us From Evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Insight Into A World Gone Wrong","review":"As a liberal American I read this book with a great deal of skepticism. After pouring through the well written, well researched, and compelling arguments I can reach no other conclusion other then Sean Hannity is right on the money. America was attacked in 2001. We have been attacked before but the response has never been so immediate and so clear. Terrorists will continue to come at America and I am glad that we have people like Mr Hannity pointing it out to people that may doubt that, or have forgotten about 9/11. Highly recommended and 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Left Can't Handle the Truth","review":"Sean Hannity is a GREAT AMERICAN. It truly is pathetic to read reviews from the liberal left who haven't read this book yet. Sean in his book doesn't resort to the political hate speech these liberal lefts have used for the past year. If some of you wish to condemn something, you should have some intellectual authority to do so. Liberals are such hypocrites, for people who claim to be open minded, they don't listen or educate themselves on anything other than their world view. Pull your head out of your ass and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defaming three-thousand fallen Americans","review":"The partisan hypocrisy Mr. Hannity peddles on every page of this book exposes the self-righteous conceit that pervades the far right in this country. His discussion of the tragedy of September 11th and its aftermath is soiled by his relentless pursuit of his ideological agenda. Mr. Hannity should be ashamed of his partisan exploitation of the horror and grief of 9/11. Based upon the content of this book, it is clear to any objective American that Mr. Hannity either posesses the critical thinking skills of a turnip, or he is willing to defame the memory of three-thousand fallen Americans by using 9/ll as a political weapon."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh....","review":"I read this book hoping to educated myself further on the current political debate between liberals and conservatives. My goal was not fulfilled. This is yet another book from Hannity in which he proves nothing other than his lack of competency in the fields of writing and arguing. He's repetitive, misleading, and it is just plain difficult to understand what the heck this guy is talking about. Take my advice: pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your [money]--- Same Old [Crap}","review":"Sean Hillarity is back on his rant about everything he thinks is bad in the world today (Communism, World Hunger, Tooth Decay, etc...) is caused by \\"liberals.\\" Sean wraps himself up in the flag and spews invectives of how we must \\"rootout terrorists\\" before they destroy \\"the greatest country ever\\" by all kinds of violent means.

The book contains pages of footnotes and quotes to really show the true face of the Democratic party, past and present. It carefully covers the recent history of the American presidency and spotlights the facts versus fiction [or politics].

The world is a scary place, I believe the answer is to confront our fears, learn and move forward. Sean Hannity's philosophy is to put up walls and divide everything.\\"You're with us or against us\\" -- Forcing other other countries and fellow Americans to \\"pick a side\\" underminds free independant thought and is, in and off itself, un-american."},{"rating":"1","title":"low-brow, biased, simplistic and ignorant","review":"Sean Hannity's childish and overly simplified notions of evil espoused in this book serve only to highlight his own insecurities, prejudices, and closed-mindedness. Hannity's lack of education is obvious in his ignorance to the barriers we face between cultures, languages, and social classes in our modern world. He is unable to see past the borders of our society to see the REAL evils we face in life - the AIDS crisis, the destruction of the environment - that are global and that we face as a species. Instead he earnestly advocates the sociopathic role Bush has scripted for our country; America should attack, control, or supress anything that strikes our fancy just because we're the strongest and we can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto heads","review":"Funny- Hannity whined on his show that his book was getting bad Amazon reviewson Feb. 22 and by the 23rd, 140 new five star reviews were logged. Hannity is nothing but a republican political hack- he doesn't even have the independence of mind that Rush Limbaugh has. Did I read the book? Nah- I just skimmed it at Barnes and Noble, them moved it to the fiction section. Go ahead and buy it if you want. Better still, just send Sean $5 and save a tree. You won't learn anything new here that is not already in the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth ios Being Delivered- Libs Can't Handle the Truth!!","review":"While I'm the first to admit that Sean's work is not always the most intuitive, insightful, or creative, it DOES deal head on with the issues that matter most to Americans right now- the threat of terrorism and our need to fight it on all levels, and the moral corruption of our liberal politicians... Sean is EXCELLENT at exposing the libs for what they are- that's why he's viewed dangerous by his opponents... Unlike Rush, who's all intellect without the mass appeal to the mainstream (though he has a HUGE core following), Sean breaks down the issues to a level that the average person can decipher... The more these truths are exposes, the more the libs, and their views, are viewed as frauds... Great job Sean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Mooreons, Frankensttooges or Phillipsidiots","review":"I was at a national bookstore earlier today and was glad to see that Deliver Us From Evil is still in the top three best selling books (based on actual book sales)Apparently people are tired of the garbage disseminated by Moore, Franken and Phillips (didn't see their books anywhere among the top sellers) and finally are seeking the truth.Also recommend Sean's earlier book, \\"Let Freedom Ring.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberalism is a Disease","review":"Sean Hannity again nails the Left between their cowardly eyes. He points out the quiet subversion of our nation by those who still hold the candle for Socialism, Communism, and control of the masses. He lifts the rock, and exposes the evil and slime oozing from underneath. Liberalism is a disease of the mind perpetrated by the remnants of the old hippies who remember having a great-ol' time smoking pot, sleeping around, and protesting their government. Now they and their brainwashed children are running the Democrat party, and the new laughable protests today.

Hannity, If you do not enlist you are an appeaser and a chickenhawk.

It's almost as if Hannity wasn't from this planet. The insane rantings perpetuated by Hannity make me glad he works for Faux News and not a real news station. Arrogance oozes from each page followed by condescension. Not a good book and one star is far too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a single star. . .","review":"A total waste of money. I'm still puzzled as to why Hannity merits a book deal to begin with--I guess to jump on the bandwagon of his Fox News mate, Bill O'Reilly.

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!","review":"As someone who for a long time considered himself a Hannity fan via watching Fox News' Hannity and Colmes, I was disappointed to find out he isn't much on his own. Sampling the radio show and purchasing the book (audio book), he comes off as being very subdued and not enthuised. 98% on the War on Terror, while other authors such as Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage tackle a host of issues head on, is it's essential flaw. I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry Hannity and Hannity fans. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit's a Homerun!","review":"Sean Hannity does an excellent job of extending his ever growing talk show dialog.

After reading I took a long look at what we have become and I must say I am shaken to reality. Hannidy covers the gauntlet aggressively and accurately. How did we let ourselves become so complacent. It is time we speak out and speak up! Great book Mr. Hannidy and continue your coverage of these and other important issues of this modern America. It is time we speak out and speak up and let the political genre know our dissatisfaction with the way the country is going! Great writing, great research, and great timing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the problem with Liberals?","review":"After read Sean's books I have only one question, what is wrong with Liberals? The complaints that I have read posted here make me wonder if any of them have even read this or his other book. Everything he says is true, he has extensive footnotes that can be verfied easily. And being unable to attack his ideas they instead attack the man, very petty.

In the past several years the bashing of liberalism and the flag waving of conservatism has become a multi-million dollar industry. And everyone from Hannity to Rush to Drudge have made millions. Is that wrong? No, it's commercialism. Are the basis of their ideas wrong? Not necessarily. Their is some fact in what they begin with, but it is clearly over hyped and marketed and turned into bite-sized, candy, wrapped in commercialism that offers little substance to the reality of politics and diplomacy in America and the world. The real concern is how many people take this creative work as fact or as a guide to real American politics. Hannity's work may be as entertaining to you as watching professional wrestling. It's a fantastic stage show but reality greets you at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"This beyond a doubt the best book I have read recently that places most of the modern critical issues facely America today in context.

One of the best things about America is the fact that people like Hannity are free to express their \\"Opinions\\".

What kind of values do you have if you want to put the people in danger and actually increase the threat of terrorism (a threat that will always exist, no matter what we do).

A historically accurate contrast of the last 70 years of liberals appeasement to evil movements (Terrorism, Nazism & Communism) and the conservatives confrontation of them. The footnotes at the end of the book and historical fact are indisputable. The only people who won't like this book are hardcore liberals who have no grasp of history and, as usual, resort to name calling and empty rhetoric.

If you didn't like the style of writing Sean used, that's one thing, but if you didn't like the message, then it's time to wake up and smell the smoltering ashes of ground zero. Sean nailed libs in this book for EXACTLY what they are, power hungry zelots. I remember my grandaddy's bumper sticker that was old and faded....\\"THERE IS NO FREEDOM WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY\\". How True! Grow Up, be a productive member of society, and expect the same from your neighbors.

The only \\"one\\" word I can think of to describe Hannity is, \\"he is the lowest form of low life dirt bag trash scumb of the earth\\".

Sean lives in a fantasy black and white world where lies, deception and instilling fear are his mantra.One thing I can say is this guy can't write. If you're looking for attacks on liberals then use your closed-mindedness and enjoy it.I'm amazed he didn't drape himself in the American Flag as he did on his last book's cover. For this dribble he chose the Statue of Liberty !! How wonderful. All from a guy who never served in the military.Sean thinks he will be president one day. What a fake.It's all about money. Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distortion of truth","review":"Sean Hannity has mastered the art, even surpassed his idol, Rush Limbaugh, of distorting fact into fiction. As he passes off his own brand of partisan hatred, he accuses the \\"other side\\" of being guilty of his very sins. He never appllies the same standard of truth or principle to \\"his side\\" but constantly accuses the other side of having no \\"core values\\" and functions under the assumption that those who think differently are lacking in morals. This book is an insult to anyone capable of independent thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hell of a spin...","review":"The spin in this book only rivals that of which came from the radio broadcast airways of a country in western Europe in the 1930's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"Deliver us from Sean!

Most people don't like the truth, because it makes them take an honest look at themselves, their morals & values, politics and environment; if they don't like what they see, they get argumentative and combative, and slander the truth because it is easier than admitting their wrongs and doing something about it.Thank you, Sean, for making people see the truth, whether they like it or not.By the way...for all you liberals who find it easier to throw mud at the truth than sandbag your own flood of ineptitude...how many of you are published authors, with daily radio & television forums? I thought so (and don't forget...when the mud gets washed off, unfortunatly for you, the truth will still be there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make up your mind.","review":"The book gives some compelling reasons to vote as a conservative not necessarily a republican or democrat.

I would never tell anyone to not read this book, so I won't. But I would encourage people who do decide to read this book to take caution: You better use your brain, that's why God gave you one. You might be tempted to believe what Sean says in this lump of pulp because you like Sean, you think he is 'funny'. That my friend, is the process of \\"dumbing you down\\". You begin to believe the rhetoric as fact. You must liberate your mental state and CHECK the FACTS. Otherwise you are just another sheep in the herd that is enthusiastically dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"No point in reading this book.","review":"If you've ever listened to Hannity's radio show, you get this jist of his message. According to him, liberals are trying to dismantle the very fabric our nation is made of, and Hannity is the protagonist hero thats going to save us all. Yeah, right.I found HUNDREDS of inconsistancies in this book. from Clintons anti-terrorism policies, to quoted statements, Hannity lies. He's a propagandist, you're better off reading \\"Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them\\" or \\"Dude, Wheres my Country?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad","review":"Where did the notion come from that there is a segment of American society that doesn't believe evil exists? As an apolitical, but horrendous example, the kidnapping and murder of an innocent child amply demonstrates its existence, surely to everyone. And why does this author and his ilk ask why we have forgotten 9/11? Disagreement with the administration's response and actions since then does not equate to having forgotten. Unfortunately, simplistic notions such as these have replaced reason in this book and in so much of the far-right's discourse. Of course it's a lot more trouble to honestly examine an issue than to mindlessly fall in with the self-appointed arbiters of morality and justice (see \\"Hannitization\\", \\"Dittoheads\\", et.al.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you bought it, return it.","review":"I wish I could rate the book at zero stars or negative stars.

If Sean Hannity hadn't been a college dropout and had the chance to read classical books on liberalism, he would have changed his views about liberalism and/or he would have enlightened us with his take on liberalism. Unfortunately, the Irish thug chose the easy way, creating a \\"liberal\\" strawman that can be easily attacked on his several (too many??) media appearances.

The title of the book tells you all you need to know about the vacuousness of the entire book. Liberalism is evil? It is one thing to disagree about policy, but this book represents the worst form of unintelligent hate speech. A movement that has brought about equal rights for women and minorities is the equivalent of Hitler's Nazi's Germany?Hannity is an extremist and the book is dishonest. He distorts and blatantly misrepresents incidents and ignores history to support his very simplistic view on the world: Republicans are good, Democrats are bad.

Overlapping images brings breath to observation. Her's are not images of nature upon the dissection table, but nature alive and exuding itself. Her observations pierce the bone and marrow of nature revealing the transcendence and sacrament that is man's experience with nature. Her writings give off the scent of true experience, true life and true thought. Dillard is quite possibly the premiere essayist of our period."},{"rating":"2","title":"American classics.

That's a comparison I'll bet--though I haven't checked--must be a cliche by now, in comments on Dillard, and if so I'd further suspect that the author herself would be tired of it. Still, that's probably handy as a rough indication of which literary landscape is her natural habitat.

Sometimes Amira's instruction didn't match what she was doing. However much I tried to get into this dvd, I could not find anything beneficial to it. Maybe someone else will.Suhaila's \\"Bellydance Fitness Fusion Jazz\\" does an excellent job with getting the body going.

Mr. Marcincko has written a fine piece of embellishment that is full of action and machismo. As with the many type-A personalities in the teams, Marcincko has to have his way and spends too much time in the book explaining why his, and only his, way is superior and he consistently tells his tales so that he appears the victor in all situations.

The first book on any subject should be one that covers the topic briefly with accurate information using proper terminology and lots of pictures to convey meaning and hold one's interest. From there, the books should be more detailed until the scholarly texts are easy to read. I would recommend \\"The Art of Japanese Prints\\" by Nigel Cawthorne as a delightful first book on Japanese prints. Much information and terminology (i.e. all the proper terms for Japanese prints: surimona, hashira-e, kacho ya, bijin-ga, nishiki-e, kirazuri,etc.)is given in this 94 page book concerning traditional Japanese woodblock prints.

In its place are the light, playful (some might say sleazy) melodies of \\"Never In and Never out\\" or the bucolic \\"To a Void You Is All Now\\" or \\"How it Destructs.\\" A titchy darkness creeps into \\"To Them BC\\" and a contemplative \\"Build A Church With Your Fear\\" becomes a hymn with some plucked bass.

Halfway through the book I wanted to stop reading, but I made myself finish with the hope that it would get better. It didn't.Her heroine, Ella, was a 30 year old woman, a Judge no less, still living at home. She was very whinny and I just wanted her to shut up. I kept waiting for her to grow up and stop running to Daddy every time something happened. Her hero, Reed, was a jackass. I found nothing admirable or redeeming about him, at all. Their romance seemed very forced and the suspense was lacking, at best.All in all, this is not a book I would recommend to any one. I will, however, continue to read Ms.Barton's work because I know how well she writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book after reading another's review that compared it to a Linda Howard book.Whoa, Barton comes no where near the writing talent of Howard. A bit of a stilted writing style, peppered with comic-like cliché characters ... and topped off by a few lines so particularly embarrassingly bad that will make you cringe.I can't understand how a fan of Howard's could compare the authors.

I dont think the author has even an iota of what romance is as far as this book is concerned. People screwing around with others as if it is their sole work in life, coming up with lame excuses to justify them...God! And as an after thought to make the characters sound sympathetic, they are shown with a fake intent of undying love and care. Basically, romance books are supposed to make you feel good after reading them. This book in turn makes you question about do you really have relationships like this.

Almost felt like being in all of those wonderful places."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read for perspective and history on business leaders","review":"The writings of the business leaders of years ago can provide both some interesting perspective on how they set up their companies and a glimpse at the foundation of the practices that we've codified today. Reading this shows just how some of these people got ahead so far: they practiced business in ways that are only today becoming common.It's also interesting to get a more personal insight on some of these people. From religious extremists to elitists to people you wouldn't mind having live next door, these business leaders cover a wide range. These insight into their personal lives and beliefs also helps to explain why they were able to try out some of the practices they used, and in turn what corporate cultures they tend to be most successfully used in.But if you're looking for the most modern, polished, well-researched thought, this isn't the book for it. It's more of a historical look at business thought than a modern-day guidebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Set-Up","review":"Hoped to like this Paranormal set in the Victorian era but found the story very slow to develop, and in the end, unexciting.Can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Barbara Hambly, but this was really dull.","review":"I read the first book in this series and liked it well enough, but with this one, I just didn't care about anything that was going on in the story.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the scenes + under the covers at a Main Line wedding","review":"I found the eight main characters in this book enormously compelling. Mr. Prickett gave each of these individuals so much character development that even if you didn't identify with them (or didn't want to) you could understand the motives behind their (often self-destructive) actions. There was also enough intrigue and more than enough racy scandal to make it a very easy, fun, and fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SC book ever","review":"I have the 1st version (pdf), so I hesitated before I make the purchase. Now it turns out that the book is worthy every buck.1. Use coin tossing space consistently as working sample. Very intuitive, never get the idea lost in abstract concepts.2. Detailed workout of examples. Very good for self study.3. Plenty of hands-on homeworks. Not necessarily very challenging. But provide good amount of extra examples.If anything the book can add, I hope it can supply implementations, in Matlab or C++. Well, it may be far stretching for a math book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I wasn't a fan of Shreve's free notes, but words can't describe how bad this book is. Its too easy and insufficient for readers with a strong probability and measure background, and probably too difficult for readers with basic probability. Most of the interesting material comes from deriving the answer from the end of chapter questions, so I recommend doing all of them. On the other hand, the same material is lucidly and fully conveyed in any basic graduate level probability book. For those interested in learning the martingale measure approach to derivative pricing, try the classic from Baxter and Rennie. For those with basic mathematics, go with Neftci's Intro book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to option pricing","review":"Shreve's book is an excellent introduction to basic options pricing. He not only deals with plain vanilla options, but also shows how the binomial model can be used to to value exotic options. Each chapter has exercises which not only apply what is taught but force you to think and ensure that you really understand it.Little more than basic algebra is required to understand the text, making it very accessible. His expositions of topics such as martingales, markov processes, etc. are very good. The text can be dense, though--there's a great deal of information.In short, if you want an introduction of how options can be priced without the partial differential equations in the Black-Scholes model, this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think","review":"This book is printed in French but no where in the AD is this mentioned.

It is the quintessence of that lamentable recent breed of art-house \\"cook\\"books that are far better on the coffee table than on the kitchen counter. One overwrought, decorative, fussy recipe follows another in a titilating but ultimately boring succession of vanity shots. Basically, this book and its ilk are an extension of the interior decorating market: if you print it, they will come. Any experienced cook can glance through this book and instantly dismiss its recipes as outrageously unsuited to the domestic kitchen. Very silly indeed.

It is a collection of marvelous presentations, but unless you have a full professional kitchen, a couple of sous-chefs hanging around, and are the kind of person who loves to spend a week preparing the basic ingredients for an upcoming meal, this book should be enjoyed as a wonderful commercial for the restuarant, and not as a cookbook. Every \\"recipe\\" is a full blown presentation (see other review listing); a base preparation, under the star presentation supported by a cast of at least two if not three co-stars. And if you try to just make one of the items, I'm afraid you'll end up feeling inferior that you didn't prepare the full meal deal.Lovely photographs, by the way.Get the book from the library, save your money to take a trip to SF and eat at the restaurant.

The high point of the creative Miami Vice was in seasons two and three after the show got rolling in season one. The dynamic creative energy began to slip in season four and by season five the combination of poor writing, actors phoning it in, and missing characters caught up with what was once THE most daring show on TV. The plots are silly. Castillo disappears halfway through the season, only to briefly reappear at the final episode. Don Johnson disappears for several of the final episodes and there is an outright awful pilot about pretty boy young undercover cops that must be endured to be seen. I tried to count up how many bad guys Crockett and Tubbs had killed in five years: just about most of Latin America. By season five you could tell the drug dealers because they were wearing the stupidest costumes that could be designed.

I find this very frustrating.grrrrrThat is why I gave it a 2 star.The only good I find is:It eventually does work!But I have other Spatulas that do the same on the first try.I can't figure out why I would want to use this for getting out cake batter from the bowl if the end is so soft, or for anything else!!I only bought this Spatula to use for getting everything out of a can or Jar, I have not tryed it for anything else.If I find this works better for other uses, I will be back with more feedback.If I felt this was worth the postage to return it, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I like to scrape out jars & was looking to add to my silicone utensils.

I think I've used it twice & it just sits in the drawer. Shame of it is, I love the rest of my trudeaus.

You haven't learned enough from the basics to really participate in the dance at first.

That \\"wow!\\" episode is well thought through, having (good and) unexpected twists.The second episode - that I saw immediately after the 1st one - was disappointing in comparison. Nothing really new, not really credible and - without revealing too much details - the ending is close to loughable.The 3rd and last episode is better. We see our hero facing what affects him the most... And a surprising ending.Some extras to hear and see our favorite characters from a real-life point of view. Interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT","review":"I've read, watch and enjoyed almost every story, movie, (even silent offerings) for over 57 years of Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson!!

Darn these spoilers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on tv","review":"It didn't blow me away the way the first season did. I think simply bc it wasn't new but the first and third episodes this season are some of the best tv I've ever seen. This is on par with breaking bad or sopranos I think. The 90 minute episode format is great and both Sherlock and Holmes will be movie stars this time six months from now as Holmes is bilbo baggins in the hobbit. I can't rate highly enough this leaves our law and order and csi shows in JV, this show is the real deal. Great ending too and I love how they came back from last season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show","review":"What can I say that the headline doesn't already convey.

This is hands down the best one of 2012. The first and last episodes of the 3 episode season are both classics. Each episode is more like a movie than a TV episode as they run about 90 minutes. It's well written and brilliantly acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sherlock series that is worth your time","review":"This series of sherlock is brilliant.I highly recommend this series for the wit, mystery, and a great adaptation of the great detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, awesome, awesome","review":"\\"Sherlock\\" is one of the best shows on television right now. If you aren't watching it, you really should be. Season 2 definitely lived up to expectations. I think the very first episode, \\"A Scandal in Belgravia,\\" is hands-down the best episode of the season to date. The third episode of the season, \\"The Reichenbach Fall,\\" leaves you with an awesome cliffhanger, one that I am dying to see how they handle next season. Surprisingly, my least favorite episode of this season was \\"The Hounds of Baskerville.\\" It was an interesting episode, but as it is one of my favorite classic Sherlock Holmes tales, I think I really had a lot of expectations for this episode, and was slightly disappointed by the way it ultimately played out. I am still giving the season five stars, though, because it is just THAT GOOD. See for yourself if you haven't already done so!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Entertainment","review":"This is some of the most brilliant television I've ever seen. Season one was great, and I didn't really think it could be topped, but I was wrong. The writing, and the acting have only gotten better, and the modern interpretations of classic Sherlock Holmes stories are fascinating. Everyone involved with this production is on top of their game.I really hope that there's a season three, four, five, and so on. Masterful storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning follow up to Season 1","review":"Love this series, and nearly everything about it. A great contemporary take on a classic series. Moffat is still a genius.

The acting, cinematography, music and plot lines are great. Wish there were more of these made.

The intricacies of Doyle's super-sleuth are inherent. The writers have remained true to the original Sherlock with a modern twist. I have yet to be disappointed in any of the episodes and fervently pray for continued success and insight on the part of the producers of this series. I have been known to hold family and friends hostage for an hour and a half to see this show. I love Benedict Cumberbatch's version of this character. He brings Sherlock to life and and sneaks in a few moments of humor.You will ENJOY! Richenback Falls is the original death of Sherlock Holmes. Fortunately, Conan Doyle saw the wisdom in re in reincarnating Holmes. The Rihenbach Falls episode in this show, also gives viewers the hope to continue watching Sherlock. A smart, funny, and challenging show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome show","review":"Do not watch elementary. Watch this. You won't regret it. Cumberbitches for life.

Not at all like the last season - raunchy, filled with sexual perversion and R-rated images."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this product is a waste of money.","review":"The actor who plays Watson is outstanding. The actor who plays Sherlock must be one terrific actor to play a character who appears to have no depth, is arrogant, and really quite boring. The stories are boring. The stories jump around for no logical reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Everything about this serious is brilliant. The modern twist upon a classic character does not destroy him in the least. I have read every single Sherlock Holmes story written by Doyle and I can say even though these have a slightly differ take on Sherlock they are still really capturing the essence of him. I can not begin to tell you how much I have been loving this series, and I can not wait for the next season to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite show.","review":"The writing and acting in this show is phenomenal. It's amazing to see what Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch can do with just one expression. I got really attached to the all characters really quickly.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 2 keeps up the tension & the cliff-hangers","review":"The only reason I didn't rate this 5/5 is the lack of extras; there's only 1. By now the BBC knows they have a hit on their hands, so they could throw us a bone to tide us over until Season 3 appears next year (we hope)! There are 3 of the most famous stores re-imagined: \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", & \\"The Final Problem\\". The first 2 need to be seen at least twice to catch everything and understand where the characters are going; the last episode is so sad, it would be hard to watch more than once. If you liked season 1, buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"devolved","review":"after a promising first season, the series has devolved.the characters neurotically focus on themselves, and the mystery is incidental.there was only a single myster in the second season. what a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rendition of classic tale","review":"I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan and quite open to modern interpretations of Conan Doyle's classic tales. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The lead actors are quite well cast, and do a fine job, but the plot of this episode (which is virtually unrecognizable from the original Hound of the Baskervilles) is at best contrived and actually borders on the preposterous. Other episodes in this series are quite good---I was very disappointed with this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"Have to agree with previous reviewer. The Hound of Baskerville - lots of expectations for this one and it just fell flat. Interesting take on the hound tale, but it just went on and on and was..dare I say it? Boring? Also Holmes a bit caracaturish. The whole Mind Palace thing was cheesy and overacted (sorry Benedict - love you otherwise). It was also just a bit weird to see our favorite London detectives out on the moors. I know I know -- that's what I think of when I think of classic Sherlock Holmes but THIS Sherlock is all about London."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of Doyle's work.","review":"These versions are great and so are Holmes and Watson.

I love this show, as having been to london a few times and love it for all its history and charm, i just love this new update to a classic. its soooo well done. the first episode of season two is brilliant and kept me guessing and i loved it! loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I don't have anything negative to say about this television series: it's smartly written with an all-star cast. Benedict Cumberbatch has the brusque, no-nonsense attitude that works for a modern day Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman portrays Watson with a mild-manner fashion that is an enjoyment to watch. Both Cumberbatch and Freeman have great chemistry along with Rupert Graves (Lestrade).I highly recommend this is you're into fast-pace, interactive, and emotional television show with the feel of full-length adventures! In my opinion, the two last episodes of the second season shined brighter than the previous episodes -- and those were fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My purchase: Sherlock: Season Two","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed these shows.

If you like Sherlock Holmes this one is for you. Many twists and turns in the episodes. I just wish there were more."},{"rating":"2","title":"misunderstood!","review":"There is a lot more humor in this one than in any of the others. I watched this episode twice, and it wasn't until the second time through, that I saw all the subtleties in it. Watson calls Sherlock \\"Spock\\" when Sherlock bemoans the fact he's got an emotional response of fear. Sherlock admits in this episode that he really only has ONE friend, Watson. The very end shows just how determined Moriarity is regarding Sherlock. It's actually a fine episode, you just have to watch it closely and maybe more than once to get it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just good fun","review":"Totally enjoyable. In the days of reality television, it was nice to just kick back and watch the stories unfold. Sherlock is a bit out there, but the balance of Watson is just genius. The axillary characters are wonderful additions, but the Moriarty character is brilliant.Each episode was interesting but I have to admit the third episode of Season 2 was my favorite. I actually watched it twice to see if I could figure out what happened.The only drawback to the series is that sometimes the dialogue is softly spoken and quick and you can miss some of the conversation. Thank goodness for the DVR.Thank you PBS, now I have both seasons in my collection and can't wait for Season 3. More, please, sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take","review":"Season 2 of \\"Sherlock\\" takes 3 of the best and most famous cases of Holmes and updates them to the present day. So starting with really great stories by Doyle is a nice advantage.\\"Scandal\\" is the story of Irene Adler, one of the most durable of Doyle's characters and certainly his most memorable female character. I think they miss the mark making Adler a dominatrix here. That being said, the story is well done.\\"Hound\\" is also fairly well done although I'm not sure the modern twists add anything to the original story though.\\"Fall\\" is the best of the bunch and is very fast paced and exciting. We'll have to wait until Season 3 to see how they resolve the climax though.There's also a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" feature that is good although not as good as the First season's one. If you liked Season One and Holmes in general, you'll want this one too as it does some of the most important stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb acting","review":"The design and filming of Sherlock is inventive and engaging. Benedict Cumberbatch's acting (as well as Steven Mofatt) is amazing -- he is the epitome of modern-day Sherlock Holmes. Loved the use of technology in this series!

Rather than being a collection, it is the short story, \\"Beyond Lies the Wub\\" rather than the book, \\"Beyond Lies the Wub (Collected Stories: Vol 1)\\" For some reason, Amazon has bled the reviews from an existing book to this Project Gutenberg free short story.The story itself gives you a bit of a shiver (at about 25 pages rather than the claimed 411.) The writing isn't as polished as you'd expect from an author like P Dick. The reason being, it's his first published story (Planet Stories, July, 1952.)

Unfortunately, I would not recommend it. In my opinion, I found that the author does not have the masterful perspective of the massage therapy profession that one would hope for with a book like this. I also had a problem with it because it purports to give guidance to those who may not have the experience to know better. The reader without above average training in massage will have difficulty separating the wheat from the chaff in this book. Part of the problem is the massage profession is so dynamic that some of what is in the book is already outdated, e.g., the information on legislation and schools. Frankly, I've found better, more up to date information on the Web. Much of the vaunted information on setting up a practice is surpassed by info someone would get from the leading professional association and networking with more experienced therapists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the real issues","review":"The author really misses the real issues that a massage therapist are faced with on a daily basis because he is a lawyer trying to sell books on massage careers.While most of what he does say is true, there is much more to starting and building a successful massage career and since he has never done it ( he did go to massage school but from what I know this guy is a lawyer and has never had a full time career), this book is really lacking in addressing the real issues such as the low pay rates, career struggles, high rates of burnout in the profession and other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading is never a sin","review":"A book which is readable, fun and gives you insight to great works of literature is a good book.

One of the protest leaders is killed and the story becomes a very bad who-dun-it. I kept hoping for Sheffer to die, but alas that was not the case.The sole attraction of this film is the love scene between Bullock and Sheffer where she shows more skin than usual, with strategic spots missing the camera so as to not technically classify it as a nude scene per se.

And did it!I'll not review every cut, though most are well packaged and quite solid, but two are worthy of the highest accolades. Push Me Down is an original tune, perfectly constructed from a simple riff that builds and swirls and knocks you down, and Workin' On A Building, an old-time Gospel tune gets a performance here that will have you cranking the speakers up all the way.So, an eclectic mix of Souther rock, country, Gospel, electic blues and straight-out boogie makes a wonderful CD, something you can happily purchase and support independent, alternative, hard-working musicians.

And all that is a good thing.Greg Spradlin (guitar and vocals), Doug Simpson (drums and vocals), and Scott Finney (bass and vocals) throw themselves into the music and are equally at home whether reflecting on trials and tribulations in songs such as Feels Like Dust or flat-out rocking on a barn burner such as Things Will Change.I hope this will not be the only offering from the Greg Spradlin Outfit because this music is just too potent and original to be consigned to the cut-out bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"It was a great story and an ok read.

In essence, if you have half a brain and have spent any time trying to get published, you will know everything she discusses in this book. What she doesn't talk about--like every other agent who writes one of these books--is this: given how difficult it is to get an agent, how one really can break in.

I give this book five stars because it deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seminal work of great magnitude","review":"This book presents the culmination of many years of reseach by a professor whose nobel award is long overdue and in need of vast recognition by mainstream Western science.

Brilliantly elucidated, if you buy any book on Transpersonal Psychology make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry Mac does a great job.","review":"Larry Mac goes a great job in telling what to do to get your car on the track.

Boring delivery, tired playing, and a lame audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Wetton - in Asia!","review":"This live effort provides a good balance of Wetton's hits (from Asia, UK, King Crimson and his solo career) as well as newer efforts from his \\"Battle Lines\\" release. The wonderful acoustic version of \\"Heat of the Moment\\" provides a pleasant contrast to the original recording, and new offerings such as \\"Battle Lines\\" and \\"Hold Me Now\\" surpass the studio versions. Wetton's voice is in fine form, and his band is able to hold its own - and then some - over such diverse material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy-to-satisfy crowd","review":"As a former Asia fan (until John Wetton left the group), I bought Chasing The Dragon not only to listen to the well-known Asia hits live but also to get to know some of John Wetton's pre-Asia band stuff and post-Asia solo stuff. This album is a good way of doing so.Only... it seems there is not much to his other stuff. Asia can't do without Wetton, and Wetton doesn't seem to do without Asia. The Asia songs on this album miss the power and the rock soul of the original versions.So unless you like quiet live pop - Wetton IS a good singer - buy one of the first three Asia albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fragile","review":"It's real glass, very thin.

IMO this disc does not even measure up to Feel Euphoria, much less anything else in their catalog. I have all the other Beard discs.There are moments where there is potential but they quickly shift gears without ever realizing any momentum. These guys are enormously talented players, no doubt about it. Unfortunately there's not much here but sporadic demonstrations of techincal ability. The songs are weak with very little continuity and some of the lyrics are embarrassingly cliched. I was not against the idea of a new sound/direction from the band. A new \\"heavier\\" sound was implied prior to release. However I did not find this to be the case either. I think this album misses the mark regarding the prog and heavy sound targets. I have listened repeatedly but am not finding any improvement. I don't have any desire to listen again. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I just can't get into it......","review":"I must admit I was curious about the new Beard, having heard \\"Don't Try This At Home'.

What happened to Dave Meros (who could be argued to be the Generation X Chris Squire) laying down the bottom end? Most of the songs seem to be just flat-out riff-laden, instead of having any sense of groove or direction to them. SB is now a mediocre hard-rock band, and no longer a prog band.

Though I'm not a SB fan to begin with, I bought this curious to hear what today's progressive bands are producing. This album merely reveals mediocre musicians milking a dead horse.

In the history of music many bands have lost members or added members and still produced music that was just as great, but different, than the music that proceeded it, Fleetwood Mac, Genesis, The Small Faces, the Doobie Brothers to name a few. Do not pass this CD by because the band has changed, the music is still terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Uneven Masterpiece","review":"My first reaction to this album was disappointment. Then I tried a second much louder listen. The first seven tracks sound remarkably good in the car and turned on to the max. The song writing is madly uneven but NDV's drums are first rate and his his vocals are quite good. The bonus disc is 2 great songs and then 2 zero tracks and finish with a nice RYO piece.

From the jaunty opener, Night Train to Munich, to the last track, the very eerie and poignant Laughing into 1939, this album quintessentially chronicles the era between the wars. And does so in typical Stewart style -- pithy, evocative lyrics, catchy tunes, and the wit we've all come to know and love.If you're missing this one in your collection, get it. If you don't have a collection yet, you couldn't go wrong starting off with Between the Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing Into 1939","review":"Al Stewart is best remembered for his 1970s \\"AOR\\" hits, \\"Year of the Cat\\" & \\"Time Passages.\\" Although Stewart has continued to produce records since then, his American hits were limited to that brief period of time. That's unfortunate since for over 30 years, Stewart has produced an impressive quantity of good material. I like Stewart's work because he often incorporates historical events and imagery into his music. Sure, it can be a bit corny at times (and his 70s hits were pretty schmaltzy) but it's a step up from today's \\"urban\\" music for sure.In BETWEEN THE WARS, Al teamed-up with hotshot guitarist Laurence Juber (briefly of Wings). These songs are, as one might gather, \\"soundscapes\\" from that surreal period of time, 1918-1939. Not all the songs work equally well, but there is more than enough vintage Stewart for any fan. Thanks to Juber, many of the songs have a jazzy feel. I particularly liked \\"The Cause,\\" about the Spanish Civil War & \\"Laughing Into 1939.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean-Fresh-EXCELLENT !","review":"I'm 16 and I have listened to Al Stewart for the entirity of my life and this album is fantastic.

Sailing away from the devastation and desperation is a different approach than I have seen in most similar novels. Good character development also. I got a little tried of being seasick, but I guess they were on the boat alot. I've read all the apocalyptic books on all the Amazon lists and this one is worth the time.

I felt so moved the first time I heard it. The slow, piercing melodies played with the traditional Turkish instruments such as Saz, ney and oud. And the singers have a great vocal agility, such as only traditional singers do. The music never becomes light, always keeping to the slow rhythems that showcase the instrumental and vocal abilties of the performers.The music reminded me of trditional East European Jewish music -the similarity is to strong to be coincidetial.

The book is solid facts one after another, mostly taken from surviving documents such as financial transactions and Leonardo's notebooks.

The writing style is not fluid, perhaps a little choppy at times, since it is so fact-oriented.

I was truely amazed by how Mr. Potok took such great care to adjust the viewpoint and voice of the main character to her age and development throughout the novel. I also loved the way Mr. Potok weaved a character reminiscint of Kafka into this tale, adding powerful metaphor to the plot.I have recommended this novel to both friends and family, with each person finding it one of the better books they have ever read.

But Davita's Harp is not simply a coming of age tale; it is an exploration of the very nature of story. Potok is showing that for Davita, and his readers, story is how we find truth; story is how we shape our own lives. The story of Davita and her Harp then, is also the story of how stories shape our lives and our beliefs. This is a beautiful and thought provoking read, about the reality of growing up and searching for truth in a world that is terribly hard to understand--the world that all of us face."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Communism to Orthodox-Judaism","review":"I enjoyed reading Davita's Harp. I found it very intriguing that Potok managed to interweave Communism, Picasso the Spanish Civil War and the warmth of Orthodox Judaism. However, I did not think it realistic that Anne, who had always despised Orthodox Judaism, suddenly turned to it after her husband died. I also thought it was interesting that Davita is the first, and until now the only, female protagonist in Potok's oeuvre. She is also the only one who is brought up by non religious parents, but turns to Orthodoxy on her own account. Besides all this I found it a warm and captivating novel that makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our book club chose it","review":"Why they chose this dreary novel is beyond me.

They say that Ilana Davita does not ring true as a female character. I could not disagree more. So much about Ilana rings true. Much of her I recognize in myself. I too am the child of parents of strong ideology and had to find my own way. The cruel response of both teacher and classmates as she expressed her parents views about Stalin brought tears to my eyes. I recall a similar experience in my own life. It is a beautiful story of a girl longing for a feeling of belonging and finding it in Jewish faith. I recommend this book without reservation. Chaim Potok is a wonderful author, (he also wrote The Chosen which is my all time favorite book) and I think he created a believable, precocious, hurting girl who finds faith and healing and perseveres through hardship and injustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, as to the mind of the precocious heroine.","review":"I loved reading about this girl of my era, so different from my WASP upbringing in many ways, but universal in her need for love, protection, understanding and affirmation.

It would be okay if this little bit of annoyance sat on its own track, but it unfortunately serves as the beginning of the first track, ultimately ruining it. So every time you want to hear Fur Elise, you need to hear this annoying toy piano intro. If they had only put the toy piano intro on its own track, this CD would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy to have this in my collection!","review":"I had this cassette when I was a little girl...mom garage saled it accidentally and I had been missing it for a long time.

Chamaco Rivera took care of the vocals, with \\"Yayo El Indio\\"(Eladio Peguero) and Adalberto Santiago on the chorus. Three of the great sonero and composer \\"Meñique\\"(Miguel Barcasnegras)themes, found their way into this production; \\"Consorte\\", \\"El Hombre Que Hable Mal\\", and \\"La Vida\\".

I was not enthralled with Danny hovering around with a sort of angel as his guide, while he was in a comma or the divorce and sex in the book, but the story was gripping.

Honestly speaking, this would fail a basic film course in any Community College in the US. The narration is monotone and quickly read from a script, and often the accompanying video footage has nothing to do with the content. The same shots are rehashed over & over again, reinforcing the impression that the makers are long on experience but short on teaching skills.The makers may want to review Bill Burke's DVDs for tips on how to make a good intructional video on 4x4ing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backcountry 4X4 Recovery Tools and technique.","review":"I really liked this DVD and will watch it again to make sure I have the recovery techniques down pat.

I record all the tv shows that I miss while I am out of the country, and watch them while I am in hotels around the world.And, who needs an IPOD? I have all my favorite songs, radio programs and podcasts all in one convient place!I really like the simplicity of using Media Player to coordinate all my podcasts and music downloads too!I can usually watch videos for 4-5 hours before recharging and I am impressed with the ease of the recharger.

I used to own the Creative Portable media center, which is a huge pain compared to the archos. synching video to this player is a piece of cake and takes 1/2 the time that creative does. you can also record directly on to the device from your cable box, VCR or DVD player, which you cannot do with any of the other devices. The picture is not as good quality, but for all of the benefits, it is well worth it. The system runs like windows with folder type organization.

The sound quality goes down when you use headphones that adjust volume on the cable, so I would recommend using headphones that don't. Only issue I have is that the 700 uses a different size power cable than every other model and I could not find a replacement on the archos website (which isn't the easiest to navigate) and calling on the phone wasn't very effective either... I guess the company is geared to the advanced users, but geeks lose power cables too right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks.","review":"My wife bought one of these. First the good: it performs all of the tasks required moderately well.The bad: This thing is really expensive. This is almost as much as a laptop, and more than most used laptops with a dvd player. Also, for the cost of this, you could buy a dvd recorder and a portable dvd player and not worry about transferring anything. The biggest drawback is that you are at the mercy of your cable/sat. to put something worth recording on. Again, you can record rented dvds, but with a portable dvd player you would still rent and take it with you. This device has compatibility issues with Directv branded receivers.If you have other digital gadgets like an ipod or a laptop, this thing couldn't be a bigger waste of money.

Debbie includes personal interactions and tender stories about her own beloved family of pets and others she has personally helped. We have all seen pet psychics on television tell us what an animal is thinking but Deb includes backgroud information, contents of the communication and how she was able to help the pet or how the pet has actually communicated and helped its owner.

All of this changes however, when troops under the command of Archon-Princess Katherine Steiner-Davion invade his home planet of New Syrtis. Grayson is forced to take action. He can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch the war unfold because now it has come to him.This book is fairly well written but the constant jumping from place to place and character to character sometimes confused me. However, the author provides good details and the plot was exciting making \\"Imminent Crisis\\" a worthwhile book to read. The news casts at the beginning of each chapter were also a nice touch. Those interested in the Mech Warrior series should definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"A nice 'sidequel' to The Sword of Truth series.

It's advertised to explain how the boundaries were created, but the books in the series gives you enough information that it really doesn't matter. The plot was boring and it feels like he rushed to just pump it out to the market. Zedd's personality was totally different than in the books of the series, further adding to the pointlessness of the book. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par for Goodkind","review":"I am disappointed in this book. I had to discuss quite a number of points with a friend to clear up inconsistencies. As other readers point out, Zedd's daughter is too young to bear Richard. In the Sword of Truth series, the boundary went up many years ago and only the elderly remember it. The Mother Confessor's daughter in this book is 12. How does that relate to Kahlan? I am sure that Terry Goodkind could clear up the timeline if he wanted, but as it stands, this book creates an inconsistent timeline.Most confusing, is in the introduction Goodkind explains that this book is about two characters he has not been able to write enough about, Abby and Zedd. Who is Abby? She resembles Adie in some regards, however, is definitely not the same character. Both a friend of mine and I originally had the two characters confused, until we remembered that the character was named Adie and not Abby. I would reword the introduction to avoid confusing the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and not enough story","review":"This book seemed written as if Terry Goodkind just wanted to rush through it and was writing it only because he was forced. I have read it and books 1-4 and am now on number 5. I love the series, wonderful in depth character development, suspence, details, incredible plots. This book however is not worth buying. If you have to read it, borrow it from someone or check it out from a library. Stick with books 1-7, though 7 does not have Kahlan and Richard in it for the most part."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of fantasy!","review":"I am a huge fantasy fan and nothing has struck my fancy the way the Lord of the Rings had in middle school, but Debt of Bones was a lovely read! I really enjoyed it. I was interested in it enough to have a hard time putting it down. It was however very short, but in a way left me craving more and now I really would like to begin the Sword of Truth series. I got this one to get to know the authors style and to test how interested I would be and in the end I would say that I loved it! Great read in my opinion. If you are a fantasy fan I would give it a go! ^^"},{"rating":"1","title":"List Price is $4.99 not $5.99","review":"This is more of a novella, though it is 175 pages, the type is very large, what you would find in a juvenile book.My beef is that Amazon is charging $5.99 for a $4.99 suggested list book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debt of Bones","review":"The service was great.

The books with this error have been recalled so they can be destroyed and the correct ones can be printed--shame on the publisher for such a HUGE error!!Overall exceptional book though!! :) Loved reading some background information on Zedd--wish it'd gone more into his life with his wife and daughter and, perhaps, a young Richard. <G> but that's just me ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the others.","review":"The rating is a bit harsh, as it actually deserves a 2 1/2, but I\`m comparing it to the other books, which would have been going at a steady four. The massive Sword of Truth books aroused great expectations of Debt of Bones, which I think have not been fulfilled. The book is short)in comparison with 400 page up books) and the storyline is weak. Fine, people want to know about Zedd and his life, but not really like this. Pieces of his story hidden in each book would have created a better effect. As it is this book contains no mention of the main characters of the series whatsoever, and is quite dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"This one didn't need to be written. It was kind of interesting, but didn't really advance the plot, and seemed to be written almost as a children's story, in comparison to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool, even the prequel sounds a lot like a rehash","review":"Jeesh, how can you write a prequel and have it seem like you already wrote the story.... Maybe he got his ideas from First King of Shannara from Terry Brooks, which seemed an awful lot like Sword of Shannara just with different characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a short story, not a novel or even a novella. Around 120 pages including several illustrations (nice but add nothing to the story). Supposedly this story is going to give us insight into Zed and Abby, but does neither, and in fact many of the incidents in the story do not match with history revealed in other books. An example of this is how the barriers between the worlds were erected (by Zed in this story, by all the wizards 3000 years ago in other books). The character development is shallow - necessarily for such a short story. Do not expect anything like the other books in the series, or you too will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"This book is a rip off of the first order. 160 pages which can be read in 2 or 3 hrs.

Since \\"Debt of Bones\\" was a special price $2.99 novella, I figured it would be a good way to see if I wanted to invest in any more TG books. I was not overly impressed. While I admit that Fantasy is not my favorite type of fiction, I was still not taken in by the story or the writing in DoB. I felt it was somewhat flat. If this is a typical Goodkind story, then I might be able to read a stand alone book, but there is no way I would even attempt to read a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Well, I guess that I just expected that this was book 8 in the Sword of Truth series when I asked for it as a gift. Needless to say I was disappointed. My initial reaction was that Goodkind must have needed some quick cash and decided to whip this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing story","review":"I found this book to be a little contradictive to the Sword of Truth saga in the relationship between Abby and Zed. As a stand alone story is was very mediocre. As part of the Sword of Truth saga, it really did not add very much. I was dissapointed and can not really recomend it unless you are a Goodkind affectionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good but OK...","review":"This Terry Goodkind Novel was not as interesting as the original Sword of Truth books but it wasn't bad!I am a freshman in high school and it took me 2 1/2 hrs to read; so it is not nearly as long as the others.I really liked it because it was a chance to get reunited with Zedd. we learn what happens before Richard is born and how the war with Panis Rahl and D'Hara ends. The boundaries are created and some new caracters are even introduced. I recommend this book to someone who has already read the sword of truth series or to someone who has a new interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and throws off everything","review":"Very good story, to say the nice thing first. Extremely too short. And it added confusion as to what the actual timeline is for things. The boundary goes up, Richard couldn't possibly have been concieved yet, Zedd intends to throw up the second boundary in a year, and it just doesnt make any sense that way. Is there something I am missing? Something I have forgotten? Something that makes it possible for Richard's mother to get old enough to be abducted and concieve him, AFTER the boundaries are all up? It's not making any sense this way. Very disenchanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it in LEGENDS instead","review":"Four stars for the story, one star for this printing. This is a good prequel to the Sword of Truth series, giving background information on Zedd. Don't bother buying it as a separate book, when you can get basically the same story in the LEGENDS collection of short stories. Plus, there's a short story by George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire prequel) in the same book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential","review":"The Sword of Truth series of books is one of my favorite fantasy sagas. I bought this novel to tide me over between the last installment. Frankly I didn't expect much and that's what I got. Boring. It didn't have any real spark to it. I think Terry Goodkind whipped this sucker out in a weekend of boredom and disappointed me (and others) with a lackluster flop. I hope the next Sword of Truth book will be back on track; it is a great series. I highly reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyler A Fantasy Connosuire","review":"This Novelette is great! As always Goodkind uses his details to paint a picture in his mind. His foreshadowing techniques are flawless. This book depicts te last days of the war between the Midlands and D'Hara with Panis as the ruler. This is the creation of the boundries between the lands which play a semi-important role in Wizards First Rule. Zedd is as awesome as ever. if you ever read this Goodkind Please include My second favorite character, Chase, in an upcoming novel.

Syncopation has members from Los Cincos, but they are definatly not the same. Syncopation is much more experimental, and their musical capabilities skyrocket in this project. I beleive that this is the only album that was \\"realeased\\" Yet they made a few bootlegs that they sold at their shows, that showcased their talent in a more fitting matter. If I had to compare them to other music, I would say a jazzier Captain Beefheart without the blues vocals, but that doesnt even do them justice.

In no uncertain terms, it clearly and concisely lays out exactly what to do and how to act in personal and business relationships to increase ones power, influence, prestige and popularity. Don't be misled by the language of the books title and other titles by this author. This isn't a book on how to gain power by being a backstabbing, dishonerable little person.

These are much worse than my regular wrist weights in terms of sliding on my wrists. I would return them, but it's about $15, so I probably just won't bother. Please don't waste your money.

She is now almost 4 and still enjoys the pretend play with the doctor's tools, and she likes to place various trinkets inside the compartments for safe-keeping. Now that my son is almost 2, he is starting to attempt to use the keys in the locks as well. It is a good way to introduce colors (which key matches which door), work on fine motor skills (locking/unlocking), and encourage pretend play. I love that all the pieces fit inside the lid at the top. But most of all, I love that this toy is designed for the child to do all the work.

One song starts :\\"Mi sveglio e mi tocco la faccia, per oggi e' rimasta al suo posto\\" (I wake and I stroke my face, for today it is still in its place).

I especially enjoyed the pictures of all the kanzashi, kimono, dance classes, and different hairstyles. It is nice to see pictures of geisha and okaasan, as well as maiko. Most of my other books concentrate on pictures of maiko while talking about geisha. The text is very easy to read and is pretty informative.

But you find yourself wanting to savor this story, read it slowly, because it ends all too soon. It is filled with twists and turns and you wonder if Leslie and Sara will ever get together.

This book was the only book I used to study for the exam. I felt that the book summarized the important information in each subject area very well. The information in each chapter was up to date as well. The practice exams on the CD that comes with the book were only somewhat helpful. The main criticism I have for the practice exams is that there is less text to read in the questions compared to the actual exam. When you write the Praxis, you will find that many of the questions require a lot of reading before you can answer the questions.

It made me scared to buy any Dutch goth metal, but I later found out that Within Temptation is a really good band. Anyways, Orphange, in my mind, is a simplistic, badly produced attempt at goth metal. They pale in comparison to the kings of the genre, Tristania. The best part of goth metal is the female vocals. With Orphanage, the female vocs are pathetic compared to the likes of Vibeke Stene, Liv Kristen, and Sharon Adel. The male vocals are, of course, growled, but they aren't too good either. The songs get boring, but the lyrics are good.

Apparently the Olay product I used was not this because I have horrible redness left after each useage which has been twice since buying this and each time it left me with the same result. My skin which was normal before was inflamed afterward and acme which I did not know was there before, suddenly appeared and left the entire area red and horribly noticeable. It also managed to pop open a few of my pimples which where nearly completely gone, leaving them red and irritated. If you have acme or possibly have acme I would not recommend this product to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh oh...","review":"I really loved this product. In fact, I have yet to find another scrub as good as this one. But, I just found out that Olay still tests their products on animals. I just think that there is no place for animal testing anymore.

Can anyone recommend a good scrub alternative?"},{"rating":"1","title":"At most a good scrub","review":"At most this is a good scrub. After using it, I feel that my skin is squeaky clean.

A day later, still nothing. A peel later, still nothing....I would not recommend buying this product, unless you could return it after you gave it a go.

Also I have just begun using/drinking Meiji's amino collagen powder to revitalize some collagen in my system to help improve skin color and texture.

Step one is the actual micro dermabrasion and step two is a foaming process to activate step one even more. The actual microdermabrasion granules are much too abrasive for my sensitive skin. Step two did nothing -- no foam, no activation, nothing. I called the company and they agreed that something was not right. I returned it to the drug store I got it form for a refund.

After this, I put on the Olay peel.For my face, I find it best to use the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit. I apply the crystals and then use the Clarisonic Pro to \\"grind\\" it into my face.

Massage gently as the crystals are kind of scratchy, but needed to get ultra soft, smooth skin.

Here the songwriting is a bit less mature, but this album displays her in all her raw, ferocious glory. One listen to the intense vocal acrobatics she performs on \\"Am I The One\\", and you will understand why her fans are so devoted to her.

The title \\"Sea Hunter\\" is weak and misleading.2. The cover picture is also weak and misleading.3. The story idea is creative.4. The majority of the book (sans the last 18 pages; the ending) is interestingly detailed and well written, so as to make the story captivating. The story builds up well to an interesting climax.5. The ending (i.e., 18 pages) is largely disappointing, rushed, and weak. It's as though the writer suddenly reached a maximum page length or deadline and rushed to write the ending. The story details drop noticeably to a substantive low, leaving readers with many loose ends, particularly as relating to the creature and the villains. Essentially, the ending is poorly contrived and written.In summary, its a fun read until the ending, which rapidly deflates to a weak ending.Two stars because the writer wrote well until the ending and then wasted his and my time with a weak ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"This book was a little slow to get going, but then really took off at the end!

As someone who has chosen not to have children, it was refreshing to find a book that agreed with things I've been saying all along - that the maternal instinct is a myth and that many people have children for all the wrong reasons. While the title makes the book sound like it's anti-parenthood, that just isn't true. This would be a good book for someone who is considering parenthood to help them determine if they really want children or if they are just caving in to societal pressure. And if you do decide to have children, this book lists why it's best for everyone if you limit your family size.While the book is a bit dated (published in 1971) I believe its message is still important today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvard Business Review on Managing the Value Chain","review":"Excellent cases.If you are an operations professional, you'll study, learn and live by whats discussed here.

With OSB and particle board the carbide teeth provide no improvement over much cheaper bi-metal hole saws and take as much drill power which makes them usable with cord drills only.The seller states that these are good for stainless steel and tile and nothing could be further from the truth.

Otherwise, it's just a conflagration of Neo-Wiccan nonsense. Even in the intro she tries to present some sort of Matriarchal Great Goddess story, and then associate the ancient Celts(how many times do we have to kill this myth before it dies?). The word \\"Celtic\\" is only in the title to win the favor of the gullible New Agey type. If you want a Celtic cookbook, go buy one. If you want a load of New Age tripe, go buy that.

As a professional remodeling contractor, I recommend this battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"$55 for the battery or $129 for the kit!?!?!","review":"I have the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit and one of the batteries started not holding a charge. So I brought it upstairs to my computer and typed in the model (1234) and found this page. They want $55 for the battery. You can buy the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit with TWO of these exact batteries ($110 purchased individually) and that means the charger and drill itself cost $19.That's just stupid.So I bought another kit. Instead of spending $55 for one battery, I spent $129 and now I have TWO drills, THREE good batteries and TWO chargers.In other words, unless you are flat broke, you're better off buying another kit than you are just replacing a bad battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works.

I read the package and see that the charger DC1414 that I have used for the same batteries can no longer be used to charge the new battery pack.

The batteries came and they are absolute junk. After charging, I get at most 1-2 minutes of light use out of them. No, I am not exaggerating. In fact, they don't hold a charge any better than the used batteries that I was replacing. I wasted $100 on these worthless batteries. Unfortnately, I can't return them because 30 days has expired since I bought them. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THESE BATTERIES. THEY ARE A WASTE! I expected more from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"For the money, one of Ayoob's or Hogg's books is a far better value than this one. To concurr with the other one star reviewer, I was shocked at the number of impractical/uncommonly encountered handguns listed by the author, many of which were rated higher than practical (and much more commonly available) defensive handguns. When I purchased this book, I thought combat would include personal defense, but was vastly disappointed to find out the author seems to think combat means only in the militaristic sense. Save your money and buy one of the better quality books out there that covers both practial and uncommonly found handguns, and is also more up to date. This book should be priced about the same level or even cheaper than Jane's guide to guns because of how similarly disappointing both books are. I regret putting this book on my Amazon wishlist. Once I got it and started reading it, I realized quickly that I'd have been better off selecting something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves the DVD","review":"This DVD was both entertaining and informative.

I was hoping to teach my students things like make a list, act it out, etc. Essentially, you watch a standardized test taken and videotaped -snoozer. \\"Rock\\" and Learn has no music either."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Undiscoverd Master of the Lied","review":"The two volumes of songs by Robert Kahn (1865-1951), sung by tenor Martin Dillon, are an important contribution to the recorded heritage of the German lied, and a most attractive listening experience. A Jew, Kahn had the good fortune to leave Germany for England in l939, but his work was long suppressed and has yet to see the revival of interest it deserves.There is no great melodic gift displayed here but musical and expressive talent abounds, and I'd guess that some of these songs could be passed off as written by Hugo Wolf without too many raised eyebrows. Dillon doesn't have a \\"beautiful\\" voice, but he has the style down pat, as do David Holkeboer, the pianist on this first disc, and the two string players who join him on the refreshing seven-lieder Jungbrunnen cycle. For a brief description of the second disc, see my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Samples Incorrectly Labeled","review":"Some lovely music but the samples are incorrectly labeled. Sample 1 is actually Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Saens, Sample 2 is Funeral March For a Marionette by Charles Gounod, Sample 3 is Night On Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky, Sample 4 is March to the Scaffold from Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz, Sample 5 is In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt by Edvard Grieg, Sample 6 is The Mephisto Waltz No. 1 by Franz Liszt, Sample 7 is The Sorcerers Apprentice by Paul Dukas.

This is a Halloween classic and is played frequently to great effect. Most recently I heard it played in the movie \\"Tombstone\\" (starring Val Kilmer, et al) during the traveling theatre group's play.This collection takes popular tunes from just as popular films. Of course, all of these can be heard in several films. These are just the most popular... or ones I am familiar with.1. Toccata & Fugue In D (Phantom Of The Opera)2.

One man's trash is another man's treasure, and if there are purchasers out there who thought this stuff was remotely spine-tingling, well....whatever floats your boat.This is good classical music but there's nothing here that will evoke images of impending doom, morbid scenarios, scary movies or anything that would warrant playing this at Halloween or during any other dark episodes of one's life.I bought \\"Music To Die For\\" and that didn't do it either. I'm going for \\"Funeral Music\\" here on Amazon next...at $10 a pop, it'd better do something better than make me feel like I'm at a high-class Italian restaurant."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I only brought it for one song then I was disappointed with the rest of the CD I had to give it to someone else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes off a bit...um...cumbersome","review":"I'm a huge fan of the two singles off this album, \`Cumbersome' and \`Water's Edge' but I'm a little let down on the unoriginality of the rest of this album. Many of the songs sound very regurgitated. The lead singer's voice is decent and works well for songs like the aforementioned, but on songs like \`Lame' (which is just that) he sounds out of place, shaky and uncertain. The only other songs I actually liked enough to listen to again were \`My My' and \`Anything' but even they are nothing new or anything special. Songs like \`Lame' and \`Roderigo' fumble in pure stupidity while \`Devil Boy' just tries to hard, as does the closer \`Favorite Dog'. I actually liked the concept behind \`Punch in Punch Out', not so much as lyric-wise but the idea of singing over nothing but drums, it's different, but it just doesn't quite work like it should. All in all this album is only as good as its singles, and for two songs I can't say it's entirely worth the sticker price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Jam/Nirvana/Live Redux","review":"When I first heard \\"Cumbersome\\" on the radio, I said to my friend \\"This new Pearl Jam song sucks!\\". To my relief, I soon realized it wasn't actually Pearl Jam, but a cheap, two-bit knockoff that's trying to exploit Pearl Jam's success and ride their coat tails to the MTV \\"Buzz Bin\\".When I first heard \\"Water's Edge\\", I said to my friend \\"This new Live song sucks!\\"...you know how the rest of the story goes. Despite all this, Seven Mary Three are still raking in the accolades for taking some of today's best music and dumbing it down for mass-consumption. In ten or twenty years, when Pearl Jam is being inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their won't be a soul in sight who will remember this embarrasing moment in history.

I was most impressed with her writing, her worldly experiences and her genuineness. I actually went on her website and listened to a conference she had that had been taped. WOW. This is one dynamic human being with a heart as big as Texas. I love dogs--always have--and she captures something about them that even I hadn't given them credit for. It's definitely not an easy read, however and you must pause, put the book down and reflect on her ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT book.","review":"I am near the end and when I finish it I will immediately read it again, this time with a highlighter in hand. It is a spiritual primer. Not only are the stories about the dogs wonderful, but Ms. Houston's insights are incredible.

I love that Sookie was unattached and joined the Faes. Ugh, it was all so amazing. Plus alot happened this season.

Devil Anse, and his son, Cap Hatfield, were extremely dangerous men at a time when families stood up for themselves. For the most part the area was void of professional law enforceent, and clanish people relied on settling skirmishes their own way. I suggest that folks who like history give this book a try.

I wasn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a history lesson!","review":"Lets see: History, WV, Hatfield & McCoy Feud, Civil War - I could ask for nothing more in a book, and this one did not disappoint me. Well written, an easy read and perfect subject matter. I learned so much I did not know about the economics, history and life during those times and I feel much more informed about my state of WV. Although it was written by a Hatfield, I felt I got to know the McCoys also, and not all biased in the information. I really loved it and it is a must for those interested in the four subjects I mentioned - or especially if all you know about those times is what you saw in the mini-series. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tale of the Devil: The Biography of Devil Anse Hatfield","review":"After viewing the Kevin Costner performance as Devil Anse on television, I was inspired to read and learn more about the Hatfield and McCoy families and their feud. The first book that I read seemed poorly written, had disorganized and confusing content. I decided to buy another book, \\"The Tale of the Devil ...,\\" and found it to more than make up for my initial reading experience. Very well written, organized, and, in fact, it contained much of the text from my first reading, that was written by Devil Anse's grandson, but included explanations by the new author. If anyone desires an easy to read, comprehensive writing on the subject of the Hatfield/McCoy story, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good/decent...","review":"I had first heard of this outfit via the \\"Compost\\" label and, oddly enough, Kruder & Dorfmeister. That being said, this really falls into a slightly different category than what I had expected.If I had to try to classify these guys, I'd say they were the stronger hip-hop side of K&D. There are many guest appearances on this release, the most notable of which is Tricky. And, if you know what Tricky sounds like (pre-his latest release), you'll get the idea. If K&D tried to remix the \\"pre-millenium tension\\" cd, you'd get this release.It's not a bad release. In fact, it's one that I'm glad I own. However, it can be very dark and depressing at times, which is fine in healthy doses. Whereas much of K&D and Theivery's stuff is good for sitting back in the Herman Miller sipping your favorite \\"adult beverage,\\" this cd is almost suitable for prowling the city streets at night, in the rain, wearing a big hooded coat, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Lover","review":"I gave Freak Unleased two stars, because I was into the story at times.

Johanna got what she deserved, and then some. I would have liked to see more of Kendall and David before he lefted, to see why and how she missed the signs of him cheating.

I honestly did not even know that LG made this ladder until a search here on Amazon. The ability to make the front leg shorter is a tremendous advantage over standard orchard ladders.

It is Tim Keller's essay that resonated most with me. Especially (1) his exposition of the Calvinistic approach to Corporate Worship; and, (2) his appeal to \\"Isaianic,\\" \\"Mosaic\\" and \\"Emmaus\\" cycles for ordering worship. It was important for us to see how Calvin consulted the Bible, culture and tradition in structuring worship. Also, Keller's explanation of how Calvinistic worship was relevant to the postmodern culture of today is very informative as we structure worship in our own churches today. The cycles of worship take on new names in the Redeemer liturgy: \\"the praise cycle,\\" \\"the renewal cycle,\\" and \\"the commitment cycle.\\" To see how we can devise liturgical formulations that are deeply rooted in a covenantal approach is very enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ladder","review":"This is a sturdy well made ladder that offers a very convenient adjustment range to work at the optimum height in my apartment (ceilings as high as 11 feet).

Even here there are no tables for the different types of ammunition, a very cursory developement history, no comparison to foreign designs (except to say that the American 57mm M1 is a copy of the 6pdr, true but not relevant) The lack of a developement history and especially a discussion on what lead to the decision on building a 2pdr and later 6pdr gun was especially dissapointing.

It wasn\`t insightful at all and it is very difficult to take this book seriously. It basically states that you can overcome fear by touching your body in certain ways. It just doesn\`t make sense. I think that I\`m open minded, but the book could at least assume that its readers may be critical and try to address the fact that it seems to be very hokey. What surprises me is that people have written positive reviews for the book. I guess it\`s the placebo effect of people projecting that they will gain something from this book.

James Gandolfini, Kristen Stewart and Melissa Leo give brilliant performances and the chemistry between the three is simply a delight to watch. Kristen Stewart gives one of her very best performances here, her chemistry with James Gandolfini is simply outstanding, and Gandolfini easily steals the show with a very powerful performance, he plays 'Doug' a very common man who could be you, who could be me. We literally see every situation from Doug's perspective and easily make out what could be going on in his mind, every time. Melissa Leo gives a very neat performance as well. Overall, not a masterpiece of a great film, but a decent film with characters whom you can easily relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent real movie!","review":"This is a great character-driven movie.

Good premise but huge gaps in logic (why do long-ago car crashes cause these people to do these outlandish things). \\"Mallory's\\" motivations are especially unclear.We know and like these actors. But Stewart does not yet have the training or gravitas to pull this off. Her trademark jaw dislocations and rapid-fire pile-ups in delivery make me think of Bella. Gando struggles with an Indiana accent (and this isn't it). Leo's character (and the two have been together since grade school) mysteriously has no accent. What? Why bother?I applaud grown-up flicks like this but this one is too thin and not well thought through. Soundtrack was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"feral girl","review":"I thought Kristen Stewart was amazing in this movie. Her character, a teenage runaway/dancer/prostitute, reminded me of a feral cat: small, spitting, scared, ready to fight. Her eyes constantly sparked, moved, looked for an exit. James Gandolfini played a wonderful dad figure. Melissa Leo's character was just the kind of smother mom substitute to set off the explosive Kristen.In the end, Kristen's character has run away again and resumed her solitary life. But this time she is calm, her black eye-ringing makeup is gone and you sense that she is will be kinder to herself in the future, thanks to this couple who love and need her and cared for her for such a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTTR Was AMAZING!","review":"I LOVE this movie!

How does this chance encounter affect the amnesia of convenience that has been created in the intervening 20 years?What we get instead is a smorgasbord, as there isn't much that doesn't find its way into \\"Bitter Fruit\\": rape, recovery from rape, memory, differing perceptions of the same even, incest (three different ways), police brutality, gun violence, marital tensions, biracial people, racial tensions, angst about identity, nature vs. nurture, religious confusion, unwanted children, and, to top it all off, mysterious Muslim men with an unclear agenda, until reading starts to become painful. The book is more indigestible than bitter. It's simply too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Novel by an Activist.","review":"In spite of trying, I could not complete the 'Bitter Fruit'!This is a story of a black middle-class family in post-apartheid South Africa. After years of struggle and deprivation they now enjoy material comforts, but events from the brutal past give them no peace of mind. The story of Silas family’s struggles to come to terms with the past, even as prosperity and equality beckons, is used as a metaphor for the dilemma in present-day South Africa. While the Truth and Reconciliation Committee works to heal the society from the indignities of the apartheid-era, individuals must still confront their demons from the past in private.In this story, Silas and his wife see their lives turned upside-down when he runs into a white policeman who raped her a long time ago. It is fertile territory for Mr. Dargor with his social activist background, but the result falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter over 'Bitter Fruit'","review":"I usually read novels, thick and thin, within a week; but this book took months. I couldn't stand to read more than a few pages at a time because it was just that terribly written. It was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I'd much rather read a boring textbook on math theory than read this again. I don't understand how it won the awards it did because I don't think it deserved it. The progression was dreadfully slow, and many times the author was redundant and appears to be just filling space. Also, I don't think it dealt much with apartheid at all, but more so about a dysfunctional family in general. And Michael's rage and his driving force (in the end) was really appalling and so fitting with the sensationalism in society and the media today. This book was rubbish and I wish there was a 0 star rating because it definitely isn't even worth one. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb scholarly literary reference (but a bit dated)","review":"This book is filled with ancient and classical literary references and catalog designations of the stars. At the price, it's an outstanding bargain. Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, Chinese, and European lore are all there. I think it's a\\"must have\\" for anyone interested in historical astronomy.The book loses 1 star because the original text was written in 1895: before the constellation names and boundaries were fixed by the International Astronomical Union in 1930.

The songs all gel together nicely which works aganist the album because if you don't listen carfully they can all blend in together on the first few listens but give it a try and you'll be greatly rewarded with a pop masterpiece.

Blowing that I felt I was \\"buzzing\\" pretty hard, that surprised me because I thought I was way higher.Using this device you have to put your lips around the whole top of the housing and blow into it.

It's fun for parties and to create a conversation with people, but don't rely on it for your own health. I am buying a professional version - much larger in size, but significantly more accurate.I would not bet my life on this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know how well this works","review":"I have nothing to compare this to so I gave it 4 stars because it does work, but it seems expensive for such a little item that is about the same size as a car alarm remote. It is designed to be put on a keychain but there is no way in hell I would do that. Dirt can easily get inside the open holes and screw up the accuracy. This is too expensive for that.It really should have a small carrying case. The one thing I don't like about it is that you have to put your mouth on the top part of the outercase. There are no protective sleeves. I guess you are just supposed to lug this around in your pocket and then put it in your mouth when you are testing. Then you pass it around to your friends. Gross!I got this device for personal reasons.When I first go it, I blew a .000 since I had nothing to drink. Then I rinsed my mouth with Scope, and blew a .200.

Finally, only AFTER the product isreceived is it made known that it has to be returned tothe manufacturer each year for calibration (at whatprice)?

Granted all (I've done my research) commercial Breathalyzers I've researched seem to have their quirks- take a deep breath then blow slowly, don't inhale then blow normally, etc. I don't even know at this point if police breathalyzers can be considered legal, because they all, at least the commercial ones, seem to come down to these rules- you can't consume any alcohol, food, drink or cigarettes within 20 minutes of the test. Now, as I've said, I'm a heavy drinker, and I'm 43 years old, but I've never had a DUI, or any alchol related encounter with the police... but based on this weird 20 minute rule, I'm going to assume that the police can't even give you a breathalyzer test until 20 minutes after they've stopped you... does anyone know if this is what they do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"daughter told me years later, it didn't work","review":"My daughter is now a junior in college and I purchased this when she was a senior in high school and used it on a number of occasions and it didn't register alcohol at all.

Tried over the course of several days, had other people try, and even watched videos on YouTube. Yes, it's tiny, but it is not reliable. Also, after every malfunction or viable test (we were only able to produce results about 5% of the time) it needs to wait for 15-20 minutes before the next test.

After we both drank 4 shots and waited a half-an-hour (purely for research sake. . .) only once out of several tries did it correctly tell us that we were over the legal limit - often telling us that we were far under (the majority of the results ranged from .02 to .06).

The book is only good as a price guide for cars you already own and if you know the exact name of the car. If you want to purchase cars that you don't already know this information this book is completely worthless. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if what you want, are some nice pictures to use as a reference for adding to your collection or just to see what other cars are out there that you can buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be the latest, but not the greatest...","review":"While going through my 200+ car Matchbox collection, I found several discrepancies, missing models, and conflicting information compared to that printed on the car. This is not even close to comprehensive collection of Matchbox information.I don't know if you can tell by the 37 pages of samples, but the book is difficult to read with its thin font and patterned background--very poor design.Though the book says it goes through 1998, it leaves out several models that were copyrighted in 1998.The author flat out states that he arbitrarily assigned letters to the model number designations as his way of showing major model changes. Unfortunately for me, I read this after updating my database.Thankfully I purchased this with a gift certificate and didn't waste any more money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for new collectors of matchbox","review":"While this product was nice due to pricing being on one page. Very limited pictures and no detailed description of products. Pricing I believe to be very low of other books on same products. This book is not for beginners due to little pictures and not very good descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple yet clever book of numbers, colors and animals.","review":"This is one of our toddler's very favorites. Van Fleet's illustrations are amusing, as well as intriguing in the way that he incorporates a part of an animal in the number that is shown with it. The concept is straightforward enough, presenting numbers, colors and animals without excess words or imagery. Yet the presentation is made clever and engaging by the double-folded pages and the surprise of the final two illustrations. This is a book we have given as a gift repeatedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that everyone can 'READ'","review":"I give this book as a gift to every 1 year old I know. It gets great reviews from both the parent and the child!When my niece was 2 1/2 she love to \\"read\\" the book to me!

Every track is great -- a rarity in albums. The lead singer (Carrie) just belts out her vocals. She's a true rocker. And nothing gets my adrenaline flowing more than \\"Electricity, Electricity\\" -- whenever this song comes on, I stop whatever I'm doing so that I can dance around and sing along. They're also an awesome live band with dazzling energy. Unfortunately, they are no longer together. I hated even writing that last sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Treasure","review":"I found this CD in the dollar bin of a Used CD shop in Pasadena, CA.

That was a huge mistake. I'm not sure if they thought they were avant garde and original with this effort or what, but to me it wasn't even real music. It simply featured Childish and Ming half singing and half talking about subjects that don't even make sense with creepy and annoying accordian noises. Normally I love Billy Childish, Thee Headcoatees is one of my favorite bands but don't spend your hard earned money on this one or you'll end up like me (disillusioned and frustated) and will end up burying it somewhere in the back of your proud indie rock collection. The worst part is, Childish and Ming could have put together a truly beautiful work. But, no that was not to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Screws","review":"I guess I don't expect much from drywall screws except to hold drywall, but these screws do a fine job.

Jazzhole questions what it means to listen to good music; Jazzhole has come close and exceeded it.To put it simply, next time you enter a bar with traditional tacky music in the background, the experience will become very taxing: keep it tight Jazz hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy an off brand","review":"The battery came on time and works great.

However, the Makita 18V tools are excellent and these batteries are much better than the NiCads that most other manufacturers supply. I bought the more expensive Makita tool set because of the NiMH batteries and I have no regrets, even though the replacement batteries are more expensive -- their use and service is sufficiently better (IMHO) to justify the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This info is bogus","review":"This window shows an 18 volt Makita Battery right down what my original battery looks like. If you click the second image, it shows a packaged 14 volt unit. My real life situation is one step worse.

But very true, nice to have a female heroine. Bottom line - this is a great story and the children respond regardless of their gender. In fact my 2 year old turned into a train lover because of it. We often use the phrase \\"I think I can, I think I can\\" when they complain they cannot accomplish something challenging and it does inspire them to try. The illustrations are charming and have a sweet old fashioned quality. Can't miss with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A children's classic","review":"Another favorite to read to the kids. It encourages them to be optimistic and try things that they might think are difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"This book was not as described and was actually a pop up book. The book was also not in very good condition. I ended up keeping it because it was only $4 and not worth the return shipping cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small book","review":"My fault for not looking at the dimensions of the book, but it was not clear at all that this was a mini book. I haven't gifted this yet to my son so we'll see if the story makes up for the size, but I would have looked for a different edition if I knew it was this small."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real crowd pleaser for the train loving set","review":"If I were rating this book based on how much I like it, it would be about a 2 star book! If my son were rating it, it would be 5 plus stars! I always found this story a bit dull and predictable. I was given this book for my son, and read it to him half thinking he would feel the same. Well, from the time he was less than a year old, he loved it very, very much. We read it over and over and over....I think the message does inspire kids, and of course, it's about trains, which alone is enough to make him happy. So I have mellowed on this title, and think it richly deserves a 4 star vote!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyed","review":"The fact that the only book I was really interested in, that said it was in stock, is not going to be shipped until the end of the month or even later is very annoying. I would not even have bought the other books if I had known I had to wait that long for this particular book. I find this very discourteous."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic for me and for my kids","review":"This is a book I thoroughly enjoyed as a child. I began to borrow it from the library for my own two boys and decided, finally, to order one from Amazon for my son's birthday. We returned the borrowed book to the library the day before his birthday and there were many tears. So, you can imagine my son's elation to open up his very own \\"Little Engine That Could\\" on his birthday. A fantastic book! There is also a newly released version with gorgeous illustrations. Check that one out as well.

A child does not even need to understand English to \\"get\\" it. On first meeting our four-year-old son, who had never heard a world of English until then, I put him on my knee and impersonated each engine character chugging through these pages.He was scared and shy, but he loved the \\"characters,\\" which I could only differentiate for him by sound, and he especially loved the famous repeating line \\"I think I can.\\"As my whispers rose to crescendo, he squealed in delight.

However, when I read the book I was surprised because it wasn't what I remembered. After doing research on this, I discovered there was another version of this story, \\"The Pony Engine\\" by Wonder Books, which I purchased used. This was the version I grew up with. What's the difference? The \\"Watty Piper\\" version makes the good engines girls and the bad engines boys and the version I grew up with does not make any [gender] distinction for the engines.

I highly recommend this book, which is delightful, especially for train-loving little ones. This edition, however, was poorly edited, in my opinion. The illustrations don't match up with the words. The sentences break up in the middle of the page. Anyone who reads to children knows that they enjoy pointing at pictures and anticipating the next event. However, it's very confusing for them when the words and pictures aren't in synch.

It is a book that can be enjoyed by any type of public. I would especially read this book to a person who is giving up. It will be a very good idea to read this to an infant or a child when they are learning new stuff. This will enourage them to do may more things in life.

Can't escape the wonder of the story, but the small size gets pretty close."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Engine that Could","review":"This story is a childrens classic. A wonderful tale about a little helpful train that overcomes great physical adversity through sheer will power. A great moral teaching story for young impressionable children. This story teaches our children especially our daughters that they too can be successful if theywork hard and think positive. This is a story I'll read to my daughter many times. The little engine represent a positive female role model without flaunting its femininity. In fact I had forgotten the engine was female until I read it again recently.

As dozens of cut-throat treasure seekers arrive near their home to find a stolen jeweled picture, Marietta finds herself on his side, fighting for his honor and his legacy.I liked this book amazingly well for a romance that did not have so much as a kiss in it.

I love their music, but not only is this CD just a re-hash of their other CDs, but on this one they've teamed up with some hack novel writer. This self-important writer makes sure you read the opening paragraphs to his novel by printing them on the back cover of the CD, printing them inside the liner notes, and (get this) doing a voiceover of the same hackneyed paragraphs over the first track on the CD. Sheesh. Willie & Lobo would have done better to get rid of this writer and put out a CD of new material (or at least make it clear that this CD is an anthology of previously released tracks).

Fifa RTWC 98 was an awesome game with, by today's standards, poor graphics. 2002 World Cup is a game of stunning graphics, with very little depth. Basically, it is the dizzy blond of football games. Where are the options? It only gives you the World Cup, there is no option to play the qualifiers, and absolutely no international selection. (All options that were included in Fifa RTWC 98).

The game lacks depth and seems to be developed by someone with a less knowledge of real soccer; the AI is a bit confused and inconsistent. Also gone many options from the older version, like the \\"customize\\" option where you can set up the player's attributes and appearance yourself.If you have \\"world cup 1998\\" stick with it, because regardless of the visual effects, you have a really enjoyable soccer game...And by the way, the game programmers started \\"Ronaldo\\" as a midfield player!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is my review?","review":"I wrote a review that listed 10 reasons that I did not like this game, where is my review?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game!","review":"there isn't major change from FIFA 2002.

The book analyses the reasons that the Germans were able to proceed so far before the British detected them, including a series of fortuitous events where the British aircraft sent to reconnoiter the area were unable to search for a variety of reasons.The book was short, sweet, and to the point. It took this high risk operation and broke the various failures down to show how almost everything lined up for the Germans and handicapped the British. At the end, the author provides a brief look at the subsequent futures of these ships.

It totally rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!!!!","review":"Here's the bottom line:this CD is cute, adorable, upbeat and all around good! Daddy's Girl is sooo sweet, I'm 13 and is describes me oh so well. The lyrics are so sweet, it even made one of my friends cry because she thought they were so cute! I loved Ai No Senshi, it's fast, energetic, and awsome, and it's in Japanese ;). Let's see here, oh yeah, The Power of Love is GREAT! It's so fun to listen to and it makes you just wanna sing right along!!! Even if you're like me and hate the SM show, you can fall in love with this CD, the music is great, period.^+^Lizzy^+^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of my favorit songs","review":"This cd is excelent. The first song the power of love is beatifull but not mushy goshy. Its really cool and energetic.The second song I whant some one to love is ok but I dont really like it. The third song I whant to hold your hand is the same as the beatls song except it has a halarius beggining. The fourth song who do you think you are is good the whole thing is about how serhnah and ray fight but there still friends. The fifth song are the orginal Jainiese theme song its called moonlight densetsu. The sixth song is horr ible dont even waste your time listneing to it Its called daddys girl. You might like the song but your more likly to think its utterly stupid. The seventh song Al no senshi loosly transleted means soldeir of love this one is also in Japeniese you regnise them melody because hey play the song in english in birthday blues part two. Number eight is a good song nothing at all its a song about friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ganbarunakucha!","review":"Ganbarunakucha! I'll never give up! That is, I'll never give up looking for more Sailormoon music...IN JAPANESE! after this.This CD is incredibly creative. It contains a few songs from the Sailormoon episodes recently translated into English, a few other related songs, and, best of all, two original Japanese songs (including the theme. Moonlight Densetsu is much better than hearing obnoxious children whine about \\"fighing evil by moonlight,\\" don't you think?)The only thing I would say is, now let's get all of the original Japanese music over here...and of course, a few more episodes translated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailormoon and the Scouts:LunaROCKS","review":"This Sailormoon CD ROCKS!!Moonlight Densetsu and Ai No Senshi are in Japaness[Of course they are!what kind of song would have that name and be in engish].The Power of Love is on the Sailormoon R Movie!Nothing at All is on the Sailormoon S Movie!I Want to Hold Your Hand is from the Beetles.I would recomend this to any Sailormoon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunarock's Rockin' Reveiw","review":"I do not yet own this CD myself, but have listened to it at the homes of my friends or at this site online. Lunarock is one of my fave CDs. It includes my fave song: \\"The Power Of Love\\" and an old beatles classic: \\"I Wanna Hold Yor Hand\\". If you love Sailor Moon, you'll love this CD. I can ALMOST garuantee it. Listen to one of the songs, then rate the CD. Another fave of mine is the soundtrack of the Sailor Moon Series. Check that one out too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LUNA ROCK IS DA BEST SAILOR MOON C.D!","review":"Ok, I know I did too many reviews on this Amazon, but, hey! What can I say?! Luna Rock is da best Sailor Moon C.D so far! But... if they put this C.D out w/ songs on it that haven't been on the T.V series yet.. doesn't that mean more episodes? cough Anywho, All of my friends love it, especially \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"I want someone to love\\". Number 6 and 8 were kinda corney, though. JAPANESE SONGS ROCK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last soundtrack!","review":"Finally! A soundtrack with my favorite Japanese song! I love this one better than the other soundtrack! I listen to it every day! You should get it if you're a true SM fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"it has a little downside on the fact that it only has 2 japanese songs, and I sing in japanese fluently. I awnt tro say that you should buy this item because it's actually better then teh first. the first had remakes of the songs... this just has the songs. they aren't from the show, and the power of love like I completely forgot that that was in the series. The songs are cute, and make it fun for you to preform them for family. My siser and I can sing just like sailor moon and mars in \\"who do you think you are\\" it's great. you should get it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I was kind of dissapointed in this CD. The japanese songs are cool but most of the english songs did not appear in the series, (atleast I think) The only ones I've heard are \\"Power of Love\\" and \\"Who do you think you are\\" Why would Makoto(Lita) sing \\"Daddy's girl\\" if her parents are dead? \\"I want to hold your hand\\" is a beatles song. I think they could have added more japanese songs like \\"La soldier\\" Which is the song played when Neo Queen Serenity battled Wise Man. Face it, thats a much better song than \\"power of love\\". Or why not \\"a madiens policy?\\" Thats just my oppionin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure it is...","review":"Music from Sailor Moon should come from the TV Series or the Movies....This is an American rip-off and not material from the series other than the two titles..A major disappoinment to anime fans..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Great","review":"I bought this CD, and I acctually like some of the songs. The Power of love (from the R movie) was great, and So were some of the others. I wanna hold your hand scares me though! So does Daddy's Girl! I like I want someone to love and Who do you think you are, and Ai No Senshi is good, I think still sung by the original artist. Moonlight Densetsu was sung by this really weird artist called Moonlips, and it sounded horable. Nothing at all is this really great song that was played in the background of the Super S Movie, and it is my new favorite song! If you like Anime, you'll most likely like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER!","review":"This I would have to say is the best CD in my collection. I normaly really like the rock music (ex. Slipknot) but this is by far my favorate cd. I would like to say I could pick one song over another but I love the whole cd. This is a BIG must buy for any Sailor Moon fan.The bottom line here is it is the BEST cd ever made. please if you buy one cd buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!","review":"This CD is a must. It has a blend of mant song styles, my fav's are the two Japanese songs, one is the original Sailor Moon theme, and a battle song from the R Series. I really like how there is a little book with the lyrics on it (with a couple pictures^_^). I listen to it all the time. It is really worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music will touch your heart forever!","review":"I got this CD for my birthday, and I think it is really great. The up-beat songs, the Japaneese songs, and the slow songs all touched my heart, I even go to school singing the songs under my breath. \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" \\"I Want Someone to Love\\" \\"The Power of Love\\" \\"Ai No Senshi\\" and \\"Nothing at All\\" are my favorite songs. If you like the Sailor Moon soundtrack, or you're a fan of the Sailor Moon show, then I suggest you buy this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD definitly!!!","review":"I have been listening to it constanly since I got it a few days ago. All the songs are great!!! I love how there are two songs completely in Japanese because those are some of my favoite Japanese songs from Sailor Moon! In fact I'm listening to it right now! It's also got \\"The Power of Love\\" the song that was played during the fight with the Wiseman!!! I love that song! This CD is definatly worth getting! I know one of the reasons I bought the CD is because of \\"Who do you think you are?\\" Where Moon and Mars fight!!! It's great! This CD is definatly worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LUNAROCK IS WICKEDLY SWEET!","review":"This is THE CD! A MUST for Sailor Moon fans! When I heard \\"Power of Love\\" on the TV series (The Final Battle,Episode 81)I wanted to fight with them! Incredibly great songs, especially Who Do You Think You Are? and Power of Love! Keep fighting, Sailor Scouts! Best song to fight the Negaverse with is Power of Love!

IT WAS THE BEST even better than the first one althought it only had 8 songs on it (2 of which I can notunderstand) it was still the best. What can I say I am 17 years old and singing \\"who do you think you are\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Fun!","review":"If you're a die-hard SM fan, it's worth it. My two faves so far are the Scouts rendition of 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand', and the really typically teenage girlish 'Who Do You Think You Are', which puts to music the infinate ballte of the brats Serena and Rei. There are two japanese tracks on it, one being the original main theme and another from one of the later seasons. As I said, fun. It's got all the camp of the US series that made it so enjoyable. One hopes that Rhino Records will continue to release additional anime discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon forever!","review":"I just got my CD, but what I think AMAZON should do is get sound samples for this and beat CDNOW to it, 'cause I do think this is the better music store. People will love this CD, I know myself! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for the Japanese songs...","review":"The album contains six English songs from the DiC show (including \\"Power of Love\\"), which are medeocre, but actually pretty good when you compare them to, say, the English Speed Racer theme or the English Digimon theme. \\"Ai no Senshi\\" is by far the best song on the albem. Buy this only if you really like the DiC songs, otherwise, buy Mirai e Mukatte or something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"The first disc was a gem. But this one just dissapoints. Eight tracks, and only half of them relate to the series itself. And the non-relating tracks aren't even all that good either. Sure, they're sung decently, but I'd much rather have the original artists singing them than Helium and the Teenybopers. As far as I can tell, the series-relating songs are just the lamer tunes that couldn't make it onto the first soundtrack, and got regurgitated here when DiC Entertainment needed some new toy to keep sales up. In my opinion, a disc with only four tunes qulifies as a CD Single, and those sell for $2 -$3 each. It's just a rip-off to charge normal CD price for a disc that really has nothing on it. Save up your cash, and buy either the first soundtrack, or some of the German import discs. Those are cool too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled","review":"I got the first soundtrack and absolutely loved it, so I was looking forward to this one.I was sadly disappointed...there are 4 tracks that are actually from the Sailor Moon TV show, and two are in English (and off the English episodes) and 2 are from the Japanese episodes, including the Japanese theme.The rest is recycled rock songs sung by (i assume) the same person who sang on the english TV shows. This includes recycled Beetles songs and songs which you have to think really hard about to find any connection to Sailor Moon whatsoever.What did I do? I taped the 4 Sailor Moon songs onto a cassette along with the first Sailor Moon CD and listen to them altogether... they way they should have made the album to begin with. The Lunarock CD itself is collecting dust on a shelf...But for hardocre Sailor Moon fans it's worth it just for those 4 songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"This CD is perfect for the older generation of Sailor Moon fans.While the other CD has pretty trying songs on them,this CD has character.I'd recomened this to 10-100yr old SM fans.

Including 2 highly-addictive Japanese tunes, the song line-up is even better than ever! My favorite songs include: \\"Moonlight Densetsu\\", \\"Ai no Senshi\\", and \\"The Power of Love\\"!

Firstly, the advertisment suggests that the transmitter will do the job by itself. It does not. You must also purchase the receiver plus the plug in extender which then lights up the RF window on the Dish receiver. The problem is that unless you are within six feet of the transmitter it WILL NOT respond to the remote to change channels, etc. Even when the transmitter and receiver are six inches apart, it STILL WILL NOT RESPOND unless the remote is within six feet of the transmitter. The remote and its batteries are less that three weeks old. Would I buy this combo again??..NO WAY. I am seeking a refund but doubt it will happen.

Just set the IR receiver unit on the lower shelf of a table near the bed, and the IR transmitter unit on the lower shelf of a table in line of sight of the TV, pushed the channel button on the Universal remote for the cable box and voila, magic happened.

The only thing that you need to watch out for is placement of the component that goes in front of your equipment. In my case it took a bit of time messing with placement until I had it just right. No biggie. The only thing I would love to see in a next version is the ability to run on batteries instead of having to plug it in.

The signal has to go through the floor for a distance of 40+ feet. Going that far, one has to be a bit careful about placing the receiver but once in place, it works very well. One thing other reviewers have mentioned, though, that I agree with is that the IR receiver isn't the best at receiving the remote's signals. Lucky for me, I sit fairly close, but even then, very occasionally it misses my commands.Also don't be too put off by the box, which looks like it was made in 1980.Overall, this product works very well and is reasonably priced and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Easy And It Works","review":"The product was shipped from 10X Express an Amazon 2nd party seller. It took 3 days to arrive after ordered from Texas to Southern California (standard shipping.) The box was placed in a shipping envelope not a box. At first I was concerned but when I opened the package and saw the foam interior I realized that an outer box to protect the inner box would have been a waste.This will be the easiest to use audio visual product that you ever purchased. You literally plug it in and it works. I have my TV components in a closet and it worked fine.It also has a jack for an infrared emitter. The emitter is not included but is easily available. This would give you the ability to transmit an IR signal directly to a single component's receiver.You could spend a lot more for other IR extender systems, but why bother when there is such an easy, inexpensive option available."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power Mid works great!!","review":"These are the first Remote Control Extenders I have purchased. The only reason I bought them is because of the high reviews everyone else gave them. I just hooked them up, and so far they work great. It took 5 minutes to get them both plugged in to the wall, and set up where I wanted them. You don't have to connect to the satellite or television. Just plug them in and you are good to go. Now I can enjoy my satellite in 2 rooms without getting up to change the channel.

I installed the receiver and transmitter (plug in and extend the antenna) and it was working immediately. I did not notice any problems with spurious commands being sent, double commands, or missing commands. All the features on the remote appeared to work. An hour or so later I went into the room to watch a football game and I found the remote extender was no longer working.

Transmitter is in my bedroom and Receiver is in the living room about 25 feet from each other, there is a wall between and they do their job flawlessly. The Transmiter gets my remote signal even from 10feet away as long as I aim directly at it.I guess the very pointy tips may be dangerous if you have kids around, if so, it's a good idea to place them high or to cover the point with some kind of cushion or maybe sand them.At first I was worried because the pictures in the box are VERY old, there's a lady that looks like taken from an Austin Powers movie using the Powermid to change an extremely old radio....(LOL)...

I bought the ones from Radio Shack and they only worked some of the time. (I used to have some that I got at Radio Shack that worked great, but now that I think about it they were RCA units, not Radio Shack brand.) I returned them and bought the Jensen units at Best Buy, thinking that Jensen was a good brand name. They were completely useless. They would not even work in the same room, so back they went. The X-10's do exactly what they are supposed to do. I have the receiver in the living room with my sat. box and the transmitter in a bedroom about 50' away through three walls. No problem!! Plus, it is nice that the voltage converter is inside each unit so that the cord and plug are standard 110 two prong deals. No transformer to try to fit into a power strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"X10 PowerMid 2 Stars - Poor Performance","review":"Installation was very easy. I appreciate the standard 110v style plug and not some clunky DC adapter that covers up two outlets. The styling is sleek and looks nice.My \\"beef\\" with this product is that it doesn't perform as I expected. I estimate one in five button pushes respond as expected. We find ourselves pointing and pushing the button on our remotes vigorously. Both the receiver and transmitter are positioned in optimized places to perform as described in the directions. There are no other devices that conflict with their operation.My recommendation is for you to try a different brand or type of remote extender as I am disappointed with the performance of the X10 PowerMid kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply failed to control anything behind close door!","review":"What a failed product! I wanted to control my equipments in a closed cabinets. The sole reason I bought this X10 is for this purpose.

I was really hoping it would work like everyone says. It didn't. I plugged the transmitter in and all I got was a dim intermittent flash. The receiver worked. I aimed my remote at it and the light flashed every time I pushed a button. Too bad. With so many mixed reviews it sounds to me like some work and some don't. I guess I'll go back to the wired ones.

These units tend to pick up too much interference. I had the reciver pyramid in a closet with all of my AV equipment. The receiver kept picking up random RF distortion from my Onkyo receiver (not remote commands, but some kind of interference). I tried moving the receiver around to no avail. The end result was that this product only worked about 10% of the time. Once I switched to a wired unit, I've had no problems.

Nothing else needed to be done, it just worked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy set-up, works great","review":"I needed a solution for controlling my cable box (which is located in the living room) from the bedroom since both TV's are running off of the same box and, so far, this is a perfect solution.I was a little skeptical of this when it showed up since the packaging looks like it's from the 1984 and I'm pretty sure I saw record players in the photos and diagrams, but it works great for what I needed it to do. The setup was very easy, all I had to do was plug each of them in. Positioning the receiver unit (the one that duplicates the IR beam for the living room) was very forgiving - it's actually flush with the cable box, even slightly behind the front of it on the same shelf, and even though the IR receiver on the cable box is not in it's line of sight, it still works with no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"chewman not really chewable","review":"THIS WAS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FOR MY DOGGIE.

Only one other humorous cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diversafied view of environmental conservationism!","review":"I found that this book presented a more well rounded perspective of our environement. It is not writen from a conservationists view, but rather in a more open minded analytical way. It represents a open analysis of our interaction with the envrionment. I recomend this book to anyone who takes interest in our surroundings and the effects we place upon it. If you feel our world is being destroyed by human utilization, you MUST read this. Easterbrook leaves his audiance with a happy outlook to end on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally very silly and misguided","review":"My sense from reading this book is neither that Easterbrook is a purposefully misleading, nor that he is particularly insightful. He is looking for an antitode to negativity that he seems to believe pervades the enrivonmental community.But whether you agree with his perspective or not, the simple fact is he gets many facts completely wrong, and his arguments are logically flawed. A prime example is the arguments he makes against the need for having regulations on air quality: he points out that the air has gotten cleaner in the US over the last 30 years. Well, yes it has, but BECAUSE of the clean air act, not in spite of it.There is no reason to be depressed about the environment, but nor is there any reason -- as Easterbrook would have us do -- to ignore it. If you want a balanced view, read the scientific literature, not the quasi-science of an naive journalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent large-scale review of environmental issues.","review":"Easterbrook may make a few errors and his writing style may not suit all, but I found this book to be enlightening and an excellent essay on the big picture in environmentalism today. While any single author is likely to stumble through a few issues when writing a book of this magnitude, I found the basis for his arguements in general to be sound, timely, and interesting.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in environmental issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco-non realism for beginners","review":"Easterbrooks book, while possessing an upbeat outlook on environmental matters, reveals all the hallmarks of a book written by someone with little insight and knowledge of environmental biology. As a scientist, I am appalled by his fundamental lack of detailed references in support of his perspectives, and inaccuracies which make this tome seem something akin to a high school project. Of course, whether it is written this way intentionally to appeal to the uninitiated or not is debatable. However, there are dangers when someone as naive as Eastebrook dabbles into an area of which he is neither qualified not informed. Altogether a rambling series of prose with little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares","review":"I got through the first 35 pages of this book and really couldn't take it anymore, I mean who cares. There is nothing compelling about this book and everything the author writes about is a reach into the boring bag.

I myself spent my youth learning hockey on outdoor rinks in Wisconsin, but who the hell cares.

I felt that the light-hearted teasing applied in the other books was largely replaced by an air of base critical negativity. It concentrated on some very odd, and utterly redundant things that I feel the XG is hardly the forum for.

To add more woes to her famous life, her brother is murdered and the cops think that maybe she did it. And if that's not enough woes, someone kidnaps her father and wants a million dollar ransom.This fast-paced, suspense story will take you on a ride you'll never forget as you tour a world of groupies and fans, face the problems of addiction and fame and wonder just who is making Mim's life so miserable.

Mim tries to hide from everyone, including the fans that constantly recognize her, a brother who pesters her to get sober, and her biological father who has recently been released from prison after the accidental killing of her mother.When nude pictures that she did not pose for begin appearing on the internet, Mim is forced out of hiding. However, the pictures are only the start: Mim's life and the lives of her family are threatened, forcing a reluctant Mim to fight back.I read this book in one evening, staying up late to finish it. In Mim, Rucka has created a tough female protagonist worthy of Louise Ure, and his story has enough twists and turns to satisfy Harlen Coben fans. I highly recommend this over-looked gem of a thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A successful thriller and a compelling murder mystery","review":"Mim Bracca, member of a famous rock and roll band and damages soul, returns home after alcohol takes over her life.

On top of that she is being stalked by someone who appears to want more than just money.Greg Rucka departs from his Atticus Kodiak series of thrillers. In this stand alone he explores the character of a woman living on the edge. Both a successful thriller and a compelling murder mystery, A FISTFUL OF RAIN reveals the prodigious writing talent of the author. A problem, however, is that the author cheats on the solution.

At first listen I thought the band would soon be all over the media as the \\"Next Big Thing\\". This music makes everything else I listen to seem old and out of date.

It is the most incredible thing to hear. The guitar is loud and hard and rough and perfectly compliments Lisa's voice. The drums drive the album though.

If you load the headphone like any other normal user would, you would push it from behind your and give it more chance to break. So I was extremely cautious and never did that. But still it finally broke on the 32nd day without a warning.I am amazed how Logitech can make such products and not recall it from the market. If Apple or Dell would have made such a product I am sure there will be 10 lawsuits on them on the very first day. Surprisingly all users including me are quiet.Please don't ever buy these headphones.That said, the sound quality is OK. Neither bad nor good. Works fine for 20 feet with obstacles and 25 feet without obstacles. Fits comfortable till it breaks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Design, Bad Execution","review":"I have been looking for a Bluetooth headphone for a while now and when I found the Logitech headphones it was the design that I was looking for. A small headset that is wireless and it didn't look like a studio headset. I got the headset in December and it worked well for about 3 weeks and then developed the crack that other reviewers have described. I got a replacement headphone and it also developed a crack in less than a week even when I tried to be careful when handling it. If it wasn't for the crack, I would have easily rated the headphones 4 stars. Amazon was very helpful when I reported the problem and I got a full refund after I returned the headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought these and in my opinion it was a huge waste of money. First: They do not plug into my MP3 player very well. It is very loose and constantly comes off if you have this in a poket or bag. Two: It took me a good long while to get the things to even work. I can't get equal sound quality to come out of both sides. This makes listening to these headphones very difficult and irritating. Three: I do not like the design (they are very uncomfortable) and they break very easily like most of these other reviews mention. My suggestion in retrospect is to wait a little while until better products (for less money I might add) come out. It's only a matter of time. Hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love these headphones! I bought them so I wouldnt have a cord hitting me in the face on the treadmill, and they've been amazing. They stay on very well when running, yet remain comfortable during the entire time. They use rechargeable batteries, which is nice, and the integrated volume control is awesome! I love these guys, perhaps the best $100 gadget I've bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rechargeable battery and constant signal loss","review":"I purchased these for the obvious reason: Wireless headphone use so that music can be enjoyed without rousing the neighbors.I was disappointed.These headphones are great when they work. So why the poor (2/5 stars) review from me? The headphones do not hold a charge longer than about an hour before this incessant beeping will drive you insane. I felt somewhat like Pavlov's dog with the random ringing in my ears. The beeping indicated signal loss. After several recharge/retry rounds with these headphones I had to move on to something else.The problems with these headphones bar me from mentioning anything else about it. Just move on to something similar with better reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the most comfortable, but work great ...","review":"I am overall quite pleased with these headphones. The sound quality is excellent. I've not had any problems with interference, background hiss or anything of that nature.Battery life has been excellent. I have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they'll last, but I use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven't failed me yet.The only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use. I'm not really a big fan of this \\"sport\\" style of headphone, and probably wouldn't have tried these if I hadn't gotten them on clearance. But, I found that after experimenting a little I was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable, even wearing them the better part of a workday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"Nice product.

They designed the band with a studier material because the headphones are a bit heavier than normal headphones. Unforunately, this means the headband cracks after prolonged use. Mine cracked after a week's worth of use. After this they are useless. Check the Logitech support forums for more information. This isn't an isolated problem, but a design problem with all the headphones. I would not recommend this product, since they are so expensive with such a short life span. Maybe wait till they fix the headband.They work great until they break."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason these are discontinued...","review":"This product sucks... not only did the plastic crack, the unit stopped working all-together after another week of taped up use. Logitech DOES KNOW of this problem and only asked one question when I called for warranty service: \\"Is the headband cracked?\\" I said yes and she immediately offered a refund. We'll see how well that goes, if I actually receive a refund for $98 or whatever I paid when they came out a few months ago.Also, the sound quality was never that good and it was VERY uncomfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headband breaks after a week of use","review":"Do not buy this product. The headband is a cheap plastic that is uncomfortable and not very flexible. It has a flat part where it rests at the back of the neck, which makes it the weakest point. My headband cracked after less than a week of use. Logitech required me to send the headphones back to get a refund - they aren't even bothering to try to replace/fix them.This makes the second Logitech product I've bought that has turned out to be junk. Their other products may be OK, but this one's a lemon. There's a review here that tells you to put electrical tape on the headphone to fix it. I considered that for a moment, but when I remembered how much I paid for these things I decided they had to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound but Poor Headband Plastic","review":"Logitech has a potentally great product here, but it suffers from a fatal flaw which remains (as of 2006-06-21) uncorrected.

They break right in the back (and then pinch your neck). The first pair stopped working because of the break and Logitech did send me a replacement pretty quick. They had said they knew of the problem and fixed it, but the second pair broke again. I am not rough with these, but I think using them everyday at work just wears on them quick. You have to pull them out a little to get them on your head. Now that my second pair is broken they no longer stay on my ears well. I am very disappointed. I love the wireless aspect of these headphones and the quality of sound is great. They also have a great range. Now they just don't stay on anymore and are too uncomfortable.

I have been buying these headsets since they first came out (about 5 years ago, before they had the bluetooth model). Since that time I have probably gone through at least 6 pair (just threw away a pair last night). That is because they crack right down the middle after about 6 months of usage.A couple of years ago, they were selling for $35 - $40, I purchased about 4 pair because I knew they wouldn't last long. But my wife and I cruise a lot and they work great with my Dell Jukebox and other MP players that I own. The set that is specifically designed for the IPOD, does not seem to have this design flaw.I do not know why they cost so much know, but please save your money and find something else, learn from my very expensive experience.

Then the transmitter (small box) stopped charging and finally the headband snapped in two. Well it did not end there. Logitech did offer an exchange. The customer service is worst than the set. The 1st tech support told me that it was not necessary to return the item. A month later when I inquire about the item I was told that they attempted to contact me (neither by phone or e-mail).

Recently I lost all sound in the left ear. I've never abused either the headphones or the receiver in any way.

It does a good job of presenting Flanagan's own neurophilosophical theory while offering discussion of the competition.Flanagan does not answer his dualist critics, such as David Chalmers, at great length. He focuses more on other naturalists.This book is generally a good overview of the topic, though a great deal of the content of this book is contained in Chapter 8 of Flanagan's work \\"The Science of the Mind.\\" That was a disappointment, and due to that and the fact that the discussion could have been a bit more in-depth, the book gets 4 stars and not 5. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in modern theories of consciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"all great conscious arguments can be found here:","review":"owen flanagan is a masterful scholar that leaves hope for a concept alot of contemporary scientists have given up on and tried to quine.

The author reprinted his lab results for blood tests and used his liver enzyme levels as proof. However he did not show us his viral load and antibody test results which is what actually determines the presence of the virus. From experience I know that the herbs this author recommends do help the liver to function better as I have been able to get my enzyme levels back into the normal range with the same herbs, however I still have the HCV antibodies and a high viral load. I am not cured. I might be compelled to try the author's high-priced frozen vials of magic if I saw proof that people were clearing the virus. But none was offered. I thought the author wrote this book with a very angry tone and that the homophobia, sexism and racism was unnecessary and really turned me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good source of information","review":"I found the book very insightful and quite helpful as I search for information to treat and eradicate hepatitis C.

Grammatically it could use some corrections but those are overlookedin light of the information and hope gained."},{"rating":"1","title":"The angry tone and attitude of the book was a real turn off","review":"First let me say right off, it is very obvious that this is a self-published book; this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but Mr. Wright forgot to have an editor review it before it went to print. The book is riddled with grammatical, spelling, and formatting errors, which tells me he considers himself 'above' double checking his work.He sells the stuff is says is a 'cure' for HCV, but even in my newly diagnosed HCV state, and with my counter full of newly purchased herbs, I found his tirades and his 'magical' cures a bit hard to swallow. He just comes across as a used car salesman.That being said, he may very well be right on target with everything he claims, but the adolescent tone and the almost childishness of the writing makes it very difficult to believe. This book, while entertaining and informative, felt a lot more like a well crafted wallet probe than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"It had a few good moments, that's it.

But the negative way in which this is stated could be discouraging to those considering a Buddhist path, and dangerous for the very depressed. \\"There is no hope; there is nothing for you; there is nothing to lean on, only cold loneliness.\\"\\"Expectation\\" is what causes suffering, not hope. If I had no hope that my life could improve, that man could find peace, I would not waste my time with Buddhism or meditation.

Maybe she's right, maybe she's wrong....but I found a lot of very challenging ideas that I tried out almost immediately.

I think this is an overloaded word that before being used, it needs to be explained. My take on this book after reading half of it is that she is saying, life is terrible, give up on hope because nothing will change, enjoying anything that life has to give is deluding yourself, etc. So, it sounds to me that this book is saying you are in this world to suffer, and the quicker you admit that the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meditation","review":"This book is not for me.

For the same advice from a neuroanatomist's perspective, try \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" by Jill Bolte Taylor, who accidentally arrived at nirvana by way of a massive stroke. These two women show us that peace resides within our right brains and is accessible at all times, if we'll just tell our left brains to shut up!

She brings forth the great wisdom from her own two marriages, children and personal life lessons. She has been a great source of comfort to me during my own difficult times in life and really helped me practice Buddhism in a way that has helped me understand my higher calling and why I am here. I highly recommend this book and all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some interesting perspectives","review":"Pema Chodron's \\"When Things Fall Apart\\" is an exploration of loss from a Buddhist perspective. Like many spiritual ideals, the advice is easy to grasp, harder to follow. Can a pleasure addicted society learn to embrace the pain that is inevitable in life, and connect with the pain of others? Would we want to? I'm not sure, but her advice is worth considering.The chapters begin with a excerpt of the central idea of that passage, then a further exposition follows. If you are new to Buddhism, some of the terms will be unfamiliar, but not difficult to understand. I am somewhat new to Buddhism, but many of the ideas have a familar ring to them. The meditation practice of tonglen, for instance, is reminicent of the Christian concept of turning the other cheek.I'm not sure if I'll read Chodron's other books, but this one was worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great great book","review":"this book has helped me tremendously in the past when i was going through a very difficult time. it gave me great comfort. unfortunately, i am encountering some family problem and in desperate need for this book. i was just looking up on amazon to see what the cover looks like in order to locate the book somewhere in my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an amazing reading!!!","review":"I have found in each page of this book, a very rich and profound words, that have helped me look in to the deepest parts....it has touched my soul!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing explanations of how to practice Buddhism.","review":"Pema Chodron is amazing in her ability to give explanations that are pertinent to an actual meditation practice.

It runs (very quietly) for a while, but then it mysteriously stops and sits there with the little blue LED blinking away. This behavior is not documented in the user guide and is not consistent with the programs as they are explained in the user guide, so I don't know what's going on, and there seems to be no source of technical support. I don't think it's really worth the amount that they want for it, it's clear that someone is making a hefty amount of profit on this little baby, but, on the other hand, it's quiet, good-looking and sometimes actually does it's job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not spicy.","review":"This chili has GREAT consistency, which is not easy in a vegetarian product.

It is a movie that I will watch again and again and expect to discover more about at each viewing.

It teaches the basics of the rosary AND beyond; so that even veteran rosary enthusiasts, can benefit greatly from this book.The rosary is a powerful form of prayer and meditation, and this book lays it out with a direct, and easy approach. Most of all, it includes some fascinating and inspirational anecdotes from John's personal experiences with the rosary. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, Simple, Effective","review":"For those who use a rosary, this might be a bit of a different perspective, but I think it's mainly for those who don't, but might want to incorporate a different type of prayer in their spiritual life. I enjoyed finding out more about John Edward..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"What I have always loved about John Edward's books is his conversational style and non-judgmental nature in his writings. I am always looking for books to suggest to my clients (I am an animal communicator and psychic medium) who feel they are intuitive and do not know what to do to further explore this aspect of themselves. John Edward's book, Practical Preying is another I have put on my suggestion list for those people. Aside from the history behind the rosary, this provides a wonderful outline for plugging in to the universe. I would love it if we lived in a world where the disclaimers in the book were not necessary - but they are understood and frankly also so well written and enjoyable - who cares! I am buying a dozen copies of this to have on hand to give as gifts. It is a lovely small size attractive hardcover as well as having a 10 star interior!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I liked the idea of John Edward writing about the rosary - especially to non-catholics b/c many miss the beautiful prayer that it the rosary. The background info on the origins of the rosary was simple and precise to those unfamiliar with it. The section on expanding one's prayer life was also a great way for anyone to work on one's prayer life.However, John Edward constantly writes about how he is not preaching Catholicism and he is \\"not on the Vatican payroll.\\" While I understand he does not want to offend some of his non-catholic followers, it really was tiresome for this Catholic to constantly read about. The constant onslaught of \\"I'm catholic, but I don't believe in everything catholic, and I am not preaching catholicism to you\\" overall turned me off the book.The best thing to do is to go directly to the sections that deal with the rosary (historically and spiritually) and how to develop a prayer life based off of the rosary."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRACTICAL PRAYING","review":"I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM JOHN EDWARDS. THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF REPITITION, AND TO LIFE LONG CATHOLICS IT WAS LIKE GOING TO GRADE SCHOOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I was sorely disapointed with this book and I'd return it if I could. Even though John Edward denies this book isn't solely for Catholics... WRONG! It's everything he denies it is, and if you are a non-Catholic or even non-Christian, you will definitely not appreciate this book. Filled with stereotypical Catholic drama with a dash of New Age. Not at all what I expected. I really enjoyed Edward's other books. A New Age tribute to the Catholic Goddess. Too bad for his many fans who aren't Catholic or Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploiting grief then prayer....","review":"Rather than addressing the four year backlog of grieving people waiting for readings from him, John Edward has chosen to write and promote this new book. Since the mediumship gig no longer is lucrative, he has apparently turned into a quasi-religious guru, exhorting people to find happiness and meaning through praying the rosary. Underneath the claimed spirituality and compassion, this book is crass and distasteful. I used to be a fan--before his self-promotion and lack of sincere concern for the people he markets to became so obvious. Now?...Definitely money could be better spent elsewhere. I have his other books (and audio/video tapes, and a DVD), but I now feel that making a contribution to a charity would be a more satisfying spiritual act than buying this new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retitled But Same Stuff","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The first half of the book was almost a verbatim reproduction of The Peacemaker. The second half of the book is a repeat of the initial repeat in the first half of the book but directed at dealing with children. There is no new information simply a change in wording that says the samething Ken Sande said in the Peacemaker and also in the first half of this book. The only hope for this book were the last two chapters that dealt with when your marriage gets in trouble and steps to protect your marriage. Both chapters were very vague and not very helpful. The author did say it was not his purpose to deal with marriage. However, my question is if that was not his intention why did he include a whole chapter on it? My recommendation is buy The Peacemaker and you do not need to waste your money on this book. It promises much and delivers very little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference VHS from an excellent musician.","review":"What I liked about this VHS is that it came with a small page of rhythm transcriptions that is actually jammed packed with information. It's great to see one of my favorite drummers in action, and the combination of being able to see the bass drum work (in a cut out) as well as the remainder of the kit is valuable. I rated this 4 stars only because I thought more could have been offered in other areas, mainly the production. Jeff burps a few times during the VHS, which is something I though could have been avoided. Other than that, he's still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get J.D. Salinger instead","review":"The Wynona Riders have a few good songs, and that's it... nearly all of them are on their EP with Lookout! records, but there's a couple more that are only found on their full-lengths or on compliations. You'd be doing fine with the EP, but if you want more then get J.D. Salinger. The recording quality is just a ton better... I think this is supposed to be a live album or something but it's not advertised as such. Unless you are excited to own a live version of the songs, avoid this... it just doesn't sound so great on the stereo.You have to sift through some silly garbage to get to the songs that make the Wynona Riders worth owning, on either full-length. For example they cover the friggin Power Rangers song... now why would they go and do that? There's more on this album that might be funny once, but the rest of the time you just keep hitting that \\"next\\" button on the CD remote, and it just makes the album get less and less play in my rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost words that should be found.","review":"Jeffrey Kacirk, The Word Museum: The Most Remarkable English Words Ever Forgotten (Simon and Schuster, 2000)A small, yet wonderful, dictionary of words that, for the most part, are no longer in use and probably should be.

As the long and ridiculous prohibition on growing industrial hemp in the United States comes to an end, most of our wannabe hemp farmers will need and find this information most helpful since so much about hemp farming has been lost during the ban. As more people realize the value of hemp to our farming, manufacturing and retail economies, the more they will need to know about it in order to maximize their efforts and outcomes. This is well written and easy to read; a no nonsense text crammed full of what we need to know about hemp farming and processing. Though highly recommended by VoteHemp, it is out of print. I am grateful to have found it available through a seller at Amazon for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood on the Moon","review":"This book is one of the best books I've read on Lincoln or the Civil War. The author went into depth about each part of the assassination and all the people involved with it.

Ed Steers, Jr. did his research well and has the talent to present the story in an enjoyable fashion. The final page tells it all. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon ?????","review":"Nothing in this book that I did not already know about one of the greatest men who ever lived.The title still mystifies me.The style of writing is poor - the author does not know how to connect with the reader. He also takes some cheap shots at other authors - Dont throw stones Mr. Steers!If anyone wants to know about this terrible time - read MANHUNT by James SwansonJohn Lawlor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Supposition","review":"Steers does not come close to proving that Jefferson Davis or anyone else high in the Confederate government was in any way connected to John Wilkes Booth and his plots to kidnap/kill Abraham Lincoln. This is primarily because there was no connection. Why Steers ventures into this fiction is up to speculation. Some might say that he is trying to solidify his standing as an Anti-Confederate. The only conspiracy in the Lincoln assassination was between Booth and the handful of men he included in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best Lincoln assassination book ever written","review":"I have read many books about the Lincoln assassination and Booth's escape through Maryland and into Virginia (e.g., Manhunt, The Day Lincoln was Shot, American Brutus, They Have Killed Papa Dead, We Saw Lincoln Shot, Come Retribution, O'Reilly's book, His Name is Still Mudd, A. Lincoln: His Last 24 Hours, etc.) and Dr. Steers' book is by far the most complete and readable history of this fascinating and sad event in our history that I have come across. He has a mastery of the subject that is unrivaled, and his skill in weaving together all of the vast information and characters associated with this story is wonderful. I would strongly suggest that anyone who is interested in reading about the Lincoln assassination read \\"Blood On The Moon\\" first and then read some of the other books (which are also good, but just not the quality of Dr. Steers.) He is quite simply the master on this subject. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Praise for Blood on the Moon","review":"Dr. Steers does a great job with Blood on the Moon. This book is well researched, fascinating and interesting to read. I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get to know the facts about this critical moment in American history. Great for the casual reader or history buff. Great pictures and maps as well. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood on the Moon--Fascinating Read!","review":"Kudos to Mr. Steers for writing a well-docmuented historical account that reads like a nightmarish novel. For anyone with an interest in the US Civil War era or President Lincoln, I would rate this book as a \\"must have.\\" The book has a fascinating account of the assassination conspiracy; the length (over time) of the conspiracy and the direct involvement of the Confederate government in the conspiracy were surprises. Whenever Steers makes assumptions, he plainly states the bases for those assumptions; and, they make sense given the materials he cites. I did wind up wanting to know more about the Confederate Secret Service and its Union counterpart; and, more about their roles in the Civil War generally. Treatment of this subject in Steers' book was more than adequate for the topic of Steers' book, though. Very enjoyable (allowing for the overwhelming sadness of the topic) and informative reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood on the Moon","review":"This is a very well written and comprehensive account of the assasination of Abraham Lincoln. All of the sources used by the author are authenticated. The basis of the book are reports, trial transcripts, letters and other archived documents. The narrative is very descriptive, detailed and an easy read. Even though this is a lengthy book, it will hold your interest because it is so well organized and written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I learned so much from this book and loved it, tons of myths dispelled. For any fan of Lincoln, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exciting Read","review":"This is the best book on Lincoln's assassination. You really feel that you are riding with Booth & Herold through the Maryland countryside at night. It also shatters the beliefs that Mary Surrat and Dr. Mudd were innocent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition could use improvement","review":"I bought the Kindle edition of this book and as with all the Kindle editions I've purchased, I am always disappointed with the way graphic images are handled.In this book, the graphics are especially poor. My major complaint is that the resolution is so low, that when you tap on a thumbnail image to enlarge it, the full sized image is fuzzy and illegible. This was especially frustrating when trying to read the map of Booth's escape route from Washington.I viewed the Kindle edition on several different devices - iPad mini, Kindle Fire, an Android phone, an Android tablet, and a PC laptop with a 17\\" screen. The display of graphics improved with increased screen size, but that really defeats the purpose of buying a true Kindle device in the first place - small format, high resolution, portability.As a read however, I thought this book was outstanding. It was informative and engaging. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the disappointing graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep, thought provoking read","review":"If you plan on an easy read, don't get this book. Steers leads you into a vast array of events and characters surounding the assassination of Lincoln. If you are not totally dedicated to this book, you will not be able to follow it. If you are dedicated, you will enjoy it. Be careful not to get lost in all of the characters. They are all important to this work. I would recommend this book to any Civil War or Lincoln buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read about the Lincoln assassination","review":"This is a excellent account of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It includes events leading up to the assassination, the paths of the conspirators before and after, and the protracted search for John Wilkes Booth. Mr. Steers is a nationally known Lincoln scholar and writer. His extensive research and knowledge into this subject have landed him on network television and radio, and in the audience of sitting Presidents. Blood on the Moon is written in a lively style that will keep you riveted to you seat, even though you know the final outcome. A must read for any history buff.

I have a copy of the script, the Alvin Theater Playbill and am a Company! junky. Loved Raul Esparsa in the 2006 revival, but it lacked the full orchestra Sondheim deserves (Angel Desai strained to sing \\"Another Hundred People\\").

I rented this movie and after viewing it, I had to have my own copy to watch when I needed reminders of how crazy life and relationships can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ira and Abby","review":"My new favorite movie. I've always been a sucker for a decent romantic comedy (honestly what 20-something woman isnt?) but this one has definitely moved to the top of my list. Ira and Abby are both lovable characters and their relationship (even with its ups and downs) is the kind we all want to have. Highly recommended to people who like romantic comedies (Sleepless in Seattle, My Best Friend's Wedding, etc) and fans of realistic comedy like Woody Allen, Seinfeld, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun, super sexy","review":"Westfeldt knocks this one out of the park. A solid cast puts into play a very enjoyable script. Perhaps the circumstances are a bit difficult to bite into but what a delicious bite. A well thought out and carefully submitted modern day message with a lively and lovable Westfeldt center stage. Hoping this one pops out on Blu Ray sometime soon. It easily makes my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"The front of the DVD says \\"The Best Manhattan Love Story Since When Harry Met Sally\\". So, I was expecting something fantastic. I couldn't make it past the first half hour. These two are such losers and to compare them to Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is a joke. Ira & Abby are irritating, unsophisticated, and kind of dumb. I give it one star for being in New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best spatula ever.","review":"If I had had 10 stars to rate this it would have been a 10. Like what a pain it is searching for a good replacement for this one.On my husband's quest for yet another perfect kitchen tool he found this spatula. He bought one each for us and for our son and daughter-in-law. So- 4 people in 2 kitchens- everyone reaching this spatula first!If Henckels has stopped making this one I guess it was for newer, more in, sexy and stylish ones. All we want is one that does what we want.What I would have wanted to know when we bought this product is when they would retire it: we'd have stocked up.If anyone finds a source for this spatula please post it. We'd be even happier cooks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Turner","review":"The is only the second Henckels kitchen tool I've bought, the other being a peeler. The quality is excellent - both the handle and the turner aparatus are of high grade materials. The face is easy to clean unlike the turners with holes that constantly get food stuck in them. Also, the tool is dishwasher safe, so cleaning is that much easier.There are two improvements that I \\"wish\\" for: make the face a little wider and give it a straight front edge. Last night I made scrambled eggs and it was awkward trying to scrape the eggs with the angled front edge. Overall, Henckels has done a great job with this little turner - you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This may not be the book you want","review":"When I ordered this book I didn't realize what it was. I thought it was going to tell me about the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls. No, it isn't that kind of book. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known what it was.It is more about the discovery of the scrolls, the caves, etc.So let this review be a warning to a prospective buyer. If what you are interested in is simply to learn the stories contained in the scrolls, read some of the other reviews to find out where that information can best be found. Not here.Anyone who gives this review a negative rating doesn't understand the process. This review is exactly the kind of information I could have used before I bought the book.Get the right tool for the job. If you need a Phillips head screwdriver get a Phillips head screwdriver. If you are looking for a book that concentrates on the stories contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls, get one. It's not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about the scrolls.","review":"This is a very nice book. It.has some beautiful illustrations & goes into some detail about the scrolls found at Qumran. It is at times a little disjointed though, jumps around a little.

The cover and binding are beautiful, and the strange dream like narrative inside provides enough of the psychological insights Kundera is famous for to keep the reader interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kundera in decline?","review":"After being consistently so very good in his earlier novels (peaking with Immortality)), Identity and Slowness have been quite disappointing. It's worth reading, it wasn't a poor novel by any means, but if you expect anything like the Kundera of old, lower your expectations a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the ending?","review":"Granted he is a fantastic author and I love most of his books, but here, what happened??? The ending is absolutely ludicrous, and totally incoherent. It seems that he was pressured by his publisher on God knows what type of penalty clause, and to comply with the deadline he delivered a badly drafted, and poorly planned final chapters. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because along the book is possible to find some of its effective reflections which are always fun to deal with. He shall use his moral rights to take this book out of circulation forever. What stain on his otherwise wonderful novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"With this book Kundera became my favourite author","review":"This is a brilliant exploration of identity by one of the masters of European literature. Kundera's prose is lucid, (post)modern and gripping. This fascinating look at identity, at love, and those fleeting moments that shape our lives will stay with you for a long time. Read it! Read his work! You'll love it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard Kundera: brilliant","review":"The great thing about Kundera novels is that they say things. This is a big problem with a lot of novelists writing today--they aren't saying anything. Plot takes a backseat to what Kudera is saying, though the plot isn't bad. It is difficult to peel back the layers of Kundera's point, but--as the title shows--he's commenting on identity: the identity we create for ourselves and the identity we create for others in our own mind. The novel raises more questions than it answers, but that's the sign of a great novel. Isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"Who talks like the characters in this book?

Keith Jarrett and Michala Petri have put together a series of performances that sound so \\"right \\" that you cannot imagine them played otherwise.The recorder playing, especially, is intriguing. Michala produces a sound similar to a flute, but a little darker and more mellow. Recorder, especially for Baroque music, is highly underrated. This is a great addition to any Baroque collection.A superb technical effort combined with an interpretation that lets the spirit of the music shine through.

And if you haven't seen the film, go check it out. *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Choice","review":"I spent 6 months in South East Asia and was determined to master the Malay Language. As you may know both the Malays and the Indonesians speak a very similar language known as Bahasa.If you want to learn the Malay 'Bahasa Malaysia' then this book is perfect. It takes you through a number of lessons and by the end you really have a good grasp on this simple language. By taking the courses again and again and thus repeating the book you can develop a stronger handle on Bahasa and you are then ready to start practising!Bahasa Malayu (Malay) is very useful when in SE Asia in Malaysia and Singapore. Some Indonesians will be able to understand but you may need to adjust some words and pronounciations - similar to two people one from the UK and the other from the US with a strong American accent.Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a paint job","review":"I purchased this in SEP 2009 and it's still holding its place on the tow hitch of my truck. For its purpose, it has done well. The foam seal has kept water out of my hitch receiver as advertised and it definitely meets my requirement of having something different as I just don't like being the 10,000th person with a \\"RAM\\" or a ram head hitch cover. The only thing that got it a 4 star is that the tongue's red color only lasted about 3 months before it started fading and was basically completely gone in about 5 months. Not a big thing as I have model paints and touch up automotive paints to fix that when I get around to it.

A few years ago I heard a CBC radio feature on Jon Vickers where they played Every Valley. It was one of those rare \\"What is THAT?\\" moments that I have had all to rarely in years of playing and listening to music. Finally I bought the recording and listen to it around Christmas every year, and love it more every time.While I appreciate the scholarly concepts behind period performance, I often find it boring in practice. Small orchestra, small choir? What's the point? Give me big, bold and raucous. If you want authentic, hire a bunch of musicians who can't play in tune and hire an unheated hall. I'll take Beecham, the reorchestration, the opera singers and all the inauthenticity one can muster if it produces music-making like this. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ornamentated Messiah","review":"If you want a Messiah as big as the planet, but with style, get this famous Beecham version done with romantic ornamentations. It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a powerful version","review":"Beecham's Messiah is performed with a powerful version of the full orchestra. In the original version of today's mainstream music is valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messiah mistreated","review":"First of all, there is nothing wrong with the soloist or the rest of the performers of this interpretation of Messiah - in fact, the execution of the work is impeccable. However, it is a performance quite unlike the Messiah intended by Handel. The orchestra has swelled to Wagnerian proportions, even adding instruments like the cymbal, the triangle and tubas, alien and unknown to Handel. It is a Romantic version of a Baroque work. That is potentially interesting. You might expect to gain extra depth, power and grandeur by this, but the overall effect is not good - to tell the truth, the result revolts me! It is like a woman overadorned with jewelry, hiding the natural beauty beneath a veil of vulgarity... This is one historic recording that we don't need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good theory, poor practice","review":"The idea of doing Messiah with a Wagnerian orchestra is interesting. But it needs the orchestral genius of a Wagner or Tchaikovsky, and Beecham doesn't have that. It almost seems as if the orchestration is done by a random process. There is no meaning in the changes of color. Whether this is Beecham's fault, or whether it demonstrates that Handel as Wagner doesn't work, will have to be left to a future orchestrator to resolve.Regarding the actual performance, I find it undistiguished. Not the worst (Bonynge gets that title), but not worth a second listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even bear the overture... although this was just my personal taste","review":"Even though I didn't even like the playing of the overture, I kept listening because I was curious. However, after listening to the whole recording, I decided not to hear it again. I wasn't a \\"purist\\" (and I'm not even quite sure what it means in terms of music) and I wasn't against arrangements or modern instruments. Still, I found nothing in this recording that I could personally like. First of all, the recorded sound was a problem for me (due to limitations of the recording technology at the time). It distracted me. However, I couldn't appreciate the conducting, either. I did find the tempi slow, but I believe I was bothered more by his phrasing. Among the ones I've listened to, my favorite recording of this work remains the one by Christopher Hogwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find breaker","review":"This breaker matched my needs, was sent quickly and worked as expected.

The text itself is just challenging enough for kids of that age, but what I had TOTALLY forgotten about was the whole fact that in the book, while there are black people, they're all household help or holding menial jobs. I'm not black, and I found this all very offputting when I started to re-read the book after the kid had gone to bed. I think it gives a very skewed view of how things were, and certainly of how things are, and I wholeheartedly can't recommend these books to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have been looking for this book for a long time.

Mathiessen. But these essays are not a miscellany. They are the culmination of a careful mind's work of two decades, and model a method for queering history and culture that simply does without the polemics or technical jargon that typically characterize such projects.

May send mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Travel!","review":"Needed a compact size for traveling and so far, these seem to work well. The curlers are not heavy and the clips pack well in the case. I also like that you heat them up in the case. I have medium shoulder length hair and the 12 curlers are plenty. Only drawback, it would have been a nice feature if the curlers indicated when they are ready but not a big deal. They don't get super hot but the curl was just as i get with my regular hot rollers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact nice looking set; poor performance","review":"Pros:1. Compact size.2.

The hair grips they talk about are useless. You can't even call them grips. And the curlers don't get hot enough. My hair looked whack when done. I'm going back to my curling iron.

Using hot rollers as opposed to a curling iron, my hair is fuller, curlier and softer. On advice from my stylist I just run my fingers through my hair after removing the rollers.

It is the perfect size, not too bulky or heavy. It fit into my carry on bag. It heats up quickly. Actually stays in your hair with the clips provided. It did not dry out my hair. It does make your hair curly. So you do have to judge the amount of time the curlers are in your hair, if you don't want a curly look. My hair is to the middle of my neck.

One reviewer didn't like the \\"teeth\\" in this, but I found it helped me.

Unfortunately they don't seem to heat sufficiently to make long lasting curls. I debated whether to send these back, tried them 2 times, and this morning decided to return them. I made my decision based on how my hair looks today after using a standard size curling setter. My hair is much fuller, much bouncier, with much more long lasting curls. By the end of 3 hours with the Conair compact, my hair would be pretty much uncurled, with maybe some slight curling left at the ends. It just doesn't justify the price. I'll be looking for a replacement that heats better and provides better curling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"I've owned many hair curlers, and I was looking for one that offered large rollers and fast heat up. I was disappointed on both points. First, the \\"large\\" rollers are not large. They're medium. The smaller ones are really small. I plug it in before my shower, and even after showering and blow drying my hair, it's still not really heated up like it should. The only thing I can say that's positive about this product is the compact size of the unit and the number of rollers, which is nice. But if you're looking for large rollers (greater than a one inch diameter, and something that heats up really fast -- this one is NOT for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with these rollers","review":"They heat up quickly, are compact and manage to curl my thick medium length hair. I have bigger sets of hot rollers but I always go back to these."},{"rating":"1","title":"curlers small and cumbersome","review":"These curlers are quite small and the curls made me look a bit like Shirley Temple as a youngster (which probably dates me by the reference -- but let's put it this way, not becoming on an-at-least-middle-aged person) There is no way to know when the curlers are hot. The curlers stayed in just fine and are easy to keep clean. It is certainly compact for travel.If you want small, tight curls this is a good option for travel because you get more than the five jumbos in other travel cases.

They do not get hot enough to really make any difference. I remember she had kept reheating them and was in bathroom for almost two hours and when she finally finished you could hardly see any difference. The pins to hold them in place are cheap and flimsy. So i also bought her the larger clamps that are made for these and sold separatly , this still made no difference. I guess you get what you pay for and the cost being so cheap also delivers cheap results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the easy quick curl","review":"I couldn't wait to get my new set of hot rollers. They are all that I had hoped they would be: compact and easy to cary or store, heat up fast and don't burn your fingers when you use them, give lasting curl in a short amount of time (left them in 5 to 10 min.)

Basically it falls apart. I believe that what happened is that without historical concensus to determine what is important and less important, the book bogs down as it delivers raw facts about present day theater without a framework or context to organize the message.Never the less, I am keeping the book at 5 stars because if you are looking to read a book on Theater History, this is the one to get.

It has a lot of good information, but the authors write about it in such a roundabout way that it's exhausting to read. Many sentences are unnecessarily long and wordy.

Not even close to being worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete & Poorly Edited","review":"I'm required to use this text for the theatre history sequence I teach at a state university. I frequently have to refer to Brockett to fill in the missing historical information. On many occasions I've found information in the text that is simply not well-researched and out-of-line with even the most conservative theatre scholarship. Wilson & Goldfarb also need a decent editor. There is considerable repetition of information, and the structure of the text leaves much to be desired. In an attempt to make theatre history non-threatening, the book only succeeds in being inconsistently informative.

I am still not sure what was accomplished by the desert protection act. The tale is told in a disjointed manner that is hard to follow. I know much hard work went into these activities, but it will not come through in this book.Also note that this book is very partisan. For example, groups that ride motorcycles in the desert are portrayed in a negative manner, I guess as the enemy. I would like to have seen their viewpoint presented. So, this book may give you some idea of what happened, but only from one side.It is not a book for the student of politics, too one sided, and the story proceeds in a random fashion. I hoped to understand what was protected, why, how various viepoints were served. Instead, it is a \\"pat on the back\\" to a handful of individuals. I wish it would be postured as such, and I could have saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!","review":"This is the stupidest, fakest film I have ever seen. As a life-long hunter & outdoorsman, it was obvious to me that most of the hunting & shooting sequences in this film were phony. The animals were tied to trees and shot at close range. The supposed grande finale was the phoniest, the elephant Tembo being a baby elephant tied to a tree and shot while it is wailing & thrashing, with bad editing shots of a different grown elephant. These guys were also demonstrating the worse hunter traits & ethics by picking up & taking back to camp baby animals. That is absolutely not done by hunters! The only good part of this film is the hilarious sequence where Hill uses the native boy as bait to lure in & kill the crocodile. Other than that this film is a complete waste of money & time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good self-help book","review":"This book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.

However, Edgar Cayce and his teachings have been clear, to the point, insightful and more importantly, I feel I am getting the truth. I am not misguided in any way. This is another book that makes me feel as though I am gaining something more to take with me, And after 18 years and having read so many books, that is not always easy.

I am sure there are more interesting books that can be used for textbooks. I would not purchase this book to read for pleasure.

To be honest, this book could have been 10 pages long. The story was interesting for the first few pages but it became extremely repetitive. This book basically had two elements: stories about the people/cultures she encountered on her walk, and complaints about politics. The book never became specific with its politics, just general statements. If you're going to be political, then be political; don't be general. Second, the people she encountered were described the same throughout the book.Let me summarize the whole story with one short paragraph:\\"I met some amazing people today that let me into their home warmly.

Shane played such a dominant role in the Pogues, that his absence is just glaring. I hate dogging the boys, I mean it was not like them and Shane had this heated split. Shane wanted to leave the band and the guys were tired of dealing with this drunken and erratic behavior.

A few songs would be decent if this were not The Pogues-- when you raise the bar high you need to meet it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Pogues!","review":"I've heard some songs from the Pogues before, and was very impressed. The Pogues come highly recommended and I absolutely love Shane McGowan's drunken Irish singing. Shane McGowan is a legend. He's a brilliant songwriter. Shane McGowan is the Pogues.But McGowan is not with the Pogues for this album. And it severely suffers as a result. I was not aware of this when I purchased this album. I was sorely disappointed. The new singer is mediocre, and the music is rather uninspired. Without Shane McGowan, the Pogues simply don't exist.If you're looking for classic Pogues, don't buy this album. You'd be much better off picking up such classics as \\"Red Roses For Me\\" or \\"Rum, Sodomy, and The Lash\\". That's what I'll be doing.I only hope I can forgive myself for wasting money on \\"Pogue Mahone\\". Maybe it'll grow on me in time.

In fact, its amazing its as good as it is. Keep in mind Shane Macgowan was no longer with the band at this time, and he was the heart and soul of the band, not to mention an amazing songwriter. Putting that aside, this is a good album, and I would probably think of it more highly if I hadn't come to expect so much from this group. There are some really great tracks on here like \\"How Come\\", \\"Living In A World Without Her\\", \\"When The Ship Comes In\\" & \\"Bright Lights\\". However, the rest of the album is nothing special. If you are just getting into the Pogues get \\"Rum Sodomy & The Lash\\", \\"Red Roses For Me\\" & \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" before you even begin to consider buying this album. If you are a Pogues fan and are wondering what the band sounded like without Macgowan, definitely get this over \\"Waiting For Herb\\" (which is a terrible album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just don't expect it to sound like Shane...","review":"This isn't as good as earlier Pogues with MacGowan, but compared to other recordings in the Celtic rock genre, this isn't a bad album. Released under any name other than the Pogues I think this would be considered a decent collection of songs. It does still have that same accordion, banjo & whistle driven atmosphere that is a hallmark of the Pogues. In a genre that had & has its share of amateurish bands, you can definitely tell that this is a band of professionals. Of course it's totally predictable that there would be an outcry against a Shaneless Pogues, so resist jumping on the band wagon and enjoy this album for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Packaging but a Keeper.","review":"This is one of those strange, offbeat European releases--who knows where they got the tape? The major two quirks about the CD are the title (since \\"No Greater Love,\\" a tune Sonny often performed, is not on the album) and the sound of Eddie Lockjaw Davis' unmistakable tenor sax on two of the tunes (\\"LAX\\" and \\"Four\\"). Besides the unannounced Lockjaw, an unidentified trumpet player solos on the aforementioned cuts.As for the music, it's fine late Stitt and characteristically heated Lockjaw. The trumpet player's presence is minimally felt (possibly Harry Sweets Edison, since one of the tunes is a Sweets' original). The rhythm section is on fire the whole way (few drummers swing like Duffy Jackson; few piano players can match Eddie Higgins' chops and ideas). The sound is very \\"present,\\" capturing the ambience of live performance but also balancing the instruments very tastefully.At the right price, this one is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny...","review":"Classic DeGeneres here!

I really never get tired of this album unlike the band's last release \\"More than You Think You Are\\" this one isn't a chore to listen to and it seems as if every song could have been a single. If there's one album I'll remember when I'm old it is this one. It seems so rare for an album to really catch your attention but this album and Dave Matthews Band's \\"Crash\\" both band's really hit the nail on the head and released classic's.I'm sure by now most everyone that will buy this album has already heard half of it on the radio, but if you are one of those people that still don't have this album then I would encourage you to pick it up because the song's that never made it to radio are just as good if not better than song's that did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"This CD is definately a masterpiece. It contains many huge hits from adult contemporary radio stations (And some of them broke into mainstream as well). The CD starts out with Real World, which was a monster hit. Other huge hits are the songs 3 a.m., Push, which is about a man reminiscing about relationships gone wrong, and one of TRL's (The MTV Top 10 Countdown show) biggest hits Back 2 Good. The two main things that make this album a masterpiece are Rob's voice and the lyrics. Rob Thomas has an unique voice that works well with practically every tempo. It sounds perfect on every song in the entire album. The lyrics, like many bands with similar musical styles, make sense and the band members have probably experienced all of the emotions conveyed in the lyrics before, as they connect with you. This is definately an album worth getting. I'd definately advise it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiver Me Timbers","review":"Aaargh, matee. This pirate looking quartet from Florida have inspired a new craze in the puffy shirt and hoop earring scene. And to accompany their latest craze is their lack luster release. This radio friendly wonderband is well on its way obscurity and obesity, the same fate Ginger Spice is now living out."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, I'm really sick now....","review":"I'm sick of hearing everyone say how \\"this band is the best\\" and \\"the album is wonderful\\". This band is far from great. To the person who said that Matchbox 20 will be in the rock and roll hall of fame, I say: First let them release a second album, then we'll talk. I read so many post that said Rob Thomas sings with such \\"passon\\". He honestly sounds like some one punched him in the gut too many times. Someone else said that the only reason Santana's \\"Smooth\\" is such a hit is because of Rob Thomas. Rob Thomas is the only reason that it wasn't an even bigger hit. Honestly people, think before you type. Matchbox 20 is very far from being the best band ever, and Rob Thomas' voice is awful. To anyone who likes this album I'll say the same thing I tell the boy band and teeny band lovers: Listen to some real music like Boston, Collective Soul, and Cream to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Attempted Murder of Rock'n'Roll","review":"Matchbox 20 showed early on how they were in on the plot to murder rock'n'roll with this album. If bands like Matchbox 20, the GooGoo Dolls, and Third Eye Blind went away, the face of rock might look genuine once more. As it is, this drivel is what passes for rock in the minds of many.This can substitute for rock for only so long. People will find out after too long that this stuff has no staying power. Viva lo autentico!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst band of the last 5 years","review":"These dullards are so bad. I mean come on, listen to this guys voice! It is so fake and melodramatic, made worse with the 90210 style guitar hooks that are evenly spaced within each song. \\"Its 3am I must be lonlehh, ehh, ehh\\" Give me a break. These guys are on the same musical level as the Backstreet Boys. Santana must have been desperate for some cash to enlist whiner boy Rob Thomas's annoying voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"This album is my favorite and I have had it for about a year now. Ever since Rob Thomas has been played on the radio, I have adored his voice. Some critisize it, yet I believe it to be one of the most passionate voices I have ever heard. The entire album is filled with these songs; Push used to be my favorite song until I heard the album. Now practically every song is my favorite; \\"Back to Good,\\" \\"Hang,\\" \\"Busted,\\" \\"Long Day\\" and \\"Push\\" are my favorite on the album. Each one express a different emotion which we all feel at some time in our lives. Rob Thomas actually did make the Santana song; he wrote it! Without him Santana may not have made such a big come back (which is good since they're awesome). I cannot wait until May 23 when their new album comes out; hopefully it will be as good as this one is. All in all, Rob Thomas is a wonderful and talented musician who writes almost all of his own songs and sings with immense passion as well as intensity. This album is a great one to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformative and Moving","review":"My musical tastes are quite eclectic to say the least. I move from Bach to Rock and all places in between as long as its quality. However, whenever I listen to \\"back 2 good\\", I feel like I am actually transported into the body of a person who has deep pain and sorrow. This song continues to have an effect on me over 10 years later from the first time I heard it. Most of the other songs are great for the unusual mix of depth and pop appeal. This album is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good?","review":"This CD, after coming out with their epic hit \\"3 am\\", hit the charts at number one. Right now though, they are awful. Their repetitive tunes are getting old. Songs like Back 2 good and Push don't cut it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate them so much I'm writing a second review.","review":"Anybody who says that Matchbox 20 is their favorite band and that Rob Thomas's lyrics are the best they've heard so far obviously quit school because they are not educated to not like them. People who never quit school or are still in school like me are educated to know that Matchbox 20 is not a band to be admired. Check out The Goo Goo Dolls. NOW THAT'S A BAND TO BE ADMIRED! ! ! !P.S. Rob Thomas can't sing, either! I mean, have you heard him scream his vocal cords (If he has any) hoarse in Back 2 Good?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fun to listen to . . .","review":"A ringing endorsement, that. Anyway, the purpose of current music is not to uplift the soul or to evoke deep emotion but to entertain. And this album does that very well. Matchbox 20's music is energetic and entertaining, mostly. And it's not insipid (like the Backstreet Boys), demeaning (like Britney Spears), or offensive to the ears (like all those bands which seem to think that destroying their vocal cords and our eardrums is \\"real music\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing","review":"the band is definately a keeper and will be around a long time putting out big hits..

Matchbox 20 really put effort and it shines through with their debut cd! I was an instant fan and now they are my favorite band they are going to be legends i can feel it.Rob Thomas' soulful singing, Kyle Cook and Adam Gaynor's awesome guitars and great backup vocals, Brian Yales rocking performances on bass and Kyle Cook's upbeat and pounding drumming, they are all wonderful performers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"For all of you, who think matchbox20 is a \\"one-hit-wonder\\" band, that is to say IMPOSSIBLE. If they were a ONE-hit-wonder band...they wouldn't have 5 #1 hits on there hands, now would they? THINK B4 YOU TYPE. And Rob was ASKED to perform Smooth with Carlos..not that he's doin a so-called \\"solo\\" thing. So please, get your facts straight, don't ASSUME. And 4 your info, BECAUSE of Rob, Smooth AND Supernatural hit #1 status on all the charts..passing up all the stinky boy groups..THANK GOD!! Rob does have more hip moves and grooves then most people THINK..don't underestimate him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Match box 20","review":"Match box 20 is great I think Rob Thomas is so sexy. I love his voice. And the song he did with Santana was great. He has such a nice voice. The CD, Yourself or someone like you, was great. I loved all the songs. I hope Matchbox 20 will be around for a long time. P.S. I love you Rob Thomas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hootie revisited","review":"Hey does anyone out there remember Hootie and the Blowfish? If you do, would you actually admit to having bought their CD? Trust me, Matchbox fans: about 90% of you will no longer be interested in this band by the time their third album rolls around. Before you know it, most of you will have jumped on the next bandwagon and you will have completely forgotten about MB20. Just like you forgot about Hootie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lyrics, bad singing!","review":"Rob Thomas is much easier on the eyes than the ears! (he's pretty but he can't sing!)

MY RECOMMENDTION, GET THIS CD NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline of Western Music as we know it!","review":"Just when you thought alternative music could not get any worse, this band comes out. Alternative music has now become what metal became in the late 80's. This is the alternaive equivalent of Poison, Warrant, (insert any other Hair band). When alternative music becomes unpopular, this band will be back where they belong, working at the Waffle House. Backstreet Boys are actually a step above these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good CD to have if your depress","review":"I haven't heard all the songs.But 4 of them like \\"PUSH\\",\\"Back2Good\\" \\"RealWorld\\"and \\"3AM\\"I might get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has the rock gone?","review":"It seems bands today have one reason to release their CDs. One reason: to make a large amount of money in a short period. Let's go back to the days when rock was packed full of quality music. You didn't have to look for it, it was on the radio. Now, Matchbox 20, Creed, Third Eye Blind, and Barenaked Ladies, among others, are spewing off music that they want everyone to like. One problem, most bands today have no originality. At the turn of every decade, rock seems to change. I will see the 90's as a decade that started off with a bang and ended with a fizzle. Lets hope this time the change happens once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Yeah, after carefully reviewing this album I think that I can speak on behalf on all decent music lovers all over the globe that this band is composed of pirates. This music isn't emotionally driven, it's emotional drivel. This album needs to walk the plank or the band needs to go into the business of makiing frozen fish sticks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only band I've ever gone NUTZ for!","review":"I listen to this CD almost everyday. I never get wrapped in bands, but these guys rock! My two favorite tracks are Long Day, which makes my heart flutter, and the not as popular track #10, Busted. I had never been to a concert, but when I heard these guys were coming to town I was in line at 6a.m. at ticket master and front and center at the concert. Some people may think they're nothing much, but me...I love 'em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brimming with humdrum and horse hockey","review":"Yeah, after carefully listening to this so-called album, I concluded that the band seems to possess this lack of talent so low that only someone like a pirate could only have. You see, I have to agree with those past reviews that these puffy-shirt wearing band of misfits are nothing but a reminder of those marauders of the sea called pirates. Also this album isn't emotionally driven, it's emotional drivel. This four-eyed band really needs to try better next time with making an actual decent album or try to go into the business of making frozen fish sticks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album i have ever heard.","review":"i think this is the greatest cd i have ever had the pleasure of hearing and i think every household in the world should own it and i can't wait for their next one. to matchbox20, you guys are incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Boring","review":"This album should be titled 1001 ways to rip off Hootie and the Blowfish, with one half the talent. The music is dead boring. And the melodies are brain dead. The lyrics are at most average. This is the kind of album that makes you wonder if rock is truly dead. There was some controversy over whether the song \\"Push\\" is about abusing women. Who cares. A song that horrible doesn't deserve controversy."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical cookie-cutter \\"adult alternative contemporary\\"","review":"The apparent success of this CD is just another indication of the depths to which the current tastes of the music buying public has sunk in the late 90's.

This band just doesn't have what it takes. That's all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hideous Piece of Trash","review":"I didn't buy this record.

It was the first one I listened to after buying the CD. There was a 'Superhero' theme going on at my school at the time and the reference in the song always put that in my head.Matchbox 20 keeps putting out some really good stuff (Mad Season, More Than You Think You Are). They are one of those bands that always has fresh, new material that fans can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun & enjoyable album to listen to.","review":"I've been listening to this album for quite some time now. With smash hits such as \\"Real World,\\" \\"Push,\\" \\"3AM,\\" \\"Back 2 Good\\" and the heart-felt ballad of \\"Hang\\" is the reason why I bought this album. This album along with Rob Thomas' musical-prowess, is what laid the \\"ground-work\\" for this band. (Rob has brilliantly collaborated with the likes of an extraordinary, music-legend: Carlos Santana, producing some #1 hit-singles.) Many of Matchbox 20's singles have peaked-high on the \\"Top-40\\" music charts, since the mid-'90's. I don't know a whole lot about the band, I've never seen them in concert; I'd like to see them perform, one-of-these-days. I do however, acknowledge some of the (band's shortcomings) songs I don't particulary care for such as \\"Long Day\\" and \\"Damn,\\" which is why I give this album ***4-stars*** The bottom line: This is a fun & enjoyable album to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it as a frisbee","review":"There is a couple of mediocre songs on this album, but you wouldn't believe how far you can launch a cd if thrown properly.

I was wrong. The major problem with Yourself or Someone like you is I know what's around every corner. As a listener, I want the music to chalenge me. This does nothing of the sort. Another problem, which is not the band's fault, is that all the singles were destroyed by FM radio. I've heard the song \\"3AM\\" so many times I want to puke. It goes back to the repetiveness. With the first single \\"Push\\", I thought they had something going. The the next single \\"3Am\\" came out and it just didn't chalenge me. Rob Thomas's voice, however strong it might be, has an annoying hitch to it that makes me think how yet another standard rock band made it this far.

To call this rock is a mockery. Who do these guys think they are fooling? They are a blatant void of talent and play with such an obvious lack of passion, not to mention they are completely unoriginal. This band is a bunch of rock and roll wannabes who would be disgraced by the true great bands they pretend to sound like. Generic, repetitive, boring, pathetic. That about sums this band up.

I admit, \\"Push\\" was catchy, but after hearing it two or three (or eventually, two or three-thousand) times, it became very annoying. \\"3AM\\" and \\"Real World\\" (nice try with the camel in the video, guys, but it was quite dumb) are absolutely awful sequels to \\"Push,\\" in that they sound EXACTLY alike. And one more thing: Have you heard the lead singer talk? He talks like a normal human being. Perhaps the most annoying thing about this band (and there are plenty of annoying things) is that he completely changes his voice when he sings--whenever he hears the band in the background, I guess, he has to start grunt-singing.

I certainly can't tell you. It is certainly obvious that this band was formed for radio play. The whole album is devoid of any originality, the band has no talent whatsoever, and their songs just suck. The vocals have that same ear-peircing whine and seizure inducing inflections that keeps humanity from enjoying radio stations. Every station, for some reason, adopted this crappy band as their own, forcing us to hear \\"Push\\" every time we turn on the radio. Why don't they just keep it to themselves?

So, please, if you want to spend time actually becoming one with an artist -- really getting into the mind of the songwriter, please listen to \\"Yourself Or Someone Like You.\\" Don't let anything sway you from actually LISTENING, not hearing, but listening to Rob's lyrics and the music performed by Kyle Cook, Adam Gaynor, Brian Yale and Paul Douchette.

What sets it apart from the pack is the vocal contortions of Rob Thomas. This guy's gutteral croakings and alternate whinings -- which some have described as \\"heartfelt\\" -- will almost induce vomiting. Self pity has never been so wretchedly on display as on this grossly over-played CD. Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one star was a gift","review":"If there was an option for no stars this would definatelly be the CD to use it for... childish riffs, childish percussion and lame lyrics- it's no wonder MB20 sold so many albums to the youth of America... if you fall in the category of \\"I actually payed money for this album\\" I ragret to inform you that there is no hope for you ever attaining any sort of respectable status amongst people that actually pay attention to what the hell they are listening to. If you are reading this and are insulted.... good, that is my intent. Band's like this make a mockery of real music and should be cast away and insulted, if you enjoy this album, good for you and please don't try and wrap your mind around real music because it will only confuse you and make you watch more TRL and listen to more top 40 radio, which will in turn keep you the hell away from my music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO TALENT WHATSOEVER!","review":"These people have no talent at all!

This cd, \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\" is different from so many other modern rock albums because it has a VARIETY of songs, I personally adore all of them. From the hard rock and roll songs \\"Argue\\" and \\"Busted\\" to the soft, soothing \\"Hang\\" and \\"Shame\\" the debut album from the men of Matchbox 20 has it all, and then some.The combination of great music and meaningful lyrics gives a combination that makes this cd as wonderful as it is. The issues dealt with are real and something people can easly identify with, they give you a sense of hope and strength which is rare today with most of music's shallow cd's. This is the #1 best album I have ever heard in my 18 years of life. Whoever does not have this album should RUN, not walk and get this. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical alternative crap","review":"I'm 15 and I bought this CD shortly after it came out. I liked \\"Push\\" and \\"3 AM\\", and even the other stuff seemed pretty good. Then about a year later i started listening to a lot of '80s rock and realized that alternative rock sucks. Van Halen, Def Leppard, Billy Idol, and Motley Crue rock, and Matchbox 20 seems pretty weak in comparison. They have no attitude, and their songs aren't very original either. If you want to get alternative rock get REM, but not this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING","review":"\\"PUSH\\" IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD. ALL THE OTHER SONGS GET BORING AFTER A WHILE.

If this album can be considered a masterpiece, then the state of rock music is in a sorry state as we are on the cusp of a new millenium. This album is not horrible - although I've grown to hate Matchbox 20 after the excessive radio play they have received - it is simply mediocre. 'Push\\" and 'Long Day' are alright songs, but the album as a whole is pretty dull, and it doesn't get any better after repeated listens, either. Also, no matter what the fans out there say, the lyrics really aren't that deep - they're pretty simple. For instance: \\"I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho...I wish the real world would stop hassling me.\\" I'm 23 years old and these lyrics even sound pretty immature to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so much that I listen to it everyday in the car!","review":"The best album I have heard in along time!

I bought this disc on the good word of a friend who's word isn't so good anymore. I was told that it wasn't the typical 90's disc. That it wasn't a much tired \\"Grunge\\" crossover. Nor did it have a singer that sings like Elmer Fudd. He told me the songs didn't all sound like they were recorded in a plastic bag under the ocean in a hurricane. And speaking of horrific production I have this qustion for you. Why is it that in the 1990's we have made all these technologial advances in the music industry yet \\"Sherryl Crow\\" still sounds like she recorded her discs in the 60's? Can we move forward please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring and Unimaginative","review":"I'm so glad I bought this cd used and didn't shell out twenty bucks on such a uninspiring cd that is called \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\". Has rock and roll music been reduced to such bland, unimaginative dreck like Matchbox Twenty? My problems with this band is that their music offers nothing special to me. Rob Thomas's songwriting abilities is as average as the lead singer from Hootie and the Blowfish. The songs may be catchy but not enough to convince me enough that they are anything special. I may dislike teen pop and rap/rock but it is bands such as Matchbox Twenty that I can't stand the most. This band can't be anymore banal, white bread, average and dull as they already are. I'm sorry I own this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this all of you people who actully like MB20","review":"I really liked Matchbox 20 three years ago, but hear latey I really have started to hate them. I like there songs Back to Good Push and Real World but all of there other songs are pretty bad. Also, they show that they don't really care about there fans since they are taking so long in releasing another album. It don't take three year the make an album. If they keep up at these rate then they will have like four albums by the time they are 50. Maybe they have ran out of song ideas. I don't know. During these time of waiting I have found a really good band Collective Soul.

And as history often repeats itself, we have encountered the next generation of maritime marauders. Our modern day mariners, Matchbox 20, take us aboard their sinking ship and sing, much to our displeasure, woeful tales of scurvy and of the time where they drank a little too much rum and of how there's an akward and uncomfortable silence anytime anyone mentions the phrase \\"sword fight!\\" now.

I can only think of one type of person that would come with something that stupid; a pirate. Ah yes, after listening to the album, I concluded that the music was applesauce as Rob Thomas uses his constipated-like voice to make sounds.

It brought me back to my VT roots. Not only did I enjoy the characters, and find them very realistic to the Vermont environment, but mostly I found myself intrigued with the specific venues of Vermont that the author brought to life. The way he characterizes the people and places within the book makes even a \\"real Vermonter\\" feel this is a person and a place they know. I was most excited about the fact that it was the first book that both I, a 40+ year old high-tech Boston suburbanite and my father, a 65 year old Vermont Dairy Farmer enjoyed it. It's a multi-generational book that I encourage you to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Okay, the ratings for this product are stuffed with reviews from the spoken CD and from the novel itself. Obviously, those should be ignored - they were put out by the publishing company and they are only here to prop up the book's rating on Amazon. I have the hardcover edition. This novel is very ordinary. There is nothing wrong about writing about the ordinary lives of ordinary people, as long as it is well-written. This is not. There is plenty of setting description about the small town lifestyle in Vermont, but I found the sensory descriptions weren't especially vivid, even though they seem like they should be. And the characters weren't terribly well-developed either for me to care much about what happens to them.

More recent Brian Culbertson CD's follow this formula, but this CD is so caught up in the \\"Quiet Storm\\" motif that I longed for the \\"storm\\"--this CD is all about the \\"quiet.\\"First of all, there is not a single song with a discernable beat.Second, many of the songs are so self absorbed they have \\"introductions\\" as a prelude to the song.

Unless of course you are a dentist--you might find the CD useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Plea to Purchase","review":"The epistles of John are not as well known as some other literature in the New Testament. Sadly!! This is a great resource for the pastor who wants to provide a sermon series on the neglected Johannine epistles. This is a model commentary on 1, 2, and 3 John and may be used by the pastor in a way that fulfills the purpose and intent of the Interpretation commentary series. I recommend this book highly. D. Moody Smith has written a book on the three Johannine letters marked by clarity and interpretive acumen.

It's also by far the best recording of Guys and Dolls I have yet heard. The cast, including Nathan Lane, Faith Prince, Peter Gallagher, and Josie DeGuzman, is first-rate, and the music, of course is classic. The new orchestrations and dance music add a huge amount of energy and zest that simply isn't to be found on other recordings of the score.

While Nathan Lane is great as Nathan Detroit and Faith Prince is divine as Miss Adelaide, the rest of the cast is a surprising disappointment. In particular, Walter Bobbie is an absolute let-down as Nicely-Nicely Johnson -- his delivery on \\"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\\" is anti-climactic with a far-too-fast tempo and a less-than-stellar singing voice.The only real thing this album has going for it is to hear Faith Prince's superb \\"Adelaide's Lament.\\" If you can only afford one \\"Guys and Dolls\\" recording for your collection, my recommendation is the all African-American revival recording from the 1970s, starring Robert Guillaume as Sky Masterson and a rapturous Ken Page as Nicely-Nicely Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was good but service was poor.","review":"I was very disappointed. It took almost 2 weeks from the time I ordered the cd until I received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"My only real frame of reference is the movie with Sinatra and Brando. Maybe not the best to campare with, even so I have to say that, with the exception of Nathan Lane and Faith Prince, the performances on the CD lacked the life I would have expected. Maybe it's the effect he was going for as the suave, worldly gambler, but Peter Gallagher's Sky Masterson just came across as bored. His voice was also not the quality I would have expected from a Broadway-caliber performer. I almost hate to admit it, but I even prefer Brando's rendition of \\"Luck be a Lady\\" over the one on this CD. The movie version of \\"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\\" was also far superior. Some of \\"Sky's\\" songs (complete songs, not snippets/samples) can also be found at Peter Gallagher's web site.I found the CD at my local library, so I avoided having to pay for the disappointment. I would recommend you try to borrow a copy before deciding whether it's actually worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"stars in the sky","review":"My only reservation about this otherwise fabulous recording is that Peter Gallagher is a little too nice to play the role of Sky Masterson. While he has a beautiful singing voice, the charisma and mystery of Brando isn't quite there. Otherwise I thought all the singers were fabulous and an improvement certainly on the movie version, Nathan Lane is priceless as Nathan Detroit (move over Sinatra), Faith Prince is hysterical as Adelaide (ah-CHOOO!!), Josie de Guzman is a compelling Sarah, and the minor characters are superb as well, in fact Fugue for Tinhorns and the title number sung largely by the supporting men may be the two best numbers in the whole program. Great orchestral arrangements too, sharp, brassy, and tight, complementing the singing perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Spunky Music","review":"I love the music from \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" I remember the music from when I was in a production of this show and I still love it!

This 1992 version is lifeless, in my book. The spoken parts on this CD seem wooden (and not in the gloriosly stilted manner of Damon Runyon's characters--just flat) and the songs lack punch. For my tastes, Sanatra (in the movie) was the ultimate sad sack Nathan Detroit, while NO ONE beats Stubby Kaye (original Broadway play and movie) as Nicely Nicely Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"i was very disappointed in the car charger it did not work at all and the other one that i bought had a short in the wires and then eventually broke after a weeks time"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"anyone who is from montauk or the hamptons will this this book is lame. number one the photography is bad. number 2 this guy knows nothing about the area.

Sometimes it is OK but most of the time the audio quality is so bad I have turn it off.In defense of the product I am picky about sound quality, however my Saab radio makes it extremely difficult to integrate an iPod into the stereo so I thought this might be a solution. If you don't care about the sound quality it will be fine, else find a way to integrate the player directly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient","review":"Works very well. We have four TVs running off one Channel Master over-the-air DVR and antenna. We don't mind having every TV in the house play the same channel as we rarely have them all on at the same time. I put one of these with each TV (basement, upstair bedroom, kitchen, and family room) and they do a great job. Sometimes I'll have to punch a button twice, but it's usually pretty responsive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remoting your remote","review":"I use this to send a remote signal from my basement or bedroom into the family room to operate the digital cable tuner, DVR, and DVD player.

You need to tap the middle, and step on it fast when two zeros appear, otherwise they flash off and you have to start again. On the positive side, the numbers are large and readable. The downside is that the standing-on surface is a little narrower for a big guy like my husband to stand on comfortably. He is 300 + pounds and has some difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"This scale is extremely accurate! I go on it once get a reading and go again and get the same reading! A great buy for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So Big","review":"Good and accurate scale, however, I found that the actual standing space is a bit small, could be at least an inch wider to be more comfortable without the feeling of falling off. I am 200 lbs which makes this scale a bit small for my size as far a standing on it, however, someone smaller without a tummy like mine would be very comfortable on it... I will too, as soon as I get a bit more weight off of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scales","review":"Searching for High Capacity Bathroom scales seemed like a dream but I found \\"choices\\", I settled for the \\"Escali Bathroom Scales\\" and I am extremely satisfied with the purchase, I would recommend these to anyone that needs heavy duty and high reading scales to purchase, I am very happy with Mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escali High Capacity Large Display Bathroom Scale (400lb/180kg) Review","review":"This scale is just okay.

In this it delivered magnificently. If you just want to learn a little Russian for your trip then this is a great book to have. It is also an excellent source for basic grammer charts that can help you on a serious study. If you want to really learn Russian, this book will help but is by no means the only book you will need. Russian is a difficult language which will require a lot more serious and percise books than this. However, this is a good book to start with and really easy and clear to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st graders will miss the weaknesses of the book","review":"A good children's book should be, to some degree, rewarding and enjoyable to children and adult readers.

Interesting that he has been openly critical of Chick Corea's song writing yet here shows rather convincingly that he is no songwriter himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 track wonder","review":"Scott Henderson is a phenomenal guitar player, however, a blues songwriter he is not.The opening track, a funky bluey instrumental, is a grooving masterpiece of dynamics, phrasing & just all out guitar cool.The solo is one of my favourites of all time.The rest of the album is incredibly unlistenable.Super hokey \\"blues\\" songs that sound like some burned out session musician penned junk ie. souless & empty.Sure the performances are clean & Henderson pulls out some cool guitar moments, but whatever. it's dreck.The opener is the bomb tho..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I could get this!","review":"The book was a great purchase and arrived in perfect condition.

After recieving the item at an immediate glance I realized that it is used. The battery has pen marks on it, as well as scratches. When I contacted the company to replace the item they instructed me to send it back and they would replace it. They also said that ALL of there items are new. When i checked the cost to return the item it is more then i paid for the darn battery. So I guess I am forced to keep it.Most people that need new batteries for there phones need them for a reason... they most certainly do not want to replace there existing used battery with a battery used by someone else.I would not recommend this company to anyone, and I will never buy anything from them again!!!!BL"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of fakes","review":"I am sure the actual OEM battery sold at ligitimate stores are good.

Beware if the price is too low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing Results","review":"Bought two of these in March, one crapped out (zero output - shows shorted) in 2 weeks, the other did just today (3 months). Capacity was always poorer than the original battery and would require recharging to get through the day (original would run for 2 days under same conditions). I believe these are factory seconds discarded because they did not meet the OEM's test requirements. They sure are not true OEM batteries.

This is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing read","review":"I love to read historical fiction but this was a real dissapointment. There was no flow to the story. It seemed all the love scenes which were far to many and all alike, were just tied together loosely with extra verbage. I would have liked to see the characters more fully developed. More of a modern romance type book set in another time setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mistake I'm glad I made","review":"I got this book by mistake, meaning to get another book by the same title. I decided to give it a try anyway and I'm glad I did. This was my first Susan Carroll book and I liked it so much I immediately went out and got the other three books in the series. Ms. Carroll writes beautifully, her characters are well drawn in these books but Gabrielle is my favorite of the Cheney sisters and thus this is my favorite book of the series. These books are longer on romance, short on history. In fact there's really not much history at all, more like a historical setting for ficitional characters. So if you're looking for true historical fiction, this is not it, but her books are still quite enjoyable if you're looking for something on the lighter side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello? Can we say ... spoilers?","review":"I enjoyed the first book and was looking forward to reading the second in the series.Until I started reading the reviews and found folks discussing that \\"the devoted warrior\\" from the prior book had ... miraculously not died!Looking back I can see that, stupidly, the book's own descriptor mentions this, but in such a way that you might not quite get it.And the download description, Chapter One, infers that the heroine might be seeing a ghost or apparition.But the folks who read and reviewed the book didn't leave anything to the future reader's imagination.Thank you, oh so much, for the spoiler. ::rolls eyes to the heavens::Now can you tell me ... is Elvis alive, and who killed JFK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Historical Fiction","review":"This book was recommended to me as \\"historical fiction\\". Fiction is a perfect description, but historical is but a loose term used to describe this book. The few chapters I could tolerate were well written, however, I felt deceived in that the book was described as historical fiction, and I expect with historical fiction that the story is based mostly on fact. As far as I know, there was no place called \\"The Fair Isle\\" where women lived as \\"witches\\", in this time period or any other. That is the stuff of Arthurian Legend, and I was not under the impression that this work of \\"historical fiction\\" had legend and lore included in it. I don't mean to nit pick, but I was expecting a work of fiction based on fact, not legend. If you are looking for a good novel based on fact, try Sharan Newman, Sharon Kay Penman or Ken Follet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian Novel","review":"This novel is engaging, I must admit; but as such an unchallenging read, it seems to have been written for thirteen year-olds. The writing does not flow well, and the author really struggles to get the novel started. As a college graduate, I am a bit embarassed at having read this book, which I only finished because I paid fourteen dollars for it. I agree with the previous review that suggested this book should NOT be categorized as an historical novel, but rather as a romance. Among those who may enjoy this book are women who read \\"chic lit\\" such as \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" etc. Unstimulating, though somewhat interesting, similar to TV shows like \\"Date my Mom\\" and \\"ElimaDate.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great escape.","review":"I have read the entire series of these books and this is my favorite. Spy novel meets ancient witches. Wonderful romance. Would read them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me reading...","review":"Although slow at first, this book definitely kept my interest peaked. I started with this one (the second in the trillogy) and am now wanting to go back and read the other two books.Amazing sexual tension and fight scenes. Made me not want to pay attention in class. I blame this book for keeping me up at night. A definite for anyone who loves historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to make a silk purse out of sackcloth","review":"With the cover and placement of this book, you would think this would be a great historical novel, along the lines of Philippa Gregory's, but it belongs in the bodice-ripping romance section. Read Gregory or Karleen Koen or \\"Forever Amber\\" if you want good historical novels with romance and intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading the first book in the trilogy and loving it, I eagerly started this one. It was so bad I read about 1/3 and haven't picked it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of Strong Winds","review":"I love windchimes and have several. These being so different is why I just had to have them. The tag that you will receive with these will tell you that you shouldn't place them in an area that gets strong winds. There's a reason for that but I had to try it anyway and the chimes got twisted around each other. Big deal. I moved them. You'll deffinatly get compliments on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This windchime is horrible!","review":"The chime looks pretty, sounds pretty. That is, it sounds nice INSIDE! Because of its petal design, it spins like a helicopter propeller in the wind. Which means that it is quickly tangled up in a soundless knot whenever the wind blows. And if it is not secured tightly to the tree or hook it is hanging on, it will spin itself across the yard like a ufo. It is useless. After 3 attempts at hanging it around the outside of house, I have settled for hanging it in my garage. Woodstock Chimes are great....but NOT this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enlightened man of love who walked among us","review":"Holy Brother is a book that everyone, whether Jewish or not, whether on a spiritual path or not, should read. Rabbi Schlomo Carlebach was a gift to human aspiration, a living manifestation of heavenly love. The stories of his boundless goodness, earthy personality, and prescient mind touch the miraculous and the mundane all at once. I am very disappointed that the book is out of print, as I was about to order several more copies for dear friends met at the Parliament of World Religions in Cape Town, South Africa at the end of the millenneum. This book would be a wonderfully uplifting gift for anyone who is downhearted for any reason. It is easy, eloquent and lucid reading, and can be read in small segments, or all at once. I found it impossible to put down and re-read it often. If you can find a copy, read it! Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love your fellow as yourself","review":"Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach was the epitomy of humility and cared about everyone with whom he came in contact. These stories are examples of his selflessness .... truly inspirational!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Isle of Orleans a master blend of tradition and innovation.","review":"Laughlin's current opus is a genuine gem from New Orleans, or 'Nu Oilens' as he instructs non locals to properly pronounce it. Like a gem, the music is pure of construction, as Laughlin writes in a traditional jazz form. Also like a gem, each tune is singular to itself, to its breatheren on the album, and yet is also able to stand singularly apart from, and yet alongside, its traditional musical heritage. When I played \\"Isle\\" at a NYC party of jazz fans, most of which were unfamiliar with of Tim, the crowd immediately began to percolate with musings of the origin of the tunes. This is a magnificent work of music and takes the listener through every emotion - in a most enjoyable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckle Your Seat Belt!","review":"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll pull the shades and bar the door-you might even question your unbelief. CRATS! is unique; there is no sense comparing it to other books. The author himself could not write another like it. CRATS! combines the rollicking fun of Chesterton's Napoleon of Notting Hill, the moral seriousness of Percy's The Thanatos Syndrome, the comedic spirituality of Mr. Blue, the bitter satire of Waugh, all with the shocking shockingness of Flannery O'Connor(and the contemporariness of Bud McFarlane, Jr.). The story concerns a small group of heroes who band together to fight the powers of darkness, along the way scuba diving,selling bird gods, and learning how the Grand Canyon was made and how a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. Good guys sometimes die,good guys sometimes kill-pacifists beware! If you don't like to think, if you like bland books that will lull you to sleep, for heaven's sake, don't buy CRATS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If this were any more corny or flaky, I'd pour milk on it.","review":"Obviously, Steel Pulse has long passed its peak.

No longer is your favorite hero or villian reduced to a maximum of one page, now whatever it takes to flesh out the bio, the more that's in there. Rich, imaginative diagrams and spec sheets of just about everything non-living that has an importance in Marvel. Iron Man's armor, the Avengers Mansion, too many to list.
