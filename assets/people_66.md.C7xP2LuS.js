There is a little story and them zooom, your into this demon thing. The transition makes no sense and the reason you're going through everything makes even less sense. You go into the odd battle system just because the makers thought it was time for a battle.I played the game for 4 hours. (Since I spent so much money on it I really wanted to give it a chance) The more I played it, the less I liked it. By the time I turned my system off I hated the game.

It took me a few (frustrating) minutes to get the arm to attach to the stand (rtfm and remove the set screw almost completely and the thing fits)...but I'm a bit touched at times. Anyway the only way I'd improve it is to have a mount for a counter-weight the way a boom arm would (my Calumet brand one does.)

An unforgettable artistic achievement of John Casavettes and one of the twenty best films in that decade, without a bit of doubt.Casavettes as all we know was one of the most irreverent and rebel film makers in all the cinema story .

I remember seeing it the first time, not totally understanding it, but was drawn to see it again - as I still do since it came out on video. Mabel is unforgettable - with Gena giving the performance of a lifetime (what a face that woman has!) - and Peter Falk is also wonderful.

Well-suited for the classroom, the book is compelling enough for a lay reader interested in any aspect of the rich history of the Great Lakes State. The touch of Lawrence Ziewacz's unique perspective on politics and culture is much in evidence here, and reading the book gives this former colleague the delightful sense of revisiting some of his riveting discussions on Michigania at Michigan State University, where he was a professor for many years. His recent passing means that this volume is the best way to recapture the power of his mature scholarship and prose stylings. A handsome volume, solid and smooth, well-illustrated, too.

However, by writing a book, the author should have gathered real facts and figures to prove his point.

Too bad, after Sept 11, US finally know that China is not an enemy and woke up from Cold War over-hanged (in the recent 20 years, Chinese never killed any American, not even slap them, but Islamic Extremists have killed many many American around the world and swear to kill much more).

What a waste of time! The book is shallow and biased, sometimes an incidental comedy. The author, who is said to have lived in China for 20 years, is apparently blind to all the positive changes from 1978 to 2000. Comparing 1999 China to 1999 USA, of course China had tons of problems. However, what Gordon failed to see is the upward trend. Now, when the name of the book came up in a conversation, I could not help looking back: 3 years have passed since the publishing of the book; China has kept a high growth rate amid the global recession. The investment kept pouring in. It has weathered the SARS reasonably well even with a slow start. More importantly, its domestic market has grown enough so export is not the sole pillar of the economy anymore. Coming collapse? Dream on.Glad I didn¡t buy the book.

Too often books are too positive about China and the fact is China is still a communist country with no democracy or freedom of speech.If China will collapse is doubtfull but there are definetly threats to the existance of the communist party. The disappointing things is that this book doesn't present a clear view on how this will happen. All it does is describing an endless flow of stories about all the things that are not functioning in China. That didn't bring any new insight too me because all these stories have been told so many times. Finally in the end of the book the author tries to describe several scenarios which could lead to the collapse of China. Unfortunatly he only use 10 pages to describe 4 scenarios which is hardly enough to create some substance.My final conclusion is that it's good that somebody brings some contrary views but what a pity it's of such a bad quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise","review":"What a waste of time, a completely worthless book!

But after wandering through the countryside and N.E of China, it became readily apparent that he was speaking in sooth. The facade of China that is presented to the outside world is scarily like the backgrounds used in the old Westerns- a strong gust of wind, and the whole thing will fall over.

This song has all the band members singing on it.The second track \\"Viva La Fiesta\\" is another fast paced party song with a very latin or salsa feel.Finally, \\"Our Time Has Come\\" an unreleased track, continues party vibe with a tropical feeling for the intro, and upbeat R&B; beats, a dance pop melody, and synthesizers during the chorus. All the band members sing on this. This song is actually better than some of the songs off their debut but probably wasn't on the album since the vocals have a few weak spots, but are generally pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sociological Explanations for Christian Hysteria","review":"It was good that the Satanic Cult hysteria of the 1980s was brought to light in book form but he fills this book with boring and in my opinion incorrect sociological explanations for the \\"devil worshipper\\" witchhunts of the 80s. He loves to point fingers \\"white\\", \\"blue collar\\", and \\"uneducated\\" types. In other words he's a typical academic ivory tower type that blames everything on working class white peoples intolerence and stupidity. He fails to mention, or doesn't realize that this whole pathology is caused by Christianity. Even if all the claims about underground Satanic cults murdering people and sexually abusing children were true it would be a drop in the bucket compared to the pedophilia that is rampant in all Christian churches.

Debbie Reynolds in a non-comic role is surprisingly good, but also unconvincing as the poor daughter of a cab driver.

Unfortunately, it suffers from some critical defects.The first two chapters are the obligatory redundant recycling of UNIX fundamentals that is the hallmark of lazy authors. Face it: if you don't know what emacs or a shell is, you shouldn't be reading this book; if this is the best opening you can come up with, you shouldn't be writing it either.While the range of subjects is broad, the authors fail to cover them in sufficient depth. For example, sockets receive a scant five pages and the examples only treat UNIX domain sockets. Who cares about UNIX domain sockets? Why are there no examples of multi-threaded Internet domain socket servers?To be fair, the coverage of the Linux-specific material is decent, but doesn't justify the price tag. Bottom line: this is a good introduction to the subject of threads and Linux technicals, but will leave you needing more. .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced programming or Advanced HYPE?","review":"Retitle this book Basic Linux Programming, Fundamentals of Linux Programming, or how about Introduction to Linux Programming ... unless that is what your looking for DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.

I ran up to ask the barrista who the artist was and the next day Walls by Apparat was on its way to my house. It is one of the few CD's I will never regret going out on a limb for. All the tracks have a different sound but still the album retains unity in the mellow beats. Its great study or chill-out music and your friends will be impressed by your eclectic yet classy taste.

A fan of costume dramas, I love les liasons dangereuses, but I couldn't empathize with these characters. Ryno and Vermilli seemed stuck in a miserable struggle of pushing their lives up the hill only to watch them fall down again, or at least Ryno seemed to be trying to progress. Vermilli was too caught up in her own drama to have any care for Ryno's wife. She seemed intent on making everyone around her as miserable as she was. Not an attractive woman! Also, how could the grandmother love her granddaughter as much as said and sit mildly listening to this man talk of his betrayal? Even for 19th century France this seems implausible. I'm giving it two stars only because the costumes and the language used in the film were so beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My 115 Minutes Back","review":"I watched this film because a friend raved about how great it was. Clearly, our tastes differ in a HUGE way.This was a very slow moving, boring story, in my opinion. The basic premise is that a woman in her mid-thirties, who has been involved in an affair with a slightly younger man for over 10 years, is now getting shafted for a younger, richer, prettier girl. Yes, the spotlighted couple have an involved history, but honestly, this movie gave me a headache. Literally. I agree with the first reviewer -this film had no point and could have wrapped up in far less time than an hour and fifty-five minutes. And fear not about the sex scenes; they're tame in comparison to all of the \\"hype\\" there is about how racy this film is. To me, it seemed like there was more focus on the expressions on the actor's faces than there was on the actual plot.But this is just my personal opinion of this movie.

In short Black Venus is realistic and Last Mistress is a fantasy.Asia Argento never been really sexy anyway looks like drug addict at the least. As usual in this type of nonsense sex looks like a fantasy for kids and we never see something to remember unlike Black Venus where women are what men wanna see.Why should I care about rich people's life--there is no connection.

Each page contains a collection of drawings that illustrate the definition of something. The illustrations tend to show the early Sendak style, but in this book, there is essentially no overwhelming background -- each boy or girl or dog is illustrated in black and white (or beige). Each picture is self-contained, but there is some flow to the text on certain pages.It's difficult to describe this book, but there is really a separate level for adults in these definitions that makes this an enjoyable read for parent and child. For the adult, this book evokes the simplest play of childhood and a return to certain basic principles that were probably totally accepted and later forgotten. I don't know why, but this is an overlooked classic. I can't think of another book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is wonderful but this copy was damaged","review":"The book was misrepresented in the description. Pages were falling out.

Tongue-in-cheek?(3) Twin Peaks?(4) No . . . just really, really bad.(5) Maybe I'm just missing something here in the art venue?(6) Wow. This is SO bad, it's almost good.I'm going to guess that, from the DVD jacket design on down through the actual film, the director was trying to do this on purpose. Maybe eventually . . . a cult classic in its awfulness?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only because there isn't a way to rate it as a negative 5.","review":"The lead actor was so out of shape and such a really!really! bad actor that we had a great time laughing at just how bad it was, like we were being punked!

All he did was shave.OMG & LOL Watch it till the end when he takes off his shirt with man boobs and beer belly...oh and the music score has to be stolen from a lifetime channel movie, it is that sad.

Not even Rich Little could do Billie better. Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sounds","review":"This is a nice collection of songs done very well by good musicians and a lady with a lovely singing voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This new album lives up to my super high expectations for a Madeleine Peyroux creation.

But these new songs feel like old friends already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a terrific CD. Everyone who listens to it loves it.

You won't be sorry you purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Found Madeleine Peyroux!","review":"At first listen I thought she was just ripping off Billie, but she is still very fun to listen to on this CD. Her varying styles keep it interesting. I just got back from Paris and saw Madeleine singing on the sidewalk for change! She fronts a great little 3-piece jazz band called The Lost Wandering Blues Jazz Band from New York. She is introduced by the band every few numbers as the woman who sang the Jaguar commercial, and they plug this CD, while she passes the hat. They said that she is on a new label now and working on a new CD. She sounds great and draws a big crowd of Parisiennes and tourists in front of the chapel St. Germain de Pres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is she?","review":"I want more and more Madeleine. Just one CD on her career? I don\`t believe! Where are you, Peyroux? In France, in USA? Why are you in silence? Send us a letter, an email, we need to know news from you.

Billie can SING???","review":"I heard a track from this CD on our local pop station and thought,\\"Wow! So Billie really CAN sing?\\" (My appologies to all you BH fans, but the lady was the first to admit she wasn't a singer.) Ms. Peyroux really delivers the technique and style, and I had to have her album. I'm looking forward to any upcoming CDs she may put out, though, using her own personal vocal style. If you like Billie Holliday, you'll love this CD. But watch out world if Ms. Peyroux decides to make a name of her own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise someone you love--this is a great gift CD","review":"When I first heard this album on NPR two years ago, I was stunned. Peyroux sounds like Billy Holiday filtered through Patsy Cline by way of Edith Piaf. Her phrasing is fabulous, especially given her young age when the CD was cut. My only gripe is that sometimes she sounds too much like Lady Day, Patsy, or Piaf. I cannot wait for her to develop her own voice and sound--it will be incredible when she matures and deepens. I hope a second album is coming soon--I will get it immediately. Give this as a gift and you will be seen as a true afficianado! By the way, Marc Ribot is on guitar on this album--for another special treat, listen to his Marc Ribot Y Los Cubanos Postizos, a wonderful Cuban-inspired guitar CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"'channeling' Billie","review":"If a young white women whose music is mistaken for Billie Holiday is your thing here she is!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"40's style jazz lover","review":"I just recieved this C.D. yesterday.

The CD is great and I am purchasing at least 4 more this year and giving them as gifts for the holidays. Pls. tell Ms. Peyroux that there are people out there who want more music from her, Please!!

I haven't (yet) and I'm still not sure if I can really take anything in it seriously after discovering this chapter.

I found the newer edition, and was disappointed to see the same typos in it. This was particularly upsetting because the typos that I noticed are in the Math sections (although I am sure they are elsewhere too) It is unfortunate there are few resources to choose from for this topic. The explanations in the math section are also poorly written. I am honestly worried about the real exam because this book gives me very little guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"When I got this book, I thought that I would help me prepare for the AFOQT as best as possible. Thank goodness I thought about getting the SAT book as well. The only things this book showed was the type of questions that you may have on the test, along with the answers. For the math portion, it did not show the steps that lead to the answer, just the answer itself. I recommend that you study the SAT book in preparation for the test. It explained why the answer was the correct one, and it even gave you formulas that you may have forgotten (for those of you who have been out of school for a while, like myself). It also stated hints as to how to take the test. The Officer Candidate Test book did none of this. The SAT book was a big help. The OCT book was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"You're better off researching free information online. This book is TOTAL waste of money.

The only reason ARCO is still managing to publish this rip-off is because they have no competition. The most you'll get for your money is a good idea of what sort of questions they'll ask and how well you can expect to do in the allotted time for each subtest (but you can get that for free on the 'net). For serious study purposes, I strongly recommend you spend some quality time with Barron's SAT Study Guide.

How many revolutions must the handle make? 16, right? The book says 18, with no explanation of the mysterious missing threads. Do you have to spin a couple of times to get going?In short, the explanations stink (the editors routinely use oddball approaches in their math and skip whole series of steps) and there is not enough background material or pointers to references.The entire mechanical comprehension section is lifted wholesale out of two freely-available Navy manuals and the test questions are just the examples that the Navy used.There is no online companion to this - not even an errata so the authors could point out some of their mistakes.I take this exam next week and I'm scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"A study guide that needs some work.","review":"I bought both this book and Military Flight Aptitude Tests to prepare for my Naval Officer Specimen Battery.

From its delighted by-fold doors that grace its cover to the close up view of dollhouses throughout the ages, it holds the reader captivated. Women will return to their childhood days, becoming little girls again as they roam the pages rejoicing in the doll's lavish surroundings. Admirers of the world of minitures will be enthralled with the exquisite pieces displayed. All will learn much about the homes themselves, their makers, their furnishings, and their owners. The quality of the volume is without question, with glossy pages, sturdy binding, durable covers and clear text. I thoroughly recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"an insight into a magical miniature world","review":"The design of this book is enticing as it is shaped like a house. As you open the front of the house to peek into the wonderful historical dollhouses from Europe and America displayed in clear, sharp color photographs, it is like you are entering into the tiny rooms so carefully arranged and maintained for centuries in some cases. The concise commentary puts them into historical perspective. My grandchildren love the book, they play with it as if it were a toy when they visit. Even my son took a long look and said \\"these dollhouses are truly works of art.\\" It makes me think of Gulliver's Travels - it is a journey into strange and mysterious lands inhabited by tiny people. I keep in on my coffee table for everyone to enjoy. For those like me who are thinking of starting a dollhouse and interested in history and art it is both daunting and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then an instructor !","review":"I bought this for my Son who is a Junior in high school.

The writer has a way with imagery that takes me from love and compassion to anger and discontent. Certain pieces seem to capture that which has been repressed and has made me feel things about my being that I hadn't discovered about myself. It's a must read for anyone that has ever felt abused, loved, tired, and/or triumphant because it encompasses the best and worst in all of us. It's the best poetry book I've ever read. My personal favorite is a poem titled \\"Summur's Time\\". It seemed to read my soul inside and out! I think anyone who reads this will feel the depth of this author's sincerity, passion and pain. I emplore you to pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine Tintin adventure","review":"I've enjoyed the Adventures of Tintin series since I was a child.

His investigations take him to South America, where the rain forest tribe that originally made the statue lives.Unlike some of Tintin's adventures, which have fantastic or science fictional elements, this is a pure mystery / adventure comic which I highly recommend.If you like the Adventures of Tintin, you may also enjoy the Asterix series, by Goscinny and Uderzo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Content!!!!","review":"I started reading this book very happily (I love Tintin) but I had a terrible surprise when Tintin disguises himself as African-American so that his true identity will not be found. However, the disguise looks like a monkey!!!! He has red clown lips, strange eyes, and actually black skin! Tintin in the Congo is normally the book thought of as racist, but this is almost as bad. I guess it's a good opportunity for discussion with your kids about different time periods and incorrect beliefs about race, but you should know about this before buying the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price","review":"These drums have been installed on my daily driver for about 500 miles or so.

The welded drum closely matched the original and was slightly out of round as received, possibly from welding distortion. The other \\"made in Canada\\" drum seemed to be an altogether better quality drum. Smoother, more defined cooling fins, evidently well balanced as-cast and perfectly round. Just a better looking drum. Couldn't say if either one is good or bad at this time. The car stops.

Within a couple/few weeks her dry skin disapeared and her coat is now unbelievably shiny, thick and healthy. It is even thicker than it was when she was a pup.

I will continue to give it to our dogs just to maintain their healthy skin and coat.We use the 64 OZ bottle with the pump.

The last brand I tried had rosemary and only 1 dog would touch it, no one else would. They all went from loving their oil to despising it, b/c of the rosemary. This HAS rosemary, even though it's hard to find a website that tells you that. If you go to Grizzly's website, it does say it has added rosemary.

He's a big GSD, around 110 pounds, but one pump of the oil per day seems to have solved his dry skin problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Amazon - package sealed properly for shipment","review":"In the past I have received shipments of salmon oil from Amazon that leaked in transit because they were not properly sealed. Congratulations Amazon, you seem to have fixed the problem if this shipment is any indication.The 32 oz. container of Grizzly Salmon Oil came sealed in a plastic bag and was further protected with clear tape around the dispenser top. The package was delivered with no leakage whatsoever.Well done Amazon!By the way, my Labrador Retriever loves salmon oil on her kibble and has the shiny coat to prove it. The Grizzly pump bottle dispenser works well to mete out her mealtime ration with no mess at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slamon oil","review":"This product has certainly reduced my dogs' dry, flakey skin. It hasn't increased the softness of their fur, but I didn't buy it for that reason. I was tired of looking at doggy dandruff, and this has certainly done the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for Canine Addison Disease","review":"My Chihuahua was diagnosed last Thanksgiving Day with Addison Disease. I did so much research about what to give her besides her monthly shots of Percortin and daily liquid prednisone. She started getting sever hair loss and needed to add supplemental products to help her out. When I heard she needed Omega 3 and 6 I found that this product has both. So I ordered it and hoped that she wouldn't mind the flavor on her dry food. I have also added 4 different supplements too. Well - I have to say that she absolutely LOVES her Grizzly Salmon Oil! She has had it everyday since we first ordered it and doesn't mind it a bit. I would definitely recommend this product for added Omega 3 and 6 for your animals. So this time I am ordering the largest bottle they sell here on Amazon. I would also recommend keeping it in the refrigerator so it lasts forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fish oil supplement","review":"This large, easy-to-dispense bottle of pure salmon oil is a bargain compared to some other brands, and contains the essential fatty acids that our dogs need to maintain good joint and coat health.

The vet recommended glucosamine and chondroitin and fish oil. Since I also have a 7 year old male sheltie, I have been giving both dogs a squirt of the fish oil on their dry food each night. The first day, the female refused her food, but then, she'd had surgery earlier in the day and wasn't all that hungry. The next day, however, she \\"wolfed\\" down her food as usual and after both dogs finished, she licked the bowls clean. So paws up from her! The male likes it, too. Since we started the glucosamine/chondroitin and salmon oil, the old girl has been able to get up the stairs as well as she used to, so the combination of both treatments (and perhaps the removal of the benign tumor by her tail...which the vet said shouldn't be causing any walking problems) has certainly helped. We haven't had to use the painkilling meds since the week after surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"grizzly salmon oil","review":"we put this on our dogs food for two years - to keep their coat is good condition. seems to work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not help my itchy dog","review":"I have a 90 lb American Bulldog.

Anything at all?","review":"I have two dogs, one of which scratches for no apparent reason. No fleas, maybe some type of skin irritation? So I get a monster bottle of this fish oil. The dog that doesn't have a scratching problem just loves this stuff - would drink it out of the bottle if possible. The itchy little dog has no interest in it, but will reluctantly eat food with some oil dripped on it.I have now used up the bottle. The results? I tried, I really, really tried, but I could not tell any difference in the dogs after three months of twice daily servings of this oil. Coats looked no better or worse. Itchy dog is still itchy. Other dog wonders what happened to the tasty stuff.About the only positive thing I can say is since the oil ran out, they no longer have fish breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the result I'd hoped for.","review":"I have a fawn Doberman. Most Dobes have good smooth coats. Fawns and Blues generally have a variety of problems, the Blues worse than the Fawns. I'm fortunately that mine has no bare spots, but the coat is thin in places and a bit rough. I'd hoped the Grizzley Salmon Oil would help her coat thicken and become healthier.After reading so many favorable reviews I did purchase a bottle. I used it according to directions but even though so many commented on how their dogs loved the flavor, mine did not. I had to add it to her food to get her to eat it. We used up the entire bottle, to the last drop, literally. I noticed no change whatsoever in her coat, the thin spots are still thin, no extra shine, nothing. The oil is fairly expensive and to go through a whole bottle (which took several months) and see no change was disheartening. I won't be buying any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guaranteed bowel movement","review":"I purchased this product as a supplement for my highly allergic french bulldog and every time I put a tiny little bit on his food, bowel movement ensued (if you know what I mean).

Grizzly Salmon oil seems to be providing the nutrients necessary for good coats on my dogs, and I have been putting two squirts into the dogs' food daily for about six months. I have three Labrador retrievers, and all are sporting their best coats. I have used Lipiderm in the past, which also works very well. I believe that quite a few of the products marketed for improving good skin and coats are effective, and occasionally try out a new one.

She has never had any areas of skin irritation or hot spots.

Best price available. Improved our dogs (Lab/Ridgeback Mixes) coats almost immediately. We were feeding our dogs an expensive grain-free brand of dog food that changed the formula without letting anyone know (Beware: this happens often) and they developed skin conditions. Grizzly Salmon fish oil improved their skin within a week or so. Just don't expect it to make up for a bad diet. Started with the 32oz. and the dogs loved it. Also seems to give them more energy. Now we order the 64oz pump regularly. We only give them two squirts instead of the recommended four so we don't go through it so fast and it still keeps their skin and fur in great condition.

I will be ordering more from here, it's a miracle worker!The oil is strong-smelling, but only if you TRY to smell it. The smell doesn't linger much after the dog is done eating. (Except in her mouth!

Grant several weeks ago in the A&E \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\", and became fascinated with him.When I discovered that he also wrote a book, I had to have it. I have just finished it and loved every word. He reminds me a great deal of David Niven and the wonderful book he wrote about his life in the movies, \\"Bring on the Empty Horses\\", but with names named.In turn funny, sad, and insightful about the oddities of the acting profession and thoughtful, without being pompous. I came away from this book with the impression that Mr. Grant is a nice man (and sexy)who happens to be an actor who can look at his profession with a jaundiced eye and a quirky sense of humour. He is both a participant and an observer. I can't wait to read his novel, \\"By Design\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for any movie fan","review":"This is a great book for any movie lover to get humorous insight into the production steps of various movies of the past decade.

Going from the distasterous setting of Budapest for \\"Hudson Hawk\\" to working with Coppola and Scorsese back to back, \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Age of Innocence\\" respectively, Grant tells the stories of back-stage bickering and premiere happenings. There's enough name-dropping in here to entertain the most avid film buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this book??","review":"Why did I buy this book? Because I loved Mr Grant's performances in Withnail and Jack & Sarah and I had read so many positive reviews of this book. To say it did not live up to expectations is an understatement - something Mr Grant should have a go at. His capitalisations, italics and !!!!s gave me high blood pressure and I swear I will never watch a Steve Martin film again after his obsequious eulogies. While the description of the family tragedies at the beginning of the book was emotionally engaging, descriptions of behind the scenes shenanigans while filming were less than captivating and descended into Hello! land fairly speedily.

If I make another serious attempt to learn this language, I will seek out other resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confusing, Too Fast","review":"Perhaps I just learn differently, but for me, this set does not work. For one thing, the c.d. has people shouting off Irish words in such quick succession that there is no time to repeat what they are saying. I suppose this cd could be useful if a person played it while they slept, but it is not a good program for those who learn languages by repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most awful language book I've have ever come across","review":"I have learnt more than a dozen languages by myself, including Hebrew and Norwegian, and I can assure you that this is the worst self-learning book I've ever come across. Although Gaelic is very difficult to pronounce and written in a way that makes French spelling look easy, you wouldn't believe how complicated the first dialogues are and how quickly the people on the recording read the words and sentences right from the start.I was completely discouraged and since the overall presentation is awful and ugly I threw the book in the dustbin in no time. Learning a language in the 21st century should not be a torture, methinks.Don't waste your money on this manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"One main problem.","review":"This book is lacking in numerous ways, but its major problem is how it gives vocabulary notes. Instead of trying to explain the grammar and listing each word separately, it gives entire phrases (sometimes even sentences) as individual vocabulary items. How are you then supposed to use individual words? I guess if you're aim is to learn \\"useful phrases\\" for the purposes of travel, this book would work for you, but for an active understanding of how to speak productively, you're going to have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Lacking","review":"This is definitely not a book/cd for the first timer. I was hoping for a few \\"good morning\\", \\"how are you\\", etc to help me become familiar with the language. Unfortunately, the CD goes almost straight to short conversations. I did read the reviews before placing my order and decided to take a chance. Wrong decision.Even if I had some experience with Irish, the CD is useless without the book and will do me no good listening to it while sitting in traffic. I'll have to find another CD to get started with and save this CD for later.As for the book, it has a wonderful pronunciation guide - but does me no good since I need to hear the words, not just read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Foreign Language CD Ever","review":"I purchased the book/cd package. While the dialogs inside the book are decent, the audio CD was a total disappointment. I would have been better off listening to Irish on the radio because the beginners' CD doesn't bother to break down the language; it starts at about sixty miles per hour and doesn't get any better. I accomplished more with a Hippocrene phrase book that didn't have a CD. I've learned three foreign languages and for each of them, the student is taken through steps; we learn the pronunciation of the vowels, consonants, and blends, which the Hippocrene book did. Then the student is given simple phrases (eg \\"What time is it?\\") at a slow or moderate pace, and we continue to build on the given theme. This \\"Teach Yourself Irish\\" is definitely the worst language course that I've encountered because it does nothing right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Language Learning Tool Ever","review":"This is quite possibly the worst language system I've ever encountered. The very structure is awful. The CD is a single repeat (meaning you are constantly replaying it to hear the words again) and doesn't cover all the exercises, but skips over whole sections. The pronunciation guide is both long and nearly incomprehensible (and, once again, the CD runs through the words way too fast, not giving you time to repeat them and still follow along in the text). The grammar is cursory and there are errors in the answer-key, still, you might be able to pick out a few rote phrases if you are determined.I highly recommend both Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone. Also, if you are interested in Ulster dialect (there are three major dialects of Irish), the BBC offers a FREE language course which will teach you basic phrases right on their website.I would be highly impressed by anyone able to actually 'teach themselves' using just this series of language books."},{"rating":"2","title":"teach yourself irish","review":"very intense study.

Dubee's flows are so saucy and smooth, that it is a shame that a fellow like this hadn't blown up. Khayree's production is a great mix of tight, heated beats that are incredibly cool to kick back to. There are also tracks with Mac Dre and Reek Daddy rapping through most of them whic is cool. THere is also a track with Mac Mall, which if you like Mac Mall, is off the hook.

The music is just insanely catchy and, in my mind, is the perfect example of power pop music. All of the their albums are great and worth your time. In addition, the music simply doesn't sound dated at all. The band is up there with other relatively unknown greats such as \\"Klaatu\\", \\"Sad Cafe\\", and \\"Camel\\".I hope the band members realize how good they were because obviously the music companies didn't \\"get it\\" and resigned this fantastically fun, 1st rate band to 2nd rate status."},{"rating":"2","title":"rockin great time","review":"This is a great album for parties or just ridin in your car! i should know i've been listening to this band ever since i was born!

Jenkins traces the early history of lawns as importations of the English country garden concept, as found in Jefferson's gardens in Monticello. She also explains the influences that garden clubs, the golf industry, and the USDA had on the popularization of lawns. The book is not just about lawns, however. It also provides a very interesting analysis of how advertising was used to create demand for completely unnecessary products, and how those products, such as lawn mowers and weed whackers, later came to be thought of as indispensable. This book will be of interest to historians of landscape architecture as well as to researchers of material culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable but disappointing","review":"The quality of the material isn't as high as I was expecting, and the angled pockets look out of place.

The songs presented here have been selected with some care, and highlight a number a number of well-known singers, not least Sam Browne, Sam Costa, Jack Cooper, and Elsie Carlisle.

The tracks with vocals have wonderful lyrics and the version of 'It came upon a midnight clear' is the best I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"I love this CD!!! It sets you in the right mood. The musis is amazing, especially while remeniscing about the early episodes. Being a true Doug and Carol fan, I loved their song. Wow. It is great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Worth Getting","review":"This is the most awesome CD you could get if you are a true ER fan! There is no doubt the theme music is the bomb!

I had visited the home in the 80's, giving out Christmas presents to some of the boys.Unfortunately, I was not able to read too many chapters because of the language. The language was very graphic and used more than what I thought was necessary. The \\"F\\" word was overkilled in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Candy is not sugar-coated","review":"This book is Charles Carroll's unflinching memoir of his and other boys' brutal treatment while wards of the state (New Jersey) during the 1950s. Mislabeled retarded and institutionalized, Mr. Carroll endured years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his caretakers and other boys. The book is well written with an adult insight into some of his experiences. Though definitely not a pleasant afternoon read, it is certainly a worthwhile one. He also includes an extensive appendix with examples of modern day abuses of the system; just in case you might want to solace yourself with the thought that things have been fixed in modern day society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired electronica!","review":"Tracey's vocals are simply astounding. They add a human touch, as some other reviewer noted, to the otherwise aseptic and monotonous background music. Pay attention, I'm not saying that electronica music is monotonous (far from it!) but in this case it would have been without the vocals. Walking Wounded is a brilliant record beacuse it's got everything: a pinch of rhythm (don't expect pounding basslines tough), soulful singing and beautiful lyrics. A must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I remember buying this album in the spring of 96 the week it came out. I was expecting the same 4/4 house beats of Missing but was pleasently surprised to hear this neato style called drum n' bass (accompanied by Thorn's beautiful vocals). It was the perfect soundtrack for the time, since I was in the middle of a really emotional relationship (and was later dumped). It's now 99 and the album still reaches down into my soul just as it did during that unforgettable spring. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds that will make you go nuts...","review":"The spirituality of this record is beyon words, the purity of the sounds, lyrics and music. And it has a certain touch of crazyness that makes this record special for moody times."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and melalcholy --- and still very good","review":"This is definitely one of the best albums that I have ever purchased. I bought it when it first came out and I listened to it at least twice a week for a year. Everything about it is perfect, from the lyrics, to the music, and her voice. She has one of the best voices I have ever heard. Great job, and still one of my favorites over two years later. (I wish they'd hurry up with a follow-up)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Out,, amongst the Walking Wounded...\\"","review":"\\"Walking Wounded\\" is a bridge. A bridge that took EBTG from their pop-bossa nova roots, to the undoubtadbly ass-kicking house of trip-hop, ambient, lounge and adult pop. \\"WW\\" is a mixture of EBTG's past and future, a CD that explores the newly discovered by EBTG, clubland, and stands out as a classic trip hop album that any self-respected trip hop fan should have. Best songs from the album: Single( in which Massive Attack's influence from \\"Protection\\" is clear),Walking Wounded, Before Today and Wrong.Gr8 CD. Get it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This CD really is one of the great masterpieces of dance music...It really put a human touch on \\"electronic\\" music; much like Bjork with Post...the songs are really solid and the house and drum 'n bass beats add texture and depth without seeming extraneous...and above all else Tracy's voice sounds absolutely amazing over the beats...I think I read that Rollingstone called her a dance club Dusty Springfield, and I don't think that it's to far off the mark...the production is solid; never over stated...I would list stand out tracks, but they are all stand out tracks...I have introduced this Cd to countless friends and they are always blown away; typically going out to purchase the CD...most people only remember them in connection to Missing(The Terry Todd Mix)...which is kinda sad, because there is much more to EBTG as this album shows...check it out, you may just find it winning you over as well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"I don't know what the othe reviewers are talking about. With the exception of \\"The Heart Remains a Child\\" everything else in this album is pathetic...ugghh...I can't get all that awful techno beat out of my head!!! It's as if Ben and Tracy weren't even trying. If you want an outstanding EBTG album, buy Amplified Heart instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece. An Amazon essential for good reason.","review":"Thankfully for longtime EBTG fans and new converts, Ben Watts hadn't quite mastered the art of the drum machine on this album. The result is a truly striking melding of spare beats and the melancholy beauty of Tracy Thorn's aching vocals.This is not really a true dance album, but more of a typical EBTG pop album set to simple dance beats. It is not as layered as the sound of \\"Tempermental,\\" which is a good thing. If you own earlier albums, don't be blinded by the machine sound. Buy it, listen to the songs, and realize it is a natural progression in the wondrous evolution of EBTG.For new fans used to electronica, this album shows what truly talented people can produce. It blows away anything you already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"These Bongos seem very well made to me.They take a lot of hitting.Produces normal Bongo sound I would guess.It may be easier to play them on a stand.Great to practice stickwork.

Great book to read to a child or better yet have them read it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Song!","review":"This is an excellent song written by Diane Warren, for the Pearl Harbor soundtrack, a song called There You'll Be performed by Faith Hill. This song really shows her range and ability to convey and express emotions clearly and successfully in her songs. Many have compared it with Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On because that was the big hit from the Titanic movie, well this is the big hit from Pearl Harbor. Also included on the single are two excellent songs from her 1999 Breathe album, a cover of the Bruce Springsteen song If I Should Fall Behind, and the gospel-inspiration number There Will Come A Day. You wont be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable healthy living cookbook","review":"I have two of Kurma Dasa's cookbooks and his cooking video series. He is a gifted cook with a deep knowledge of food and flavours. His recipes are delicious, they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful. There are a wealth of recipes for all occasions. I am still developing my cooking skills so it is wonderful to be able to cook and get tasty and healthy results. I have a very sensitive digestive system and have tried many different diet approaches over the last seven years.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best veggie cookbook ever!","review":"This book is wonderful. Its recipes are foolproof and fun to make. I have tried most of them and none of them ever really failed. If you are a vegetarian, this book is an absolut MUSTHAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Achievement","review":"This book is a stunning achievement. I went from poem to poem in amazement at this writers ability to capture those moments of horror he endured as a political prisoner and transform them. Like Yeats said \\"a terrible beauty is born\\"This is a splendid example of the poetry of witness and I think it belongs in the company of Akhmatova's Requiem. When she was asked \\"Can you describe all this/and I said I can\\".That is what this writer did, with words of power and grace, that will linger in anyone's head. It is fortunate to come upon them.The poems on London filled me with longing for that city one never tires of.Buy this book. It will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"John Michael Montgomery is a great country artist.I love Friends and What I do Best. I wonder why he did not release the single\\"What I do Best\\"? I will soon purchase his new CD. Keep up the work ,JMM. You are a super singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimentally slow","review":"John Michael Montgomery is well known for his somber ballads and twangy rhythms. This album is no exception as it is full of sentimental ballads and a few of his more \\"twangy\\" country tunes. \\"I Miss You A Little\\" is a nice sentimental ballad in his usual style, and \\"Friends\\" is a ballad with a hint of sarcastic, dark humor mentality. \\"Friends\\" is a song about a man basically not wanting to hear a woman using the term \\"friends\\" as a way to avoid a romantic relationship. I think just about every breathing man has experienced that in their life at least once. Hear those lyrics and you'll find yourself cracking up a little bit... \\"How Was I To Know\\" was another enjoyable hit, and a few of his other tracks are quite catchy. While Montgomery isn't one of my favorite country singers, he actually does a good enough job on this album for me to listen to it fairly often. You should give this one a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"I could give John Michael Montgomery's What I Do The Best five stars, because the songs are great. The toe-tapping \\"Ain't Got Nothin' on Us\\" is solid, as are \\"Friends\\", \\"How Was I To Know\\", \\"What I Do The Best\\", and John Michael's moving tribute to his father, \\"I Miss You A Little\\". Another great song is \\"A Few Cents Short\\". That song, along with \\"I Miss You A Little\\", was written by John Michael himself. However, this record, unlike John Michael's previous albums Kickin' It Up and John Michael Montgomery, is heavily weighted toward ballads. John Michael is a great ballad singer, but I also like to hear him sing upbeat songs such as \\"Be My Baby Tonight\\", \\"Sold\\", and \\"Cowboy Love\\". Fortunately, besides \\"Ain't Got Nothin' On Us\\", John Michael includes two other great upbeat songs, \\"Lucky Arms\\" and \\"Paint The Town Redneck\\", on this record. What I Do The Best is a solid collection with good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"charon's landing","review":"A very good story - not quite as good as the Clive Cussler series that Jack Du Brul has also written.

It suffers from wooden dialog, factual errors, grammatical errors, sophomoric philosophizing, and poor editing. Perhaps if the story itself was better told, I could have overlooked these issues. I'm usually willing to forgive a few errors (heck, I read Cussler), but it just was not worth it this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"most excellent","review":"DuBrul is on par with Cussler if you like this sort of novel.

I enjoyed the entire concept of the tale and found that the Middle East, Alaskan pipelin and oil scenario all too frightening. We may be giving terrorists ideas, but I really hope not.I have noticed that either the reviewer loves Jack DuBrul or hates him. I see no middle ground in any of the other on line reviews and you won't see it here.I like his style and the plots and how he interweaves various subplots to one grand finale, or series of finals. Excitement abounds in the telling of the tale and it was a book that I found myself making time to read, rather than picking it up for a few minutes each day.Is this book real, no.

They seemed mostly positive, so I bought a couple thinking they would be good for long airplane flights, afternoons in the sun, etc.Sadly, both Charon's Landing and Vulcan's Forge were mind-numbingly slow, the action sequences were nothing special, the characters were wooden stereotypes, the heroes were no better than the villains, etc. There really was nothing to hold my attention from chapter to chapter. Mercer (the hero) acts like a pubescent boy looking down the top of every blouse and up the slit of every skirt, and DuBrul can't seem to write a decent piece of dialogue between a man and a woman.Ultimately, I read both books, but it took the better part of a month to get through them (I usually read a Clive Cussler novel in about 2 days) because I kept putting them down and picking up other books that held more promise.I won't be buying any more DuBrul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...Boring and predictable","review":"Is there anything more boring and predictable than a hero who happens to be a mine engineer, and also happens to be a crack shot, a gutsy, two-fisted hard-drinking man of the world, a wizard at oratory, the owner of a stylish and sleek Jaguar, and the object of every woman's desire? James Bond has been done before and been done better. And the bad guys are Russians and Arabs. Yawn. Predictable from the word \\"Go\\". Of minor interest is the hero's (and presumably the author's) views on ecology. Apparently, attempts to reduce pollution and ecological hazards are direct subversions of the process of evolution. I told a friend of mine this once as a joke; I was startled to see it argued in all seriousness in print. Final point: This is a pale imitation of Clive Cussler, and I'm not saying that Clive Cussler's a genius or anything, but he can at least tell an entertaining story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book is even worse than Du Brul's first, Vulcan's Forge.

Sometimes I think when watching early work by now well known actors and actresses, we expect too much. Or maybe it's me. Sandra Bullock wasn't really seen that much, and the other \\"school kids\\" were pretty run of the mill. It was another example of guys hanging out, guys fighting, and the occasional girl passersby.

I frankly despair of non-Catholic solutions to Catholic \\"problems,\\" even if these \\"problems\\" consist on nothing but the Church's continued adherence to the high ethical and moral demands of the Gospel, which the Church is unqualified to alter.Get yourself another book, get yourself George Weigel's The Courage to be Catholic or Letters to a Young Catholic instead, if you really want to read a solid Catholic response to the challenges posed by secular modernity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should anyone care?","review":"This is an odd book.

I remember when I was in school, if I aimed just for a pass or a B, I usually got a poor result. If I aimed for a perfect test paper, I would usually get an A.Catholic truth and dogma has stood the test of time (2000 years). That it is difficult to adhere to, there is no doubt. I prefer to try to configure my life to an ideal, rather than to being just \\"good enough\\".I recommend that faithful Catholics stay away from this book, or simply read it as a testament to what is wrong in our society today.

Of the 2 times I used this, the first time it didn't taste that bad, but the second was overpowering. The only guess I can make as to why this is is the temperature. First use was in modest circumstances of about 60-70 degrees. Second time out it was 90-95 degrees. Could be that the hotter temperature brings out the taste more. Either way, not too happy with it. Too bad, cause I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best stroller on the market","review":"We got this stroller as a cristmas present and we absolutely love it.

I contacted evenflo to ask if there was some sort of harness for this stroller and they said there was nothing they could do for me. I am always with my son while he is in his stroller but if I turn my head for a minute he was almost on the floor. I highly recommend that you buy a stoller with the five point saftey harness.

Every marlin spike I have seen is gradually tapered. This spike is one consistent diameter three quarters of the way to the point and then ground sharply conical to the tip. Maybe this is a recent design change but it does not look like the picture provided. I am curious as to whether other owners knives are like this. I think I might have bought a different knife had this been apparent. Either change the picture to represent the actual tool or better yet, make the spike a continues taper.

However, this book is a joke. It offers very little in the way of TRUE altering--ideas like \\"Make an elastic band to hold too-long sleeves up around your elbows\\" does NOT qualify as good technical advice, in my humble opinion. The \\"fashions\\" (if you can call them that) recommended in this book are grossly outdated (I suspect they were already passe even in 1995 when the book was printed), and they all have a grossly home-fashioned look to them. If you are really into baubles, embellishments, and that frumpy \\"mom made it\\" look, buy this book. If you are looking for a good guide to TRUE altering, spend your money elsewhere. My new copy is getting donated to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the non-sewer","review":"I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I read reviews that made me think that as a non-sewer, somehow this book could tell me how to do quick and easy repairs. The only use it has to me is that it might give me some ideas for repairs to request from a seamstress. There were no definitions for the neophyte. For example, there were repeated references to \\"serging\\" which, I guess, is something kind of like sewing, but different. I do think it is an excellent book for someone that already knows how to sew and wants some ideas on how to do repairs that will improve the fit of garments.

Todays kids could do well to read this and see what is possible when one really works at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"This album is like many of Rush's recent. Bad lyrics with horrible vocal delivery and terrible songwriting. Geddy Lee sounds like he is talking again, making bad lyrics sound even worse. Dog Years? How trite can you get? Their previous album, Counterparts, is a brief return to some great moments. But this album is just plain terrible. What else can I say? No dynamics, boring guitars, no direction. The music is loud, trying to be exciting and the vocal delivery just doesn't fit that. I love old Rush and some new, but I must say, this album is not only one of the worst Rush albums, but one of the worst albums I ever heard. Yeichs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash test","review":"\\"Test for echo\\" is the weakest of Rush's albums. No melody, anyway if there had been one somewhere, you couldn't hear it because this album is just NOISE. Remember Lou Reed's \\"Metal machine music\\"? T4E will give you the same headache. \\"Counterparts\\" had some good rock moments, because Rush had written the songs before entering the studio. In T4E, it seems like no-one knows which way to go. So it starts from nowhere and it goes nowhere. Peart sounds tired, Lee's incantatory vocals are boring and Lifeson's guitar play is terrible. Peter Collins, who did some good work on \\"Power windows\\", brings no fresh idea, and in fact you come to wonder if there is a producer. Don't buy this record, it has strictly no interest, whether you are a Rush fan or a prog-rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing it","review":"In my opinion this is Rush's least inspired and enjoyable album. The music and the lyrics are weak throughout the whole record. Rush make an attempt to go back to their hard-rock roots, but, just as some other reviewers said, the guitar sound is just plain ugly and cliched. There are no fine melodies here, just a blatant excess of dull heavy riffs. Geddy's vocals are very calm and pale, obviously his voice is completely ruined. No wonder, because he tried to imitate Donald Duck and Minnie Mouse on Rush's '70s-albums ('tricked by circumstances', oh yes!). Well, there are flashes of good melodies in some songs (\\"Half the world\\", \\"Resist\\"), but the whole affair is just very boring and lame. \\"Counterparts\\" was a pretty good album, but \\"Test for echo\\" shows that there's no future for Rush. \\"Moving pictures\\", along with some other Rush albums, is certainly a classic in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"Just payin the bills. The only thing this album is worthy of is background music in a port-a-john. No wonder their music isn't selling any longer and, on their recent Vapor Trails tour, they were playing in huge arenas which, for the most part, were half-empty. Geddy's vocals on the title track are very good. Time and Motion has measures of being an awesome song, particularly with the trade off of Lifeson's sound. But, as one reviewer stated with Test for Echo, they don't bother with it. As he said...just sitting back getting 'fat and lazy'. But other than that, it looks like momma wanted a new beach house on the cape.......time to make another album. And I too am a musician, who 1st picked up the guitar about 3 years after Lifeson started playing (1968). And I truly believe only a musician can understand how Rush has decimated their sound and dumbed down their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush trying to make grunge music","review":"I am a fan of Rush since his single signals went to market. This year I decided to complete my collection of rush. I decided to start with test for Eccho. I was very disappointed Jeezzz it is too grunge for my taste. All songs are pure distortion and grunge. Apparently the members of rush decided to put aside the piano or the keyboard melodies and emphasize the distortion of the guitar. If you like Rush from signals to counterparts this record is going to disappoint you for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear, more middle-of-the-road-drivel","review":"Yet more inane nothingness. Rush was the only band I would listen to as a teenager in the late 70's early 80's and it's been a long, slow, sad decline since their last decent album which was Moving Pictures. I can remember with absolute horror, the release of Signals and GUP. Forever lost is the majesty and raw spirit of 2112. So, so, sad. I feel truly cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I Received This As A Gift And Didn't Spend My Own Money","review":"I agree with John from the Midwest; however, I think that his two stars are too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid and unremarkable","review":"This is the sequel to Counterparts, with an even heavier sound. There aren't many memorable melodies and after a while the crushing guitar riffs get a little monotonous. There's still good stuff on here -- The frantic \\"Dog Years\\" may be the first (intentionally) funny Rush lyric, while other highlights are \\"Driven\\", \\"Carve Away the Stone\\", and \\"Resist\\". This is not one of the band's better albums, though fans of Counterparts may enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is simply the best rush cd ever!","review":"Test for Echo was my first Rush cd. Before I got it, I burned my favorite songs from all of my other cds into a blank cd and I still listen to this cd more than my burned one. But then i get Retrospective 1 and I cant explain it very easily but it just stunk. It went rock with rock. Geddys voice was too enthusiastic. I like the idea in Test for Echo. They went rock with Geddy's new relaxed voice. The thing that Rush really needs and has is Neil's talent. For thos of you who do like the albums in the past, just imagine them without percussion. Or without Neil. My top favorite 3 songs from Test for Echo were Virtuality(for 1st place)which went straight up there because of Alex's guitar playing,Limbo(for 2nd), and Totem(for 3rd). If you are interested in Rush, PLEASE get Test for Echo as you're first Rush CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good Rush","review":"Ok this album just isn't up to it, the production is pretty bad the songwriting isn't really there just about the only thing that saves this CD are the lyrics and the best songs on it are just average. And they are the title cut along with the two singles, plus the jam session \\"Limbo\\" and \\"Virtuality\\". So all in all don't buy this album unless you are a die hard Rush follower and I know to some of you that average Rush tunes are good tunes in general, but take my word for it the production is way off so they all don't sound nearly as good as they could have. I gotta end it with this album is a lot of filler, so if you don't mind that pick it up hey who am I to stop you, but if you want good Rush then don't and wait for the new one it will come out within the next six months and I am sure it will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"*The Greatest Rush Cd EVER!!!!*","review":"The brand new Cd by Rush (Test Fro Echo) Is full of grinding riffs and songs that almost remind me of a famous metal band (Metallica). Among the tracks that stand out on my point of view are \\"Test For Echo\\", \\"Time And Motion\\", \\"Driven\\", and \\"Virtuality\\". \\"Time And Motion\\" almost reminds me of \\"2112: The Temples Of Syrinx\\". This album has given my band plenty of inspiration, which probably explains the 5-star rating!!! My band has learned how to play \\"Time And Motion\\", and we LOVE that song. It has plenty of peaks and valleys and takes you on a RIDE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush bring it home!","review":"In our modern and jaded age, it is refreshing to hear an incredible band such as Rush defy the shallowness of contemporary music and summon up a work as powerful as 'Test for Echo.' The lyrics prove themselves to be as poignant as ever, Lifeson's guitars are unrelenting and melodic, Neil Peart's drumming is...well, come on now, it's Neil Peart...and Geddy Lee's bass playing and vocals are at once synchronized and profound. It is, in short, a more than worthy release from a band that has seen it's fair share of releases. And now, with Rush rejoined and working on new studio material for the first time since this 1996 release, I think it is doubly important for us to hear this great album, and glean from it what we can expect from Rush in the future. Such tracks as 'Test for Echo', 'Driven', 'Totem', and 'Dog Years' remind the listener that this is a band, not only alive and kicking, but never missing a step of the race!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Test for Echo continues the return to heaviness that began in earnest on Counterparts. Most songs are good, especially the title track and the instrumental \\"Limbo.\\" Indeed, the only subpar song is \\"Totem,\\" though \\"Carve away the Stone\\" is somewhat generic. All other songs feature great instrumentation as usual, especially \\"Virtuality\\" with its awesome dynamics (despite somewhat corny lyrics). That said, Neil Peart has some really good lyrics here, especially \\"Half the World,\\" \\"The Color of Right,\\" \\"Time and Motion,\\" and \\"Dog Years,\\" Rush's first real attempt at humor. This is also the first album where Peart committed to his redesigned drumming style, and his playing is more \\"on the beat\\" than ever, though I must say that I like the \\"classic\\" style better. The main reason is that I feel he rides his cymbals too much. Despite these minor gripes, this is another worthwhile album from Rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be a classic for most mortal bands","review":"I don't think many other bands have the same expectations that Rush has when they make a new album. All know that Lifeson is a guitar god, Lee is a master at bass and a wonderful singer, and Peart is the last great classical drummer. Moreover, they have so many other great albums in their catalog. Man, it has to be intimidating for these guys to even step in the studio, knowing what their fans expect of them. For the record, this is a good album, has some really hard-driving cuts, such as \\"Driven.\\" No, it is not \\"Power Windows\\", it does not have the complexity and diversity. But it still rocks and I know of a lot of bands that would kill to be able to claim this recording as their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Weakest Rush Album I have ever heard","review":"I love Rush. I have just about every RUSH album on CD. But let me say this: this album is mediocre. All the songs sound the same.

The few highlights of this album (\\"Driven,\\" my favorite track, features some of Neil's most inspired and complex drumming ever; \\"Resist\\" and the title track are also strong) can not counter the lackluster songwriting and playing of the remainder of the album. The weaker songs are a combination of corny (\\"Half the World,\\" \\"Dog Years,\\" \\"Totem\\"), dated (\\"Virtuality\\"), or just plain boring (\\"The Color of Right\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rush Classic? Nope.","review":"Test For Echo has a few decent songs but as a whole this album is pretty much forgettable. The title track and virtuality rockharder than Rush as since it's 2112 days. Unfortunately both songs are plagued by really bad lyrics. The two songs on this albums that are worth having are Driven and Resist. The version of Driven on Different Stages is more exciting as it has a wonderful live feel and sports a rare bass solo by Geddy Lee. I am not a fan of ballads but Resist has an emotional edge typical of the band. The rest of the songs you can listen to once or twice and never have a desire to hear ever again. Test For Echo like all Rush albums sports incredible muscianship. However the songwriting here is lacking. For diehard Rush fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"There But Not There","review":"Speaking frankly as a musician who when younger was VERY inspired by early Rush, namely Fly By Night, Caress Of Steel, I just have to say that this recording sounds extremely flat. I'm a RUSH appreciator, I have a more discerning opinion.. but if u ask me, they haven't made a good album since Grace Under Pressure. Come on guys, recover that intertwined grouping and connectivity of songs, coupled with abandon and HUNGER, that you had in your younger days, there is still a new frontier for all of you. No need to sound fat and lazy. dig deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Decades Strong","review":"Not many bands stand the test of time like Rush, especially such a unique band which are a great gift to musicians around the world. Rush is simply a musicians band, a band that plays more than chords and a band that composes songs deeply rooted into society and the issues within.There is an intertwining of musical talent within the world we live. Not \\"just\\" a typical beat aimed to grab you - the refined complexity of their skill does. Not only can the songs grab you through their musical talent, but in taking time to reflect on the lyrics, stories and tales are told; not typical tales. It is not Boy meet Girl, but how Netboy meets Netgirl and we consider the impact of technologies influence on relationships around the world.Great tracks and nothing less than the skill you have heard in better know works such as Moving Pictures"},{"rating":"1","title":"Among Their 3 Worst Records","review":"Test For Echo sounds just plain and tired. It has moments that recall past glories,a cool riff or two,and possibly has some of Peart's best lyrics,despite what anyone says. Yet the tunes are not memorable at all. I rate it a hair above Roll The Bones and Presto(Counterparts was a brief comeback).The title cut is my favorite,which is typical of the formula of later Rush albums,best goes first then downhill from there.Also,Geddy's vocals,which showed some signs of life on Counterparts,have returned to the robotic,monotone delivery we older fans loathe. A friend of mine who's lost more than a few brain cells due to substance abuse actually thinks these songs are 'classics'in the same league as 'Fly By Night' and 'Lakeside Park'. I think he's well,lost some brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really much anything","review":"I was listening \\"Test for Echo\\" when I started wondering what would reviews say about it. Then I found myself surprised of all sort of diverging and passionate opinions. Is it really THAT good? Is it really THAT bad? I tried to remember the songs but, exceptuating the title track, nothing came back to my mind. Not even the titles. Then I realized that the best way I can describe it is: FORGETABLE. I've been listening Rush music for 20 years, and this is first time that I can't find a song exciting enough to make me hear it again three or four times. Maybe I'm getting old. Maybe they are. Maybe is a problem of the expectations we've come to set for the band. Well, I don't feel ecstatic about it, but neither I feel betrayed as some reviewers. Maybe just a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have been an avid Rush fan for 20 years, so I was very excited when this album came out. But what can I say, other than, I'm dissapointed. One of the great joys of listening to Rush over the years has been their evolvement as a band. T4E not only doesn't cover new ground, it is a poor imitation of their previously brilliant work. Eventually I had to take it to a used music store and sell it because I felt it was wasting space on my shelf, and had been a waste of my money. I hope the next record comes back and completely blows me away. But Test For Echo will forever be a gap in my extensive and loved Rush collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the dynamics?","review":"I had to force myself to listen to this album more than once to be certain: every song is at one level, that is, ear-splittingly loud, from start to finish. I've stayed faithful to Rush for two decades, even when they experimented with ideas I didn't much like, because I know they are all about remaking themselves and embracing change. But now that they lack the slightest bit of dynamic variation, I've had enough. I even saw them on this tour at the San Jose Civic, CA, and while I loved their choice of vintage songs (even doing 2112 and Natural Science in their entirety), I could barely hear them due to the lousy venue. In retrospect that was the perfect venue to support this unlistenable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!!!","review":"Rush, in my oppinion, is one of the best prog bands in history. But TFE is one of the most boring albums in prog-rock history. I got this CD (unremastered version) for my birthday this year just to pretty much complete my Rush collection. I it popped in my stereo hoping to get the awsome stuff I had heard on Counterparts but noooooooooooooooo!!! I found the title track which is pretty good, and Driven, an awsome song. The rest was just plain crap to fill up this 12 track disc. Its a waist of money and a waste of time to go out and buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sound like they should retire.","review":"I take a backseat to nobody in my love, admiration, and knowledge of the works of Rush. Which is why it pains me to say that this is an awful album.... the worst they've done. It's too bad Neil used this album to make his long awaited instructional video.- lazy songwriting- passionless performance- nobody sounds good here, but particularly sloppy and lazy guitar work from Lifeson. He sounds like he's drunk. This is the guy who played La Villa Strangiato???There is not one memorable song on this album.... nothing. Even some of their other \\"poorer\\" albums (Presto, RtB, CP) at least have a few gems each to redeem them, but this album has nothing. I detect a downward trend here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I get the right software?","review":"Not so sure not so sure, is this the software that tests and records the echoes that emit inside a structure? I know you can yodel all day long in a canyon like they show on tv but I thought this was the software that allowed you to test and record the echo itself. I did get some interesting feedback when I first used it but I was not sure because it is an English voice actually saying echo. I think this may be a Microsoft tool licensed to a third world company and resold here. Just not sure what to make of it but I will keep trying to use it and hope I can further my echo research!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing with the Rush string of phenomenal music.","review":"RUSH continue to prove that they can write some of the best music available.

And we all know what was released that year! The guitars are given the priority on this album like 'Counterparts', although the keyboards aren't completely ignored. Opener and title-track 'Test for Echo' has a nice 'chorusy' guitar part, but it isn't really a sign of what is to come. A change of production team made the difference here; from track two ('Driven') onwards the whole record rocks hard whilst maintaining excellent melodies throughout. There's even a slice of psuedo-punk for good measure ('Dog Years'). If you own that certain Rush CD from '81 and no other, buy this one. 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I can't understand the bad reviews of this disc.

I bought Vapor Trails last week and was shocked by the lack of guitar solos. This CD has more guitar solos but they are all very short and most of them are simple and uninspired. To me hard rock has always been about great instrumental solos (guitar, organ, etc). Without them it is like eating a hot fudge sundae without the hot fudge.It seems like the boys have decided that Alex will be little more than a rhythm guitarist, which is sad because he has played good solos in the past. It seems like a waste of talent.Yes, Neil does write good lyrics but listening to Geddy singing almost non-stop song after song becomes rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid and unremarkable","review":"This is the sequel to Counterparts, with an even heavier sound.

Each topic is covered in sufficient detail to get started and points out the hazards one should be aware of. This book is also well-researched and contains a good list of references. Overall this is a solid, well-organized effort that deserves space on the bookshelf of any developer getting into test-driven development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange book","review":"Very strange book.

In the familiar fashion of the modern documentary style it is structured around interviews with former employees, members of the community affected by Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart commercials, and news items - and makes no attempt to offer anything but a biased viewpoint.Sadly despite its good intentions this film fails to deliver. It is poorly filmed and poorly edited. Many interviews lead nowhere. The film would have benefited from a narration to bring some coherency. We only hear from disgruntled former employees and community members. There are no interviews with \\"experts\\" or Wal-Mart itself to tell the other side of the story or lend weight to any of the allegations.\\"Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price\\" fails as both polemic and entertainment.If you want to see an excellent documentary on the evils of big business then you should check out \\"The Corporation\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A very important movie for those who shop at Wal-Mart!","review":"If you wonder how Wal-Mart got so successful, then this film is a great example.

That's the whole enchilada for these spoil-sports.If you have any concern about issues relating to power, economic and social consequences, and the direction retail marketing is going, DO NOT expect to get much out of this but some Hitlerian diatribe about the Evil Empire of Wal-Mart.Try reading some good articles or watching other documentaries, but if you're just too lazy to think for yourself and want to be sucked into this caricature of corporate hatred, by all means go over to the darkside, Luke.I wish I could give this zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Whining!","review":"If you don't like working for low wages - then quit!!

I for one am glad we can buy all these things in one place, instead of spending a whole day going all over town to buy your groceries for the week.

Lots of first hand interviews, but those are more for emotional appeal than to prove a solid point.- High school level film making. Choppy editing. Music levels are often higher than the dialogue.- The parts (or acts) of the film (employee wages, effects on local econimics, etc,) are poorly defined. The transition from one topic to the next is rarely well executed.This film could be good:- if it was shorter- if there was an narrator to outline the points at the very beginning. Also, use the narrator at the beginning and end of topics, or at least, a title stating the new point to be made.- if more effort was placed into the editing.

I didn't realize until watching this video that they were totally uncaring for the environment and they treat their employees so badly. Also, whenever they move into a community they actually decrease land values besides driving out many many small businesspeople. Then they can potentially kill the town they move into and leave a giant vacant building as an eyesore in what may have been a thriving community before WalMart moved in.

This film shows exactly what happens when a giant doesn't play fair: Wal-mart gets subsidized tax breaks and drives local businesses out.

I am shocked, but not surprised that Wal-Mart is a modern-day slave plantation...and of course, only in America is slavery still approved of under the guise of corporate profits and benefits to the consumer.

It's the same sort of dual standard that enables him to criticize Fox News for not presenting balanced reporting (in his \\"Outfoxed\\" documentary), only to turn around and show only one side of the Walmart debate. Legitimate advocacy requires that the messenger have credibility. By presenting easily disproven statements about Walmart as \\"fact,\\" Greenwald has severely damaged the credibility of those genuinely wanting to influence the company.

Where are the images that can't be forgotten? Where is the play that language does so well? This is a poet like Jorie Graham, one who tries to say something, then gets bogged down with free association. There is some good stuff in the poems, but as a whole they are a let down. The opening poem, \\"Library\\" happens to be a poem where this works, but it is a list poem, and you can get a little wordy in those.

First of all, it was embarrassingly obvious that none of the three strippers with \\"several years of experience\\" had ever stripped before! The only thing I can think is that the creators wanted us to feel good compared to them. The extreme lack of talent and looks of the three women was indeed nonthreatening.

The DVDs are a great improvement over the last release, but the Bond bootleg DVDs that flooded the marked last year had better overall quality and packaging.

The sample stories interspersed throughout the book made me laugh and cry and gave me great inspiration. I also appreciated how Ms. Dunn clearly organized her information and presented highlights at the end of each chapter.

The author, Gloria Dunn, has been there and done that and offers in her book the nuggets of wisdom she discovered along the way.The many topics covered in this book include: how to find the work of your dreams, how to make your current job more fulfilling, how to determine whether to leave or to stay, what to do if you're laid off or fired and how to have a more fulfilling life that is enhanced by your work and not dominated by it.This book is a not to be missed resource for anyone who works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DUDE-ikoff is back, but this time he ain't no ninja","review":"For some reason I have to watch any movie that stars Michael DUDE-ikoff, especially if the film was produced by the notorious B-action Cannon Films corporation. This time the dude is in the middle east taking on terrorists and corrupt oil company big-wigs. At first glance this reminded my of the hilarious Steven Seagal film On Deadly Ground, but give me DUDE-ikoff anyday over Seagal.This movie was made towards the end of the Cannon Films legacy and I don't think the company had a lot of money to spend, and it shows. The production values is of considerably less than their classic 80's films such as American Ninja and Invasion U.S.A., however it still comes off to be a fun NO-brain action flick with Dudikoff giving another hilarious, almost drugged performance. For fans of Cannon or B-Action flicks, this is a must. Just don't expect a steller presentation on DVD as the DVD is as basic as you can get. Full screen and NO special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill the writer!","review":"Found only two things good about movie: 1) More lines for Michael Dudikoff=more chances to show he's a good actor (better than Jean-Claude). 2) Decent supporting cast. The writer should be shot. The only way to believe this garbage of a script is to be a 5 year old child. Too many action movie cliches. What was Ross' nemesis wearing? It looked like a wig. And yes, I'm sure everyone will believe that one man in the open can shoot all the personnel at the refinery with a few clips and an AK-47 while they shoot at him from cover and he doesn't even bother to duck (not that it matters, he doesn't get hit anyway).

Surely Shakespeare himself must be delighted to know his words ring true for so many instances in this 21st century.

After a month I had had enough leaking. I understand the concept of their air flow system, but no matter how tight we turned the tops, they would still leak. I sold them all and bought the Sassy Mam bottles. I have not turned back since. We still use them a year later without any yellowing and with the original nipples. They never leak.

I bought 3 as bridesmaid gifts. Instead of arriving in nice velvet presentation bags like every jewelry/accessory item I've ever purchased, they arrived in black linty felt bags which looked very badly hand-sewn. The bags are open at the end (no draw-string closure) so the mirror will slide right out and thus float around in your purse getting scratched. I am too embarrassed to give these as gifts as they are, so I'll now have to go buy velvet bags to put them in. I called HansonEllis to complain and give them a chance to fix it, and they couldn't have cared less. Ladies, if you are thinking of giving these as bridal gifts, I would choose another product from another vendor.

Great for the begineer to intermediate DIY'er.However, be sure to check your local building codes before making any plans. It will save you a lot of money. This book (like most deck building books) are written with people in the North Eastern US in mind. Readers in the South East don't need such deep footers for example. It goes the other way too, the directions for attaching a deck to your home were insufficient for code in my local area.This book, like most other deck books, focuses on tall decks and really doens't discuss much about ground level decks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another out of date book re: deck building","review":"A lot of the info between the covers is no longer accurate concerning acceptible deck building methods, and it's hopelessly out of date re: materials. If one were to construct a deck as outlined in this book it would not conform to the latest far more demanding building codes, esp those adopted about a yr ago. The Publisher should either cease publishing this book, or completely revise it. . .Absolutely a waste of money, in my opinion.

But Mr. Closterman does get mentioned on pages 69 and 70, and you get a photograph of him and his plane as well.What I especially liked, apart from the pilot stories, was the the last part of the book with the bibliography on page 96, the explanation that goes with the forty superb colour plates and the scale drawings of the various Typhoon versions - the Typhoon was well known for the teething problems in the first versions which gets a nice coverage - culminating into the beautifull sleek Tempest."},{"rating":"2","title":"great scarf","review":"My 20 something daughter loved it; good quality wool.

I started reading and could not stop laughing.The author uses hilarious agruments about how you can anticipate what a person is going to say as proof that we are evolving into Gods. As if people in the past never anticipated what someone else was going to say or do.Very weak theories.

Most of the examples and works that support the viewpointof the authors seem to me quite ok, but the authors probably didnot read them thoroughly because they left much of their depthuntouched. What this book provides is merely inconsistent andunexplained information about aspects of humanity that are betterdiscussed elsewhere.

But at least reading it from cover to coverwill not cost you much intellectual effort..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful overview","review":"This book is an overview of the entire spiritual journey. It is a like a map of human consciousness, covering the evolution of our understanding of God, as well as giving information about every aspect of the spiritual path. It is not a novel (like Celestine Prophecy, etc.), but rather it is a guide to help each person as they increase their awareness of their own spiritual understanding.

If you've been absent for the last 20 years you might find it useful.Where's the passion? Where is the new direction? Where's the meat? We are so ready for going ahead in new areas and doing it quickly -- particularly since 9/11 -- that these two giants of metaphysics have left us cold and looking elsewhere.I'm sorry guys (and lady) this isn't the book we were all expecting from you.

Ultimately, neither pity nor admiration for Carolyn is possible.I still can't decide whether Carolyn Cassady is simply pathetic or simply trying to cash in on her husband's fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit pathetic","review":"Carolyn's whole story was the same page after page. Neal and Carolyn have a kid, he leaves her for his other girlfriends, Neal and Carolyn have a kid,...etc...This woman needed a serious clue and I wasn't impressed with her life at all.

I wish I could have had a chance with him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great portrait of cassady and kerouac","review":"As great as the Beat fiction is, and life-changing as On the Road is, we get too caught up with the fictitive personas of the Beats. It's nice to see the side of Kerouac, Cassady, and Ginsberg that didn't make it into the novels. I'm sure Carolyn's viewpoint is skewed a little, but so is what we read in On the Road. Between her work and their work we can get a picture of what they were like, not as legends, but as men.There are times when Carolyn bogs down with too much detail, or too much whining, or patches that just aren't great writing, but all in all it is a good biography, autobiography, and novel.If you want to know more, here is a good place to start, along with these books, though you probably have read them by now: Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums; Cassady's The First Third; Perry and Babb's On the Bus; Ginsberg's Howl"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR ANY BEAT BUFF!","review":"A recent appetite for any and all written about Beat Generation(Kerouac, Ginsberg, et al), Ken Kesey and Merry Pranksters led me \\"Off The Road\\" while browsing at my local library.

I was happy to read of NC's unending love for his three offspring and his true devotion to his friends, even though that comradeship was the foundation for his doomed relationship with Carolyn. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a feel for the late 50's and early 60's that altered many lives and lifestyles."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"I thought this was a really great book. I had read part of Kerouac's On the Road a couple times but hadn't gotten all the way through it. By chance I saw this book and decided to read it. It tells the story from a different side, a more rational and real side than in On the Road. It makes you realize that these people who were Beat heros were really just sad, real people who died young. Carolyn Cassady is a great storyteller. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a wonderful and inspiring book for us control freaks!","review":"I read this book a few years ago and sadly lent it to a friend and saw no more of it so I'm thinking of rebuying it at Amazon.

The Blu-ray makes the stark landscape just amazing to behold, the audio is also very good. I'm not going to go into the story all that much because enough has been said and spoiled by others. I thought this was well acted, considering the characters are from a land that looks so harsh.

It's pretty boring and the kid's character is mopey and annoying.*****Spoiler Alert*****You think they're going to unearth Santa and he's going to be terrifying. Well, they do eventually find Santa, but they never show him (probably for budget reasons). The scary guy with the beard is just an elf, one of many as a matter of fact. And they don't do anything useful in the movie, except run around naked. The movie seems to be leading up to the culmination of all the events, but there's no Santa reveal and the big \\"showdown\\" consists of a boring helicopter scene where it flies a few miles luring the elves into a pen. Then, apparently the people box up the elves and sell them to people. But they sell them as Santa Clauses, so that makes no sense.

But don't buy it from amazon. My book arrived with its binding completely torn from the pages. One cannot notice the damage until one removes the shrink wrap--but, of course, once one removes the shrink wrap, one cannot return the book. So I just blew $60 on a book that is already falling apart. Beautiful edition, great notes, will still use it for class--but fail, Amazon, epic fail.Get it from Borders or Barnes' & Nobles'. Not Amazon. At least don't have any seller ship it to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO HEAVY!!!","review":"Perhaps it is because I don't really like Shakespeare and took this class, but this book is just too long. It should have been broken up in to several volumes instead of jammed together in this 15 pound monstrosity that makes even reading it awkward at best. The best part? This is assigned to students who have to lug it around all day long. So, students, if you are assigned this book, I recommend going to class the first day, getting your syllabus and buying each individual play. Most sonnets you can find free online.If you aren't a student and are buying this for fun, even if you like Shakespeare, this book just takes up a ton of space that isn't worth it AT ALL!If you are an instructor thinking of assigning this book...

It has a couple of features that I personally didn't thing was needed for a grill cover but it is kinda nice to have. And that is the little pockets if you want to store a few things and a couple of vents that allows it to breath even though some moisture can get thru on your grill. But that's not a major problem because from my experience, you need a like a driving rain with winds blowing at your grill for that to happen. So, this cover is the only cvover worth buying and using in my opinion if you can find one like I did on Amazon.com with some amazing prices. Because other than that these can be kind spendy.

One is up in the mountains and gets plenty of snow and freezing temperatures. The other is in our back yard in Southern California and gets lots of sun and wind. The back yard cover has shredded six months before the end of the three-year warranty, but the other cover is doing great and so are the two lounge chair covers I bought in this same fabric in 2009. So I am very happy with three out of four and am buying another Veranda cover to replace the one that didn't make it. Hopefully this time the cover will last as long as the others. The fabric is a sturdy canvas and the colors are nice looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, quality grill cover, but does not adequately fit Weber Summit 470","review":"This was purchased for my Weber Summit 470 grill based on a review of it (the large) being a perfect fit. This is in fact not the case, the cover is short on the front and back by about 3 inches. The X-Large is the same height at 26 inches, though longer, and the cover is the fitted style, so there is no guarantee that it will be any better.The cover is excellent quality, and very heavy. The vents and handles are well thought out.This may be adequate for some, and the circulation from the shortage may even be beneficial in damp climates, but i live in a high corrosion environment by the ocean and the salt air would permeate under the cover and cause corrosion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice thick cover","review":"Very well made cover. For the same price or less than that of the cheap covers I have bought in the past that don't even last a year it is a great value. Very heavy material, does not blow off my grill like others I have had. From the look and feel should last for years to come instead of one season. I would definately recommend this cover to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, ripped after one season","review":"After reading mostly positive reviews I purchased this cover and bragged to friends about how durable it was and how it was going to last. I have to admit that upon recieving it I agreed with the reviews. However, going into my second winter (I have owned it for just 1 yr) I can tell it will need to be replaced next year. Three of the four corners have rips of about 3-4 inches wide. I have re-sewn the corners 3 times and even used duct tape to help keep the corners together. If you live in a place with little wind or have great protection from the elements you should be in great shape with this cover. If however you are from the mid-west I suggest lookign elsewhere or planning to re-purchase every year or so.With the price currently at $29 I am feeling a little bit harsh with two stars. That said if you can get this for $29 or less I would probably rate it a 3 star as I wouldn't expect a cover to last much longer than 1-2 years for that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!","review":"The Medium size fits the Weber Genesis E-310 perfectly.

The length of this cover is great reaching nearly to the ground...eliminates debris from splashing up onto the lower part of the grill cart.I found the cover runs pretty true to sizing listed on Amazon. The neutral color blends into any patio decor. My only concern is that over time it may accumulate stains from mold and mildew exposure in damp areas.

Easy on/off using cloth handles. The large is large but fits the Genesis neatly. Some on this site say the medium is a bit more tailored and even better fit. The neutral color is great and although only purchased this season so far all the stitching seems to be holding up just fine. No need to pay nearly double for other covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for Weber Genesis 310 gas grill","review":"I wasn't sure whether to order the large or medium size, and based on other Amazon reviews, chose the medium size. It fits perfectly. I like the canvas-like quality of the fabric and think it less prone to ripping and tearing that you might find with plastic or vinyl covers. However, one downside to the fabric is that it is hard to clean. Vinyl or plastic covers can be either hosed down or wiped with a damp cloth, but this cover can only be spot cleaned. The veranda cover has screened vents (to minimize condensation) and fabric handles to facilitate removal or installation.2-year update:The grill cover is so heavy, that I often didn't put it on. It spent the entire winter on the floor next to my Weber grill inside my screen porch. Unhappily, when I tried to cover the grill with the cover, I found that it had extensive holes, so parts of the fabric had been used as nesting material for mice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I needed a good cover for my Kennmore BBQ.

I looked at reviews, and someone suggested this one instead. Price wise, it is a much better buy. Visually, the color blends in better with my house and there is no large red Weber logo to alert the local thieves there is a $900 grill underneath worth stealing. For all they know, it may be a cheap $99 Char-broil!!! Only time will tell, but my initial feeling is that it is quality made. I figure it will last at least a year or so until I get tired of covering the grill and allow the elements to do what they do best and take its toll on my nice grill. Thanks to the people who stated the medium size fits this Weber. It fits very nice, like it was made for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice, but...","review":"The cover looks nice, but it lasted less than one season. It's supposed to cover your grill while it's outside. However, the issue is it being OUTSIDE. It doesn't stand up to the elements at all and will eventually rot and rip apart.

The cover had a lot of great features (the handles, the vent, good looking, the tie downs) and for the first year I was really impressed with it. However, starting late last year, I noticed the color fading really bad. When I flipped the inside out, the bottom color with drastically lighter. It does get the morning and afternoon sun, so some of this is to be expected, but it is a lot more then my neighbors similarly color toned cover that receives similar exposure. Now, the fabric is ripped at the seams right by the handles that are used to remove it.

I can see that it will last a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice cover","review":"I tried several BBQ covers and this was the best by far.

The price was right and the quality was very good I would recommend buying this cover"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grill cover","review":"Who would have thought that matching umbrella and grill covers could dress up a patio, but that's the case. Both appear to be high quality products, the sort of quality I often pass up in favor of less expensive products, but for what I paid through Amazon, both were exceptional values for the price. Only time will tell on how they stand up to the elements, but they appear very durable, attractive, and with very strong zippers and drawstrings. I also like the contrast from the typical black vinyl grill cover found in most yards."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!","review":"This is easly the nicest grill cover I've ever owned (out of 3 covers).

It is made from heavy-duty material and has, thus far, held up to two very bad storms that would have ripped all of our previous covers to shreds.

I look forward to having this cover as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"This cover is used for a Coleman grill, and is about half the price for one from Coleman.

However, when the late summer and fall rains began, I noticed that it mildewed on the plastic liner inside. I cleaned it off with a mixture of clorox and water, but with the heavy dews I know it will continue to mildew because it is damp inside every morning I have checked it. Sooooo, if you life in a dry place, this cover should be great. I'd avoid it if you live in a damp climate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice","review":"I have a large BBQ and have had a lot of problems finding a cover large enough to fit over my configuration.

It has 2 handles on the top so you can just grab each side of the cover and lift it off. It fits my webber spirt grill perfectly. The only drawback is that it will get dirty as it is pretty light colored and the grill will have some smoke residue that will rub off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grill Cover - Looked Good but Didn't Last","review":"After only eight months this grill cover ripped down the middle. It looked very sturdy, so I was surprised. Every other grill cover I purchased before lasted at least a few years. This one did not even go thru a winter. It did look good, but did fade somewhat over eight months.

If it weren't for the hole, this product would be fine to use. Very disappointed. I need to figure out how to get a replacement, since there's a three year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover - be careful of the size","review":"As mentioned in previous reviews, this cover is made from a heavy duty fabric and seems to be well constructed. The handles are especially helpful in placing and removing the cover and the straps that fit around the legs are wonderful for us as we live in a windy area. It has covered ventilation areas to prevent condensation and leaks and it also looks good. We are very happy with the cover itself.I bought a Weber Genesis 330 and ordered the size Medium for a grill up to 58 in. My Weber is 60 in and the Large cover is listed as starting at 63 in. I wish I would have ordered the Large as the Medium is not wide enough to fit around the side tables properly in the front (it is fine in the back). The Medium sits about 3 inches off the ground so I think a Large would not be too big. The Medium is okay, but I think the Large would have been better.Great B-B-Q cover and good price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the others said...great cover!","review":"Just like everyone else says, this is a great cover.

It was a great, sturdy cover, but after 2 or 3 years (I don't remember exactly when I bought it)in the blazing sun, it is falling apart. I would definitely buy one again. Unfortunately my back yard gets full sunlight all day long, so I guess that is why it did not last lomger. I am taking one star off because I feel that it should have lasted longer* I was curious so I went back to my purchase history - I paid $35.99 for this at the end of 2009. Probably put it on in the spring, do it spent 3 summers on the grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Accessories Veranda, Medium, 58 inch","review":"Excellent quality and price is a bargain. Bought a new Weber Genesis E-330. I was really torn between the medium size and the large size of this cover. I saw several reviews that said that the medium was fine for this same grill, but saw at least one that said that the medium was too small for their E-330. Whoever wrote that review either got a bad cover or tried to put the cover on backwards (yes, it makes a difference). This cover fits absolutely perfectly. There is no need to buy the bigger cover. Excellent, sturdy construction. The only thing that I would change would be the color. After a couple of months, this light color is starting to get dirty just from taking it off and putting it back on and being out in the elements. Otherwise, would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...","review":"I purchased this to replace the cover that actually was made by the manufacturer to that fit my grill. I purchased the medium size to fit my Weber 320 unit. Perfit fit!Couldn't be happier. Only wish this product was made in the USA. For that I will only give it 4 stars. Sorry, but I believe we can manufacture this here just as well as China can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cover","review":"Covers my grill and has much thicker material than the cover I had, which was slowly ripping to shreds.

It arrived in 2 days, thanks to Prime. So far so good, although, with the colder weather, the wrinkles from shipping are not going away. Hopefully, when the weather heats up it will help relax these creases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"This is a very good value for the cost, and it fits very well and protects the grill. I would nrecommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative to Weber Cover","review":"I purchased this item for my new Weber 330 grill after viewing several reviews that recommended this item over the stock Weber cover. Weber's cover has a design flaw which places the ventilation holes over the grill's burners. Not only is this product cheaper, but it's better crafted and the light cover is not a visual eyesore in the backyard. Taking the cover on/off is a simple affair, made even easier with the two built-in handles on top.The only downsides to this cover are: 1) the cover can get dirty if dragged along the ground when uncovering since the material is a light color; 2) it needs to be treated with a waterproofing product to repel rain better. After only a couple of storms I noticed it was quite soggy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I looked on-line before buying","review":"I almost bought a grill cover when I picked up my new grill. They even included a 25% off coupon in the owners manual. Luckily I checked here first, and hit on this model since it was clearly the favorite. This grill cover is as good as the reviews claim. Includes side-vents, handles, a zippered pocket... A very well executed product for something as \\"simple\\" as a grill cover. Highly recommended, I'll gladly join in on the 5 star reviews for this cover, well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"attractive, well made grill cover","review":"This medium-sized cover fits our Weber Genesis Special Edition grill like it was made for it. The fabric is heavy, water-proof and attractive. The seams are nicely finished with sturdy stitching and a rolled finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grill Cover","review":"Material is much more durable than most covers. Fits a 54 inch grill perfectly and doesn't drag on the ground. Doesn't blow off even without using the straps that go around the grill wheels.

Eeven though it is not made specifically for my grill, it fits like a glove! I have a Kenmore gas grill for which Sears/Kenmore does not offer a fitted cover. My prior cover was an ill-fitting Kenmore brand that just did not hold up well. And, it cost me close to 50% more than this Veranda cover. I'd recommend this one to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After over a year it has held up great","review":"This is a very well made grill cover. We have used it for over a year, and it still looks as good as the day we got it even though it is out in the sun all year. We got the X-large up to 70-inches Wide cover. It is a perfect fit to our Blue Ember BBQ grill w/ side burner. The snap straps on the bottom hold the cover down if there is a strong wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cover","review":"I have had this cover for a little more then three years and is just begun to wear out. This is after constantly being taken on and off, all through the Michigan Winter covered with snow and ice.It is all I could expect from a cover heavy duty, attractive and fits well. So I've just ordered a second cover as a replacement for $30, the same price I paid in 2007!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice cover","review":"I bought this cover for my e330 weber gas grill.

I was surprised at the quality of the cover for paying such a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"73922 Veranda Barbecue Cover, 64 inch","review":"Cover is well made and fit my Weber Genesis Gold Series Grill pretty well. I say it fits pretty well because the cover does drag on the grown so it will tend to get dirty at the bottom. The cover has two handle grips to pull the cover off and nice hold down straps and draw strings. It also has a pocket for tools, but I doubt I will made use of it as that could get the cover dirty much faster. I would buy this cover again and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed","review":"The quality was 10 times better than I even hoped for.

It protects my PGS BBQ on my patio. We live in a hot, sunny climate, with high winds, and this cover stays put. It has straps that wrap around the BBQ wheels, for extra secure coverage in windy areas. The canvas like cloth exterior shell and PVC like interior lining, makes for a heavy duty product. The nice touches like the sewn in handles, zipper pouch, draw-string cord, and vent make this this an outstanding buy. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grill Cover","review":"This is a great product that does everything it says it does. This cover is very heavy duty, and has ties to secure it to the grill along with elastic that can be cinched to keep it tight around the legs.

This cover does a great job of protecting our grill and keeping it dirt and dust free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill Cover","review":"Great Grill Cover.

Bought the second one, paid a little more, it didn't secure to the BBQ very well and kept getting blown away in the wind. This one is solid, secures very tightly to my BBQ buy pulling tight under the ends and has the added feature of straps that you can snap arond the legs. This thing isn't blowing away in the wind or going to start to rip in the first storm. The color also blends well with my deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"lining cracked","review":"I bought this cover in September of 2008. So at this point it is going into its third winter. The fabric of the cover is still in excellent condition ---even new looking. The thing is the plastic lining is cracked and it lets the rain through.I find it disappointing to have the fabric in excellent condition and the inside water proofing cracking apart. Well I just do not really know what is reasonable to expect as far as usable life. Seeing as the cover needs replaced now I basically got two years use out of it at a cost of about $22 a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bbq cover at a geat price","review":"this is an excellent grill cover at an excellent price, much better than the one that came with the grill"},{"rating":"2","title":"longlasting cover","review":"This has to be one of the nicest covers for a bbq.It replaces one that I had for 4 years, same one.

The Chargriller cover I purchased for $50 was crap and faded within the first 2 months of use and ripped after 3. The reviews were terrible for that cover, but I got it anyway because it was a custom fit to my grill and I couldn't find an alternative big enough. I wish I would've discovered this months ago! I've only had it a week, so I can't speak to its long term durability, but it fits my very large grill almost perfectly and the construction seems much much better than the Chargriller cover. Handles, zippers, ties, there are features on the cover I probably won't even use (but the handles are nice for lifting and getting the cover situated after using the grill). I'm very pleased and hopeful that this is as quality of a cover as it appears after the first week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"Seems like a legit grill cover. I listened to the reviews and got the \\"medium\\" model for my Weber E-330. Fits like a glove.So far I've only taken it off and on maybe 10 or 12 times. Since it fits so well, it takes a few seconds to put on. Not too loose, but not so tight that it's hard to slip on.The only negative I can think of are the straps and clips on the bottom. They are intended to buckle around each leg/wheel of the grill (I'm assuming to prevent the cover from blowing off). Sometimes I'll unbuckle and try to pull the cover off, only to have the clips bind and catch on the grill. I'm guessing those will get cut off before too long!GREAT cover though. Would definitely buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy one.","review":"Well made, attractive and functional. All at a fantastic price.

First, it developed a tear within the first several months--not a fatal flaw, but one of slight concern. And having gone through not even two full seasons of winter here in Northern California, my cover has turned a shade of green, so it's fairly likely that I'm going to buy a new cover. I've read that the weber cover no longer has vents, so I may be going that route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cover","review":"This is a good fitting cover that is flexible.

Handles at the top make it easier to remove also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid cover","review":"We bought our first Weber Genesis this year and I wanted a good cover to protect it (not the flimsy vinyl ones at the hardware store). I had my sights set on a Weber cover on Amazon, when I saw this one. The reviews were so overwhelmingly positive and it was a great deal. The construction quality of the cover is very solid - good heavy water-resistent fabric, nice solid stitching, and thoughtful extras like the storage pockets, vents and tie-downs. Can't comment on durability yet, but I'm confident it will last for some time. Size medium fits the Genesis like a glove. If you're on the fence about getting this cover, don't hesitate. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value!","review":"As other reviewers have stated this cover is well made, heavy duty and an excellent price.

It is attractive, and it doesn't get dirty in the rain or in pollen season like the black ones do - I'm not sure why, unless the material sloughs off the dirt. It is a heavy canvas cover, with a zip pocket that I never use, but it would come in handly if you wanted to put something in the zippered pocket. The cover is sturdy and easy to take off and put back on, and it is long enough to go all the way to the ground so it really covers the whole grill. I have had grill covers of many different types and prices, from the expensive Jenn Air to the generic Wal Mart variety, and this is the best ever.

Out of the package it looked and felt really well made. Fit very well on the grill after a bit of fussing to get it in the right position to drop properly. Nice looking on the grill and deck. First problem was after a moderate shower, there was water on the grill under the cover. No wasy it could have gotten in the vents. Shrugged my shoulders and left it on. A week or so later, we get several inches of rain in Connecticut, I take off the cover to cook and not only is it wet again underneath, but my grease pan was flooded and had poured greasy water all over the inside cabinet of the grill and onto my deck. Also, after a month or so of ownership, there is mildew growing on the exterior. Now I regret not getting the Weber cover. This one is going back to Amazon. Wanted to like it but unless you live in an arid climate, I would not buy this cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"We wanted a grill cover that was going to hold up.

It was much less expensive then the Weber cover offered for the Genesis. It had quite a few nice features. There are 2 handles to help lift it off the grill.

What's really nice is that it has 2 bungie pull cords on the sides to tighten it to the grill and straps to buckle it to the wheels. These help keep it in place even in the strongest winds.

It came securely packaged, and the cover is extremely heavy-duty with vent slips, handles for easy removal, and clips at the bottom to hook around your grill legs/wheels.

Nice heave material."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great grill cover","review":"After searching hardware stores for grill covers and finally buying one at Sears that didn't fit my grill (they said it did), I found this great grill cover. The material is pliable, but very durable. The cover has a drawstring at the bottom and wrap around snap ties to secure the cover around the wheels. This cover will never blow off. In addition the cover had handles to easily lift it off and to put it back on.

But this review isn't about the grill, its about the cover I bought.Lets me say off the bat, its a really solid cover. I bought the XXL size after reading another review saying it was big enough. That's partly true. It fits over the grill well, but its about an inch or two too short to reach the ground. If you are real obsessive about this I wouldn't buy the cover.Overall I am really happy. All the other things reviews have noted are true. Seems very durable, good ventilation etc. It was $20 cheaper than the Weber cover too boot.Would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Quality Than I thought!","review":"This is really unbelievable quality!

It WILL NOT blow off..and YOU will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"I never give 5 stars, because I don't believe in perfection. However, this item comes close! I bought this for my husband's new Weber propane grill and he really appreciates its features. I love that it is not ugly and black! Easy to put on and remove, water beads up and just falls away, and the elastics at bottom keep it in place even in our strong West Texas winds!

I'm glad I bought the X-large as the cover drapes down to the bottom of the grill, so the base of the grill isn't exposed to spray from rainfall hitting the patio. The cover is not so long that it prevents the grill from rolling on the patio, though. I previously bought one of the inexpensive grill covers you typically find at local retailers...the cheap cover literally ripped along a seam as I pulled the cover over the grill the first time I tried it on! The Veranda cover is made of thick, high-quality material that feels like it will hold up well against the elements. There is no question that it's worth spending a few extra bucks to get the Veranda cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bbq cover, covers my giant grill completely","review":"i have a terrace on my roof and i keep my bbq grill up there. there is unfortunately no protection up there from the rain and snow so i was forced to buy this bbq cover. even though this is the only bbq cover that I have ever tried I can be confident in saying that this is a really good one. it protects my giant grill 100% and has remained that way for 3 years now. there are handles on the top to take it off easily and there are special clips that you can attach to the cover to keep it from blowing away easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very heavy, very well crafted","review":"Form fitting; excellent assembly.

The handles on each top side not only make it easier to pull it off, but it helps to determine placement to put it back on. I also did not realize it was vented on each side. A zippered compartment on the front top side can be used for storage.Although I feel like the cover is heavy enough to keep from blowing off in the wind, there are straps to fasten to the legs of the grill in addition to a pull cord to tighten it at the bottom. It even has a quality appearance and I've actually gotten numerous compliments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn already","review":"This looks nice and of high quality which is why I got it. Unfortunately it didn't hold up. In less than a year it has two gaping holes (2 feet each). Both of the tears are along the stitched part. It has just come undone. The last cover we had came with the house so I'm not sure how old it was before we got it but it looked old and not nearly as nice as this one, but it held up in our sometimes very windy yard for over four years with us before getting any holes and needing replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"Bought this product in March. Initially loved the product- it was a clean, canvas look product which really complemented my patio and color scheme. I really liked the storage pocket too. Now that it is November, 8 months later, the cover is starting to crack near the top and leave gaps for water to get into. A couple of months ago, the cover also started to get mildew spots all over it so it is no longer clean looking. We do cover the grill after each use. The cover gets an equal amount of sun and shade during the day and we have not gotten a tremendous amount of rain the past few months, so not sure why the mildew or dark tiny spots started to form. No one is yanking the cover roughly off and on, so not sure why the cracks are happening. Very disappointed in this cover for the price. I thought it would last at least a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted 3 years. Just like the warranty!","review":"I expected this cover to last longer than 3 years. It seemed to be very heavy duty and we were very impressed during the period before it getting holes in it. It's really heavy duty canvas material, similar to a boat cover. We did have it in an area of full sun exposure (unavoidable for the grill area). Overall, it was a great grill cover and a great gift for my dad. I'm just a little let down that I'm having to do this all over again so soon. It turns out the warranty is for 3 years, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit cover","review":"Seen this veranda cart cover on another site covering a pellet cooker.

It is made with a heavy duty fabric and has nice handles on the top making it easy to remove.

I found that the depth of the XL cover to be too tight which caused the length to be very tight and the height to be too short.I returned the XL and ordered the XXL. The XXL has the same length and height as the XL, but the depth is 4 inches deeper. This added 4 inches of depth allows for the perfect fit on my E-670.The dimensions of the XL vs the XXL from Classic Accessories website are below:XL 71\\"L x 24\\"D x 46\\"HXXL 71\\"L x 28\\"D x 46\\"HNote: The Summit 670 model has a rotisserie burner with an extra panel covering it on the back of the hood. I believe that this panel makes the 670 deeper than 620 and previous non-rotisserie burner Summit models, thus the reason why I needed the XXL size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice grill cover.","review":"This grill cover is just what I needed. It's heavy duty, well made, a nice neutral color, and it fits my 6 burner grill perfectly. I was skeptical at first, but the sewn-in handles really do help lifting it on and off since it's quite large and a little awkward to handle. The zippered tool pocket was an unexpected bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"We have a lot of wind.

I read the reviews before I purchased and I will say they were right! The quality of this cover for the cost is excellent. Even my hubby was surprised.

I would definitely recommend this cover to anyone looking to buy an affordable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very NIce!","review":"This is a well made cover and will last a long time. Be careful of the sizing, though. Based on a prior review I went one size bigger to make sure it fit, and it is a little too big. I was concerned about the depth of my BBQ at 26\\". I thoutht the XL might be too tight, so I went with the XXL. The XL would have been fine. Better too big than too small. Aside from that, this is a great product and a good price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover","review":"I bought this cover for use on my large grill that has a side table and side burner. I lie the extra storage pocket on the front of the cover too. The straps make it easy to tie down and I don't have to worry about it blowing off in the crazy midwestern winds.

Much better quality than the cheap vinyl one you can get from the big box stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grill cover","review":"great material, very durable fabric, not the plastic kind.

I've gone through several cheaper and more expensive covers, but this one is pure quality. It's heavy, durable, and weathers well. My only hesitation was the light color, but it manages to stay remarkably clean, despite the birds and bats that frequent our property. I have no difficulty with removing or replacing the cover. We are very pleased with this item, and plan on purchasing their furniture covers, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veranda XL barbecue cover","review":"This is my second cover from this company. I went with this company's product both times because they were one of the few that made a cover for my larger size grill. The first cover seemed to be durable enough, however the materiel did not hold up well in cold (freezing) weather. It probably would have been fine if I left it on over the winter season, but I grill year round and the fabric is not very pliable in the winter. As a result of it being too stiff it cracked very easily.The second cover seems to be a similar materiel (maybe a little thinner), so I assume I'd have the same problem. I only remove it when temps are above freezing and so far it seems to be holding up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great for 1.5 years, then started tearing","review":"This *was* a well-made grill cover and though the smallest size was too big for our grill, it served us well for the first year. After the first summer, it started fading pretty badly; the bottom color is now a purple-ish color. After the 2nd summer, I noticed tears on the top, towards where the handles are. Now on our third year, there are multiple tears and the \\"fabric\\" has become brittle and tears easily. For what I paid for this item, it should have lasted longer. Each time we remove and replace the cover now, it tears a little more. So, expect to only get about two years out of this before it starts tearing (if you look at other reviews, you'll see they have the same issue, too).We do store our grill and cover in the garage 4-5 months out of the year, too.Would not recommend. Will post pics later today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok while it lasts...","review":"I'm placing an order for a replacement one right now, my last one made it almost three years. It is thoroughly destroyed right now, material has dried out and is tearing, webbing on buckles has broken, there are 5-6 large tears in the material on the top. Two of the buckles no longer work so the wind has been blowing it off.For the price, it was great while it lasted, I didn't expect it to last forever. I haven't found anything that I like better, would be nice if it lasted a little longer though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent non-OEM cover for my Weber Spirit E-310","review":"I picked up the Weber OEM grill cover (9935)locally for my new Weber Spirit E-310 grill and was disappointed by the presence of an open vent located at the front of the grill (the vent on the back seems fine since its vertical placement doesn't seem like it would let in much moisture). After looking up reviews of this cover I thought I'd give it a try and keep the one I liked better. The Weber cover fits like a glove, but this Veranda cover fits quite nicely as well. I have the 58\\" version and it is plenty wide and deep. Also, it's taller than the OEM cover as it sits only a couple of inches from the deck when on the grill. To me it looks much better on my deck than the black OEM cover and the side vents have a cover over them, so I don't anticipate much water getting on the inside. It's also about $10 cheaper than the OEM cover. I could live with either, but the Veranda is the one I'm keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I previously owned a vinyl cover that lasted about 3 years (with duct tape patching the holes)...I imagine that it cost more than what I paid for this new cover. This new cover by Veranda is an incredible cover. Not only does it look great, but the quality is unmatched. It's thick, durable, and keeps my grill bone dry through the harshest weather. Veranda apparantly offers covers for various outdoor funiture - I would definately purchase multiple covers for anything kept outdoors.

After I saw the appearing everywhere, and seeing VH1 talk about Aqualung, I figuired that it was going to be great. So, I decided to purchase it. I guess I expected to hear more songs like 'Just Like Love', but most of the songs were sung in his high pitch head voice, and really slowly. 'Just Like Love' is about as upbeat as it gets. Not to mention, 90% of the songs are written about a depressing love experience. But, I'm sure, just like all of my other albums, it will grow on me, and I'll likely wind up liking it the most.

It speaks directly to the soul, with spirituals such as \\"Walk with Me, Jesus\\" to a starkly simple \\"Silent Night\\" to the title track. Cyrus is in no hurry; he lingers over these tunes, massages the keys, and produces music that is sweet, fragile at times, and always affirming.A cd for all seasons from one of jazz's most original and soulful young talents.Don't rush to the store.

Each career is highlighted in a separate chapter, using real ancedotes and comments from professionals who have already achieved success. Some of the topics discussed include the training and/or formal schooling needed, job duties, work environments, and possible salary ranges. One topic I found especially helpful was the importance of having a portfolio. Not only do students need to present a portfolio of their art work when applying to an art school or college program, they will need a portfolio when interviewing, especially in the fields of graphic design and conservation. I also like the way the author identified the key skills and attributes each career requires for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education: The Civil Rights Issue of our Time","review":"The Lottery is an outstanding documentary movie.

I encourage all people of voting age to watch this movie to learn of the enormous effort required to overcome the status quo in bringing about an improvement in educational outcomes. Many of the people in the educational establishment who claim to want to help are actually shown to be far more interested in preserving the status quo than in helping students.

I didn't really expect to find the movie interesting, I just wanted to see what everyone was talking about.The first minute or so was nothing but explicit sex and I almost turned the movie off thinking it was going to be pointless, that this was all there was to the movie, but I had nothing better to do so I kept watching.This movie is not porn, nor is it erotica. This movie IS an uncensored look at the truth about love and sex, and is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is brutally honest, thought provoking, intense at times, and funny at others.

It is predictabely grim, yet author tries to make the stories unique and interesting to read. I liked the stories for their exposition of desperation in peoples lives.

Every yarn is unique, some with tons of black humor, others placing you right inside the Afghan war. The first tells of a journalist trying his best to get some penicillin for his malaria sticken pal, including risking his life in a mad rush near the battlesgrounds, to a supposed plant/field that can kill the disease. The end is shocking, and horrific. In \\"The Ambassador's Son\\" we are inside the wild west flavor of a new \\"Istan\\" nation,including some of the zaniest writing imaginable.

I saw it years ago - even had a tape of it (taped off of one of the movie channels) but the tape deteriorated - and I no longer have a VHS player anyway.I'd love to watch it again.

And it gives people a bit of an insight into this annual piano competition and what the \\"kids\\" go through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Music in movie","review":"The musical performances in this move are very enjoyable. All the major piano concerto composers are heard. Many typical personality types of classically traind musicians are presented in the movie. There are the emotional entanglements that can draw performers away from their art. Done many years before Mr. Holland's opus, Dryfus has a great scene directing the orchestra on the Emperor Concerto. He is not much of conductor here, but has a great understanding of the musical work and his character get the awesome results from the orchestra, coloring outside the maestro's myopic traditional perspective. I have watched this movie over and over and enjoy it to the fullest every time. I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please bring to DVD!","review":"This is a great movie. As a pianist myself (though amateur only), I may be a little biased, but Richard Dreyfus and Amy Irving are just excellent actors (they even manage to make their piano playing motions, including fingering, somewhat realistic - unlike most movies where actors have to pretend-play) and the music is fantastic... The supporting cast is superb as well. I didn't even mind that they passed San Francisco's Academy of Science building as a concert hall (that building was razed two years ago, by the way, so the movie has archival value there as well). Highly recommended is you love the piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vendor","review":"This VHS was in very good condition. Happy to have it as this film is not available on DVD. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this with someone you love !","review":"Gosh, there were so many good movies from the 1970's & 1980's. The Competition is definately one of them. People who enjoy classical music with a good star cast will really enjoy this flic. The story is simple enough. Richard Dreyfus & Amy Irving are young pianists who fall in love while vying for the prize of a major competition.For the finale, Dreyfuss chooses Beethoven's piano concerto no.5, while Amy chooses the more complex Prokofiev's piano concerto no.3. Though Amy Irving is more smitten by Dreyfuss's charm, he's a bit reluctant to get involved due to the competition which both parties want to win desperately. Lee Remick is apt as the watchful teacher over Amy Irving. Sam Wanamaker who's also a popular director himself is excellent as the conductor of the competition. Popular 70's music director Lalo Schifrin is the movie's music composer & Joel Oliansky takes the honors for story, screenplay & direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The love/ hate movie","review":"I gotta tell you, my sister and I both love Dreyfuss and Irving and Lee Remick. The best part of this movie is the piano competition. The actors were beliveable in their \\"playing\\" the piano. Eveything thing else stunk in this movie. It is a guilty pleasure movie. This is possibly the worst acting from an entire cast in a single movie. Lee Remick walks around in robotic motion and needs a beat down for the insults. Dreyfuss' parents should have thrown him out from the basement years ago for over-acting more than usual. Sam Wanamaker and his sweater on the shoulders, joint smoking, getting his mack on to weird music was just what we needed to push us over the edge into uncontrollable laughter. I rent this movie when I need a good laugh and it suits the bill. I am sure that wasn't the intention when it was made. Did I mention about Dreyfuss crying after having sex and that silly cap?

It captures the self-annihilating desire to play well, the desperation of it. The fierce competition with everyone else and with yourself. It's a movie without jokes, it's not entertainment, but movie making at its best. When you make a movie...or write a book...or draw a picture without thinking of your audience. When you do it because it's inside you and you want to give it expression.And the people are lovely. Is it just because it was made in 1980 that the absense of media seems so strong? They're just lovely people with personality. Even the Piano Teacher, who's slightly stereotypical, isn't made into a joke. You feel her contained ambition. That is, if you're a pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVDnowplease!!!","review":"One of the greatest movies with piano music and brillant love story between two great actors.

It contained everything I needed to get ready for the test and feel well prepared. I was comfortable on test day, very pleased with my test score and happy with my college acceptances. One thing I liked especially was the way the author explained things. At times I felt as though he was talking directly to me.

This is how a set should be presented. That being said, watching it all took some effort.Many of the routines are dated but most can still produce laughs. This is especially true of some of the absurd setups and situations to say nothing of the animations. Still, I learned that the Pythons are best taken in small doses.

Much of Python's humor looked terribly forced and it was not anywhere as funny as it was supposed to be. Hill's show had far more life in it, naturally flowing humor and the timing was impeccable.

But, my children love it too! This comedy has really held up over the years. It's still laugh out loud funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Python done wrong","review":"Monty Python is a British Institution that became a Comedy Institution around the world. The show has been greatly disrespected by A&E; in both versions of DVD sets they've released.I really hopr that someday either A&E; will redo this series to today's standards ((better DVD menus, extras (like the ones they apparently put on the 'Best of' Gilliam, Cleese, etc bits,)) yse slimline cases, a transfer that is both restored from the original and then touched up a bit better, both German episodes, the python live and life of python versions with all the goodies as well as some more extras which could totally be done. Do that A&E.; Or maybe some other company should buy the Python stuff from A&E; if that is at all possible and do the aforementioned because the inaction by A&E; is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burma","review":"What can you say about these brilliant gentlemen and their early work?

There are plenty of histerical routines, but some were obviously meant for British audiences, since the references which drew laughs didn't make any sense to me. Still a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrate their 35th anniversery with this great treasure.","review":"Oh yes, Python fans. Monty Python was born on October 5, 1969, or that's the first time it aired on BBC television anyway. This has all their episodes and is a great gift to any British comedy fan and I'll say right now that it's definatly worh it. I got this for Christmas in 2002 and was immeadiatley hooked. The British are just funnier than we."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Halls Of Monty...","review":"...comes this set of Python! I've discovered that if you're an American Python fan, you belong to an elite group! This box contains EVERY EPISODE (4 seasons worth) of Monty Python's Flying Circus, complete with bonus extras on each of the 14 DVDs. Everyone has a favorite, and they're all here. Mine has always been \\"Confuse-A-Cat\\" which is so deliciously dumb, it's hysterical! I haven't run across too many American Python fans in my own circle of acquaintances, but hey --- if you're reading this, YOU must be a Pythonite! Glad ta meetcha! This set is VERY reasonably priced and you'll be transfixed for days with all the lunacy you love. What makes this 6-man group endearing to me is NOTHING IS SACRED WHEN IT COMES TO COMEDY...exactly the way it should be. They take the simple and make it creative. They take the mundane and make it hysterical. They take your money and make it disappear. So buy it awready...it's a gas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really?

What else do you need to know about it?I kicked myself in the rearend for a year and a half for not buying this earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus 16-Ton Megaset","review":"This collection brought it all back even after all the years. Monty Python is one of the greatest ensemble comedy troups ever assembled and their Flying Circus TV show was a smashing success. This complete set includes so much additional material, and every one of their sketches, and is a MUST have set of DVD's. Until now the only place I could get my MPFC fix was on BBC America, and even then only sporadically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Much Else To Say","review":"Yup, this is the one to get. I gotta go along with the crowd here. Monty Python is bloody funny and this is a treasure trove of treats.Ministry of Silly Walks, Anybody for Tennis, the Cheese Shop...the list goes on and on.And now that it's impossible to see these on TV anymore the value of this mega DVD set is even higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all there","review":"It already starts with the packaging, that should put a smile on your face before you even start a dvd. But when you do, it's even better!!Menu's look good, the extra's are great!

This is a great set! I got it for my brother as a gift. He said he didn't realize there were this many episodes. He used to watch it in college. I recommend this. . .you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's fascination with Monty Python rewarded","review":"Actually I have not personally reviewed all of this material, as it was a gift to my son, who does not live with me. He is a 13-year old who has become a fan of Monty Python at an early age and now has been inspired by this most intelligent group to become a comic actor - of course, any opinion I will have on that idea will be tainted, so only time will tell. This is quintessential British humor and though my son is from the US and is of latino origin, it has strung a chord with him. This set is totally essential and guarantees hours of enjoyment many times over. Both he and I are thankful that this product was made available."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a python addict... Here's your fix","review":"I've always wanted ALL of the episodes. I've had them on old Umatic(3/4\\" pro) tapes, recorded off of PBS, with interruptions for \\"beg a thons\\" even. I had some on VHS, then I saw this collection, and said \\"I must have this\\", and yes... It's as good as I'd hoped. Buy this (you KNOW that you want it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Albatross!","review":"This is a great collection and Monty Python are genius'. The Flying Circus came out on television a long time before I was born and it still managed to attrcted me to the amazing comedy these six pythons produced. Monty Python's Flying Circus presents absolutely hilarious sketches, some of which are funny on the pure randomness of them which, I suppose, is implied by the title. There is such as mass of memorable sketches that its hard to name them all. From Bruces to Lumberjacks, Cheese Shops to Spanish Inquisitions, and Dennis Moore to Silly Walks,this show is amazing! Stunning! A great show and a must buy!ALBATROSS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supreme Classic Series","review":"Ah... Monty Python. What hasn't been said about them? They're hilarious, ridiculous, bizarre, unusual, humorous, enjoyable, deep, sincere, sarcastic, crazy, and legendary. I mean every single one of those in the best way possible. Basically, they're just about the craziest group of people this planet has ever spawned and you're crazy if you don't buy this collection. It will keep you laughing for hours upon hours and then, you'll do it all over again. This is as good as humor gets, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection, but...","review":"As a previous reviewer feared, this collection is censored.

Possibly THE greatest film humor work of the 20th century. I mean it; don't let this go out of production without buying it. One BIG GRIPE, though: I don't know whether it was Gilliam who did the programming or what, but number one, every blinking time you want to watch a particular sketch you have to suffer through a very long, pointless intro of Gilliam's animation (which I'm so sick of at this point I could puke), with the Skip function disabled, and number two, the programming apparently hides some stuff so you only see it if you get to it the right way. That's not humor at all; it's just antisocial. I watch mine far less than I would because of the intro problem, and I'm ripped about it because I love the sketches so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The (almost) Complete, Original and Genuine.","review":"In the autumn of 1969 I was a thirteen year old schoolboy when Python appeared: it was love at first sight and over the years I grew to appreciate the subtelties even more. I bought the 'Best of...' DVDs from the BBC and enjoyed them, but something was missing and it wasn't just Australian tennis stars' investigation into the intelligence of penguins!Now that I have the complete series in original sequence I can see that the shows were planned as complete self contained entities. I recommend all my fellow 'Brits' to buy this... it isn't much more than the exerpts and you get one (but not both of the german) shows.I'm off for a lemon curry... enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The highs and the lows (and a few missing bits)","review":"It goes without saying that this collection is a treasure, and worth every penny. You'll see the original sketch-free stream-of-consciousness comedy that redefined comedy, in all its animation-linked glory.You'll also see the occasional nice little tidbit you might otherwise have missed (Graham Chapman was a fully-qualified mountaineer?).What you might miss are the occasional song or sketch that's mysteriously cut out without notice. For example, in episode 22, the Bruces mysteriously forget to sing their Philosopher's Song. The Proust competition has some parts omitted. I don't know why these bits are missing, and it would be interesting to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not get it yet","review":"I did not get it yet.So i can not rate it .

However I believe that a sample SAT book or a strong latin review will help with the two sections that deal with words. The math was pretty basic, similar to the SAT's and the charts and electrical mazes are larger on the test compared to the practice books. I think the best way to study for this test is to lock yourself in a room and play some classical music. The lord of the rings soundtrack worked for me, but anything will do. It is also important that you answer every question for the AFOQT. It hurts your grade more if you leave an answer blank. Just relax and try not to stress out. As for studying, take it a section at a time, and time yourself accordingly. The Person in charge of our test had a loud timer that was distracting, so maybe you will want a loud timer so you can get use to the noise. Honestly, the test was not as hard as I thought. Just eat a light breakfast and concentrate.

I was extremely dissappointed in this book. I am still searching for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy! Contains wrong answers!!!

In the Western culture, we understand traditions completely differently. Therefore, our perspective is askewed in terms of how we interpret the Bible.

I would not recommend purchasing this book.If you are looking for more on the relationship between Christ and the church, I would suggest this set of short lessons called \\"That the World May Know: Faith Lessons on the Death and Resurrection of the Messiah\\" by historian / archaeologist Ray Vander Laan instead.Faith Lessons on the Death and Resurrection of the Messiah (Home DVD Vol. 4) Home Pack/Bible Study Guides: The Bible's Timeless Call to Impact Culture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap cheap cheap","review":"The switches are super cheap, and some of the buttons (such as the on/off switch) are labeled in Chinese.

Not only is it trigun, one of my favorite animes/manga, but it is also a very good price for its size. most manga that i get is the same price or more for one third of its volume. The fight scenes are a bit confusing though to first readers, and if i hadn't seen the anime first, i would have been very confused. It reminds me very much of clamp's x/1999 in the battle style, with many, many lines and complicated backrounds that take the reader's attention from the action. However, if that doesn't confuse you at all, then, buy the book! its very good. however, if you haven't seen the anime and are easily distracted by lots and lots of lines, then i wouldnt get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few best mangas of all time","review":"This is one of the best mangas I have ever read.

It is a great blend of action and comedy and unforgetable characters. It isn't that much different than the anime, only slightly differing in some parts. It contains the original manga form of the first few episodes (those with Brilliant Dynamites Neon and the Nebraska Family ending with Meryl and Millie saving \\"without help\\" the plantation) and they are portrayed quite well. The artwork although in the very beginning is of a slight less quality than the anime early in the Manga. Those of you out there with a Wolfwood Legato or Knives obession shouldn't worry about this volume, as these characters are yet to appear.

I will admit, it has an edge on Red Eye because of the incredible plot and beautiful camera work and direction, I however was not electrified as I was in Red Eye. I'm not in any way saying this film was not perfect in it's genre, I'm simply saying that if you are in the mood for a shocking thriller that will make you jump, laugh and fidget, Red Eye may be a better choice.Overall, this film DID have excellent acting, an incredible story, wonderful score by James Horner, great camera work, and flawless special effects, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid At All Costs","review":"All I have to say is, you know, you're in trouble, when you fall asleep, watching a thriller. I've read Roger Ebert's review of this film, and I normally agree with him about 90% of the time. This movie fell in the category of the latter 10%. This is a double-yawner. Where is the tension, thrills, suspense, and just a general sense of urgency? Nowhere to be found.Jodie Foster, as good as she is, didn't portray the \\"mother in agony\\" as strongly as the role should have been. James Horner's music, though bautiful, didn't fit this film. The direction and editing were not tight enough, to make this film even remotely interesting.All in all, totally uninvolving, and deeply disappointing.

SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was the dark icing on the cake. Now, Ms. Foster has become a suspense / thriller / action hero. PANIC ROOM was great and FLIGHTPLAN is almost as good. Here we get a mother named Kyle Pratt (Foster), trapped on a plane, unable to find her 6yo daughter. Unfortunately, no one believes her, and there's no record of her daughter ever being on the plane! Is she nuts, or is there some diabolical conspiracy afoot? The tension builds nicely, while we wonder what is going on.

Other than that, the movie is very well done,if slightly predictable to those who've seen more than three or four thrillers. Still, its very suspenseful, and will keep you engaged the whole way through. My biggest props go to Jodie Foster, who is excellent as always. In fact she is so good in this movie that the other actors all seem diminished somehow. She just makes them look like they're standing still, with the exception of Sean Bean who turns in a great performance as well. Overall, I would recommend seeing it at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than what I was expecting.","review":"Very good film. Good pace, action, and story.

This has to be the worst film that Jodie Foster has ever done, and not because her acting was poor. On the contrary, she was fine for the role; however, the writing and plot were terribly formulaic. From the second of the aforementioned quote it was evident to see where the film was headed, and it did not derail from the predestined outcome. While the premise was frightening, the thriller aspect of this film just did not convey. In fact, it came across flat out hokey in several spots. I adore both Foster and Sarsgaard, but how many times has she played a victimized overprotective mother, exactly? Often enough that she should have it down by now--and she does. Sarsgaard, though, seemed bored with his lines, all but delivering them between yawns. The only real star in this film was the six year old daughter, played by Marlene Lawston. Too bad she had so little time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, Don't Buy","review":"Definitely recommend renting this one prior to purchasing. Pretty intriguing at the beginning but finally became incredulous, leaving this viewer wishing he had done something more productive with his time. The acting was good but, ultimately, the writing was not. As far as a purchase is concerned, the DVD is really worth only about $9.00...certainly not the current, almost $20 pricetag. Try Netflix first or get this used, at a reasonable cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one reason to watch this film...","review":"...and it's staring at you on the video cover. It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene. No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense. It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy. Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it. But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap... Absolute Crap...","review":"This movie is horrible, and should be avoided at all costs, the acting is disgusting (a fact made worse when you consider the cast) and the story is full of plot holes - the writers lean so heavily on the whole \\"she must be crazy\\" idea, they've left no room for any other explanation, and then try to give us one anyway, and what should have been a good twist will leave you scratching your head and thinking \\"wow.. how dumb\\".I cannot stress enough just how bad this film is... Buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie appearently wasen't made for ppl who don't care about kids","review":"I went to see this movie recently - despite how much I mocked the trailer for being predictable, unsuspesful, and boring. I held out hope that the movie in its entirety would be better - boy was I wrong!This movie is basicaly the same as the trailer! In fact, it's just an extended version of the trailer - sucking up two hours of my life that I wish I could get back. I didn't find the charecers convincing - I've never cared for Jodie Foster as an actress, and with this charecter in particular, I found her to be dreadfuly annoying. It seemed to me that all she did in the movie was whine about her child being missing. I found the plotline to be predictable, and wasen't surprised in the least, at the conclusion. This is a 'chick flick thriller' I would not reccomend this to guys, nor would I reccomend it to ppl such as myself who don't particularly care to include children in their immediate lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont go for a smoke","review":"really holds your attention , lots of great surprises ,usually i forgot they were just acting , jodie maybe my favoritesince contact , but thats hard to beat ,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Suspense!","review":"This is defintley is a must see for all who love great suspense and who love thrillers. This movie is very unpredictable and just when you think you figured what's going to happen or what has happened, it completely surprises you as to what indeed does happen.

A Must See!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mothers definitely won't like this one","review":"We have two young daughters, and my wife was definitely disturbed by this one. There's something primal about a story of a mother separated from her children that touches things that sometimes are best left undisturbed. In this case, the discomfort of the premise outweighed the entertainment value.Foster does a good job in the central role, but the plot is preposterous, the direction too slow, and the editing at the start is misleading, not in the sense of plot misdirection, but in the sense of setting up the tone for the rest of the movie.Not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tongue-in-cheek review . . .","review":"If propulsion engineers looked liked Jodi Foster, I'd be working for Boeing, sipping a double shot of java, and living in Seattle.The screenwriter must have had bad karma flying Southwest or Delta.

That's another thing: I've never seen a plane like that, decked out like Carnegie Hall.When I fly, I could use some \`therapy' with a sex-kitten therapist . . . maybe in first class with some bubbly to boot.Ok, ok . . . enough with the Henny Youngman routine. This was a top-notch thriller. Lots of action, spills and thrills. It kept my attention, and, as usual, Jodi Foster stole the show. The scenario was well-plotted, imaginative.I lied; back to the shtick. The pilot on this plane was from central casting; my pilots are hung-over, eighteen and bipolar. Drum roll please . . . please, take my wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ludicrous plot \\" is much too kind / Throw Jodie from the plane","review":"In too many thrillers, the plot depends upon an implausible, if not impossible, turn. This is the ultimate in such thrillers - the antagonist's plan depends upon an extended series of unpredictable, implausible/absurd and illogical occurrences. One element even depends upon the conjunction of three ridiculous circumstances.By halfway through this movie, you will be wondering why someone didn't kill Jodie Foster, and her character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Flightplan, or \\"Flightpanned\\" is implausible posturing and shrieking. Its total disregard for facts adds foolishness to tediousness.

The \\"suspense\\" scenes that set up the plot are turgid. Jodie Foster looks awful, abd that's before someone gives her a sucker punch.And then there is this giant new aircraft.... It looks like a cruise ship with lounges, decks, rack-mounted computers and bathrooms big enough to sleep in. Whoever thought this up has no respect for the intelligence of the public.And finally, 4 or 5 hours into the movie (it seems like 4 or 5 hours) they finally reveal that the shifty-eyed air marshall and the cold stewardess are the criminals. What a revelation! BTW, who thought to make the Arabs good-guys? Probably Jodie in a fit of irrational political correctness.Sorry follks, this one is a bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true and it was!","review":"The first part of the movie was well done. Was her daughter with her or was it just the thought of her daughter that overcame her? I began to have doubts, as the flashbacks appeared on the screen, and with the growing certainty of the passengers and crew that they never saw her on the plane. I thought of Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES, where the gentle older woman disappears as her newly made friend takes a nap on a train.But then everything changed. The movie was too good to be true, and it degenerated into a standard, nonsensical thriller, with Arabs, with hints of hijacking, with threats of a remote controlled bomb, with ransom demands, with guns, and with an intricate murder plot.It is always a pleasure to see Jodie Foster, and to see the quality of her acting. But she just couldn't save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"i watched this movie and enjoyed none of it. the script was bad and the acting was no better. if you enjoy being bored to tears from a movie, then by all means watch this one. if however you like a little more then a thin plot line and bad acting try a different movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"reasonable thriler movie that could have led nowhere","review":"This movie sounds like a pretty cheesy concept. A 6 year old girl on a plane gets lost. But add in a dead husband, a very fatigued and frantic mother who is an airplane engineer, and possibly a very great terrorist plot, with a decent ending, then you get this movie. Jodie foster plays a mother traveling home from berlin to long island with her 6 year old daughter after her husband falls in a mysterious accident. Foster falls asleep for 2 hours and then poof, the little girl is gone, lost on a plane over the mid atlantic. however, no one seems to remember the litte girl, so it's off to the races to find her. This is definately worth checking out once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Thing About This Flick Was the Previews","review":"This could have been a good film. The previews certainly suggested as much.A woman, played by Jodie Foster, takes an airline flight with her young daughter, but the daughter just disappears and no one on the plane remembers her. It sounds promising, but the plot has about as many gaping holes as any film ever made. The makers of this flick were gambling that most viewers would be too stupid to notice them, and, based on the mostly positive reviews, it looks like their gamble paid off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should of missed this flight","review":"The best part of this movie unfortunately were the credits. I did enjoy Jodie Foster's role, however the movie as a whole did not deliver. It's obvious who the \\"villians\\" are in the very beginning. The way that they act so strange instead of trying to blend in more with the other people gave things away too soon.I did enjoy the design of the plane. It was neat to see a full lounge/bar and huge plasma TV screens in front of each seat. The technology was displayed in an up-to-date atmosphere that allowed the starbucks/cellphone/IPOD generation to feel right at home. All in all I wish that the movie had a much harder plot to figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"For a while the suspense builds effectively, but the premise is so far-fetched that it collapses. Isn't there an easier way for the bad guys to do what they want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous premise that wears thin","review":"I can't believe all the great reviews for this. You have to first buy into Flightplan's preposterous premise that a six-year old girl goes missing during a flight, which I was obviously perfectly willing to do since I went to see the movie. However, you then have to follow around a frantic Jodi Foster for most of the movie as she searches for her daughter in the midst of a bunch of vacuous charcters who smile nervously in her presence.Flightplan was in dire need of a Leslie Nielsen cameo to alleviate the numbing tedium, which really begins to set in big-time around the fifty-minute mark. When we are illuminated as to \\"why,\\" it's no big revelation, no big \\"ah-hah,\\" no big deal.Finding out what the in-flight meal was would have been of equal interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible plot","review":"The first part of the movie where the protagonist is looking for her daughter is too drawn out. And when the truth is finally revealed, it's so far-fetched it's almost insulting. So many things could have gone wrong for the bad guys! How did they know she'd bring her husband's body, as well as her daughter with her? How could they know no passengers will notice her daughter? How could they possibly have predicted that she would unlock the casket (and why didn't they just get the lockpad code themselves)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flightplan","review":"I didn't watch it because I asked for refund.

There are indeed many plot holes that seem way too big to just brush off (no one saw the daughter on the plane?..she was the first on board!! No one saw her daughter being kidnapped and injected with a drug or her luggage being taken?).

Jodie Foster had to have financial problems at the time to accept the role.I gave it one star because..... I couldn't choose half a star!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodie Foster CHOSE to do this?","review":"I understand that big stars pretty much pick and choose films to get involved with. I therefore assume that Ms Foster thought this was a good idea. It wasn't.It doesn't take long to figure out who is the real bad guy, and once that is out of the way there is little else going for the film. I could only tolerate hearing \\"you're not listening to me\\" in so many variations. Even Jodie Foster can keep that interesting for so long. The film hints at one of the attendants having sympathies for the distraught mom, and I kept waiting for the film to spring a surprise related to that. Nope. Then I thought they might be implying that the captain understood and might somehow help, Nope again.Bottom line: Very talented actor, but awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like to give it more stars...","review":"..but I just can't. I'm a Jodie Foster fan for the most part (did anyone besides me notice her frightening resemblance to Michael Jackson in this film?) However, her success with \\"Panic Room,\\" which was a better film all around, seems to have spawned this thriller. Sadly, this one is full of way too many plot holes to take it seriously. Foster is a strong actress as always, but her abilities can't keep this flight up in the air. It's contrived, unbelievable and, though it has a nice set up, it's ultimately a huge let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense !","review":"How can anyone give this movie as low a marks as you guys ? Their is so much twist in this movie and everyone is great, Maybe one ofthe biggest faults in this movie is their spending an hour and a half of the movie in a plane, and there is like an hour 32 mins in this movie.. so a big let down their.You cant say what will happen or you give away to whole movie really, But it is about some girl who's husband died and she has to bring his body back home.. but while in the plane, she losses the her daughter.Overall, great movie and i advice all people who know what a good movie is to watch it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change your Flightplans","review":"The characters are practically all uninteresting. The plot is so tired. The ''best'' part of the movie is Foster merely opening a bathroom vent and then having access to all vital plane wiring. Yeah, that's going to happen.

People were inferring Jodie Foster was doing another Panic Room, but this isn't even as good as that movie(which was only ok considering it was a David Finche film and I expected much more out of it). Foster seems to need a new manager who finds better scripts. Whatever happened to the actress who starred in Silence of the Lambs perhaps her taste in scripts got mediocre, because her films sure have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense","review":"Flightplan is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't usually like thrillers, but this one hooked me. The plot is extremly good, and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie.The story set in Germany, is of a mother and daughter who lose their husband/father and decide to come back to America. While on the way to America the mother wakes up to find her daughter missing. She is told however, that they have no record of her daughter ever coming aboard the plane. From there the story is one of mystery and intrigue as she struggles to find her daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the little girl actually disappear?","review":"If you have purchased this DVD or rented it rest assured that your money has not been wasted. Flightplan delivers all the drama and suspense without blood, bombs, or fights. The movie wastes no time in getting you hooked and once you are hooked, you are hooked till the end of the movie. Jodie Foster's acting is superb and the rest of the cast also deliver. At a certain point there is a clever twist where you even begin to wonder if the disappearance of the little girl was her mother's hallucination. One other nice thing the movie does is to clear the stigma that Arab/Muslim looking passengers need not be terrorists or hijackers all the time. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Impressed - Beyond Expectations","review":"Flightplan delivers an edge-of-your-seat high-octane adrenaline rush. Jodie Foster is the star, however, it's the entire cast from top to bottom that makes Flightplan a takeoff hit! To the average viewer, you'd get the initial impression Flightplan attempts to rip-off the viewer with an unoriginal concept (mother losing her daughter on a plane post 9/11), but when you look between the lines, you notice the depth of the plot this movie molds itself into (the psyche of Kyle Pratt and bizarre twist of events). Sure, Flightplan is no masterpiece, but this movie delivered well beyond my expectations. I'm confident this underrated film will do the same for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller","review":"This is a great thriller without the blood. Heavy on suspense, and it was no surprise that Foster's acting was outstanding. Her ability to have just the right voice and facial tension adds to the dramatic feeling. Perfect for action/suspense lovers. I also liked the twist on the new style of plane, though it did make a point that by getting bigger, we only increase the inability to pay attention to people.Chrissy K.

Her sanity is in question when it is discovered that her daughter's name is not on the passenger list and no one remembers seeing her. She insists that the plane be searched, but she is doubted by the captain and an air marshall who is aboard.

And to be honest I have Nine Inch Nails albums with a better and more consistent beat. In my opinion, it's a total marketing ploy aimed at gay men. Some songs are good, but the mixing is bad which tends to make the songs too short. This has gone to my CD shelf and is collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I bought this cd soon after it came out and I walk to it.

Wait for the video and live album from the 2000 reformation to be released, buy Live at the Paramount or American Woman, but forget this dreck.

Kelly's ever popular 'I Believe I Can Fly' and Monica's beautiful 'For You I Will' and everything in between. Standouts include the rap fused 'Hit 'Em High' where B-Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man give us the Monstars theme, and the hilarious 'Basketball Jones' where Barry White trades lines with Chris Rock...insanity.

The situation turns into a circus when a plane of pakistani refuges fleeing from a nuclear war tries to land in Idaho. And so starts this big mess that might lead to civil war. As the story progresses we see it from various points of view like the news network triyng to explore the situation for higher viewings rates, the imconpetent president and his advisors and governor Farley that sees himself in a situation where there is no turning back. Great performances from James Earl Jones and James Coburn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, provocative movie","review":"What is really surprising is that this HBO video ever made it to DVD! Its about a repressive president who steps over a line, and the Western governor takes him on-sort of. Its played for laughs, but events spin out of control. When you start calling out the troops to defend your country, sometimes things just happen-and your country really does get defended. Vaguely similar to the Turner Diaries, in that its about the conflict between the Eastern repressive Federalists and the Western (think Montana) free staters.

The 2 strengths of these books are(at least to me) the well-rounded, likeable character of Vlad and the way the books is like a fantasy version of the Mafia. In this one the Mafia idea is not really used, and the characterization is more like something you need to know for later books than actually enjoyable to read. I read this series years ago, and this is the one that stands out least in my mind - even a friend i lent it to cried out in pain when talking about it.

Vlad and Cawti were fighting the whole time and she behaved in such an uppity way, she looked at him like he was some kind of filth on her shoes, that I couldn't understand what he saw in her, why he still loved her and kept running after her like a lost puppy.

Granted i am not the most mathematically minded individual and may be this is the reason. The bizarre structure of the book and lack of answers to the problems and exercises did not make it any easier.I kept the book after passing the subject (thank god), hoping that it will grow on me, nothing yet.

Also, all toys, especially those which go straight into the mouth (which is most of them) have to be washed a LOT. Another issue is that this is really going to hurt when babies smack themselves in the head with it, and they probably will, depending upon the age of the child.Both rattles look terrible, with chipped, fading paint. They were cute (at first) and appealing, on the plus side. I would not recommend these, or give them as gifts, to anyone with an infant. They seem to be more decorative than functional.

For those who like action movies, this has lots of it. It's also a romantic comedy. Well actually an action comedy with definitely a big side of romantic interest thrown in.

It's fun, exciting, fast paced and is a movie that has something for pretty much everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I don't usually like action type movies, but, bought this one because a friend is in it........really enjoyed it!

I don't think the beginning dragged-- in many ways it was my favorite part. Robert Schwentke knows how to create a quiet yet hilarious scene and Bruce Willis pulls it off stupendously. This is the type of movie my dad and I have termed, \\"Sarte meets Van Damme.\\" It has everything that makes a movie well done and fun. We have an excellent cast, excellent writing, and excellent plot, and fresh exciting action scenes. Lots of wonderful bangs and booms, yet we like the characters and easily get into the story.

If I knew about the difference in audio, I would not have purchased this movie and would have waited for the price to drop on the 2 disc special edition.

The story was a bit of a stretch, but hey, if it permits the likes of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, & Helen Miren to work together in an improbable plot, then just sit back and enjoy it.Movies like this are meant to entertain, not have the viewer scrutinize each and every scene for authenticity. It is meant to be an imaginary flick. For the characters to sometimes do the impossible, well, that is what makes this movie a kick to watch.I would recommend this movie to most of my friends and acquaintances.

The listed actors are joined by other very fine actors who deliver fine performances, in both the comic parts as well as the more serious moments. The idea is that these former C.I.A. agents must be eliminated for reasons that must remain obscure (they have to figure it out for themselves, then they'll tell you).

But to deliberately put out this hacked version and not make it PAINFULLY OBVIOUS what you are getting...that is just low. I have no problem with the idea of having tiered levels of pricing for what you get (though I have to question the wisdom for everybody of having say, 3 different Blu Ray sku's for toy story 3), and even lo-res audio would be ok if it is CLEAR what you are getting...if you were being given an informed choice. And if the ONLY difference was audio, then you'd make an informed decision vs. the special edition, but no, it appears that its the other stuff that differentiates the two versions.

I am giving it a one star rating because the movie only edition shortchanges the consumer. As indicated in some of the prior reviews, this edition only comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. It does not come with any High Definition audio tracks. Most blu ray movies typically have at least one HD audio track whether its TrueDolbyHD or DTS-Master Audio so the average consumer may not be aware of this deficiency because they've come to expect High Def audio as the norm for Blu Ray movies.

This was a great movie solely because it was an action movie with a comedy storyline and the cast that performed it was exceptional. I would highly recommened this film to anyone youll love the action atmosphere and parts with the comedy roles, the chemisty between Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker is amazing really makes the movie.

We had a great time doing the \\"pre-baby\\" activities and she can hardly wait for the baby to come so that she can finish the other activities that are about the baby. Be sure to get this book well before the baby arrives, since the first 3 chapters are based on preparing the child for the new sibling. Based on the amount of journaling, experiments, and projects, I would recommend this book for 5 year olds and older. For younger children, I would recommend My New Baby and Me, also availble at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gun, Low FPS","review":"i'll make this short and sweet.

First of all it didn't come with the leaser pointer, then the flashlight fell apart (good while it lasted) then it ran out of battery, so I charged it for 2 hours 30 minutes, but the whole time the charger light never even turned on. Then the stock broke. It couldn't stay, it just kept swinging. I was planning on just cutting the stock off so I could use it as a video prop (Youtube: ChazDirects) but after I spent 50 bucks, it just wasn't worth it. And it only shot about 225 FPS, not 350.

All in all it's a good package for an entry level rifle, especially if you're a fan of the Sig Saur 550 Family, this being the 552 \\"Commando\\". Gun has a decent fire rate and pretty nice accuracy at 10 meters, I super glued the springs in the stock so now it's pretty solid, comes with a single 30 round mag, I'd recommend buying more for it, especially since they can clip together, the red dot is adjustable but Not worth the effort in my opinion, the iron sights are great for the gun and also adjustable, I'd recommend not using the mock suppressor because it seems to make your shots go wild, also the thing is really light compared to the real thing, so don't expect an 8 pound rifle to come in the mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginer gun","review":"Works well. Stock feels a lttle flimsy but the gun itself feels solid. It did not however come with the light and the lazer pointer as shown in the photo. That is the DE M82P.

Overall a good starter gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gun for starter gun","review":"Gun is great for the price, just got my gun today and everything works great. One minor detail is that u cannot use .12g bbs with it, the reason is that the hopup setting at normal still put spin on the bb so when i use a .20 the bb flys straight but with a .12 the bbs curves up and i have to really compensate by aiming below the target at a distance of 30-50ft."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this","review":"I ordered an m4 but got this gun instead, hoping it would be the same quality but it wasnt.

Look through some of their other items and see how unreasonably high the shipping is on their items.After buying close to two dozen airsoft guns over the past two years I will not buy airsoft guns online unless the fulfillment is done through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"(NOTE: this review is by my 11 year old son- I bought the gun on his behalf) I was pretty excited at first because it looked cool but then when I actually put bullets in it , it stopped at about 30 fires- I took out the clip and it was empty. It is not worth 28 bucks. You would be better off just buying a different gun. The only other solution would be to buy more clips but they're like 8 bucks each so you would have to spend like another 20 bucks just for more clips. The clip is also very difficult to load.

This book is so grabbing that it is almost impossible to put down once you've started reading it. Sorry I will not say much about the story (I do not want to spoil it). Just know that you will travel alongside this guy who is kind of looking for something missing in his life and that his trip to Australia will take a turn that no one could have predicted.

My expectations were not realised.I can only assume that Mr Kennedy's literary skills have improved significantly since this (apparently his first published novel) was written. The Dead Heart had unbelievable, one dimensional characters and the depiction of northern Australia was so removed from reality as to make me think Mr Kennedy had neither been there, nor conducted any basic research, before he wrote this book.This is a book to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"I teach Advanced Visual Basic. I inherited students who took the prerequisite course, Visual Basic from instructors who used this book. All the students I got in Advanced Visual Basic had absolutely no idea about programming. All they could do was draw good looking forms with some controls on them and copy the code from Shelly and Cashman book. It does not provide challenging, unsolved programming projects for the students. All the students learn is to copy its forms and its code. Whatever this book is, it cannot serve as a good textbook!For my Advanced Visual Basic, I use Chapters 7 through 12 and appendices of \\"Computer Programming with Visual Basic 6: A Problem-Solving Approach with Cdrom\\" by Alka R.

That premise being that ALL emotionally abused women were abused as children in one way or another and that is why the woman choses abusive partners and even friends all through her life. Not ALL women who are emotionally abused come from an abusive childhood, to say so is an irresponsible commentary on the subject. I find the book \\"Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\\" by Lundy Bancroft a more in depth and on target handling of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book heal my wounded soul!","review":"This book challenged me to be more assertive toward my abuser. It also made me realize that I am not alone going through this abuse. It also helped me to see what kind of abuser my father really was. I had to look deep inside myself because of the pain that I have endured. Most of all this book helped me to move beyond my pain and accept it as being real. I thought to myself that this is how a parent was supposed to parent a child. Boy, was I wrong! Any woman that has gone through this abuse needs to get this book for their well being. I also found out within myself the traits that I got from the abuser and that I can change the way I act toward other people in a meaniful way! This book was a life saver!

I had to give this 2 stars because only the last chapter talks about this (the last 40-50 pages). The majority of the book gives case examples of abuse. This might be a good book for someone who is just realizing that they are a survivor of abuse, and wants to read about others who have gone through the same or similar circumstances.The book also assumes that once abused, an individual will always choose abusive relationships, which I find extremely untrue.

I think that this will be a good book for her to read when she starts reading on her own due to the small length of the book and the short sentences on each page. The book is a hardback, however it is not the most sturdy hardback we have and appears that it would fold and possibly rip if you have a child who is hard on books."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate!","review":"There are a number of good method books for the jazz bassist these days- I must own at least a dozen! But Hungerford's book is one of the best. Unlike some authors, Hungerford doesn't start you off playing root-root-root or root-fifth-root-fifth. He assumes you want to learn to play real bass lines, and that's exactly what he gives you. From the beginning he has the reader building lines with roots, 3rds, 5th, 6ths and 7ths; from there, he moves quickly into I-IVs, rhythm changes and II-V-Is in various keys. There's also an accompanying CD to provide rhythmic and harmonic accomaniment to the excercises.The second half of the book takes the reader through a number of standard tunes, some with bass lines written out and some provided for the reader to write their own lines using the guidelines given. There's a lot of information packed into less than 100 pages here, and a diligent player will find all they need for a solid progam of jazz education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful/Practical Approach","review":"Let me qualify this by saying I am not a bass player, nor do I aspire to be. I do however have a need to record credible basslines for my guitar soloing. In that regard, this book fits like a glove. There is no unnecessary theory or confusing sidetracks to the goal of playing credible jazz basslines. The book is easy to read,(spiral bound so it opens completely), with large notes. Each jazz standard offers a different lesson which is an ingeniously effective device. This book would have gotten 5 stars from me if it weren't for the small number of typos I found. Most of these are obvious,(page 23, 1st note under a B flat major 7th chord is obviously not going to be a B natural) but perhaps I'm being too hard on the book. It's been said that any fool can make a complex subject complex but it takes a genious to make the complex simple. This is probably the only book on bass guitar I will ever need for my purposes and so I thank you Jay for that !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant, Informed Analysis","review":"In a small package, Vidler has written an analysis - - not merely an overview - - of reactions by the Christian Churches to moderrnity and its discontents from the French Revolution to Vatican II. This is a deceptively small book for it is dense, deep, and highly informed. It may even be too concise for the casual reader; I read it with an abundance of other source materials.

Add some lyrics by Donald Fagen to After the Storm and The Story Teller and there would be a pair of solid Steely Dan-styled songs.Ponty continues to shape his sound through the musicians on tour and in the studio, though his distinctive artistry on violin remains absolutely phenomenal. This auto did not leave heavy tire tracks in the Motor City, but showed style by gliding along like a well-manufactured luxury ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible drumming","review":"The drummer on this CD, Michael Barsimanto, is much better when playing rock music. He seems to not know the music very well here, also. His playing is very sloppy, especially when he tries to use fills to accent the solos, often ending before the beat. Very sloppy indeed. I find this album hard to listen to for this reason especially, but also for the terrible mix. The drums are too loud in the mix, and the audience sounds as if it were added in later.Ponty's solos seem tired on this CD. The only standout soloist is Jamie Glaser this time around. Chris Rhyne (on keys) doesn't even sound like the Chris Rhyne of old - he just goes through the motions, playing forgettable jazz cliches on piano.I love Ponty's output - except for this one. Much better is his first live album for Atlantic - simply titled, \\"Live\\".

And I would recommend it to you if you think it is pretty, you need a silver every day kind of necklace and you are going to be wearing it yourself. Unfortunately, as a gift, it just comes across as a cheap necklace - when you hold it in your hand the medallion and the chain make a tin-like sound against each other and the under-side of the medallion is hollow and not smooth.

Theses Swedish metal masterminds (boasting members from Darkane and the aforementioned Soilwork) have crafted some brilliantly heavy thrash metal. With their catchy and heavy metal licks and Swedish roots, this band really stands out when listening to the record. By chosing not to follow the rest of the crowd and rehashing every Swedish metal cliche known to man, it makes 'Karma in Black' a solid metal release. The whole album gets more enjoyable with every listen, often digging up more death inspired roots in the tracks. Highlights include \\"Once in Between', 'Exit Body on Mass', and 'The Fading Suns'. If Soilwork has gotten a bit stale for your taste and the likes of Omnium Gathering seem a tad too extreme, then satisfy your thirst for Swedish thrash with this great release from a great and promising band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"This brand is rather cheap, however it isn't expensive so I shouldn't be surprised.

I would love to know if anyone else has heard about this book being a \\"fraud\\"?Regardless, the 560+ page book is a long, and at times, a somewhat laborious read. I kept reading because he had SO much to say. The difficulty in reading this huge diary is his way of writing: He isn't a fluid diarist and it is all a bit choppy; however, I just couldn't put the ... thing down!

But once I started reading, I became drawn into his life, attentively reading until the end. Many insights into Nazism, but more just very human- probably how many of us would react. Every page true, because it was written only for himself. The astounding thing is that it went on for years and years, though even his earliest entries indicate many people knew of the insanity. It must be horrible to love your country, as he loved the German culture, but want its defeat. Where was the rest of the world? At what point should other nations concern themselves with how a country treats its own citizens? The segment on his short isolation in 1941 is as well written as Kafka. Yes, others suffered or witnessed more, but no other record is as full of insights. Is this why he survived?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"And I will get the other years of this author's diary. This is not a fast paced WWII battle book; this is the diary of a poor soul who had to live through every moment of a terrible regime, to endure even more when he thought he'd reached his limit. If you're interested in what it was like to live day to day in Hitler's Germany (as a Jew or a gentile)--to understand what it was like to watch it begin and grow and eventually implode--this is an excellent read.

In addition to the atrocities we're familiar with, Mr. Klemperer kept detailed accounts of daily life for Jews. For example, Jews could not buy flowers, ride bikes or enter subways. He describes the hard labor he was forced to perform, in spite of the fact that he suffered from a heart ailment. His diary also details the many kindnesses performed by German citizens, pointing out that there always remain some good folks among the bad. This book of over 550 pages takes some time to read.

This is all \\"blond-hair-blue eye-short-upper-lip\\" Anglosaxon ... There is no such thing as \\"objectively good\\" path of development. When will the scholars finally learn that? The authors should read Polanyi again or something.Second, there is no account of how STRUCTURE influences CULTURE and cultural perception of the structure. The authors show only one way causality, and I think they did it on purpose and are fully aware of it. But to say that culture matter is exactly 50% of the story. Where is the rest 50%?

While its nice to know the foreign policy elite are ready to think about culture as more than \`western civilization,' it turns out that this allows them to blame all poverty on the malformed and defective cultures of underdeveloped countries. It's as if the \`culture of poverty' debate never took place. Most anthropologists will grind away several millimeters of tooth enamel while reading this. Why do economists and political scientists feel like they don't have to read the work of people who have devoted their lives to studying cultural difference?"},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"Short and sweet:Read this if: 1) you want to understand the mindset that creates a foreign policy that makes other countries think the US is arrogant; 2) you can abstract from the ethnocentrism and think about the importance of institutions in the context of capitalism. Don't read this if: 1) you are likely to be bothered by the lack of attention to history -- this text ignores studies that tie the very progress and institutions they are discussing to colonial legacies; 2) you won't appreciate the overview of value systems around the world (which is very helpful) because it relies on homogenizing cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Peter Aughton's version of Cook's second world voyage is an invigorating, concise glimpse into this 18th century nautical genius.With sails fully open, the author takes us aboard the \\"Resolution\\" and its sister ship the \\"Adventure\\" below the Antarctic Circle, to New Zealand, several South Pacific islands including Tahiti, the Society and Friendly Islands and New Hebrides while all the time mapping, charting and adding valuable scientific data.Although many of the places during Cook's second voyage had been discovered earlier, his main purpose was to locate them specifically by longitude and latitude, which he did. At the time he journeyed further south than any explorer had before him.

Unfortunately I found it too late as I needed it a while back. The features of this crate make it my favorite, if a dog has an accident taking it apart is so easy and then it just washes up. It makes it so much easier than dealing with the screws. I am having a new dog shipped and asked the breeder in Germany to send him with one of these crates. The nice thing is now they come with wheels to make it mobile. For ease of use and durability I highly recommend this crate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Value","review":"The value for this product is much less then sale price. Amazon needs to regulate pricing better. For the price charged I expected the crate to be perfect and above other crates.

It's gameplay is impeccable, there are plenty of characters, each with their \\"secret combinations\\" of teams, hidden, or obvious. Heroes mode would be considered the \\"main\\" mode, as it is the first mode you see when you first enter the game. Promotion test would be the next best thing, it is a great way to get more parameter points for your characters. Versus computer I would say is the least favorable section of all. In this mode, you gain a meager 10 parameter points, and 2 gold scrolls. I believe that they could have been more generous and give AT LEAST 50 points per battle, which is why I never use vs. comp, I use heroes mode. The wireless mode is a good way to battle friends and what-not, and finally the parameter power up is the most useful part of the game. All in all, this game is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best naruto game out there!","review":"I've played a bunch of naruto games and this is, by really far, the best one.

If so, hopefully Universal will respond and correct this issue soon.Discs #1 and #2 seem to work perfectly.It might be sensible, for those trying to defend Universal, to investigate the mastering instead of simply assuming DVD player incompatibility.

Don't be fooled -- this is the best the episodes have ever looked and sounded.What's rotten is everything else. No extras. Cheap disks. No pilot.

The lever gears are loose, so you don't get much control over the ball's movement.The wood is cheap and not properly sanded. To make it worse, there are residual dried glue marks near all the barriers. These two factors create speed bumps which reduces your control of the ball even more.The ball is too small and light, and the holes are too big.Finally, as another reviewer pointed out, the exit hole on the side where you're supposed to get the ball out is way too high.

I would rank it the fourth best among the 15 or so I have heard (1st is Chariots of Fire, 2nd El Greco, 3rd Antarctica, and 4th Oceanic. The worst is Heaven and Hell.) Oceanic is about the ocean, naturally. It lacks 'powerful' tracks like some found on Direct, but if you are after tranquil, relaxing music, Oceanic is the word. Extraordinary peace-bringing sweet melodies, ample sounds of the sea and the surf and the sea birds. Takes you virtually out in the ocean.

It was written with the language teacher in mind. Many of the other books on the subject are focused on the researcher rather than the teacher, so this book fills a gap in the literature. The explanations of the major theories are carried out without frequent use of jargon, so it's easy for the beginner to get a handle on SLA theory. I even recommend this for students who are studying SLA in graduate school. This will provide an excellent introduction that could be read before reading more difficult texts. After readinging \\"How Languages Are Learned\\", you'll understand more in depth discussions about the theories covered. A must for all practicing language teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to language learning theory","review":"For language teachers.

The listing specifically mentions the \\"optional cover\\" for THE CONTAINER, which you can buy separately.When these arrived, all I received was THE LID.Yes, the word \\"lid\\" is mentioned in the title. But 99% of the listing is selling/advertising THE CONTAINER.Very unhappy with this experience. Extremely poor and confusing advertising.

I bought a demo model for under $500 which makes is a real bargain. It runs warm but not hot to the touch. It sounds very dynamic and clean, I can't detect any kind of coloration from the amp. If anything it's too transparent because it will make bad sources sound as they are: bad. I haven't tried it with any big speakers to see how well the bottom end hits, but the top end seems real good. Very dynamic for movies with my Atlantic Tech. System 270 THX Select speakers. The retail prices are a bit high, for $1200 I'd probably prefer other amps such at Outlaw's Model 750 for $1099 or others from Parasound, B&K or Rotel. But if you can find a decent price on this amp it is a high quality product. It could easily meet THX Ultra specs for power and performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work!","review":"Sorry, it just doesn't work!

I like the camp mockery and the names of the bands and the tunes. Satan's Pilgrims? Mummy Walk? Awesome. The 3D graphics on the cover are what you are paying a little extra for, it's worth a chuckle, especially if you get a tiny pair of 3d glasses in the Case.

I am a Democrat who doesn't like Doonesbury, which is often hailed as the Sacred Cow of Comic Strips.There was a time when I thought a big drawback to being famous was being lampooned in Doonesbury. I felt sorry for Trudeau's roommate, the Pillsbury heir who inspired this strip.

This volume begins with some fragments of ancient Oriental and Greek music and then moves to medieval music and that of the Renaissance.The examples are quite diverse, and while there are samples of the ancient notation, most of the pieces are provided in modern notation for ease of understanding by students. There is a nice balance of instrumental and vocal music, of sacred and secular music, and of various geographical locals and different times over the centuries.There is commentary on the pieces in the back along with translations of the texts into English.

In the US, this led in some regions to a decayed inner city, abut against a prosperous business district, while the suburbs boomed.The book has a strong statistical bent. Numerous tables that document such things as relative per capita income of suburbs. These are used to buttress observations in the text. Plus, the book also speculates on future trends. Like perhaps a re-favouring of the inner city urban regions? Or of old suburbs. In part motivated by a relative cheapness of housing in those areas, compared to well-to-do suburbs that might have priced themselves out of affordability for much of the workforce."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLANNING","review":"Haven't read it yet, part of a required planning course.

I realize that Tina feels very strongly about these dogs, but she choose to write a book about herself and the drama of her life instead of about Shiloh Shepherds. For $75 I expected beautiful pictures and much more information on the lineage of these dogs.

This is one of my favorite CDs in my collection. 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xymox at their Finest","review":"All I can say is....what a relief from the \\"original\\" Xymox! I'm glad that 1) they reinstated their name and 2) they are exploring a new field in the genre of Goth/Darkwave, even incorporating a little Electronica into the mix. Simply fantastic. All of these songs should be club hits. It's terribly sad that they haven't gotten enough exposure here in the U.S. Oh, and speaking of new genres, I took a look at the other reviews regarding this album, and the one thing none of those reviews mentioned is this......\\"Wild is the Wind\\" = DAVID BOWIE! Yes, you heard right. Xymox (sorry, CLAN of Xymox) did a cover of a David Bowie song. And what a rendition it is! Superbly done! I'm not usually a fan of David Bowie covers, but Xymox pulled it off extremely well. This just goes to show where their roots are. I'm glad to see that they have an excellent musical background, which is clearly apparent in their experimental styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Unlike their truly wonderful album \\"Twist of Shadows,\\" this follow-up release, after their departure from big-label status, \\"Headclowds\\" is an utter disappointment, and is not worth buying. As creative, entertaining, and thought-provoking as \\"Twist of Shadows\\" is, this release is as much the complete opposite. With the exception of maybe one track, it is dull, uninspiring, and very much boringly generic......as if your nextdoor neighbor decided to create a techno-alternative album, but had not yet learned to play any instruments and lacked any creativity. To make a long story short, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. First of all, if you don't know the meaning of what I call hundred-dollar words this is a waste of time. The only reason I bought it was that it was required reading for a class I was taking. The author uses many many quotes from other sources and inserts their opinion. Its not a pleasant read. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Versions.","review":"When you end up playing out all your peter murphy cd's because you love the songs so much, this is a nice fresh listen to different versions of his classic hits. \\"live recording\\" are what they are. I think its more about the content then the quality though. Its a perfect cd to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goth Cheese","review":"Peter Murphy, solo, is a progenitor of a particularly heady brand of Goth cheese. Sickly thin, with a piercing stare and birdlike movements, he's a mesmerizing live performer even though he comes across as a cut-rate Bowie. Compelling as he is, he has a three note range (when he wants a bit of drama he hits his high end and, well, screams) and a ponderously opaque song catalogue. There's no meaning; just ambient surface and atmosphere. When his band is rocking the New Age, though, this rarely matters, which is why aLive Just for Love is such a disappointment. These stripped-down, Unplugged versions of his songs need all the accoutrements they can get. Many of these tunes are mid-tempo beauties in their studio versions - \\"Indigo Eyes\\", \\"Marlene Dietrich's Favourite Poem\\" - where they are densely layered with guitars and viola, percussion and keyboards - but they need their surface density to breathe. Here, they're skimpy, and expose Murphy's vocal shortcomings more than they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"i killed mister moonlight","review":"a showcase for the deep haunting voice of Mr. Murphy. the song's arrangements are sparse and spare and it works as a beautiful minimal piece of recorded live music. the sound quality is pristine and the song selection is superb. a cool document for his fans and the bonus disc should thrill all the bauhaus enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why people get \\"Tough Guys\\" and not \\"Tough Guise\\"","review":"I also have been searching for a way to purchase \\"Tough Guise.\\" That film, however, is technically unavailable for individual purchase. On two websites I have searched that exhibit documentary, social awareness, etc. films, Jackson Katz's \\"Tough Guise\\" is only available for those purchasing from a high school or other institution. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Guys","review":"Hi: I twice ordered the film \\"Tough Guise\\" not \\"Tough Guys\\" and on both occasions I was sent the latter. I am not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for your range bag.","review":"I have this kit in my range bag. It doesn't take up much room and although you don't usually clean your gun at the range. I like to have something that I could use in a pinch. I have these in a couple of other calibers. Nice little kit for handguns. The extensions are metal not plastic. I didn't know that when I purchased the kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a terrible and un-objective book!If anyone here is actually interested in reading a mostly fair and balanced book on Kim, I suggest you read Dae sook Suh's work on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with pendant","review":"It was much smaller that I anticipated. So small can't see guardian angel on pendant. Very disappointed. The pendant had to be magnified to be able to take a picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but beautiful","review":"This was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, even for a child's necklace. It's beautiful, though, and my great niece was very happy with it when she opened it on Christmas Eve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss leading on how big the pendent really is","review":"From the way the pic look i thought that the pendent was going to be much bigger then a dime if not infact smaller tham a dime"},{"rating":"1","title":"i got the box but nothing in it!!!","review":"i was buying this as a gift for my youngest sister and i had it sent to my mothers house. when the box came i was so excited to give her the necklace, but when i opened the package and then the jewelry box it was EMPTY!!!!! i felt so ripped off and my little sister was heart broken because she got all excited. it felt like a bad joke or something. please take it from me and do not purchase this necklace because you won't get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tips for busy cooks!","review":"I really like this book! I tend to make up my own recipes, sometimes beginning with someone else's or just from scratch. This book gives me great ideas for the right spices to add. I especially like the \\"Foods and flavorings that go with them\\" section for those times when I know the disk needs something, but I'm just not quite sure what. The historical remedies and folklore/history on each spice is also very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to Joy of Cooking","review":"I've cooked for many years, professionally for a while, and didn't fully understand the hows and whys of spices. Linda has put together a cooks resource that should be in every kitchen. Put a lot of spice in your life and cooking, and do it most effectively with this guide. Be sure to get the spiral version...it works best on the kitchen counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quick reference book","review":"I saw this book on display at a cooking store and thought it would be good to add to my collection for two reasons. (1) I was making a career change and going to culinary school, and (2) it looked like an all-around good reference. Since buying it I've taken a quick peak at it whenever I prepare something (or eat something) new. It's got just about everything, including things other than spices, like meats and pastas. My only issue with it is the descriptions are very brief. Overall, it's been helpful as a reference for things I haven't worked with before, and how to pair them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The key to understanding the economics of any business!","review":"This book is very unique by its very applicability across businesses and across time. The focus of the book is to explain the economic realities behind business decisions and explain how to go about systematically analyzing your your business result areas, the inferences to draw upon, and the strategies to plan and implement.The real force of this book becomes apparent by the very applicability of it in today's scenario of great economic and social change. Concepts like the result areas of business, and managing knowledge as the ONLY crucial economic resource of an organization are most relevant today. The book also explicitly details strategies that can be developed depending on each individual organization in times of change.This book is a great asset to every manager! I recommend it as one of the best and most comprehensive books on business analysis and strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This relates good basic, but not necessarily obvious rules for getting results. There is some overlap with other Drucker books. But his stuff is worth reading twice, so I'm not complaining. He does seem to contradict himself, however, when he writes that what he's relating can be learned by most anyone. Then elsewhere he relates how \\"generals\\" are quite rare, suggesting leaders are born, not made. So, I'm not quite sure what to think of his take on that. But otherwise, he is the management guru of our time, and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sounding Xylophone","review":"We bought this for supervised music time for our 12 month old. I would not recommend for a younger child to play with on their own as the keys are removable and the plastic sticks could be dangerous too. That being said my husband and I love, love, love this glockenspiel! It has crisp, honest sounding notes. It can get loud when hit with force, but what fun is music time if it's quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Toy","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. The tone quality is excellent and we can actually teach our son songs. We bought it as an aid to make sure his hearing is okay but really happy it is not tinny and keeps great tone. If you don't want the sound to resonate then you just touch the keys to stop the sound. The base is plasticwhich I thought was wood, but still a very good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily comes apart.","review":"The metal bars come off the pins very easily and can easily be lost! I'm afraid the plastic buttons that the metal notes attach to will easily become loose and break off. Would not purchase again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Bought It!","review":"As with the film, the attempt here is to spoof sci-fi works of the 50s and 60s. This CD is a lot of fun. I love that leitmotif--that tadataDA tadataDA march of quasi war music which is played in a few of these tracks. Ungodly Experiments is my favorite and I wish there were more of those tracks of electronic space music, heavy on the thermin. Then at the end, there is a tune of Slim Whitman whom I only recognize from late night informercials, but the song is really campy and cute. First I thought it was a Hawaiian love song, then realized it must be along the line of an old cowboy song. The CD finishes with Tom Jones belting out in his sexiest lounge lizard style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Repetitive","review":"I agree that the mood created by Elfman's score is suitably eerie and alien-like, but for an album the music is not so effective. The tracks become far to similar to one another, although the main melody - the opening tracks - is really memorable, and, dare I say it, Jones' Not Unusual is actually pretty brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working for the U.S Government Overseas","review":"The U.S. Goverment is the largest employer of American citizens overseas.They work in various occupations. Finding the right job begins with this book. This is guide to a variety of agencies which actually shows job vacancy listings. It tells how to apply for these jobs and who to contact. This book is for you whether you are a recent graduate or a mid-level job hunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistently, Persuasively, Boring","review":"The only reason I suffered through this tedious tome was because it was sent to me. Tedious to the nth degree, the self absorbed lives don't deserve to be memorialized in a book. The writing is stilted and stiff and repetitious. Short little sentences describing every boring nuance of lives that move slower than molasses. Dysfunctional families breeding emotionally crippled adults - how original?The most positive thing I can say about the book is that I enjoyed the cover art and the original title. However, the story is devoid of passion, joy and faith and is one of the most tedious things I have read in ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-crafted, memorable characters","review":"The Inexquisite Eye is a wonderful reading experience. The novel's characters are well-crafted. They are memorable for a couple of reasons. Each character's personality is convincingly described. The reader sees their gestures, hears their conversations, and feels the psychological tensions among them. Elissa's quirky behavior surprises and intrigues. It is fascinating to see Elissa aggressively marching into every personal encounter and then folding emotionally when her high standards and values imprison her from finding satisfaction. Elissa and Warren will linger in the reader's memory long after the last page has been read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inexquisite Eye","review":"This books sets you to thinking; -thinking specifically about Elissa, but more generally about perceptions of what is real. Elissa sees many things with incredible sharpness, and other things she misses entirely. Where her sense of reality leads her is compelling, unpredictable, and sometimes wrenching. It is an engrossing tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inexquisite Eye","review":"For me, Warren is the most appealing character in the book. I can understand the logic of his emotions and actions. His patience, in light of Elissa's stubborn quirks and inconsistencies (think of the tea incident during their last fight!) is nothing short of saintly. I would have throttled her.Elissa, on the other hand, is a fascinating, frustrating character who absolutely confounds me. I've known people like her-highly intelligent, highly capable in technical ways, yet somehow increasingly paralyzed when faced with decisions that impact their own lives. It seems to me that, rather than ceasing to compromise decisions as she aims to do, Elissa simply ceases to make decisions at all.The Inexquisite Eye is fabulous. It's not an easy book, just as Elissa isn't an easy character, but it's worth the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product, bad price on Amazon.","review":"Amazon's website states the retail price of this product is $29.99 making their price appear to be a deal which is not true. This same product is $24.99 retail and another major retailer and they have instore coupons which bring the price down 20%.The product itself is pretty cheap and I am mad at myself for trying to save $10 each as I think the In-Tension rods at $35 each are a FAR better product. This would be fine for curtains that you rarely use but if you're looking for something that will last I would suggest going with a higher quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wanted a black decorative tension rod. Well. This isn't it.It was not advertised as a twist and turn rod. Maybe I should have known that from the picture. Anyway, it does not stay up on a smooth painted surface. My curtains are extremely light. Yet, the minute I twisted this thing on, and hung the curtains, it immediately untwisted itself and fell to the floor. It took with it some of the paint from my wall.It is also cheap looking. Now I have to go through the inconvenience and expense of returning it. Not to mention having to spot paint my wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, Too Thin, Lasted Only 10 Months","review":"The photo of this shower curtain rod looks nice. My shower is only 58\\" wide, and this rod barely works. 10 months later, it was warped and rusted and needed to be replaced. The rod is only 1/2\\" diameter at the THICK end, 3/8\\" diameter at the thin end. Not thick enough to support most standard shower curtains. You need a thicker rod (1\\" diameter) than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls often","review":"I have been using this curtain rod for about a month now, and it has fallen down more than five times. Having to re-install it every week gets frustrating very quickly. It would probably get the job done for a curtain that you do not touch or move very often, but if you will be opening and closing the curtain on a daily basis you should expect this rod to come crashing down on your head more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth wasting your time on","review":"I was truly happy that I found the right size shower rod when I found this one on Amazon. It looked nice when I received it and was happy with it for about 3 months. Now it's a battle with rust and it not staying up...falls about every 3 days. I'm now looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice-looking tension rod, performs well--exactly what I wanted","review":"I got this to use as a shower curtain rod and it has been a really attractive addition to our bathroom. It seems to be quite strong because we use a cotton shower curtain with no liner, so it gets very wet and heavy, but we haven't had any problems with slipping. I am also happy to report that it shows no signs of corrosion after a year of being in a wet environment. I'm very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little more than I wanted for my not yet 4 year old","review":"Prior to this we have been a PBS, Elmo, Dora and Mickey Mouse watching family - which is important to keep in mind as my frame of reference. Although my son is completely satisfied with this CD, I wasn't prepared for the hard-rockin' theme song, action packed adventures and loud sound effects. There's something about the sound effects and villains that makes our 2 year old cry. If I had my choice, I would probably wait a few more years before getting this for my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero Up!","review":"This show is great for small kids who love superheroes! Our son is a long time fan of several Marvel characters and this show makesthem more accessible for small children. The adventures are cute and very funny, even for parents who like comics! If you canaccept that the characters are obviously going to be more friendly and gentled-down for kids, then the show is a fun way to sharetv time with your little hero.I was disappointed that there were only 7 episodes on the dvd however. We are looking forward to more volumes. Be warned tho, the theme song is VERY catchy, written by former Nerfherder headman Parry Gripp and you'll soon be singing it with your little hero inthe car when you're driving around.Hero UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reach....","review":"With this type of actor, or with almost any type of actor, it's better to view the material as opposed to reading it.

Its to Southside and the Jukes credit that they came out full throttle, with a take-no-prisoners attack on this record. From the opening \\"All I Want Is Everything\\", to the closer \\"Vertigo\\", this disc just keeps you moving. Even the slower numbers like \\"Security\\" and \\"The Time\\" have killer bass lines, and a great funk/blues rhythm that just won't quit. All the songs were either written or co-written by Southside Johnny and Billy Rush, and to their credit, they manage fine without Miami Steve Van Zandt. Leaving the CBS stable (along with the Springsteen/Van Zandt baggage) couldn't have been easy, but the boys managed to pull off a winner all by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Not His Greatest","review":"After losing Steve Van Zandt as songwriter, Billy Rush stepped in and wrote this and the next album. It's slightly schizophrenic as the words are in a more modern style while the tunes and arrangements remain fixed mainly in the R&B style that SSJ married to rock on Hearts of Stone. So if you're paying a lot of attention to the lyrics it can be awkward at times, but if you're just letting it rock you then it's got the same energy and verve as his other best works. If nothing else, buy it for the song \\"Time\\", with its loping bass, snaky groove in the verses and tight horn arrangement in the chorus. Billy Rush upped the amount of guitars on this and the next album (Love Is A Sacrifice), bringing it more into the 70s and 80s than the first three albums and it works really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Recieved What I Ordered","review":"I ordered Bayou Classic 7408 Set of Six Fajita Pans, with Wooden Trays and Mitts I only recieved 1.

But your level of loud may be different...I like to put them on high when I'm not in the area/room and then set them on auto. The features are great, the auto setting does work when it should, amazing. I am still suprised at how well they clean the air. Cooking fried chicken stovetop always left a greasy smell which I found unpleasant..the unit works like magic (now we eat more fried chicken which probably isn't good! :) The unit picks up animal fur too, the filter easy to clean. I looked around and researched for a while before deciding on this unit, and am very glad I purchased. The price with the $25 off 125, can't be beat.

This is the second Mont Blanc fountain pen I have purchased and the enjoyment of such a writing instrument continues to grow.

The first reason was because I am a fan of the television show. The second was because I was curious of the musical connections Paul Reiser would make to market this show. I found some new artists on this soundtrack that I had never heard of, and I enjoyed those that I've loved for years (Sarah McLachlan, Anita Baker, John Lennon). However, there were some odd choices that made this soundtrack more about having a baby than it did about Paul and Jamie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be 5 stars without the dialogue","review":"I don't know what they were thinking.

Her music and voice transcend words, and hit one on a visceral level. Regardless of the mood she is trying to evoke in any individual song, she achieves it in spades. Whether she is aiming at subtle longing in \\"Over The Rainbow\\" or triumphant female pride in \\"I Want More\\" or \\"Big Time\\", you are there with her every inch of the way. And, if for no other reason, \\"Man of La Mancha\\" is worth every penny of the $15! You truly will not believe this rendition. All I can say is thank god the summer is over and I can roll the windows up in my car. I can't tell you how many times I have been gawked at by fellow drivers, as they pass my car, and hear and see me singing along to this rousing rendition. Both this song and Linda's performance thoughout the CD are viagra for the soul! Truly life-affirming."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"What an incredible voice - so emotionally penetrating it demands absolute quiet around us so we can capture the pure essence of every nuance of the sound she delivers. And yet, such a waste of talent to be relegated entirely to the \\"Pop,\\" genre. Her voice should be allowed to find expression in the kind of music that is intensely romantic, that haunts the soul, that evokes the subtle, deep, and often fleeting feelings that \\"Pop,\\" never seems to reach. She should cross over now and sing to the millions of us who are more moved by a sweet, passionate, honest, melodie that speaks directly to the heart, than just \\"beat\\" or the delivery of some lyrical \\"message.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is easy listening.","review":"This woman has such talent - right on pitch, good expression, excellent breath control, a rapport with her background musicians, and really understands wht the lyricist meant - plus one can understand every word - something refreshing today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice, Wonderful Album","review":"\\"It's Time\\" is an absolutely wonderful album. Ms. Eder's voice floats amd soars on every note. Her range is simply phenomenal and the power, support and energy she seemingly pours into every song is something to be envied. As a studier of voice, I know just how difficult it is to perfect such skills and with such ease. This is a marvelous and thouroughly enjoyable album and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gobble This One Up, Folks!","review":"Most standing ovations are gratuitous and undeserved, but not the three that Linda Eder received at last evening's performance in Chicago. Eder is phenomenal. A rising star. Although I was in row \\"X\\", I felt as if she was signing every song only to me. Streisand without the attitude. Garland without the mess. This woman is a powerhouse who will hopefully be filling our world with song for years to come. Her voice simply leaves you begging for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Time","review":"Just happened to have caught Linda Eder on a special TV show. We were smitten by her talent.We purchased It's Time and now play it constantly and have shared it with other friends who have now purchased their own copy. Do yourself a favor, and get this CD. It is absolutely incredible. Linda Eder is an incredible talent! How anyone can pan this CD is beyond me. I am not a musician but I do own alot of CDs and this is a good as it gets. There is absolutely not a better singer in the world than this lady. Our 10 year daughter even loves this voice and delivery. Believe me, this is a great CD.

While her voice suits the Broadway stage, it lacks popular appeal - this voice is not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great new talent","review":"After hearing about Linda from friends and published material, I was really excited about buying one of her cds. Well, I have bought one of her cds and I have come away with mix emotions. As far as talent, I think she definately has that, but that's only half of the equation. The other half is material to perform and the lush arrangements that go with it. In Lindas'case she came up short on the second half of the formula.Linda it seems used primarly comtempory music, which I think was a mistake. As one might guess, the new comtempory music we hear today, doesn't have a very strong melody line. After most people hear this music a time or two, they can't recall the melody at all.For future projects, I think it would be in Lindas' best interest to record the old standards from Broadway. I think this would propel her career to an even higher level.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Talent and Presence/lousy material","review":"This seconds another review on here. Linda Eder has a phenomenal,powerful, beautiful voice. Unfortunately, love is blind (or deaf in this case). She sings her husbands songs and he writes very mediocre material. She shines on songs like Man of La Mancha filled with passion and soul-his material is uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, lousy material","review":"Having just been blown away by Ms. Eder on a PBS special, I was eager to listen to one of her albums. I was disappointed, unfortunately, with \\"It's Time.\\" Having the composer Frank Wildhorn for a husband has, in my opinion, acted as both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it has provided her with an instant audience, a curse because she's saddled with too much of his under par material. I'm sure Ms. Eder would disagree with me, but it's my review! Even Streisand (whose voice Ms. Eder's resembles at times) recorded mostly standards on her first three albums; only after did she begin slipping in new material.

If you don't mind reading the truth about what gun-slinging was really like in the old west then you will not be disappointed. Written as excerpts from a journal, it is fascinating to follow the evolution of the psyche of Clay Halser from the Civil War to his 'appointment in Samara' somewhere in the mountains of Colorado. It could be as good a movie a 3:10 to Yuma ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel, not just a great Western.","review":"This is the first book I've read by the author and won't be my last. It was much more than I expected from a novel set in the old west. It's written as though you are reading a gunfighter's personal journal, edited and published by a reporter after his death. It's an interesting look at how a life of fame and violence can affect a person on the inside. We all know the legends of Wyatt Earp and Bill Hikock, but what might actually have been going through their minds as they went through life as a tough-as-nails frontier lawman? There's plenty of action and Western drama to satisfy fans of that genre, but there's more depth here than some other novels might offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the audio version","review":"Stefan Rudnicki, the reader, will drive you batty.He reads each word in a boring dull monotone with absolutely no emotion or change of inflection.

These guys aren't afraid to letyou know who they're influences are.

The remixes are definitively superior.Ever since the release of the \\"Machine Head 25th\\", the 2nd remix CD took its place in the front spindle of my double CD jewel case; I have never listened to the original album CD since.It would have been a truly wonderful experience to give the fans the same option with this version.Since there are only four more tracks to remix, perhaps there's some hope in the future for such a set?

Sure they sound pretty good if all you're used to is Walmart off-brands like Durabrand, but there are far better products out there at the same pricepoint. All they do is take mediocre components and hype the living daylights out of them, as well as get them into mass market chains like Best Buy where the average Uninformed Naive Joe Consumer strolls in about to be royally fleeced. Joe thinks he's buying \\"High End\\" when in fact it's really Low End...only with a High End PRICETAG.You don't need to take my word for it, just go to Internet audio forums likeI'd recommend the Logitech Z-2200/Z-2300 instead, which goes for half to one-third (if you buy it with a rebate) [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK sound, poor quality of materials","review":"This is one of those products you really don't know what your getting. I found this out after a failure of the Companion 3's. A lightning strike took out the Companion 3's. So I decided to take them apart. Boy, what a eye opener! Being a amateur audiophile since I could read the title on a record album. I was sorely disappointed in the Bass driver which was made of a paper composite and a foam surround. Not what I expected from $250 speakers! The desktop speakers were the same cheap quality. Actually I was surprised considering the Bose do sound pretty good. But for a company who keeps specifications secret and glue's enclosures so you cannot see speaker's. I can only wonder what Bose is trying to do? I have to say from what I have seen of their quality.

Unless I can verify I am actually getting something for my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky","review":"I see some reviews that knock the audio quality, but nobody has taken the time to complain about the quirky volume control. The volume knob lets a considerable amount of sound through even when it's turned all the way down, so I'm constantly fiddling with the computer's volume as I toggle between very loud and very quiet. Also, twisting the volume knob up from the \\"off\\" position has no effect until about 10 degrees of rotation.

The bass are absolutely fantastic, and if you want to improve them just place the subwoofer 5\\" far in front of wall, it's when you say Wow!. Satellites are very small, nicely designed and you won't ever understand how something so SMALL sounds that BIG. Volume level was lower than I expected, but the guilty guy was my Toshiba laptop's sound card, so I had to upgrade it with a cool pcmcia Creative Audigy 2 ZS. Now, that's sound !I use these sound system primary to enjoy karaoke music at my parties with family and friends (lot of people!), this is why it was an important point a higher sound level.

It wasn't even close. The Logitech effortlessly DEMOLISHED the Bose in every relevant accoustic department: accurate bass, deep bass, full midrange, defined but not harsh treble, low distortion at near-maximum volume...it was no contest!And the kicker is, the Bose is over twice the price! Needless to say I sent that hunka junk straight back where it came from.Looking at Eduardo's review history and James Bond Israel's review history, it is obvious that JBI is a Bose employee, or depends on selling Bose products to put food on his table.

The speakers take up virtually no space plus the bass unit is super efficient for its size. The hockey puck is not only cool but functional.

It sounds like what it is: Two tiny speakers and a disproportionately huge woofer. There are no mids whatsoever. In fact, there's almost a mental disconnect between the shrill highs coming from the little speakers and the muffled thump coming from the woofer. It's like playing the music out of way-cranked-up headphones as they sit on your desk and in the background your neighbor is cranking the bass on a huge stereo. With all this said, it's probably fine - and even exciting - for gaming. But if you're interested in this for music, look elsewhere.

It contains a clear plan to create the kind of relationship I want with my animals. It is very sensitive to natural camelid behaviour and works with these instincts which I feel has to create a more harmonious bond. I especially like that the emphasis is on handling rather than training as your animals don't differentiate between the two and most of the time spent with them is day to day handling tasks. I believe that a lot of established owners could learn from this book, maybe my animals wouldn't have come to me as fearful and nervous if their previous owner had worked through this book. Any book on handling/training is not a strict manual, you have to take the bits that work for you and create your own plan.

That in a nutshell is the premise for the series. These aren't the best movies story or continuity-wise(each movie has a new origin story for the dead)they are however fun to watch. The boxed set has been painstakingly remastered, and the picture and sound are quite amazing. So if you are a fan of zombie or schlocky movies do yourself a favor and get this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over-rated.","review":"I read so much about how \\"creepy\\" these Holy Grail of movies were. Luckily, I did not buy the set. I rented it from a local store in Philadelphia. I suggest renting them before making a purchase. I thought these movies were extremely dull, and not in the least frightening. Tombs is the best of the four movies. But, it is really all downhill to the end. Unless you're a Blind Dead fanboy, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom of the Dumb Dead","review":"Amando de Ossorio was an awful director. He was incapable of actually frightening any viewer in all of his films. They are dull, meandering and padded down with either half naked waifs or lethargic scenes of zombie-like blind Templar knights. I watched all The Blind Dead Collection and all of them stunk. No horror, no creepy atmosphere, no character sequences, nothing. I found them to be boring and not worth the amount I spent on the crappy cardboard tomb box.My Collection included:Tombs of the Blind Dead (1971)Return of the Blind Dead (1973)Night of the Sorcerers (1973)The Lorelei's Grasp (1974)The Ghost Galleon (1974)Night of the Seagulls (1975)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened.","review":"I emailed the owner of this product and specifically asked, \\"Does this read military IDs?\\" the person responded with a yes. I bought it. Then I thought, I should've asked the company. I called the company. Nope, this doesn't read Military IDS. So I wasted all my money. By the way, they don't reemburse you for shipping and handling. So, you're not breaking even here by returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not fantastic, but adequate","review":"If you're looking for something to hold expensive CDs or DVDs, then this case is not for you. It doesn't provide very good protection and it has a plastic cover. However, if you just need somewhere to store data discs, I recommend this case. The price is far lower than Case Logic or similar brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible cd wallet","review":"You get what you pay for, this is terrible. I ordered three, waste of money. The pages are sewn into the folder and can't be taken out or replaces. The cover is the quality of a cheap piece of plastic. These are going back to J & R."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy manufacturing","review":"This CD case would be tolerable, except for one thing... Absolutely no quality control on the product. The one I ordered had several loose pages when it came out of the box -- not torn, just never attached to the binding and laid in the folder loose -- and many of the others are not attached well. I have bought knockoff brandless CD wallets from junk sales and/or flea markets that were better made and cost half as much. I am very disappointed and will never buy a Laserline product again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Helpful","review":"This book has been invaluable in tracing my family's genealogy. The author was very meticulous in cataloging the McGavock family from 1760 to 1903. I only wish it had included persons and dates beyond 1903. It includes all the names and dates of EVERY member of the McGavock family tree. When I found a copy of this book in the public library, I knew I wanted it for my library. Thank heavens I was able to find in on Amazon.com.The book is easy to read and to the point. I liked the history of the various family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Powerful","review":"This book greatly exceeded my expectations. I expected to get a career book with the usual (albeit) useful information, and instead found myself unable to put it down. Kirk Snyder gets his message across by introducing the reader to amazing gays and lesbians who have experienced all kinds of good and bad things in their careers and then translates it into great career advice. Reading this book is like meeting new friends who teach you all kinds of powerful lessons--and not just about how to do well in your career but in life. Gays and straights alike should read this book. If more straight people read books like this there would be less homophobia in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eight hours of shoddy images :^(","review":"An aviation buff, I thought I could not go wrong getting this 4-DVD documentary for less than $20. I was wrong. This is far from the documentary quality one can find on the History and Discovery channels, in fact it actually reminded me of the murky and dull 16mm films seen in school (half a century ago) as a feeble gesture toward audio-visual \\"education\\".Most of the early archival film clips didn't look as good as similar clips seen on TV, while the newer clips were almost uniformly unsharp or in bad color. The narration was half-decent, but overall the visual quality was so lacking this entire production seemed a distinctly amateur project done on a shoestring.I had been fooled into thinking this DVD set might be a quality item because of the packaging in a neat metal case. I might as well keep the case and throw away the DVDs. The DVD publisher Madacy is one I DEFINITELY will try to avoid in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Narrow Subject Matter","review":"I actually mistakened this DVD set for The Century Of Flight made by Time Life Video in the late 1990s. (Please make THIS series in DVD format!). When you look at the two, there is virtually no comparison. Madacy's A Century of Flight covers very little about the history of aerial warfare. It has a brief segment on World War I; World War II takes up a whole disc but is told only from the American point-of-view. Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War are not covered at all! The series only covers the history of U.S aviation, exempting of course the topics listed above. My verdict: the series seems like something an elementary school class might find interesting (only because they'd rather watch TV than do written assignments) but to someone seriously interested in aviation; like the previous review says: Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Love, Not War","review":"This 4-disk video set is beautifully packaged in a 4-disk folder in a beautifully illustrated metal can case.While it was reasonably well produced and showed some fun stuff, it was not organized well. The worst is the so-called \\"hawks and doves\\" disk that is all hawks.During the first 100 years of aviation, warfare played a key role in air development, but not as overhwelming as portrayed here. The first two disks are almost entirely devoted to war with very little coverage of the development of civilian aviation at all. And even if it were supposed to be all about wartime aviation, some highly historical airplane episodes, such as the Enola Gay, are not even covered.The third disk was devoted to space exploration. Moving from the second disk to the third suffered from some of the same sense of uneven treatment.There must be a better collection than this - but where?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flight??","review":"Contains minimum information or scenes about flight. Very limited about aviation.

It's small, compact, easy-to-use and cleans well. I don't hang it so I'm not sure if that is \\"awkward\\". No complaints! At Amazon to buy a couple more. Hoping they haven't somehow screwed up the quality like so many products these days. Will let you know! :-)Revision: The other reviewer was correct about this item when it comes from Amazon. Very disappointed. I think they were stored incorrectly because the dust pan is warped and does not make good contact with the floor. Bought 3 of these at Amazon and all are the same. Stay away...I changed my review from 5 stars down to 2 only because I know that the one I bought at the store worked fabulously. The potential of a great product exists. Too bad Amazon has stored them in a manner that damages them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick up all the dirt","review":"I bought two of these.

I've never seen so many unethical shots. At one point, when they can't get a shot with their bow, the pull out a handgun and start flinging lead at a distance far greater than the effective range of the weapon. By the end of this video, you'll find yourself pulling for the hogs! I know there are few hog hunting videos out there to choose from, but don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor shooting and hunting ability","review":"I bought this video because I\`m a hog hunter myself but these guys should have waited to put out a video until they know more about hunting and learn to shoot better. They take to many stupid shots and when they do finally hit the animal it is usually in the guts. It was awful to see one shot in the guts and then they chase it another hour (that is what they say in the video)with his guts hanging out,make four more shots (all of them misses)before they kill the hog,and then they do not show the killing shot.Then they show the hog dead with a arrow sticking in his front shoulder that anyone can see was stuck in him after he was already dead.Please do not buy this video! Buy a Dan Fitzgerald hog hunting video and you will love to watch it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Journal of Biddy Owens","review":"I give The Journal of Biddy Owens two stars. Although I am a big fan of Baseball I am not a big fan of this book. This book was kind of boring to me. It's about a 17 year old kid who loves baseball. He is the equipment manager for the Birmington Black Barons, one of the best teams in the Negro leagues. The main character , Biddy tells about his experiences traveling with the team and the prejudice they encounter. Although I enjoyed reading about their eperiences I wanted to know more. I think the author could have told more about Biddy's friends,his life in the neighborhood and his encounters with prejudice. I also think the author could have told more about characters and their relationships. This book kept me wanting more information,descriptions and details. To me this is not a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biddy Owens review","review":"If you like baseball this book is for you. It has good detail in the words. You get to read some of the hardships that Black ballplayers had to with. It is about Biddy Owens a player with the Birmingham Black Barons. A Negro team with players such as Lorenzo Davis and Willy Mays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring.","review":"I read this book because I like the My Name is America series.

I'm diligent about using SPF lotion on my body and face every day, but my hands are starting to show signs of neglect, especially since I turned 40. I picked up this hand cream since I've noticed more sun spots appearing on my hands and it had good reviews. So far, I haven't noticed any lightening effects, but I know that that can take a few months. Overall, it has a nice texture and feel to it, and it sinks right in. I personally like my hand creams to be a bit thicker, but this is a great size for keeping in my purse. Since it feels good and has a pleasant smell, I know I'll actually *use* it, which is key.Overall, a nice lotion. I'll report back with any lightening I notice after I use it longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good with continued use.","review":"I have been using this product for a year now. I would recommend to anyone who has discipline and will use diligently.After about 3 weeks I noticed a marked difference in the few brown spots I was looking to fade. The key is to keep using it.I will sometimes get lazy and not put sunscreen on the back of my hands when exposed to the sun for longer periods oftimes...then I will go right back to using the cream and the spots fade back up. I do not use like a hand lotion though, I onlyuse the cream on the back of my hands and wrist. For the cost I don't want to waste the cream on my palms, etc. For mepersonally it smells nice, not offensive in anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like!","review":"I am always looking for hand lotion. I like thus one so far. It does not dmell too strongly of medicine or flowers. I took pics of my hands and time will tell if the anti-aging componant works.

Slightly greasy, but I expected that with these ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"A insider's historical account of SETI.","review":"Basically, my title says it all...this book seems almost like a biographical account of Frank Drake's career as a radio astronomer.

The Philosophical Implications of the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reminiscences of a SETI pioneer","review":"Forty-three years ago, astronomer Frank Drake was the first to conduct a search for radio signals that might be evidence of an alien civilization beyond our solar system. He has remained active in the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) ever since. Drake founded the non-profit SETI Institute, whose Project Phoenix is the most powerful of the current radio astronomy searches.This accessible book, co-written with journalist Dava Sobel, is partly an autobiography and partly a non-technical survey of SETI. Drake tells both stories in an easily readable way. If you want a painless introduction to the radio astronomy search, this is as good as any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Fiction","review":"Fine SETI overview.The man famous for the 'Drake Equation' takes a look at his own career in science, and also the history of the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence.From the very first experiments that almost started it by accident, radio telescopes, right up to the nineties.Very interesting. Anyone that wants to learn about this subject should certainly read this book, particularly those that aren't directly involved and want an understandable view."},{"rating":"2","title":"vital reading for earthlings","review":"i was surprised when i found this book in a second-hand book store.

Great for the car and in your house just chilling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"The good things about this CD: Christiane Noll is better than Carolee Carmello, and the chorus has a much better, tighter sound. The Bad things: No \\"I Need To Know\\"? What were they thinking? I think the show overall has lost some of what really frightened me on the concept recording. And I can't stand Robert Cuccioli. He has a nice voice, but as Hyde, he sounds like a villain from a Disney cartoon. No One can surpass Anthony Warlow, IMHO. And to whoever said he was a Tenor...He's a BARITONE. And he's definitely not 'Operatic'. Yes, he is an Opera singer, but he has SO MANY strings to his bow, and on Jekyll & Hyde he's not what I would describe as Operatic.

The vocalizations are tremendous and the orchestrations superb. You can follow the storyline completely and become wrapped up in it. I can listen to it for hours on end and while I'm driving down the street in the car. I can feel the emotion of the drama and can almost imagine the action. The company who recorded this cd should get these performers all under their wing. They are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Gothic Musical Since Phantom","review":"Jekyll & Hyde manages to put across in music what Robert Louis Stevenson dreamt about when he wrote the short story.

He cobbles together FM-lite power ballads and chorus songs with weak storylines and covers it all in sugary emotion. He yanks the story around to make sure his song fits rather than writing his song to fit the existing story.There are some hummable bits and pieces and the female leads' voices can be enjoyable except when Linda Eder decides that *every* song needs a big vocal finish. I would also agree with the reviewer that said to get the CDs with Anthony Warlow as Jekyll. His voice is an absolute *treasure*. Robert Cuccoli tries hard, but he can't convey the emotional range that Warlow can.P.S. Buy the other Anthony Warlow CDs. They're imports, but they're worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror!","review":"In the name of all that is holy, heed this warning: Do NOT buy this CD!If you're looking for a Jekyll & Hyde recording, the one you're after is \\"The Complete Work\\" double CD in the black box - the one with two dozen tracks that feature the jaw-dropping vocals of Anthony Warlow.Here, you must endure the tinny, cringe-inducing, strained voice of Robert Cuccioli in the lead role. Even if you saw the show on Broadway and want a momento, you're likely to be very disappointed with this CD. The only song that gives this version any merit at all is \\"In His Eyes,\\" a duet between the two most talented singers in the cast (Linda Eder and Christianne Noll, both wonderful), and even that track is so poorly recorded that the vocals blare.Either go for the 2-CD J&H recording in the black box - or pick up a Les Miserables or Ragtime CD.

The recoding here has Jekyll as the same man who plays a prince from Into the Woods. Some of the lyrics to the songs are slightly laughable, but the songs like A New Life, Alive, Take Me As I Am are excellent. The mesmorizing nature of His Work and Nothing More is AWESOME. The music is well done, and can only truely be appreciated after seeing it done. I am not saying that you HAVE To see the show to appreciate it, but seeing it gives you a greater depth of the show.

Of them all, the 2 CD set is the best. I was very disappointed in the dramatic changes to this version. It pales in comparison to the 2 CD set. While Linda Eder is superb in anything she does, the song \\"Good and Evil\\" does not justify her capabilities as did the song \\"Bring on the Men\\" in the 2 CD set.

I have this CD and I have the \\"Highlights\\", but the 2-CD set of The Complete Works of Jekyll & Hyde is far superior. If you listen to all three different versions, you'll see what I mean. Anthony Warlow is Jekyll/Hyde. This new cast version is great if you've seen the show. It takes you back to the stage by visualizing it in the music. But please buy the 2-CD set. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly different opinion","review":"I decided to write this review after reading several others on this page. I have both the complete work and this broadway release and of the two I would say I prefer the broadway rendition. Emma soars on those beautiful high notes that Lisa never hits in the complete cd and the broadway rendition seems darker and more emotional to my taste. Although both are magnificient and I recommend either with my highest regard. In this rendition subtle changes in jekyll's voice foreshadow future changes and accent underlying themes of the story stronger than in the complete works as well. Overall one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is \\"Bring on the Men\\"?

Having seen J&H a few years ago I longed for this release. Unfortunately, the most dramatic parts, (Lucy's murder and the quasi-suicide of Jeckyll) were left off, for the sake of keeping thismusical to one CD. 73:40. How obvious is that? It is a shame that this disc which is filled with excellent performances and rich music is compromised for economy's sake. I'd have paid more for the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable; Not the \\"ultimate\\" musical, though","review":"After all the hype, I had to listen to the soundtrack. Granted, it's not Les Miserables or Phantom, but it resembles Les Mis in it's style.

Even if you dont like show tunes, it's amazing. True the story has had more added on to it from the book, but if Robert Louis Stevenson had heard this he would relize what his story was missing. The actor who Plays Dr. Jekell is extremly talented, he conveys how tortured Dr. Jekell truely was. The musical says so much about life of the upper crust. It has truth of humanity writen all over it. I have no doubt that everyone has played in the Facade. The music is great and so is the writing. The concept album is also good, but not as good as this one. Hyde is strangly enticing in the song Dangerous game. Jekell is tragicly Heroic in the song true way back. And looking in his eyes is probley my favorite song out of them all. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes some getting used to","review":"I was first introduced to this wonderful score though the 1990 concept album. I will tell you that is the perfured version of them all. Still I bought this album to see how much further Mr.Wilburn could take his music. When I first heard the final product I was discusted when I heard a much weaker opening then \\"I Need To Know.\\" The problems didn't stop there. \\"Facade\\" was completly distroyed by his editing. Why he took out \\"Bring on the Men\\", one of my personal favoret songs in the album, I will never know. Finaly \\"This is the Moment\\" and \\"Alive\\" was murderd by the actor who played Jekyll. Beside the things I mentioned I also did find some really good qualities about this recording. The Lady who played Emma did a much better job of exspessing the power of her songs. I must confess these concutions came about around 3 or 4 months after I bought it. So if you hate it at first keep and you will find, sooner or later, why it is not as bad as the first impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst music to disgrace broadway in years.","review":"I bought this cd because it was highly recommended by a friend. Not only was it a waste of money, I am ashamed to say I own it. The cd contains the worst music on broadway today!! Shmaltzy pop ballads obviously written for composer Frank Wildhorn's wife's(who stars in the show)limited vocal range(No one knows who I am,Somone like you,A new life) and obvious ensemble pieces like'good and evil'are far too contempory for a musical set in 1885.Most of the actors and the ensemble have obvious American accents and even the actors who try for the correct accent sound overblown and silly.For heavens sake the musical is set in LONDON!

Great thought I, because I love Terry Pratchett books, and thought it would be something along those lines. But a Terry Pratchett book it is definitely not. Far from it. That's not to say other people wouldn't enjoy it, but not me. I would call it a coffee table book - one you toss on your coffee table for other people to thumb thru, but you never read yourself.

When I got it, I thought it would be about mythical creatures and things and people in fantasy. Such as, witches, wizards and so on. But instead this book is about a Fantasy Media. So it tells you about things such as fantasy movies, books, and video games. But it is also kind of old, and I've noticed that it doesn't have anything before 1997, and maybe even before. So it doesn't even talk about classic shows like: Charmed, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Supernatural, Smallville, or anything else. It doesn't even have the classic Harry Potter books!

Thus it is a letter that sings with urgency and passion. Dunn does a good job of capturing the historical circumstances that helped to foster St. Paul's passion. I was especially taken with the way Dunn identifies both the shared convictions and the points of dispute that existed between Paul and his opponents at Galatia. Paul, in Dunn's words, was doing \\"theology in the raw\\" as he both asserted the primacy of the cross of Jesus Christ and yet also maintained a hold on the roots of Judaism in the promise to Abraham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring Step Flurry Black Winter Boot","review":"It feels good to walk in, but when standing they are quite uncomfortable.

The prose style is deft and cuts straight to the point, making it perfect for aspiring as well as established writers.

Thompson is a single woman whose life consists of work, a creative writing class, and a meddlesome mom who calls her cell phone several times a day. Predictable ending?

People reviewing here said that they didn't buy that Emma Thompson's character is too attractive not to find a man - TOTALLY missing the point . . she just doesn't connect with most men and really doesn't want to even bother. And Dustin Hoffman - I think many men can relate to him as well - woman too. That feeling that in a whole room of people you just will never, ever 'get' the whole thing. You'd rather stay in your hotel room and read the phone book. The only thing I didn't agree with was when Dustin Hoffman gave the father of the bride speech (most of it was great!) and he said that he daughter turned out to be so lovely and kind, etc. even though she was from a broken home. IF she was so kind, why would she have her step-father walk her down the aisle? Yeah, I know, he wasn't a good father - but that was REALLY hitting below the belt - this from a sweet, kind daughter?

It worked well to feed my 5 1/2 month old in for a month before he was able to sit up properly in his high chair. The tray is pretty thin but still functions just fine. Not a great tool for keeping baby occupied with toys as he just throws them off the tray and I have to retrieve them. A suction cup toy would work well with this. The thing I like the least about the tray is that once it is snapped together you cannot unsnap it to store it. In hindsight I would have purchased a different seat entirely since the seat has to be tipped up in order to snap the tray on which is a bit awkward since the baby has to already be in the chair to attach the tray. The tray is a good deal for the price but I think the actual bumbo is overrated and overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the idea of it, but doesn't stay","review":"I would love to use this thing, but it does not stay secured.

A little hard to get off.","review":"I bought this tray to go with my daughter's Bumbo, and I love that I can put a couple of toys on it and she can grab them and play with them (she is just shy of 4 months old). The tray will be great for feeding too, when the time comes.My only complaint (and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the instructions say to always remove the tray before taking your child out of the Bumbo, but it is very difficult to get off when the Bumbo is sitting flat. You have to tilt the Bumbo backward and pop it off from the bottom and sometimes it kind of \\"jolts\\" the baby when you do this. I will still continue to use and love this product, but it is a little annoying. I've just decided that it is easier to ignore the instructions and just ease my baby's legs out of the slots without taking the tray off (which if you are halfway intelligent you can do safely)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I think this tray is very easy to assemble and easy to clean.

Boy was I wrong. It's hard to get on and off so you wouldn't want to remove and replace each time you put baby in/out. It is so hard to get the baby into the seat with the tray on and even harder to get him out! His legs get stuck when I lift him up and the whole seat is dangling by his legs. I hate it. He cries every time I take him out. This thing went straight to the trash after 2 days. It should clip on and off easier so you can take it off each time you want to get baby in or out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I agree, this product is not worth the money. It is hard to get onto the seat at times and is easily pulled off. When I finally get the tray onto the seat, I like the fact that it provides a surface for toys but you can easily enjoy your bumbo seat without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bumbo Tray","review":"Love the tray! Very easy to assemble and looks to be easy to clean. The tray is much stronger than I would have thought it to be. My only complaint is that it's a bit of a pain removing it from the bumbo when you are trying to get your little one out but I didn't read the instructions so take that for what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"I was hoping I could use this tray when I started to feed my daughter solids.

Get a high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table sent was not what was shown","review":"The table sent to me was actually a different version than what is pictured. I had one like I was sent this time before that broke very easily so I was thinking I would be getting something different since the picture was different. The table I was sent was clear and has a plastic piece that attaches to the bottom of the table and helps connect it to the seat.

Everyone should have one for their child!We had also purchased the Bumbo Play Tray and it is USELESS! My seven month old was able to pull it off and it would not secure in place. What's the point of a tray if your child can take it off? At first I was thinking, \\"well, maybe I didn't properly install it\\" but after my husband looked it over, we still had the same problems. I'm very disappointed with the Bumbo Play Tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"This tray is a good idea in theory, but if your child is like mine, they will be able to easily remove the tray.

I don't care what anyone says - the tray does not attach to the bottom half of this product! There is NO give in the plastic, so attachment is nearly impossible. Trust me, we tried! It looked good in theory, but since the snap doesn't work, I wasn't comfortable using this. I bet you can get away with jamming the tray on and it probably won't pop off the bottom piece of plastic, but I wouldn't risk it, especially if you have a wiggly baby.I had to return it. I was sorry to do so because my baby likes sitting in her Bumbo and wants to have toys. I had hoped the tray would mean less time picking up toys from the floor and having to wash them off.

I am afraid my child will lean on it and it will fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Attach","review":"Let me first say that I love the Bumbo seat design. However, because of the design, you have to put your baby in the seat before you can attach the tray. (Or at least I do in order to get his legs in the holes) I find that the tray is very difficult to attach, especially with a baby in the seat. You have to tilt the seat back a little to get enough tension to snap the seat on. I'm always afraid I'll lose my grip and he'll go tumbling backwards.Also, the first time I put the tray on, my little guy's arm got caught under the tray. The squishy material of the Bumbo helped cushion his arm, so he didn't scream his head off when it happened. While I like the Bumbo, I'm less enthused about the tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean and doesn't pinch baby","review":"I got this to see if getting a high chair was needed at the time. My daughter is breast fed so she didn't need one right away. I got this tray to ease her into the transition of eating off a spoon and we both loved it. It didn't pinch her when putting it on and it was obviously easy to clean. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars was because it's really snug so kind of difficult to lock onto the bottom on the Bumbo. Otherwise I love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an option for a baby who doesn't want to stay in the seat.","review":"My baby never stayed in his Bumbo seat for more than a minute. So I purchased the tray hoping to prevent him from getting out. Yes, baby gets locked in well, however, instead of climb out from front, the whole thing flip to the side. Risk of getting baby hurt is even much higher now. Waste of effort for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The first tray I received was defective; the base piece was warped to the point that it didn't fit into the tray. Amazon responded quickly, sending a replacement by FedEx overnight. Unfortunately, the plastic below the slot on the second tray cracked when I attempted to push the base into it. I've used the second tray anyway and have had no trouble securing the tray to the seat. I'm unhappy with the product, but it's not worth the hassle of returning another one, especially since there's little chance the third one would be any better made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chimp could install but it'd take a gorilla to remove","review":"Simple installation yet when done correctly it will not simply \\"pop off\\" as some suggest.

I'd buy another if one wasn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works at first and then the cheap tab breaks!","review":"I first got it and used it a few times. It was perfect for my son and he loves it. Then one day the tray pops off. Then I try and put it on again and 2 min later it is off again.

However, the tray makes the leg holes pretty small, making it difficult and awkward to put the baby in the seat and even more difficult to lift him out. His legs usually get caught on the tray.

The long and short of it is that the book tells you that there is no ideal spacing between children (there are pros and cons of any space you chose) and that you will handle things just fine. It provides (weak) validation that you'll do ok, and get used to things, but simply presents very common-sense type ways your life will change. I bought the book despite the very outdated pictures on the cover, since I could find very little else as a guideline to what was a scary and impending change for us, but the book did not help with time management skills, suggestions of how to get out of the house better/faster, ways you can implement changes in your routine to accommodate two - etc. All in all, a no-help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"I will admit that I haven't finished this book but I'm not a fan.

I found this book to be very negative and could not even finish reading it. In the intro, the author states that she uses sources to found her notions on. However, I found that very untrue. Most of her advice/ideas were not cited, and therefore seemed to be her opinion. I have to say, I do not recommend this book. After putting this book down, I started reading Twice Blessed by Joan Leonard and found it to be encouraging and helpful to me for preparing for my next child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Negative","review":"I have never written a review on Amazon, but after reading this book I strongly felt that it was needed. I was very disappointed with how negative this book was written. It was overly dramatic and made out that your life was going to be in constant turmoil once your second child arrived.

A cheap exploitation film with really no story, a silly werewolf. I really saw no point or plot in the movie, just people (ladies) dancing really,padded out for over 1 hour. Watching partially to topless nude women dance around for an entire movie might be entertaining to some, but not to me. Really a waste of time unless you like films like this.

By 1966, Cris was pretty much bloated from alcohol and his pink face shows it well in this color flick. Vampira wasn't available for this pie so Ed Wood enlists the aid of the lovely Ghoulita as Criswell's bitchy ghoul sidekick. Together, they bind a man & woman to wooden stakes where they are forced to watch really bad strippers cavort in the graveyard (fast forward thru these ladies...it's the only way to watch 'em). The wolfman and mummy also hang out with Cris; the mummy in a rubber suit that creases when he walks and wolfman in rubber hands and mask that were probably purchased at K-Mart - after Halloween - on sale for 50 cents. Cris is still a marvel to watch, though, and this really is a wonderfully bad film. This is one of the few films where I find myself actually laffing out loud. You'll rewind some of the scenes over and over again in disbelief! Try it....but keep the kids away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tit-tit-tittilating!","review":"This movie gets five stars for pure awfulness! \\"Based on the novel by Ed Wood,\\" (did he direct this under a pseudonym...?) a bunch of \\"damned\\" (and mostly damned chunky) chicks are raised from the dead by a guy in a REALLY cheap vampire suit and forced to dance (in various stages of undress) for his jovially demonic pleasure. With a plot about on par with the average \\"Tales From the Crypt\\" episode (and with even more frontal nudity), you can just let your brain go out for a beer while you watch this one! My (and my wife's) personal favorite: the porky \\"indian princess\\" in red thong undies! Dig those tom-toms! I'm sure all the women who were in this (if they haven't killed themselves from shame), are somewhere thinking \\"I can't BELIEVE I slept with Ed Wood to get this part!\\" I'm especially amused that the only other review of this movie is by some OTHER poor bastard in Akron, Ohio.

IT HAS VERY POOR SCRIPT WRITING AND IT WAS SIMPLY DULL. YES THERE IS NUDITY BUT IT GETS OLD AS THE MOVIE DRAGS ON. IT WAS A VERY SLOW MOVING MOVIE.

When a horror-writer and his lady love have an auto wreck en route to a cemetary for literary inspiration, they encounter... a bunch of topless bimbos bumping and grinding amidst the tombstones!There is no story per se, the majority of the film being devoted to the questionable charms of the lady phantoms, few of whom are more than apathetic at best. But it's perfect for a Halloween party... Just turn down the sound and put on some decent music, add a few drinks, and giggle away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy but not fun","review":"This film is simply an excuse to show topless women performing (bad) strip tease type dances. The best things about it are the image quality, which is surprisingly good, the actress Pat Barrington, and Criswell, of many Ed Wood films fame. There is also an interesting interview with Apostolof, in which he relates some amusing anecdotes. He also asserts Ed Wood had no talent as a director, but since immediately after this film I watched \\"Night of the Ghouls\\" and \\"Plan 9 from outer space,\\" I must disagree. Orgy of the dead is wooden and silly at best, and tells no real story. The Ed Wood movies (his main connection to this movie is his script, which sounds pretty funny) are at least strangely entertaining. Interesting chiefly as an artifact of the times -- I doubt I could rewatch this, as I fast forwarded through most of the movie's boring dances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Wood's nudie classic","review":"This review is based on the VHS version. A couple crashes on a tropical island and stumbles across a bizarre ceremony presided over by Ed Wood favorites Criswell and Vampira (or at least a facsimile of her). Various topless girls appear before him and are required to dance as atonement for various sins. It turns out that the voyeuristic couple were killed in their plane crash and the woman has to strip and dance for Criswell, too. No plot and no sex, just topless dancing girls. Very odd film. I gave it two stars because it's typical Ed Wood fare (low budget, poor acting and cheesy dialogue), but I'm an EW fan. If you're not, don't bother with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deleriously trashy","review":"If you love totally wretched movies,then this is the one for you.

He crashes with the car and the couple have to spend the night at the cemetary where the Emperor of the Dead (Criswell) and Princess of Darkness is hosting a topless dance show. This is a very boring film, but the few acting scenes between the dances are as cheesy and funny as you expect from a film by Ed Wood. The \\"erotic\\" dances are very innocent and embarrasingly silly, but fun for the first 5 minutes.

And more often than not these extensions are so easy to use that you don't really need to spend a lot of bucks for a book that tells you how to use them inside Dreamweaver. All the extensions are about Javascript, so if you don't want to force your websites\` users to have Javascript enabled on their browsers then this book isn't for you.Four stars anyway for the nice choice of extensions, which keeps you from spending hours on the net to find the extensions you need and because without a book like this one many people might not be aware of the power and ease of Dreamweaver extensions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for an advanced level...","review":"...easy to read and to follow, but the reader has to be in an advanced level; otherwise, it's clueless for the beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not THAT great!","review":"I consider my self an intermediate web designer and I am having some trouble with this book.

From what the other reviewers said about the dictionary's content, I guess we didn't miss much.

Most other dictionaries, Scholastic for example, do it that way (i.e. \\"God\\" is the god of Christians and Jews.)

The book talks about the mills and the factories through Lyddies eyes. Lyddie is telling the reader her life story. The book is letting us see how factory life was. You will see how dangerous it is to work in a mill at the age of 13 and working three or four looms at a time. You will find some advantages of working in the factory and some disadvantages.(...)I would rate this book as a four because it starts of slow talking about Lyddie and her family. Then it gets good when she is at the mill. It is both fun and exciting reading about Lyddie's life long journey at the mill. The story also has some humor in the end. While reading the book you get to see what factory life was really like.

Throughout many deaths and being harassed by Mr. Marsden, her boss, she improves her grammer with the help of Diana and encounters Irish Immigrants.

Interestingly, nobody seems to have commented on Diana, who I think is a pivotal character.

If you don't require a lot from movies to be entertaining, well then its a good flick. The characters have no depth, and what you get is a shabby job of roughemup action Styallone style against ridiculous odds. Stallone's shootemups with the bad guys are really ridiculous, as is the part when he impales the villain on a very blunt, and obviously dull hook at the local foundry. The hand to hand action, although brief was the most exciting part of this film and I wish I had seen more of that. The picture quality was not what I have come to expect from DVDs and the sound was substandard."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time King of Bad Action Films","review":"Cobra makes Rambo 3 look realistic and intellectually appealing.A giant cult of insane axe-murders (not as cool as it sounds; remeber this is bad action not bad horror) takes on Stallone.Guess who wins.This film is pumped full of testosterone-fueled corniness, and seeps with pointless violence. If you laugh harder whenever Sly tries to be more serious, then get this, or at least rent it.In my opinion, Cobra is a laugh riot!P.S.

Stay up late at night and watch horrible action movies on HBO, that is. It seems like each one gets worse than the last. But \\"Cobra\\" is about as low as they can go.Stallone demonstrates quite admirably why action movie stars should not write their own screenplays. From the \\"maverick in the police department\\" to the \\"female lead who falls in love with a guy who continually and recklessly endangers her life\\" to the \\"treacherous partner cop-gone-bad\\" to the \\"one man vs. an army\\" of the climactic shootout, the plot might interest a sleeping zombie. Maybe that's his target audience, as the brutal senselessness of the movie could only escape the undead. Although even zombies will get a little nauseated at the retro-80s soundtrack.Maybe I've been spoiled by \\"The Matrix\\" -- no, scratch that, even the memory of \\"Rambo\\" and \\"Rocky\\" was enough to ruin this film.

After several dozen murders, Stallone tracks the killers down and blows them all away (except for the one he hangs on a hook and burns to death). The End.Total Recall showed how extreme violence could be used to produce an imaginative, entertaining film. Cobra shows how extreme violence can be used to produce a multi-million dollar mess that makes you wonder if Darwin was wrong. It's basically a star vehicle slasher film during which victim after hapless victim is paraded in front of the screen to be slaughtered in the name of forwarding the \\"plot.\\"With a resume filled with junk like this over the past two decades, it's no wonder Stallone's career has gone down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"When are we going to see a definitive DVD edition of Cobra?","review":"To many people (including myself) Cobra is a classic film and as such deserves an appropriate DVD release.

Sylvester Stallone plays a guy named Cobra who is a bit of a maverick of a cop. Of course to make him look good all of the other cops are dummies. Cobra's real name is Marion Cobretti so now you know why this guy is always trying to prove his masculinity.The only good thing about this movie is the cool custom car which Cobra drives but it gets totalled in the film early after which point I turned this movie off.

Not many people starting out are capable of having knee surgery and running a race shortly thereafter. What little useful information was provided seemed impractical and laden with disclaimers such as, just because Joan did this doesn't mean that everyone can, etc. I wanted to read a book that would give me pointers in starting and maintaining a running program, not Joan's life story."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Joan Samuelson's book - Running for Women","review":"An excellent reference resource for women runners.Also, an easy and enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

The questions are too detailed and esoteric. I think even a surgical intern or resident would have a hard time with these questions.-Many of the explanations are convoluted, and there is no clear cut answer given in the actual explanation.

One thing STP does so well -- always has, always will (see: Army of Anyone & latest STP record) -- is arrange songs. It's like an orchestra of guitar and bass tones and tracks on these songs. Dave Coutts' voice sits wonderfully in the songs, which are propelled by the tight Motown-like grooves of the Kretz/DeLeo machine.

Although scott has a great voice I d not like that development at all. I would like to say to the other members of STP: don't give up on talk show because this first album sold less than expected.

The subject is fascinating but Leman seems to think that readers should believe what he says just because he says it. He gives scant attention to well-replicated studies on the subject.As an example of his pronouncements, in discussing firstborn newscasters and talk-show hosts, he writes \\"and the spokesman for excellence in broadcasting himself, Rush Limbaugh\\". ... I wish his biases were clearer before I put out money for this unhelpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of you interested in your personality this is it.","review":"Unlike other personality books that attempt to help you improve yourself...this book explains how and why you are what you are. The explanations of personality profiles and family dynamics were written as if the author had studied my family and myself. Being a first born I found his extensive explantions very informative, but I feel the author may have spent too much time on the first borns and not enough on the others within the family structure. Overall the book is fascinating and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Family","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't find this book useful or at all applicable to my family; I think a study of 3 generations of our family would make a great new book for Dr. Leman; he could call it, \\"The Anomaly\\" and I invite him to take us on. I drew this conclusion just from the introductory page, but pressed on and through and found no satisfaction what so ever. That being said, everyone should explore the doc's writings and see for themselves if this book provides any insight to them on their own situation (note that I suspect that you have to be a blessed with a near perfect family picture to begin with)so I donated my book to our local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Very interesting book!

One thing that I find helpful is that I can anticipate how someone will respond/react in a situation or understand their behaviors while others look in confusion.Female 7 years olderMale 2 years olderMale (me)It's interesting to see how based on our family dynamics, I take on last born and first born characteristics."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just Birth Order","review":"This is the type of book that makes a lightbulb pop over your head. You will understand yourself more, as well as your family. Leman is funny and extremely down to earth in his writing style (and I love his Christian references). He also includes very sound advice on relating to and parenting certain birth orders. I just finished this book, and I now want to read his \\"Making Children Mind Without Losing Yours\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY interesting","review":"Wow - I wish I had had this book when I was raising my four children. What great helpful tips for parents regarding their children, but also for parents themselves to better understand their own inner being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"My husband and I read this book 30 years ago when our babies started coming and it was SO, SO helpful to us as new parents. I loaned it out so many times over the years that it finally never made its way back home. Now, that our little grandchildren are here and we are an active part of their lives, my husband and I wanted to refresh our memories. Well, my husband picked it up, hasn't been able to put it down, and keeps exclaiming what a GREAT book it still is!! Dr. Leman is fascinating, enlightening, educating, comforting, and entertaining. I'm now going to order copies for all of our adult children because it's a such a WONDERFUL resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I Really Like That?","review":"\\"The Birth Order Book\\" by Dr. Leman is very informative. He breaks down so many of the things that we think are just our normal responses and shows how our birth order was an influencing factor. In some senses he says it affects so many of our basic day to day skills and behaviors. I found most of his information to be very enlightening and useful. It is informational by nature, but it can also be a useful self-help tool. When we can see why we act certain ways it frees us to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Leman nails it. Best book on the subject.","review":"I have been very much interested in the concept of birth order affecting who you are. I am a first born male with a younger sister and my wife is a first born female with a younger brother. Needless to say we have butted heads.This book is written by a man whose opinion I greatly respect. He covers not just first borns but babies, middles and only's. He covers the best and worst marriage combinations. He also writes about how to parent a first born and how to parent when that first born is dethroned.This book is chock-full of great info about how birth order affects many aspects of life. He frequently uses his own children as perfect examples.I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting theory, too much focus on God and author","review":"So I read the book and am intrigued by the theory but it was hard to read the theory between irrelevant references by the author to how great he is and totally irrelevant remarks referring to his Christianity. Christiany and how a person interacts with God has nothing to do with his scientific theory and should stay out of the book.If the author had just stuck to explaining the theory without the unnecessary fluff it would have been a great book (even though I challenge the author to predict my birth order and that of my siblings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I thought this book was really interesting. It's about your birth order and how it relates to your personality. It described me exactly, which really freaked me out. I thought this would be a good book to recommend to someone. The author even talks about his own experiences on how his birth order relates to him. If you like to learn more about yourself, then this would be a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life","review":"This is one of those books that changes your entire outlook on life. You will understand yourself better, and most importantly you will understand your kids, your siblings, your coworkers, and your customers. Birth order is one of the most important factors in understanding other people. It's not the ONLY factor, but birth order is the one thing that you can readily learn about someone that will help you deal more effectively with that person, whether it's your brother, your daughter, your mother, or a sales prospect. Try it. It will enrich your life. Beats the heck out of horoscopes. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"Great book!! I learned so much about myself and everyone around me.

Things are hard to find. If you know of any let me know. Adult things too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible!","review":"After catching the end of one of their songs on MuchMusic, I listened to all the Tea Party clips that amazon.com had to offer. I just couldn't get enough and bought Splendor Solis, The Edges of Twilight, and Transmission all at once (I drove to Canada earlier this year to pick up Triptych).At first, Edges was my favorite of the three, since it has a *very* solid track list. Every single one of the songs is awesome. Because I was so busy listening to Edges, however, I neglected Transmission somewhat.Now I find that the more I listen to this CD the more I like it. So I listen more, and I like it more and more and more. This CD, even though it was great to start with, has grown even beyond that. It's both interesting to listen to and entirely hypnotic at times, and the electronic aspect was added perfectly. Of the entire album, I would have to say that my favorites are: Temptation, Psychopomp, Transmission, and Aftermath.Buy this! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tea Party Album.. . Edges of Twilight is good too","review":"If you like The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails you will love this one... This album is flooded with tons of instrumets. The whole album flows very nicely right through. I bought it after seeing them live in 97. To this day I still listen to it like every month. My favourite song from it is Gyroscope. heh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transmission","review":"This album is truly a treat. It deals with the \\"funkier\\" side of the Tea Party, with guitars and drums galore. \\"Transmission\\" in my opinion is a summary of all the past albums that The Tea Party have produced, with a twist. Saying that however, at times it does get a bit too excessive. The message Martin wants to express is quite clear: Live and let live or wither and die. Listen to this album and get ready for a real ride, a ride which has no speed limit nor blasting horns wailing at you, except perhaps the sound of those blasted drums."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily the tea party's best","review":"i bought this cd about a year ago, and have just started to enjoy every song on it now. i loved the hits like temptation and psycopomp, but i had never really given all of them a chance. transmission, babylon, etc. are all great songs - there is no filler here. the only downside of this album is that martin's vocals don't really sound very good on the quieter parts of songs like release and emerald. he's better off singing to loud guitars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transmission Received.","review":"Transmission is beautifully brutal. The Tea Party's 3rd major album focusses on the human condition of the late 20th century. Sex, Spirituality, Love, War, all combine in a mind-blowing alchemy on this album. If you've never heard The Tea Party before and are fascinated by the Occult and the Bigger picture of Humanity, Tx is for you. Dark, raw and sensual. Pull the curtains to, light the candles and the incense and let the Mystic Moroccan-roll take you far far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed transmission","review":"Uninspired industrial metal with poor melodies. \\"Temptation\\" is the only decent tune on here. After the fabulous \\"Edges Of Twilight\\" a disheartening turn of events for one of the better rock bands of the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"This album is very poor. The lyrics are apalling throughout the album, though \\"Release\\" is by far the worst offender. The melody is good, but there is very little melodic variation between songs. More annoying than this is the similarity of some of the tunes with songs by other artists. The electronic noises used in the songs are unwelcome, and prove that \\"clever\\" production can never make up for boring songwriting. Musicianship is ordinary, but again it is the dreadful lyrics that make this album so unlistenable. Standout tracks include Emerald and Army Ants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely unique","review":"It's 2007 and I still go back to this album for great sounds. An awesome great great album. Thank you Tea Party. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical and spectacular","review":"Transmission stands out from the crowd of misc pop-rock it was released at the same time as; with dark, intricate melodies and an incredible vocal line, it deserves a permanent place in anyone's master playlist.

I have owned many espresso percolators, and I rate this at the bottom of my list. You are better off with a Bialetti. They are sturdy and last long.

I didn't want to replace the entire CPU fan as the Thermaltake Silent Boost for Opteron heatsinks worked very well, their fans were just designed poorly and tend to fail frequently. So I hunted up the specs and found that they use 92mm fans, so I hunted up these Vantecs, because when I previously purchased some 120mm Vantec Stealth fans they were incredibly quiet and I hoped the smaller version would have the same characteristics. I was not disappointed, these fans are even quieter than the Silent Boost fans I believe, and keep my server just as cool. They also have a much lower profile so I can route cables more easily and have more space around the CPUs to mount an additional fan for cooling the RAM."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD fan...","review":"Stealth ???

While most of NP's music is political only in passing, Sabac's solo album is an all out political album. And its dope as hell.\\"Organize\\" is a great opening track, with insighful lyrics and a hook that sounds like a protest chant. Even Necro sounds decent on \\"Positive and Negative\\". \\"Fight Until the End\\" with Immortal Technique is another highlight, after that the album kinda weakens in the middle but finishes with a number of dope cuts like \\"Urban Guerillas\\", \\"I have a Dream\\" and \\"A Change Gon Come\\".Cop this album, its refreshing to hear such an aware album coming out in 2004.By the way, I reserve 5 star reviews for classics. In retrospect,I may consider this album a classic in a year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thorough. A Must for any Blondie Fan!","review":"I love Blondie and I couldn't have asked for a more thorough and entertaining documentary of the group. There are in-depth interviews with the band members as recent as the No Exit album. (It is interesting to see how jittery a couple of them are, including Debbie; too much coke from the Studio 54 days?!!) The video plays many snippits of songs spanning their career, as well as showing video clips. It even covers some of their solo work, and Debbie's 1968 music venture with the group, The Wind in the Willows. I bought that album as a result of it being mentioned. You'll find the complete Maria video in this, too. This is a must-have for any Blondie fan. At this price, you'll be very satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stax/Volt Review Smokes in Norway","review":"You take arguably the best backup band in the country, add a hot horn section and put them behing some of the finest soul performers in the business at their peak and this is what you get - a show you wished you had seen in person. When you put Booker T & The MGs and the MarKeys behind Arthur Conley, Eddie Floyd, Sam and Dave and the incomporable Otis Redding you are in for a hot time, indeed, and this DVD - made for TV in Norway during the Stax/Volt tour of Europe in 1967 - captures that excitement. The only thing keeping it from a full 5-star rating is that it appears some of the Eddie Floyd segment has been lost for some reason and it was shot in black and white, but those are minor picks at otherwise excellent footage. Watching this DVD will let you relive the times when soul music had soul and performers gave it everything they had and provided their own pyrotechnics without the need of 22 dancers and 10 back-up singers to entertain you. This is the real thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Got Ants in my Pants and I need to DANCE.....","review":"What a vintage musical explosion.......if you can sit still when you are watching this SOULFUL concert video from the 60s, then you are already DEAD and need to find a crypt to hang in!

While this movie simplifies the story, and does not end true to the book, it is still worth owning for any fan of Richard Chamberlain, amd it is a quick-moving, mesmerizing story. I found the quality of the video to be excellent -- yes there are brief pauses where commercials once were when it aired on television, but so what? It doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. The sound quality was excellent, and it even played on our old, fussy DVR player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count Monte","review":"Very poor import. Probably cost 10 cents to make.

It's nice, I guess, that Amazon is providing more exposure for these journals; nonetheless, for them to claim they're offering a discount, while not exactly a lie (since they're offering a discount over the per-copy price), is deceiving, as they don't seem to be offering a cheaper rate than that already offered by the journals.

(Especially when they are infants.) Other nursing pillows have rounded tops which force the baby to roll either towards or away from you. Not ideal. I have bought this for friends and family who are expecting and tell my patients about it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not if you had a C-section","review":"I think this is an awesome product; however, I ended up in a C-section which made using this very uncomfortable. The incision of C-section was at the exact spot this cushion sat which was painful for the first 6+ weeks. At that point I had gotten used to using pillows to help prop my son up. I did like that the cover was washable and the little bumps elevated my son's head perfectly. I must say I was quite bummed I couldn't use this as much as I would have liked to due to my c-section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"It's a soft cover. Loved the pillow when I nursed. My only complaint is that the brest friend pillow doesn't have a nicer assortment of colors. They should take note from Boppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brest Friend is not so user-friendly..","review":"I bought this when I had my second child. I was hoping it would give me some support in my back while nursing. Sure, it offered support, but with it around my waste, I couldn't fit into my glider! I'm very petite, 5.2 and 120 lbs. My chair is rather comfortable. The only way to use it was to rest one side of it over the arm rest.Another major negative - after nursing, I could not put the baby back into the crib because the front of the pillow got in the way. So I had to hold the baby with one hand and unbuckle the pillow with the other. If this wasn't enough trouble, getting the baby out of the crib with a pillow already buckled was impossible because of it, once again, getting in the way. And try to hold the baby with one hand and buckle the pillow with the other! Yikes.I went back to my Boppy and used a regular pillow behind my back. Brest Friend is not so user-friendly.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to 1966, with Batman!!","review":"This Album from the Marketts, is really a 'blast from the past for me.I have the Crown label' Maxwell Davis' album titled Batman , I had given to me when I was 6 yrs old/ in 66, and yes when I put it on my record player, hoping for the 'POW/ZAP-ZOWIEE! of the Adam West Batman TV Series, I was a little so-so disappointed at not hearing familiar voices or sounds from the Classic show, but as years had gone by, as with this album, Batman Theme/ by the Marketts, Pulling these records out to hear them again you get a 'new perspective of what was really happening in '66!! big drums! heavy backbeat!

Usually, I thumb through a copy of Sailor Moon manga, but my eyes were drawn away and towards The Ring, which had not been there during my last visit several weeks ago.I had originally intended for only a quick read, but I ended up spending 40 minutes going on a mental and emotional thrill ride. Awesome must-read, with an exceptionally creepy ending (which I will NOT share here).Like the book, it has NOTHING to do with the \\"before you die, you see the ring\\" theme of the Hollywood movie. The horror is more intangible than obvious, with much of it left to the imagination.I don't usually like horror-related books or anything else (besides Castlevania), but I LOVED this manga, and I really want to get the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time!!!","review":"I just bought this book in Amsterdam at the Flash Forward conference. As a self confessed Flash/Actionscript book junkie I am really impressed by this title. Books on this subject tend to fall into one of two catagories - very basic or advanced scripting - Drag, Slide, Fade doesn't. It is squarely aimed at the designer who is comfortable using Flash and wants to know how to do cool scripted effects using their artwork and the software. It has a relaxed writing style and is easy to read through - well designed layouts help too. I've seen Brendan Dawes talk at several different events over the years and the title reflects his no-nonsense easy to grasp style. If you are a Flash designer looking to improve your scripting skills then this is the title to do it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO many errors","review":"Very disappointed in buying this book as it has so many errors. For a beginner, it will be very frustrating to deal with. Very disappointed because I know the author is a Flash expert. Very disappointed that the Author, Editors and Technical Writers rushed this book out onto the market before testing, thoroughly, the examples in this step-by-step book. The only ones who will truly benefit from this book are the advanced readers versed in ActionScript as they have the knowledge to pick-up on errors. ActionScript newbies.... you will be very frustrated with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragging is not such a drag anymore!","review":"I got the book yesterday, and today I've already done things I thought I couldn't do. This is the first book that walks me through the code so that I understand what I'm doing and can apply it to my work. I also love that he explains effects I can really use.I've just completed the projects in chapter two, \\"Drag,\\" and already I've learned more about movie clips than I had in the last four months. Finally someone has written a book on Flash that is clear and interesting and, best of all, immediately useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors, errors errors","review":"This book is FULL of errors in its code. Unless you know actionscript well enough to figure out the errors on your own to make the code work, you'll be very disappointed. I am thankful I bought it used and didn't pay full price. Avoid this book and save yourself a lesson in frustration. I think he wrote it with the motivation to make people think actionscript is very hard and thus limit his competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm... Where's the meat?","review":"First of all the book is beautiful as it seems New Riders likes to put 'em out. I'm all for coffee table books. But not when it comes to Flash design.I want to read code to make me think about other code, and more code on top of that. I want my coding to improve so that my imagination won't be stifled as my skills won't warrant heavy creative ideas yet. I like nice design, and I am by no means a great scripter, but I think that this book went about 40% of the way that it should have gone.This book is pretty vanilla and full of fairly useless examples. There are quite a few coding errors throughout and overall I get a lot of eyecandy with nothing to hold it up. Brendan and Hillman have great reputations... but what's this book all about.

Do research about the resources BEFORE you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for newbies","review":"I was very disappoointed when I bought this book. I was learning flash and I wanted to get a good basic understanding of actionscript. When I started reading the book, I knew this wasn't it. There were errors and as I quickly discovered, this is definitely not a book for beginners. There are better books out there. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors.....errors.....errors","review":"I bought this book with much excitement based on the examples I was going to learn through the step and step approach. Brenden assumes you have some knowledge of ActionScript and therefore assumes that you can pick-up on his errors and correct them for yourself. For a newbie who is learning ActionScript for the first time should not be learning from a book with so many errors. Not only is this very, very frustrating for a newbie but it quells the excitement of a newbie from learning ActionScript....at least for awhile. The book was probably rushed out to the stores without thoroughly testing the examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book to get started with Coding","review":"If you are new to coding, or are looking for alternatives to manual shape tweens, get this book. Clear, fun and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"false premise","review":"Here we go again with another book from New Riders with great layout and graphics but content not worth the paper it's written on. Brendan Dawes states that this book is for designers with little scripting background. He states that if readers can pick up the programming skills needed to relax and \\"feel creative\\".ActionScript consists of understanding methods, classes and objects and placing error free code in the correct places (timelines or on symbols) and careful testing. This book teaches none of that.The book is full of \\"monkey see, monkey do\\" excercises. A careful reader can follow and repeat the tricks, but that's about it. No reader can walk away and begin coding based on the content in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed the mark","review":"This book claims to take the fear out of programming but it jumps right into writing raw code in \\"Advanced\\" mode as opposed to coding in \\"Normal\\" mode which I would assume to be the logical first step.The author does a good job of introducing the ActionScript language by using metaphors but failed to get me to actually program anything.This book is not for designers, maybe it is for programmers but, I would guess that programmers would require more depth than this book provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"Superficial information, short and incomplete code examples.I had a basic understanding of COM+, transactions, MSMQ, etc. and that has not increased after reading this book.If you know COM+ you don't need this book, if you don't this book will not help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking...","review":"This book is poorly organized and lacks focus.

Partly, I expected it to awaken nostalgic memories; but the main reason was, I'd had a sort of vague \\"flashback\\" involving the book that was very emotionally painful.I now think I know why. The little girl in the book, a two-year old, tries to give the three eponymous kittens a bath. Her parents intervene -- unskillfully, in my opinion! -- causing the girl to throw a tantrum, which the book fully blames on her. In my experience, young children (and animals) are extremely willing and happy to be cooperative; it's the rude ways their parents or owners say NO! that makes them react \\"badly.\\"The story finished by saying how everything turned out ok because she turned three and became a \\"nice girl.\\"Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Favorite","review":"The story is one of a child growing up, just a little.

Considering he has direct lineage of one of hockeys most storied coaches, has seen practically every Montreal Canadiens game in the past 40 or 50 years, has written dozens of hockey books and provided countless analysis on HNIC this book represents a let down. Given the lack of 'off-ice observer' insight one would expect from someone who practically grew up in the Forum, we are then left with large-scale referee reminiscing, much of it repetitive (entry into the profession, forced early retirement, mentors), however with little depth and not much to re-new our appreciation for the men in stripes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduro Road racing....","review":"I also race WKA nationals..

I always enjoy Walter Matheau as an actor. He has a special charm to his acting style. However, his humor is pretty stifled here. Also the he vs she plot just seems a bit too tiresome here. Matheau argues for the sake of arguing and that is never too pleasant.Jill Clayburgh is mis-cast as the first woman Supreme Court Justice. She is way too young for such a role and that hampers the film from the get go.The pornographic subplot also is addressed in such a boring way. The general plot does not excite me in anyway. I tried viewing this a second time to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, the arguing between Matheau and Clayburgh became more annoying than funny.Walter Matheau's presence is probably the only reason this movie even earns two stars.

I found the trick is to dry my hair with a blow dryer till just damp, roll it in my velcro rollers, then use the bonnet dryer while putting on my make-up (about 10 minutes). I put the hose away while it's still warm so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit. I wait just a minute or two til my hair cools then pull the rollers out and style.

My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot.

But, still, I even left this thing on my head overnight and my hair wasn't completely dry in the morning.

I took him to Mt. Pisgah in Eugene where they hold an annual mushroom festival. We had a lot of fun identifying the more obvious ones but had a difficult time finding several mushrooms in the book. The problem could've stemmed from us being in such a diverse area for the first trip. All in all I love the book. The stories and pictures add a nice touch. It was an informative and fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"reviewed but not used much yet","review":"we have used this in a limited way only because we have not yet been out in the field much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good field guide ...","review":"Excellent pictures and information. The best part is just inside the cover where you will find an identification process mapped out. This makes it easy to figure out where in the book to look for information on the new mushroom you have just discovered. An enjoyable read, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best take along guide","review":"I gave this book to my husband along with a large mushroom book, as he has been very into mushroom hunting. He said this is a perfect size to take along and that it is very informative.

I am hooked and have to get my own copy now!! Great for beginners like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice companion guide","review":"This is definitely a companion guide to Mushrooms Demystified; I bought this one first but found during mushroom hunting that there were many instances where I couldn't confirm identifications without referencing MD, which I didn't have at the time. But since MD doesn't have color photos, and it's too big to carry around in the field, this is a very nice little book to have around."},{"rating":"2","title":"best mushroom field guide ever.","review":"I don't leave home during mushroom season without this book.

If you like Wild Mushrooms, You Must Have This Book Yesterday!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down, the best mushroom field guide you can get","review":"This is simply the coolest field guide I own. I own several mushroom field guides and many plant guides, and this one is by far the easiest and most fun to use. While it is a field guide for Western Mushrooms, and that's where it will work best, it is also useful on the east coast. The key, descriptions, and photos are great, and the introduction has great info for beginners. Unlike many mushroom field guides, the author doesn't see condescending or have numerous disclaimers due to fear of lawsuits.It is not as comprehensive as some other guides, and a serious mushroom hunter will probably want some other ones as well, this book is the best to start with. It helps you learn some of the most common edible mushrooms, and gives you a good foundation to learn other ones. I sometimes bring several field guides with me, and I usually check this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nets are not removable, difficult to clean","review":"These mesh feeders are messy, but there is no way to feed a 6 month old that isn't.

Sassy also sells replacement nets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his favorite","review":"My son didn't like this very much. It seemed very cumbersome to put a piece of fruit into the net. Often times the fruit would be too small and it moves around in the net too much and hard for the baby to eat it or the fruit would be too large and it won't fit into the net. I almost have to cut it up perfectly so it's snug and baby can get to it easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure","review":"My son started teething about 2 months ago.

Not sure if I will ever put anything but the ice chips because it would be really messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very difficult to clean","review":"Good concept, but very messy...not only when the baby is sucking on it, but afterwards, trying to clean it is a nightmare..I tried it with fresh banana today for the first time, and spent over half an hour trying to scrub out the fiber!

Haven't had too much trouble cleaning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Idea, Do Not Buy","review":"I thought these sounded like a good a good idea but it turned out to be completely weird. You put food in the little net and then the baby is supposed to chew on it and suck the food out. However my kids all found it strange to have the net in their mouth and nothing we put in these made the kids want to use them. We threw them away shortly after purchasing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Hard to clean I'm tempted to toss them!","review":"These are so incredibly hard to clean that I'm at my wit's end! I've been using them for about a month and it's kind of insane how much time I spend cleaning them out - before AND after I put them in the dishwasher...GRRRRR Munchkin needs to think before they put giant fabric seams in a fruit-containing product. Please re-design this with a plastic cage, Munchkin!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wrote more reviews on WhenKidsRock.com","review":"Have you ever want to give your child new food but you are scared that they might choke? Or has your child ever been teething so bad that they're in so much pain and Baby Orajel doesn't help the pain? Well, the Fresh Food Feeder by Munchkin will solve your problem. You can give your fresh frozen fruit or vegetable to try or place ice in it to use for teething. The mesh bag will prevent your baby from taking pieces of food too large where they can choke. You don't have to worry about your child taking the feeder apart too as it's pretty sturdy once you lock the ring to the mesh bag. Why use Baby Orajel when you can use something more healthier or fresher.The only downside to this product is the cleaning. While it's great for feeding your child, food can get stuck in the mesh holes. It can get a little tricky to clean it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby won't use this","review":"I've tried offering this to my baby several times beginning at 6 months. She is now 9.5 months and still won't use it. I put banana in it, her favorite food and try to show her how to use it to eat it. But she is just not interested. She didn't even really want to play with it as a toy. Also the price they are charging here is too high. I found it for several dollars less at Target."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more choking","review":"We received two of these as baby shower gifts and my 10 month old LOVES them...he started using them around 6 months. I would highly recommend these to anyone. I gave it four stars because it can be tricky to get all of the food particles out and it can be a little messy. That isn't a major problem though because let's face it, a baby learning to eat is going to be messy no matter what you give them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great with ice cubes!","review":"Putting ice in these makes easy clean up (run in through the dishwasher) and provides a GREAT teething toy and entertainment for our daughter.I love to have one with me while we are at a restaurant---Overall this has been a FANTASTIC tool for us and I recommend it.The only cons:if you put food in them, they can be gross to clean (thus the ice cube)her shirt gets wet when she sucks on itthere is no case to put it in before she has it or after she is done (I just bring a ziplock bag)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY !!!","review":"The name is \\"pack of two\\", the product came in only one.

Do NOT buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I agree with others who say this is impossible to clean. I used it with grapes, no problem. I then tried bananas and literally can't get it clean. I hand washed it, then stuck it in my dishwasher inside-out. Still not clean. There are black pieces of banana stuck in the mesh. I threw it away. With the remaining feeder (it came in a 2-pack) I guess I'll stick to grapes, apples, pears. Definitely no bananas. What a disappointment. Would never recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean","review":"I bought 4 of these for my son who is teething.

I was concerned because of that and threw them all away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea. VERY hard to clean.","review":"Our son liked squishing banana out of this, however it only gets one star since it's impossible to clean quickly. Baby products must be easy to clean fully or they don't get used. Preferably they should easy to take apart and load in the dishwasher. I stood over the sink for 10 minutes plucking banana fibers from the mesh. That's a nightmare scenario for a baby feeding tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a baby who has already started eating","review":"my son is 10 months old (has 1 1/2 teeth, lol) and likes to eat fruit, veges, meat, etc... he likes it when we put bits of food on his high chair tray so that he can pick them up and eat them himself. i thought this would be a great product for him but he never really took to it. he tried it once or twice and just gave it this weird look, like what is this? (even though he'll put almost anything else in his mouth) he's used to eating real food so he's probably not willing to put up with the thick netting to get to the real food.by the way, after buying this at this ridiculous price on amazon, i saw the SAME EXACT 2 PACK at target for $1.39!!!! I couldn't believe it. sometimes target just has random items for super cheap prices. since this product has such great reviews, i did get a couple for some of my friends. it seems like a good product for little ones who are just starting out on solids. so maybe for 4-6 month olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's true. One-time use only.","review":"Yes, I read all the reviews saying that these are impossible to clean. I thought: oh I'm not some OCD clean freak; plus I'll clean it right after use, unlike all those OTHER people. Silly me! Everyone was right. You know how they sell those bottle brushes, complete with nipple brush? That's because we don't want bacteria in our babies' foods, right? Since they don't sell a brush in the world that could clean this thing, there is really no way to get it clean. And I don't want my sweet boy ingesting some banana from last week. It was fun for a one-off experiment! But we like to be more sustainable than one-off excursions into plastic. Oops. Humble pie is mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces of Mesh fray from edges of seam","review":"When I first bought the fresh food feeder I was so excited to have my daughter try it out. I washed the two feeders in the top rack of the dishwasher before use and then took them out to dry. Before I went to use them I was straightening out the bag and I noticed that the edges around the seam fray and little pieces of the mesh come off. I, unfortunately, will be returning this product to the store because of this flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety testing not complete; Too hard to clean","review":"I'm in agreement with the other reviewers that these are way too difficult to clean. There are banana bits that seem impossible to dislodge from the seam and around the ring! I also just read a review that this product hasn't even been fully tested to meet requirements for California Prop 65, which alerts consumers to potentially harmful products. Yes, Munchkin claims the product is BPA-free, but there are other unhealthy additives in plastics. Combine that threat with the fact that some of the other parents who have noticed the possibility of ingesting small threads from the mesh and it's just NOT WORTH THE RISK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Okay, anyone that comes to my house will quickly see, I'm not a neat freak. Not in the slightest. These were so messy! I know, I know. It's kindda the deal, but I just didn't realize how big a mess it made. Plus, stinker just didn't get into it. He'd rather mash it into the floor than suck on it. Maybe he was too little? Dunno. But these are going in the trash. They just seem like a good place for germies to live. I couldn't really get them clean. Seemed like they always had a little old food living in them. Kindda like a old kitchen dish cloth. Bleh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have item!!!","review":"I just ordered 2 more of these for my 8 month old. I use them all the time.

I would definitely recommend these to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves these!","review":"I think these are great and so does my baby, yes they are a pain to clean but here are my top tips!1. Clean as soon as baby finishes (if you leave it for long it's not pleasant) - under hot running tap - turning inside and out scraping along seems takes a few minutes but comes up nice.2. Use frozen banana in it not fresh, baby will love it and it cleans up easier!Babies can use handle really well, and feeding themselves is great.This is my second set, they're great ( my baby now 6.5 months)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great place to grow BACTERIA!","review":"I'm amazed that this thing can not be taken apart to be cleaned properly!

But WOW are they messy. I've thrown two away because I can't get the banana mush out of them. Any tips? I've put it through the dishwasher a number of times and tried to scrub it out with a brush. If I have to buy and toss, I will because they're that great but there has to be someway to clean these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"The use of this allows baby to sample table fruits on his own with out chance of choking. Gives him the taste and allows him to hold it, keeping him occupied on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product!","review":"A friend sent us these feeders and we absolutely love them! My 6 month old can't get enough of it. We have put all sorts of fruit in the feeder and while it can become a little messy it's a great way for her to feed herself. My only wish would be that it had a tie that you could put around the wrist so that she wouldn't drop it so much! I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has potential","review":"I bought this product for my daughter when she was younger. At first, it seemed like the greatest thing every. She was able to gum on all kinds of fruit and some freshly cooked meats.After a few uses, I decided that they were not worth the money. My daughter loved having strawberries in this product. However, the strawberries are extremely difficult to clean out of the mesh. After about 4 washes, one of the meshes started to tear apart.This product is a good idea, however I will wait for improvements before buying again for myself or a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mesh Not Replaceable","review":"This worked pretty well the first time with my 6.5 month old - he seemed to like it and was able to get a fair amount of banana through it. However, the mesh nets are not replaceable on this brand, unlike on some of the other brands (Sassy, Nuby, and BabySafe feeders). This is a major problem because eventually you will want to replace the net. It is just too hard to clean out all the goo since the net is permanent. I attempted to detach the net by pulling out the little plastic locking ring, but now it won't reattach fully. I think you're better off with one of the replaceable net systems. Also, a cap would be nice for on-the-go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, what a mess and not worth the trouble!","review":"I tried this product with my first daughter & thought it was a fabulous idea. The feeder is a pain to clean & a mess when juice from produce collects. Just give your child a sugar free popsicle or spoon & bowl or let them dig in to the snack with their gums/teeth and fingers. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really suck to clean","review":"I was so paranoid about my first child choking to death, we got these but eesh. So not worth the trouble. I'd rather just sit and watch him eat than mess with the half hour of trying to clean these things out. Think the dishwasher would do it? Nope. Don't waste your money, these suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to be cleaned!!","review":"The concept is great, but after one use you are unable to clean it properly and who has time w/a small child to be repeatedly cleaning this thing. I would not recommend this to a friend although I loved the idea. I tried rinsing immediately after use but there was always food stuck in the mesh...ran it through the dishwasher..still food in the mesh..tried pulling it out by hand..still food stuck in the mesh. My baby is past the age of using so I have no need for it anymore but I hope someone has come out with something more practical that doesn't require a ridiculous amount of effort for one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Brands Out There","review":"This is by far the worst feeder bag on the market. It is impossible to clean, unlike the brands where the bag can be removed. Try the Kid Co. Baby Steps. The bags can be removed for thorough cleaning which means you can buy new ones if they start to look worn. Feeders are a great idea to introduce new flavors to babies without the risk of choking. You can also make cold \\"teethers\\" with frozen breastmilk. Highly recomended, just not this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"child wont use it","review":"my son would not use this. i'm assuming it's the texture of the mesh he doesnt like. he liked chewing on the handle more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean - Mesh always had food bits in it","review":"While initially we loved this product (our 7 month old went to town on some orange and banana), we have now thrown all of ours away.Put simply, we could not get them clean. I soaked them. Washed them. Scrubbed them. Put them in the dishwasher. All for naught.Tiny bits of food particles still clung to the inside of the mesh. Gah.The amount of time I've spent trying to get these suckers clean just isn't worth it. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies not into jars-- just avoid bananas","review":"I originally bought this 5.5 years ago for one of my children. I put bananas in it and it was horrible to clean. I ended up throwing it away within a couple uses. This time around we've avoided bananas and it's worked wonderfully. My 8 month old has had avocado, apples, grapes, clementines, and strawberries in it. No issues with cleaning it. If you have a little one that wants normal table food this may be a good compromise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not practical","review":"First, the netting is too long. My daughter tried to suck it into her mouth and ended up gagging on the netting everytime. Also, the seam on the netting is very thick and the overage on the netting inside makes it difficult to clean. This product is reasonably priced and looks cute, but the last thing I want my daughter associating with fruit is the gag reflex."},{"rating":"1","title":"they are too hard to clean","review":"These NEVER comeclean. Scrubbing, dishwasher etc. nothing works. The Sassy teethers with the removeable and replacement bags are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and impractical","review":"I bought this thinking that baby will have a way to feed himself because he wants to eat/drink by himself.

But my girl doesn't like it at all. When I put it in her mouth, she immediately throw it out. I guess she doesn't like the cloth like texture.When I try to clean it up and save it for future, I found that it is impossible to clean it completely. Some food color dye on the mesh permanently. I guess that is the reason they make the mesh in different color to try to hide this issue. I am sure those left over food color will become bacteria. I decided to trash it right away.

We held off giving her solid foods for a little longer than usual because she has had some sensitivies while nursing & we wanted to make sure she was in the clear. I thought once I started offering her solids she'd be ready but hasn't been terribly interested in being spoon fed at all. On a whim I picked up this fresh food feeder & put a hunk of a peach in it. She took a little while warming up to it but then started nomming on it like a monster. She loves the way the mesh & cold fruit feels on her gums! It got a little messy so I wouldn't put anything in it that may stain.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is that the child proof opener is tough for moms to open too, especially when coated with fruit slime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Sassy's version - so much easier to clean!","review":"It took over 30 minutes of non-stop scrubbing and rinsing to clean remnants of banana from the non-removable mesh on this teether-feeder by Munchkin and later I noticed additional spots which needed more scrubbing. The way Munchkin's mesh pouch is attached to the plastic makes it very difficult to clean that top edge of the mesh. Someone recommended I try the Sassy teething feeder (also available through Amazon)which has a removable pouch, and it only took a few minutes to thoroughly clean it of all traces on smashed banana. Now the munchkin feeders, both the one I had used and the unused (from the twin pack) are going into the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean","review":"These are good in theory, but I found them difficult to clean.

However, it takes me so long to clean it, I'm ready to throw it away. I even tried to wash it in the dishwasher and there was still food stuck in the seams, soI had to spend another 10 minutes trying to get more pieces out.

I love that all of the parts are dishwasher safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is such a great product!","review":"This is my favorite invention for babies! My little one loves to chew on the feeders and taste foods that he wouldn't usually be able to enjoy. I don't have to worry about him choking, and it is giving him early exposure to the types of foods that our family likes to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd be better off with the Sassy feeders","review":"We bought one of these Muchkin Fresh Food Feeders from Target and it worked OK the first time we used it. My daughter loved 'eating' with us at dinner time and there was no concern for her chocking on the apples we gave her...but after that it was all downhill. These feeders are fairly hard to open, and since it's not a screw closure you have no way of tightening it less or more. Secondly, the mesh bags do not come out of the feeders so you'll be hard pressed to ever get all the food bits cleaned out. I would soak our feeder overnight and still not be able to get all the left over food out of it. We have since boutht the Sassy brand feeders and they are much better. The mesh net comes all the way out and is much easier to clean. Plus, you can buy replacement nets so you can get rid of them as often and you feel comfortable with. In the end I will only use the Sassy brand mesh feeders and have thrown out my Muchkin feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"well made but unnecessary","review":"As a first-time mom I was paranoid about my child choking on things, so I thought this would be the answer. Well, my daughter only chewed on the handle, so it didn't work as a feeder.As time went by and I have learned about babies learning to eat, my fears about choking have been alleviated and I have found that this is a totally unnecessary item. We still have them kicking around from our firstborn, but haven't used them with our second child.Sit them upright (no leaning back at all) and let them chew and try things. Save your money on these and buy a good board book to read together instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea, not for fruit however","review":"These are a brilliant concept but a poor execution. I bought these for my teething 5 month old, and threw in some banana pieces. Bad idea. These things are impossible to clean, food gets stuck everywhere. I tried cold mango too, same results- 3 times through the dishwasher, soaking and scrubbing cannot remove all the food bits. And I'm not super paranoid about germs, but that just seems unsanitary. Another brand recommended cleaning with warm water, vinegar, and alka seltzer, so I'll be trying that- but in the meantime, will NOT be putting fresh fruit in these.That being said, I do make and freeze my own baby food, and a cube of that is messy but provides neater cleanup of the product, so it's not a total loss.Will I buy these for my next baby? God no. Not untill the design is revamped and I don't have to spend hours picking little banana bits out of the seams."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY hard to clean!","review":"We got one of these feeders free with our Munchkin food mill. The first time I put bananas in it, I was delighted with the performance, but the cleaning afterward was awful. I soaked it, scrubbed it, put it through the dishwasher, and scrubbed again. I could not get the banana fibers out of the top of the mesh, and ended up throwing it away.I did love the mesh feeder idea, so went back to the store and found the type with removable mesh parts like these:Sassy Teething Feeder, Colors May VaryI recommend these instead because you can buy new mesh bags and not have to replace the whole device."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby won't use","review":"Haven't been able to get my 8 month old to use these.

The taste and feel of the mesh is not very pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for chewers!","review":"My baby is 7 months old. We've been using these for a couple months now and they are great at pacifying him! All of the teething rings that we keep in the freezer make his little hands so cold, so these are a great alternative for a baby who is teething. We bought a big bag of frozen fruit to use in these and have found that he likes the peaches the best. We tried fresh fruit (strawberries & bananas), but those not only created a huge mess on him, but it was extremely difficult to clean the bananas out of the feeder. I literally had to scrape the little pieces off with my fingernail AFTER running it through the dishwasher and then trying to wash it by hand with a bottle brush. So we're sticking with the frozen peaches. I'm actually on here to buy a second pack of 2 today so that we always have a clean one available."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I LOVE the idea of this product but the material makes it very difficult to clean out.

I threw them out after 2 washes from frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck in a sack","review":"I knew several people that used these and loved them, but they were more of a hassle for me. I put in a few different foods to try and all of it ended up being mush in a sack.My daughter would try it, lick it then toss it on the floor where it would squish all over the place. And don't get me started with cleaning this nasty thing. GROSS!In theory the feeder sounds great but functionally its gross and traps food in places. blah! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Not into teething rings, but enjoys this","review":"My daughter, 9 months, has never been into teething rings, but she enjoys this. I actually put frozen baby food (carrots, peas, etc...) in the pouches and let her knaw on it. (Healthy and fun!). The only downside that it can get messy.

When trying to clean them I got so frustrated because I'd have to rinse out as much food as i could then I'd have to let it dry so i could get all the rest of the food out before I would wash them again.We kept them for now but we bought another brand that has removable mesh bags.

I had Amazon call me and got great customer service from a guy who looked up every one of my items and found that this was the one subject to Prop 65. He sent me a return label so i could send it back for a refund on their dime. great service!Prop 65 makes manufacturers tell consumers (in california) that there are potentially harmful/toxic substances in their products.Needless to say, i was shocked that this would be in baby gear especially from Munchkin, as they are usually bpa-free etc.So, be warned, as this is the last thing i would put in my baby's mouth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheds Plastic","review":"We had misgivings about letting our baby chew one of these, but we finally gave him some apple in the Munchkin feeder.

I threw it away after one use. A couple of weeks ago I bought the \\"Baby Safe\\" version also available on amazon and I love it! Ok, it too requires some special effort to clean but it breaks down in a way the munchkin doesnt allowing better access to the ring for cleaning AND allowing replacement 'mesh' Buy the 'starter pack' with 2 rings and 2 extra mesh.

Thats the only problem with this one. You can wash it in the dishwasher or by hand, but its still a little unclean and unsanitary. Otherwise its so great for feeding baby and he can hold it very well, but being a mom of 5, I have tried everything and the one with the disposable mesh is alot better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use this product!","review":"This product has been slammed by paediatricians, lactation consultants and speech therapists. Using this product distorts the way a child learns to chew, process lumps and swallow food. Further more, allowing a baby to graze using this product (essentially chewing on a cud) will lead to tooth decay. The only purpose this thing is good for is allowing a baby to suck on ice chips when teething, and even then they can get the same effect from chewing on a teething ring. Not worth it. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept","review":"This is a great concept but by the time my kid could chew the food through, he developed teeth to chew through the mesh. This was fun because it helped us experiment, but it was better to mash the food in a bowl and serve with a spoon. I wouldn't recommend to anyone honestly. It was a great concept and had potential, but falls short in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would YOU want to eat week-old banana?","review":"I have hand scrubbed, machine sanitized and stood over the sink picking tiny pieces of week old banana out of the folds of mesh on this thing.

It's easy to load, easier to hold, and easy to open, but not too easy, even for the strongest baby, which is what you want. The juices flow right out of it and the fine mesh keeps choking hazards in the bag. You can put any kind of food in this bag for babies to try, even a piece of steak! Remember, this is a mesh nylon bag so cleaning it should be completed immediately after use so that food doesn't get dried and stuck to the bag.

I turned around 2 days ago and he had the pin and both pieces of the feeder in his hands. The pin is a plastic long piece that could cause a choking hazard.

After one session of banana, hard scrubbing by mom, a run through the dishwasher by dad, and now we're soaking in some heavy duty oxy type cleaner.....they're still not clean!!!You've got to be kidding me! This product needs a serious rethink. Parents, especially parents of mulitples can not spend their day scrubbing this product clean.It is great in concept, but horrible for real life use!

I couldn't take it away from her. :) She's been less fussy and I've been a very happy mommy! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a teething baby.

The author examines economic, political, and social events, as well as foreign policy--he presents a Canadian perspective on the U.S. Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Morton goes into detail about Canadian elections down to the breakdown of seats by party in Parliament, and the author shows how many of the social trends in America in the latter half of the 20th century also took place in Canada. Those who wish to get a basic understanding of Canadian history would do well to read Desmond Morton's informative history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously Cumbersome to Read","review":"It's as if Morton had a bunch of trivia in bullet points and he put it all in sentence form.

I just wanted to let you know that this is not the best deal for your money. If you are able to get this thing for $20 buck then I would suggest it, but It is definitely not worth $45. I soon discovered that you could receive better performance for cheaper if you purchase the Hyper 212 coolermaster HEatsink. If you purchase the hyper 212 and pay an extra $4 for another 120mm fan then you get to a grand total of about $27! And with this Hyper 212 plus an extra 120mm fan, you will receive performance that is almost 6-7 degrees Celsius cooler than the Zalman for cheaper!!!!! Only the Hyper 212 may not fit inside your case, and this is where the ZAlman may win. IF you have a tiny case and want to pay $20 more for a smaller, less efficient fan then go for the ZAlman. Overall, this product is just not priced effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your PC cools down and looks cooler...","review":"This device saved my ears, believe me. The OEM Intel fan cooler used to spin at such high revs than the buzzing was starting to drive me mad.A friend of mine told me about this excellent accessory -she has it installed in her home PC- and I get it in a rush.Problem solved. Even in the most demanding photo-processing tasks I put my PC to work, it runs smoother, cooler and more silent.Be very aware of the compatibility issues with some motherboard/chassis configurations, since it's a pretty larger device than the OEM. Check in the manufacturers site for a list of compatible main boards."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, THIS IS UNBELIEVEABLE....","review":"All what I can say is WOW, I have a P4 3.2 Prescott which is known to be an extremely hot processor, now with this beast my idle became 45c and under load is 59c and that when the Zalman fan is running at the lowest settings 1300cc to 1600cc; on my previous Intel stock fan I used to get 55c idle and 78c under load.....However I gave this baby 4 stars because installation was extremely difficult, and I mean really a pain process where actually I bleed my fingers.And just to be accurate I used Arctic Silver Grease.If your processor is too hot like mine, get this and you won't regret it, and Oh, did I tell you that the PC is too quiet now that I can hear myself mumbling!!!!And also Amazon ROCKS !!!

His release of the names of the inmates who cooperated with investigating authorities has compromised their health, safety, and welfare...even those who have been transferred out of the state of Ohio. It is my understanding that because of this, the book is not being permitted into Ohio's correctional facilities and rightfully so.Mr. Lynd has apparently allowed his aversion to the death penalty and unwillingness to hold inmates accountable for their crimes to cloud his objectivity and his sense of responsibility. The death of 10 inmates and 1 correctional officer deserved better than Mr. Lynd's self-serving effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Sided","review":"This book was written very \\"One sided\\".The other Lucasville books are much less, unbias and give a better picture of what went on those 11 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection.","review":"This is a great disc because it's lengthy, but also because it's full of groups that I would never buy a full cd of, but I like these songs.

But my favorites are from \\"The Cars\\", \\"Christopher Cross\\", \\"The Motels\\", and of course \\"Marvin Gaye\\". I think overall this is much better than similar collections.

There is a lot of talent on here and it shows. The Band sounds great. You will enjoy the music as much as the technical aspects of the drum work. \\"In a Mellow Tone\\", an Ellington tune I believe, really cooks! Neal Peart did a wonderful job with the production of this CD.This would be rated 5 stars if not for the vocal overdub on Channel 1 Suite.

If you purchase this cd, do not listen to Channel 1, EVER!! Just pretend that it is not on the cd. They took one of the greatest tunes of all time and massacred it. If you do listen to Channel 1, you will never be able to listen to the real version of it without having these stupid lyrics run through your head. However the rest of the cd is fantastic and definately worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of Buddy Rich Music","review":"This album is a prtty good collection of Buddy Rich tunes performed by some of today's best drummers. The band is great and for the most part, so are all of the drummers. There are two outstanding performances. Steve Smith on \\"Moments Notice\\" is a great rendition of the Coltrane classic. Steve blends taste and supurb technique. The other great tune is \\"Groovin Hard\\" with David Garibaldi. For those who thought Garibaldi could only do well in a fusion/funk setting, think again. This tune smokes. Dave Garibaldi shows that a solid, creative drummer can play anything well. Other good tunes are \\"Time Check\\" with Dave Weckl and \\"Standing Up In A Hammock\\" with Marvin Smith. Although Marvin really shines brighter on Burnin for Buddy Volume 1 when he plays \\"You Gotta Try.\\" This is a good collection for those who are familiar with Buddy's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been a 2-CD set instead of separate albums","review":"If you liked Vol. I, then Vol. II is a natural choice. It is an excellent album; however, I gave it only 4 stars because it is comprised of the overflow of recording sessions that wouldn't fit onto Vol. I. Obviously, the best songs were picked for the first volume, but don't let that hinder you from buying this one as well. It is still worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work in my case","review":"I recently got home to New England after a 12,550-mile motorcycle ride. The vest didn't work for me. It just made me feel soggy, not much cooling effect at all. After the vest was soaked in water the fabric felt slimy.

They were happy to give me a refund, no trouble, even though I had bought the vest more than 90 days earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me cool in 95 degree heat on a motorcycle.","review":"I first used the vest on a motorcycle trip across eastern Montana in lateAugust. Temperatures were in the mid 90's and we were riding at 75 mph.The vest kept me very cool. At that speed and temp it dried out quite abit after 2 hours. I re-soaked it and was good to go. It does take up alittle space when stored wet- about like a pair of chaps. I would definite-ly recommend the vest to anyone who rides in hot weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast","review":"Product claims of 5-10 hours cooling are a wee bit exaggerated if you are going to use this for hot weather motorcycle riding. I have used it several times over the top of a mesh Kevlar shirt. When worn outside other clothing like this, the evaporation rate is way too fast. It was bone dry within 45 minutes. Next time I will try it under the mesh shirt.My other dislikes include (1) the shorty cut in front that doesn't come down to the waist when standing up. Otherwise, it makes a great blue collar fashion statement. (2) the front lower edges fold up in the wind on the motorcycle, exposing additional midriff.I suppose it would function better underneath a mesh shirt or riding jacket where it can't be seen, the wind can't catch it, and the evaporation rate is slower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingersoll quality","review":"Great drill, the trigger is great letting you easily control the speed, not as powerful as others its size, but a very well made tool for the right job."},{"rating":"2","title":"13,000 Questions with 13,000 Answers.","review":"This review is based on the two books I own. 10,000 Garden Questions, Answered By 20 Experts, Volume 1, Third Edition 1974. 10,000 Garden Questions, Answered By 20 Experts, Volume 2, Third Edition 1974.

Everyone that reviews it says the same thing and i agree but where i am different is that I think the last two tracks, \\"Prayer\\" and \\"Overemphasizing\\" are the best tracks on the cd. i saw them open for Dream Theater and bought this CD and I still listen to it now in 2005. Prayer hits me so emotionally that i cry damn near every time i listen to it and i am covering it on my upcoming solo album (watch [...]for Brandon Crow) if you love hard rock with a melodic edge and a trace of prog excess, than buy this CD if you don't, you should stick to Britney and N' Sync."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album","review":"It's a shame this Canadian band bit the dust.

Mary Lorson has quite a voice, and the notes she can reach will rival that of any other woman you've heard. The first track \\"My Star\\" has this mysterious sounding percussion and, coupled with Mary's voice, will hook you for the rest of the disc.

The book is fun. I have enjoyed reading all of Jo Nesbo's books. I highly recommend them. They are amazingly inventive, literate. The main charater, Harry Hole, is basically a mess at times.

I really enjoyed this film. While the protagonist did not have the physical characteristics that are commonly associated with a leading man (a fact the character contends early in the film), he has great stage present and a range that runs the gamut of human emotions. He's an antihero at best but you become totally enthralled with his plight and share in in his bewilderment as we navigate sharp curves and hidden agendas throughout the course of the film. Overall, not a bad way to spend two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense movie","review":"When someone gets hit by a speeding semi, falls off a cliff in a pulverized car and wakes up with a few scratches, you know the movie is bollocks.

Anyway, a movie from a book is not usually good (take the Hunger Games for one!). But this movie is so good that it is like reading the book all over again (OR put it another way, reading the book is just like watching the movie). Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enoyable foreign film.","review":"Somewhat offbeat film from Norway. I enjoyed the cynical story of a hero (or anti-hero) who is cultered, self-confident, and able to overcome his lack of height by marrying a gorgeous blonde who is far taller than he is. The hero is also a thief who steals art to support his rich life-style. When the hero meets another thief who is also ruthless, you begin to bond with the hero in his struggle to stay free and alive and out of prison. Will the hero be able to keep his gorgeous wife? Will he be able to overcome his ruthless adversary? Or will his luck run out, and he will be taken down by the law for his past crimes?Not a great film.

I decided to see this movie because I had nothing else to watch and I am so glad that I did! Don't let the fact that this movie has english subtitles keep you from missing a very good movie! I am not going to get into what this movie is about because other reviewers have already covered the basics of this film.

You will smile really big, and the next evening watch it again. It's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice forests","review":"There are some attractive second growth woodlands in this film - our unattractive, dishonest, self-centered, whining leading man spends a lot of time running through them to make his rather implausible escapes. It was hard for me to imagine the beautiful blonde could have or should have ever cared for him. I am sure there is some satiric intention here aimed at the corporate world but I found it all rather predictable, not suspenseful. Keep your money to save up for a good painting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiplash plotting keeps you guessing","review":"As a fan of Jo Nesbo's books this film is not about Harry Hole - but it is no less satisfying. The plot is engrossing and the twists keep coming ensuring that the viewer is constantly on the edge of their seat wondering where the story goes next.

Mighty Joe Plum has put together a fine album, I mean this is what rock is all about. Take the song \\"Lumberjack\\", ever since the first time I heard this song I can't get it out of my mind, this song is a theme of it's own-so look out all you Paul Bunyan want to bees. \\"Live Through This\\" may have been the hit single but other tracks on this album are not far away from being potential hits too.

So do yourself a favor and make MJP a regular in your cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"More horrible corporate radio rock","review":"A friend of mine recently lent me this cd and God is it awful. It is just more of the same horrible corporate radio garbage in the vein of Live and Collective Soul that was popular in the 90's. The only difference is that those bands could write a melody whereas Mighty Joe Plum cannot. Each song repeats the same 3 chords over and over for 3 to 5 minutes without any development. All the while you are treated to the lovely vocals of Brett Williams which sounds something like a 1973 Duster without a muffler. The last song \\"Please\\" is especially horrible in this regard as you hear his bantering the same word for over 6 minutes.

Got to know Wagner from the classical Furtwangler cycle, for many the best Wagner music ever recorded. Although Furtwangler is exceptional I do not think that it can surpass these accounts of Klemperer's Wagner. The sound of my CDs is not that great (something that probably has been fixed in these CDs) but the music is illumining in every instance. If you listen to this Tannhuaser you will understand what I am talking about. The Philharmonia Orchestra under Klemperer works miracles as always. A must have for every music-lover, even if you hate Wagner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"I've loved and cherished these performances for nearly 35 years. Much has been said about Wagner's merits (or lack of them) for over a century and a half. When the music is played as Klemperer and his orchestra play it here, there's little doubt as to why The Master had such an enormous impact on so many in his time.Just sample the Entry of the God's into Valhalla or Siegfried's Funeral March or the incandescent Prelude to Parsifal. They're among the most sublime, noble, and epic recordings of anything you'll ever hear. Rather sad that within the vast bulk of the recent film version of The Lord of the Rings there's not a single moment that equals these three short pieces. What's the point in all that we create these days if we can't plumb a depth now and then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely useful book","review":"Writen by two experts, both of them professors at IMD, Lausanne, Switzerland, this book offers family businesses very practical advice on setting up governance systems.

As a clemson student I thought that this book would be a good read. However, there was so many small mistakes in the book. For example, some of the percentages did not add up to 100. Also, many words were used improperly.

His errors on military structure (a sergeant, which is a non-commissioned officer, is trying to make \\"non-com\\" -- hello, he already is one) and paleontology (saying T. Rex never got further south than Colorado, when remains have been found in Texas) really set my teeth on edge. The military etiquette mistakes grated on me as well. I also had problems with his \\"creation science\\" stance, but if you're religious that probably won't bother you. However, even most creation science people have admitted by now that all the supposed dinosaur-man trackways are just dinosaur trackways or outright fakes, so having a character in the book who really ought to know better saying that there are several such sites was also annoying. Other than that, it was an almost decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced","review":"Tonopah was a fast paced, easy reading book.

Plays kind of like a Kruder & Dorfmeister, but with an otherworldy obscure sound that may at times put off the casual listener. My only problem is that Yokota has mixed 25 tracks into 60 minutes - and standouts (IMO) like 310's St. Mesa Substation and The Sons of Silence's A Grain of Sand, are too darn short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Goldsmith Review","review":"This book provides tangible evidence that local citizens are best able to solve local problems.

As mayor, Mr. Goldsmith worked with grass roots organizations and neighborhood groups to find workable solutions to the nagging problems that often plague our cities. In this book Goldsmith outlines the steps that were so successful during his administration. I would recommend this book to any not-for- profit or community groups looking for a road map for making their own search for local solutions a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little bag!","review":"This fun bag is just adorable! The bag and license plate are a lot smaller than what I expected, but then I remembered that it goes on a child's bike, and not an adults! So the size is just right. The materials are pretty good and the workmanship looks nice and sturdy, something that can stand up to my three year old nephew's abuse! Also, the bag itself has shoulder straps on it so it can be used as a backpack as well.

It has become my favorite of all our dvds. I even rewatched the first three seasons of it with a sister who visited us, and she is hooked on it as well. The characters are delightfully human, and the plots are so well written. I can say that one of my favorite activities now is \\"going to the glen\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful series from the BBC","review":"Monarch of the Glen is a wonderful series from BBC. Endearing characters, beautiful setting, creative storylines focusing on family, friendships, loyalty, and love make this a delight to watch. The first 4 seasons are strong, but after some cast changes, seasons 5 and 6 are weaker, with no fault to the actors themselves. The writers attempted to \\"replace\\" some characters who had left but were generally unsuccessful; the one exception being Paul replacing Archie. However, season 7 wraps things up nicely, and once you're hooked, you really have to watch the entire series all the way through, no matter what. I couldn't help but think why more series such as this couldn't work on American television, the one exception being Northern Exposure. NEX fans will love this show. Watch and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Being a Gael the series was sweet and sour to me. The program itself is wonderful. Those who enjoy the good times and the bad in this glen full of many \\"characters\\" will appreciate this grand collection. The sour is that this scene is too real for many of us, with our own Clan Chiefs being raised in areas outside the West Highlands and Islands and not fully caring about those locals who choose a life in their family's home areas. The wonderful thing for me is that the \\"big house\\" is still a part of this non existent MacDonald family and Clan, and that poor Archie, with all his faults truly cares...the only soil my own Chiefs own today in Appin is the soil they are buried in and I think of it often. Cheers to you Archie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shirt","review":"I bought this shirt for a Twiztid fan and he loves it.

Based on input I received from librarians, they were excited that a book is available that is written in a way for young children to understand Alzheimer's Disease as they interact with family members. The illustrations were extraordinary and helpful as characters and the storyline was developed. It depicted a simple, realistic, relatable experience a young child goes through in dealing with this disease. The supplement was an important and useful tool - especially afterwards with all the questions...a real aide to librarians! This book is just what our district needed to explain Alzheimer's Diseases to our students."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say-it's a triangle!","review":"My daughter bought this as a present and a gag gift for her brother.

This story of the origin of Mosquitoes is based on Ojibway legend. It has suspense and humor.....and not enough suspense to really frighten children. The Native American imagery is not mawkish and children today can feel kinship with the heroine. The pictures are good. We enjoy rereading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fictional take on history","review":"Sacagawea is a young girl when this story begins, and is captured by the Minnatarees in the first chapter. The book continues with her captivity, marriage, and journey with the Lewis and Clark expedition. I think it is interesting if you are looking for fiction in this setting, but not if you want the facts. None of the history I have read substantiates any kind of romance between Sacagawea and William Clark, for example.Also, the book seems geared to children about the age of thirteen, as that is Sacagawea's age for most of it. I would not recommend it to children that young, as I think the themes of her marriage and attraction to William Clark are too mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written!!!","review":"Scott O'deal has did it again!! He has written so many books, all of them seem like classics to me. \\" Streams to River, River to Sea\\" is one of them. He blended history into a well told tale of Sacagawea and of the Lewis and Clark adventure. I read this book as fast as I could only to find the end the best part.

I recomend you read this book soon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a journey down the Missouri...","review":"This book is about the courageous Sacagewea who isthe Indian guide for Lewis and Clark's expeditiondown the Missouri River.

This is an excitingtale and I would recomend it to anyone who isinterested in Native American history, or the journeyof Lewis and Clark."},{"rating":"1","title":"schoolgirl romance","review":"I read this book before allowing my eight year old daughter to read it. While engaging reading as an introduction to the Lewis and Clark saga, I found the fictional romantic sub-plot troubling. It advances the idea that the chief(only?) motivation of Sacajawa in pursuing the journey, as well as the woman's acts of courage chronicled in the journals, was her pursuit of the affections of Captain Clark. While arguably this romance between the two might have existed, it hardly does justice to the heroine to ascribe such weight to what boils down to a schoolgirl crush. It sends a negative message, I feel, to the young girls who read it. One might reasonably conclude from this novella that the only credible reason for a woman to become an explorer is the search for the love of a good man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Music!!!!","review":"If you are a jazz fan,this is an excellant recording for you.At midnight,and News from the blue's are very good,as is the rest of this recording.One of my favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"Granted, this is a great collection of songs from a great era.

It looks to have been trimmed off of a large sponge because it is so loosely arranged and has little solid body to it. I don't know how the other reviewer could have possibly cut it in half to use as two sponges.

What I liked best were the quirky plots and the still quirkier people. But quirky should not imply \\"funny\\" - these tales contain sadness, depth and heartbreak. \\"Lindow Man\\" is one of the best - an archeologist is studying a recovered body from the bogs, a prehistoric man, when he meets his future wife. Upon marriage she becomes ill and dies. He is drawn to the bog and attempts suicide only to choose life at the last moment. \\"Pipistrel\\" is also a tour de force. A boy who has sonar abilities (like a bat) enters a cave and his mother goes in after him...eerie but satisfying.There is an art to writing short stories and make them both interesting and \\"complete\\". Richard Selzer has perfected this style of writing into an artform. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!!!","review":"If you don't have a GPS or want to make sure your GPS is working properly, this is a must have.

I say little story because it only took me a couple of hours to read it, but this isn?t reflecting on the size of the volume but more on my inability to put it down once I started. I found it impossible to drag myself away from Nepenthe, an orphaned translator in the royal library, Bourne, her magician apprentice lover and the young queen Tessera, for whom the thorns mean the end of her reign and possibly her life.While not an epic by any means ALPHABET OF THORN is a darn good story, well written and rich in characters and character development.
