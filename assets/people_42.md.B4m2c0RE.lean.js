Perhaps this books greatest asset is its thesis of how Hebrew fiction fluctuated between supporting the Zionist meta-script and rebelling against it. Hebrew fiction in the State of Israel could act as an agent to foster group identity and patriotic cohesion and also to illustrate alienation and subversion of the Zionist vision. The book, if anything, tends to be a bit reductive. There are too many hasty judgments in one or two paragraphs of an entire writer's work. But overall, this does not mar the book's usefulness.

I would like to read more books from this author, particularly if they were tightened up a little, some of the text is long-winded. A few spelling errors in the kindle text make me wonder if this was converted and somebody missed the errors in the proofreading, but nothing too annoying - I am just particular.A good, light read, recommended if you enjoy the genre, I would give it three and a half stars if possible, rounding up because of the author's obvious love for her cast of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better alternatives","review":"This dictionary might seem fine if its the only Kanji dictionary you've seen.

It feels velvety and is well-filled with something that feels like tiny little beads that are easy to make conform to your lap position. There is even a little zipper pocket there to hold a few pens, pencils, erasers and such.For me, it's just the right size for sitting in bed and making lists, writing a letter, or even using my laptop.It's pretty, sturdy, well-designed, well-made and the right size for what I want to do. Can't beat that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Sharp","review":"I recently bought this product for my boyfriend and he loves it! His laptop gets extremely hot and when he puts it on his lap, it's ridiculous. After I bought this product for him, he can use his laptop much more often.

And as an added bonus-- it looks great; the wood is very attractive! I've had no problems with the bean bag cushion underneath like some have, you just have to take care of the product. Essentially it's a piece of furniture, you're only responsibility is respecting it like you would anything else.It has a convenient little zipper for whatever (i.e. pens, pencils) It's also big enough to have a little bit of room for a mouse, which is a plus when you're tired of using the trackpad.Overall, I'm very happy with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband and was very disappointed.

It starts out in full scope ratio (although not anamorphic) but when the titles end, back to 1.33 pan and scan we go! Additionally, the Columbia pictures logo is missing. Amazon doesn't mention what the aspect ratio is supposed to be so you kind of assume it will be the native ratio for the film. Especially when the cover art screames \\"CINEMASCOPE!!!!\\" in letters as big as the stars names. The big attraction here, aside from Ms. Eckberg, is a big screen experience with lots of battle scenes which you will see squeezed and cropped. No excuse for this sort of thing these days.

I just loved this album, pure and simple. Muireann has an exquisite voice and it was accompanied beautifully. It was a pleasure to listen to each song. I found the review that gave a \\"1\\" rating to be mean-spirited and unfair. Even if one doesn't like the arrangement and style of an album, he or she can still acknowledge vocal talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I finally gave Muireann a try with this album because it kept coming up in Amazon's recommendations. Frankly, it's $18 I wish I could get back. She'd got a good voice, but the songs here go back and forth between solid Celtic and what might as well be Texas folk. This is a style that seems to crop up periodically amongst female Irish singers, as if some of them secretly wish they were Eliza Gylkison or Nanci Griggith, and can't be happy with who they are.The one-third of the album that is truly Celtic is fine (not great, but okay), the rest is atrocious. Long, rambling lyrics matched with a total lack of melodic sensibility, as if Muireann had written some sappy 70s poetry and then threw notes on it during the recording session.I'm not quite sure why she is getting such high recommendations. My vote, go back to Deanta or Capercaillie and leave this one in the dustbin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging for those experiencing infertility","review":"I found this book very encouraging as someone who is experiencing infertility. It's not a medical self help book, but one with short stories of other couples going through the same experience with infertility. When your on the infertility road, as time goes by and you read up about all the medical conditions and so forth, it can become quiet disheartening and sometimes it feels like your all alone, but this book dispells that and shows that everyday people also feel the same way. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Only for Fundamentalist Christians","review":"I really wish I had known this book was written about and for fundamentalist Christians-then I never would have bought it. Non-fundamentalist Christians might be put off by the Bible-thumping people portrayed in this collection of couples' accounts of their struggles with infertility. I know I was! When several women described tears making their mascara run while at church activities, images of Tammy Faye Bakker kept flashing before my eyes.This book was certainly written with the best intentions, and the people portrayed are very honest and loving (as much as you can be when you believe that all non-fundamentalist Christians, abortionists, Planned Parenthood, homosexuals, etc. will burn in hell for all eternity).Many people will certainly feel more at peace with their infertility after reading this book, and I do believe that knowing you're not alone makes all the difference.That's why I'm giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope and Help in the Struggle!!!","review":"When the professional advice isn't enough, and you've had your fill of well-meaning comments from those who haven't experienced infertility, Marlo Schalesky wants you to know you are not alone. The true stories she tells of couples who share in the collective hopes, fears, frustrations, and the comfort only God can bring will encourage your heart.Our family knows that infertility strikes at the core of what oit means to be a woman or man, it tests marriages, and shakes the faith. This honest, open, and emotionally resonant first-person collection of stories will touch your life, and if you're looking for a good dose of Christ-centered encouragement for the journey of infertility, this is it.We looked for months for a book like this, and we hope you are encouraged like we were.A very highly recommended book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Organizer","review":"I'm a Special Ed teacher, and I use these exclusively so that all of the docs aren't falling out everywhere when I pick up a file.

There is a somewhat odd song selection and flow to the song arrangement and often, Anne's voice isn't used to it's best advantage. Her voice may not be what it used to be, which is understandable, but on this CD, it seems unusually strained and harsh, which makes it a little hard to listen to. I do listen to this occasionally, but, unlike others I have, not usually more than once at a time. Also, I thought it was seriously overpriced.

The song selection on this CD is very good. The production is one the worst I have ever heard on a CD. The sound fades in and out. At the times when the sound isn't fading the production is simply bad. I listened to the CD one time and don't think I can bear listening to it again. The sound isn't that bad on the Amazon previews therefore, I didn't expect this at all. I was considering the purchase of another of Anne's recent CDs but now I am wary and may not do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Listening to this album invokes a deep sadness in me because I feel I have wasted my hard-earned money on it. Why does her voice sound so stiff and harsh in this album ? Each song sounds like a windlass with an enormous load at work; the song ends when the heavy load gets hauled in, at which moment I feel like I could breath out in relief. Instead of getting my spirit up, this album drags me way down. I'm glad there are people out there who like it, because I'll have to find a buyer for my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Classics","review":"I love Anne Murray--this is my favorite CD.

Jake Simmons helped American companies open up the Nigeria oil fields yet none of us have heard of him.

His successes and failures were accomplished with dignity, fortitude, dedicated work ethic and a quiet pride. They exemplify values that seem to have been lost in recent years.

This book is supposed to be an exegetical study. Seems to me little effort is spent on that and a lot spent on trying to dispute various doctrines (generally Calvinism). If that is the purpose for the book then I think it should have been titled that way. Shame on Prof. Reese for presenting it this way. I understand that this is generally used as a text for beginning ministerial students that are not going to study the three basic languages but rather are going to trust the word of a scholar.On a positive note I found several areas of interest, but they didn't refer to exegesis.

Absolutely fantastic.Before I purchased this item, I borrowed my friends' and tried out both the regular version and the Ultra Grip. I chose the Ultra Grip version because it felt better in my hand and my dog is relentless at fetch. The regular version is fine too, but Ultra Grip has cushioning. Whichever version you choose, if your dog is as passionate about fetch as mine, I think you'll love it as much as I do.My dog loves fetch and after a twenty plus throws, my arm would get tired and my hands were covered with slobber - yuck. The Chuckit is awesome. No more bending over to pick up the ball, no more slobbery balls and it's so easy to throw the ball farther (fewer throws more exercise for my dog). I just ordered the Pocket version of this for more portability on hikes and for backyard fetch. Unfortunately, the Pocket version doesn't seem to come in Ultra Grip, but I think it'll be fine. I'll review that once I get more time with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should","review":"I got a few laughs from the owners of the full-sized Chuckits, but it sends the ball flying nearly as far. If you have a larger sized dog, this is a good one because bigger dogs won't need to run as far as the smaller, faster dogs. I have a 1 year old German Shepherd and this works great for him.

I hardly need to bend down and it's back in the Chuckit and ready to go. My puppy was exhausted for days after our first outing with the Chuckit and the peace and quiet was pure bliss.

In the Win2000 environment my DSL connection is recognized, as is my Zip drive. Folders and files are easy to share and all in all speed is not too bad. There is some funkiness with things like 3-button mice, my trackball isn't supported and display settings can get a little wierd, but overall it makes using Win2000 easy.

You have to type the entire word into a little window, if it's correct it will place the word in the grid; if it's wrong a window pops up to tell you so, and then you have to click \\"OK\\".

I found it to be a very accurate and hard-hitting account of WW II in the Pacific Theatre.

Well, I guess this is a great workout, since I couldn't do even half the foot moves, let alone the very complicated arms. But it is super dancey. And the styling and clothes?

The apparent premise has certainly been done before, i.e., good vampires vs. bad, innocent mortals caught up in the events, philosophical conundrums, etc. What makes this novel so fascinating is the way these old themes are made new and refreshing by characters you really like and care about,as well as the amazing involvement of the character Iago. An entire novel could be done on him alone. The quality of vampire novels has diminished in recent years. \\"Never Dream\\" not only restores quality to the genre, but sets a new standard.

I have no expectations of philosphical quandaries or moral dilemmas for this series. I want action, action, action and action.

It's got some of the worst car racing physics I've ever seen, and the controls are totally user-unfriendly. The cars handle like crazy, and the A.I. of the computer-controlled racers is totally uneven and takes away the last bit of fun from this game. Don't waste your $50 on a crappy game like this. I'm already very pissed I wasted $7 renting it from Blockbuster. Even though I could have kept it for two weeks, I returned it after less than one. This game truly sucks, big time.If you want a good racer for the PSP, check out Ridge Racer, which, admittedly, is a different kind of racing experience but at least it's got good car physics models in it.

There are over 60 cars and graphics are very much like Juiced, a game for PS2. They have added 2 cars to this game and now have over 60 very different cars that you can fully customize. This game has a good career mode. One thing that was an improvement from NFSU2 on the consoles was all the extra driving around. For people who are new to NFS, in Underground 2, EA made you drive around the city to look for races mostly so they could show you all of the endorcements that the game got. Overall, this game is nearly identical to NFSU , but is in no way a port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Very disappointed in this game. Not even close to ridge racer as far as fun goes.

Smashing in to walls and cars and then winning the race is just stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Burnout but strong second","review":"Burnout beats the rest of the deep field of racing games, but if you are a huge NFSU fan, this is a nice transition to the portable. I don't own a console version of this but I have played it at friends house. There is pretty much same customization (a few less colors for paint.)

While loosely organized by topic, it reads (so far) like a book of random quotes, of which you can expect some will be gems, but you really don't know what to expect next.

Obviously it is an old film, but one watches this film to see truth, and the lack of perfect technical quality is really quite unimportant if you want to grow spiritually. If you know her life closely you will pick up on the lessons to be learned from this film. My four young children love this film, but we also speak of the spiritual life to them extensively so they are sensitive to this. We also do not watch TV which makes a huge difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate yet not","review":"First, I did not finish the film. I got through most of it, but I just couldn't get through it (explained below).The film was realistic about convent life and the spirituality of St. Therese, however, I recommend the recent one put out (http://www.amazon.com/Therese-Lindsay-Younce/dp/B000BDGVT0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1326223333&sr;=8-1) because (though it does have its problems) Therese does not come across as proud and self-righteous. Also, Miracle of St. Therese portrays the other sisters (nuns and biological) as cold, unfeeling women. I love St. Therese, but I was absolutely not pleased with this portrayal of her and the other sisters, hence my not finishing it (I had enough!) and would not recommend it at all. I think only a sedevacantist could enjoy this film, but that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Monstrous Regiment of Women\\" is monstrous disappointment","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Beekeeper's Apprentice\\" and eagerly bought \\"A Monstrous Regiment of Women\\". It is a self-indulgent diatribe, surprisingly boring, and a bad case of women's lib run amok. I called my sister to warn her off, but she had already started it and could not imagine why she kept falling asleep. I read 3 to 5 books a week (the downside of being a really fast reader) and usually 2 or 3 of them are mysteries of the manners variety. This book has no humor, less plot, pages of nothing but musings. Total waste of time and money. If you liked \\"Beekeeper\\", chances are you'll be less than impressed by \\"Regiment\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't get any better","review":"The only reason I read this book is that I had it with me while traveling.

This second book is not onlyas good as the first one, it is even better. The suprise twistat the end left me gasping for breath (I didn't realize Ihad been holding it!) and I may go mad before the next bookin the series (\\"A Book of Mary\\", due in January 97) isreleased. Laurie King has captured the essence of SherlockHolmes and developed the character of Holmes and all thewonderful supporting characers (Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft, Dr. Watson)beyond the narrow limits of Doyle's stories. These two bookshave developed such a folowing as to spawn an internet newsletter,The Beekeeper's Holmes Page, and a weekly digest, RUSS-L.DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monstrous Regiment of Women","review":"Very Disappoinnting. I enjoyed The Beekeepers Apprentice much more. I will finish it but not enjoying it. Looking forward to the next in the series and hope it will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel to Beekeeper's","review":"I enjoyed a Monstrous Regiment of Women enormously. The relationship between Russell and Holmes is perfectly understandable, especially when considering each of their temperaments. The plot itself is fascinating and seamless. Also, Mary Russell, as a young, well-educated, and also absolutely fearless woman, is a decent role model for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good...","review":"This book was good, but not as good as the Beekeper's Apprentice. Being the hopelessly wistful romantice that I am, the only thing that really kept me reading late into the night, last night, was the hope that Holmes and Russell would end up together. And although it did not have as much ingenious deduction as I had hoped for it was still a better than average book. Overall a good, enjoyable read. Definently worth the trip to the library. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for those who enjoy turn-of-the-century England","review":"Mary Russell is a compelling young woman and an unusual one for her time in history. She seems repelled by the lifestyles now lead by her female classmates from Oxford, but must join them in order to answer some disturbing questions. Mary's tensions with Holmes keep this sequel to The Beekeeper's Apprentice intriguing. King takes the reader through the grime of London, through the damp and cold, but the heat is on in all other respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romance that transcends morality and propriety","review":"It hardly bears mentioning any longer that Ms. King's second \\"Mary\\" book demonstrates all the technical skill of the first. The plotting and the characterization are excellent.I wonder though, why I am the only one disturbed by the implications of this intimate relationship between an elderly man and his minor protegee. Does Laurie King mean to imply that the only woman that Holmes could love would have to be one he created? And how sick is that?Nevertheless, I am impressed by Ms. King's treatment of the traditional Holmes mystery from a proto-feminist point of view. This juxtaposition of the world's most famous misogynist as a lover and a defender of women's rights, gives an added, compelling dimension to the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Put It Plainly","review":"This series is good. Quite good. Unto the point of excellence. I highly recommend it in its entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment I've ever encountered","review":"The Beekeeper's Apprentice was one of my favorite books ever, and when I saw there was a sequel, I couldn't wait to read it. In her first book, Laurie R. King perfectly encapsulated the Sherlock Holmes of literary fame -- in this one, she utterly destroys him. I don't want to give away plot twists, but the character is decimated and the mystery dull. I imagined that Holmes would someday adopt Russell; it would have been much more palatable than the plot twist tossed into this mess! I had to go back and tell everyone I recommended The Beekeeper's Apprentice to NOT to read the sequel -- very depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buzzing with joy!","review":"This book is an incredibly well-written, beautiful demonstration of character development and insight into two great minds! Though Holmesian purists might cringe, the relationship is entirely believable and excellently done! Love and friendship know no age! This book is one you'll never forget and will treasure forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MREG is an LRK value-vehicle, but a good read","review":"This mystery isn't as fast-paced as many, and it's rather obvious Margery Childe's sermons are a vehicle for some of Laurie King's own beliefs. However, King writes beautifully and evokes the era with great skill. The tension between Holmes and Russell, caused by Russ's doubts about their relationship, threads throughout the book and effectively links the first, shocking hansom-cab scene to the eventual dock scene. I did approve of the eventual turn R&H's relationship took. A 40-year age difference is cause for an initial squirm or two, but it really isn't as though Holmes was eighty-five. And, hopeless romantic sap that I am, Holmes and Russ make me melt. ;) Not really a purist book, but the purists can stay in the nineteenth century. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem of the Slipshod Pastiche","review":"Actually, \\"monstrous\\" doesn't begin to describe the outrageous liberties which Laurie R. King takes with the master detective in this, her second resurrection of Sherlock Holmes in her Mary Russell series. Nor does that fine word cover the extent of the disappointment which readers, your truly included, feel (or are likely to feel) after trudging through a lame plot - laced with religious philosophy that's about as subtle as being brained with a service revolver - only to arrive at a cliched ending straight out of MACMILLIAN AND WIFE. Those who thrilled to King's truly remarkable THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE will no doubt wish to discover how Mary Russell developes into her own, but be warned: this time, the game is afoot, and it's limping - badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Russell fan","review":"I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining book. It was an easy read, but also provided an intelligent look at life around that time, without coming across as purposefully 'educational'.I am completely captivated by Mary, and her relationship with not only Sherlock but other men of the period, and the scraps and scrapes she gets herself into.I am a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monstrous Regiment of Women","review":"A good read if a little drawn out on the plot lines. Do not like the character of Watson portrayed as such an idiot--too far from original character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but...","review":"The book is amusing. However, it is not a well written book: it lacks in the plot department. The story meanders and two thirds into the book one starts to wonder when the mystery is going to get momentum. Finally, close to the end, the author must have remembered that the she is actually writing a crime/ mystery story and not a church/women's lib book.I wanted to read a mystery and not some pseudo historical blah. Sherlock and Russell were of interest to me, not some full length church sermons (I'd go to church for that). I guess, I would compare it to the tabloids available at the cash register: amusing but without substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monstrous Regiment of Women is a monstrously good read","review":"The second book of Laurie King's adventures of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes is a very good read. The character development continues to entertain and delight. That which is mysterious kept me turning pages to see how Russell/Holmes solves the case. I am looking forward to the third installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not definitive","review":"Obviously, being an unauthorised biography, there is only so much that Myles Palmer could do in terms of research, so it's fair to say that he's done a very good job with the tools available. Most comments that are unsubstantiated are stated as such, and hearsay is usually clearly noted. It's a pity Knopfler chose not to assist, as he's painted in a positive light on the whole - goodness knows why he couldn't make some sort of contribution.Bear in mind that this is now relatively out of date, and therefore misses the latter parts of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this little book!!","review":"Reading a letter a day for 40 days is a great way to change your life!!

If you are a casual gamer as I am, you for sure will enjoy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Don't be fooled like I was. This is not the full version of TRIII. It is actually more of a demo. It only contains the 4 India levels. Once you complete them, game over. I guess the price should have been a clue, but I figured that it was priced low simply because the game is several years old.

The book contains recipes for breakfast, breads, soups, main & side dishes, fish & game, international, beverages, and desserts & snacks. One chapter covers equipment and camp cooking techniques. At just over 200 pages, it's chocked full of great camp cooking ideas.Many of the recipes call for dried foods, some of which may be hard to find in smaller towns.

Good animated comedy, clean fun, excellent fight scenes. The one especially at the end I thought would never end and is well worth waiting for. It certainly is reminiscent of the silent movies, almost bordering on Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckling routines, including good old slapstick humour. The female characters are good and strong but at the same time feminine and I would gladly swap places with any of them, especially when Jackie flips them up in the air during a mock dance sequence. This is good Saturday morning viewing, curled up with a bag of popcorn and one which any fan would not be disappointed to add to their collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I felt a bit embarrassed watching this.

Starring Jackie Chan with wo things on his mind... Food And Women... this terrible movie decides to try to be funny in the style that only a cartoon can show. There's no fighting until the end and even then it's all stupid. Jackie Chan gets zapped by the game Street Fighter 2 and somehow turns in to the charcters for one scene. The dubbed voices are terrible and I decided not to watch it after a certain point so I don't even know how it ends. I am a fan pf Jackie Chan but even favorites make mistakes... big ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"City Hunter (1993)","review":"This film is silly!

The one problem with an author like Tim Berra, who attempts to critique creationism, is that you can tell by his arguments he doesn't have a clue about the scientific evidence for intelligent design and special creation. He spews venom in the preface of his book that costs him credibility before you get to the first chapter of the book. He speaks of \\"creationists (who) are determined to impose their views on others\\" and then proceeds to commit the same offense from the opposite perspective. After reading the book, I must say that if someone is going to argue the scientific case for evolution, they should avoid discarded case studies and theories such as the horse fossil sequence, \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\" and the peppered moth among others. All in all, a good read and reinforcement of the creationist point of view in the same category as \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sells?","review":"Berra begins by stating his experience as an educator and then gives us \\"the end all\\" of arguments for evolution. His book not only is inaccurate in many of its principles, it is simply a repackaged freshman biology textbook mainly focusing on evolutionary biology. All I have to say is that anyone who says that whales' hindlimbs serve no function must not think excretion and mating are important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Statement of The Facts and Exposing Creationism","review":"I purchased this book two weeks ago. This is a very interesting book which outlines the scientific method step by step. The book also discounts the arguments presented by creationists.

I just wanted to inquire on why so many people can accept this belief that life so complex as the human race, and any other living being for that matter, could just happen because of one little cell having the desire to become something that could funtion as we do. The father of evolution himself said that the human eye was to complex to have evolved, and because of our eye's amazing capabilities to focus to light and colors and many other things, he said the theory of evolution was absurd, and he actually said absurd! If anybody can give me some logical reasons why I and many others should believe the theory of evolution, please post them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, without esoterica","review":"For the average person who does not have a degree in molecular biology or advanced genetics, this book is very helpful to set forth the basic premises of evolutionary theory and to debunk the 14th century, Ptolemaic worldview advanced by the creationist camp. The major complaint I can foresee creationists having about the book is the lack of need for a god in the evolutionary process. The book never takes up the question of the exitstence of God, and rightly so, since this question is irrelevant to the study of the origin of life. Berra answers the questions he sets forth to answer.

I'm still at the same point I was before getting this book. Same issues, no insights into how to fix it. It doesn't even cover setting up POP3 access for virtual hosts.If you think this book will give you an easier read than the online documentaion, don't bother. I had the online documentation open and it follows it so closely that it seems the author was simply paraphrasing the documentation. The only areas that it goes into more detail are irrelevent issues, like setting up ISDN (isn't that out of the scope of this book?) and how to run strace!Again, don't bother.

There's also a very heavy bia towards Linux, and specifically Red Hat. If the book had stuck to the focus of Postfix itself, and gone into extreme detail about topics like spam control, performance tuning, and virtual domains, it would have been a much better use of my 50 bucks.It does a fairly good job of covering the basics of configuration, but it's nothing particularly different from what's provided in the HOWTOs and other configuration docs at the Postfix website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do *not* buy this!","review":"Horrible bookSpends 50% explaining how to install Redhat and skips almost every dificult feature postfix has.

It surprises me that the clubhouse comes wih an easel and a table when none of the characters can use them!! Finally, the \\"tootles\\" and \\"Mouskadoer\\" are neat, but the telescope is missing.

Don't waste your money, you can have mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too flimsy for the price!","review":"Very cute toy, however.......Every time my 3 year old even looks at it the slide falls off, the yellow door falls off & the black door on Mickey's head falls off. Cute but very disappointed in the quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing","review":"I have NEVER seen such a piece of junk. I spent half of Christmas Eve trying desperately to get it to stay in one piece. We have the same problems with the slide and the door as the other reviewers. I am really shocked that Disney put out such a poorly designed toy, and my hope is that it was hard to find because they now realize their mistake and stopped production! This is truly the worst toy we have bought or received, and no matter how much your kids love the show, they will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter likes it but is is so poorly made","review":"My daughter was so excited to open this for her birthday. I was lucky enough to pay the regular store price for the clubhouse, had to pay extra for the figures on ebay. Considering my daughter had been pretending an old carebear house was mickey's clubhouse, this was a step up in appearance.I don't see why this toy was so expensive. My daughter who was 3 kept asking why doesn't the kutchen pop up and why isn't there a telescope out of the ears? They cretianly could have made more features. Plus as others have noted the slide and yellow door don't stay on at all.I had to give this 2 stars because my daughter loves it but it is a frustrating toy for a parent and totally overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I share the same opinion!!","review":"I usually don't write reviews, but I have been searching for the phone number to reach the company, Characters Direct, LTD, the manufacturer of the mickey mouse clubhouse. I too, paid more for it on ebay, because it was not anywhere to be found. My daughter loves it, but the workmanship is junk. Minnie is missing screws in her head, which keeps falling off. As others noted, the yellow door and the slide do not stay on. Thank goodness my two year old doesn't notice that stuff. The idea is neat. I look at the talking bases as a bonus, for she barely uses them and yes unless you have the original characters on the accompanying base, they only say one sentence. Overall, I too am disappointed. I am still searching for the contact for characters direct, trying to get screws for minnie's head and glue for the slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the kids love it.","review":"I would give it 0 stars if my kids didn't love it. I got it for my 2 year old for x-mas and my 4 year old plays with it just as much as he does, which is every day so far. Like most people, I couldn't find it anywhere except on EBAY, so I paid more then retail. Normally I don't mind, but the club house is so poorly made/put together that it isn't worth the retail cost, no less what I paid. It's bascically a peice of junk in my opinion, and like previous reviewers, I excpected much more from Disney. The characters only say one phrase unless you keep them on \\"their own base\\", the club house it's self doesn't do anything that interesting. Over all I'd say it stinks, but again the kids love it. So at least I'm getting my money's worth that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"this toy makes my son cry!","review":"my 5 year old son has autism and is love with everything mickey mouse. gramma paid double for this and the characters online just to see his eyes light up on christmas. well, they did until the box was opened and daddy was scrambling to fix the foot and the slide for him. he does not understand that they won't stay on and he comes to us every 5 seconds saying, \\"slide?\\" \\"shoe?\\". we try to fix it, it falls apart and then he starts to cry! shame on you disney... i hope you read these comments. you broke a little boys heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Toy","review":"I was happy to locate this toy for my son even though I had to pay an exhorbitant price. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Falls apart, does nothing special, no instructions to let you know what \\"talks\\", etc. - only a few phrases, impossible to find additional figures - just a worthless piece of junk! My son has barely opened it since Christmas day - money down the drain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!..........","review":"My 2 1/2 year old never misses a show, so I looked high and low for this toy. I finally found one 1200 miles from home. Got an extra suit case to toke it home. I couldn't wait to see the excitment in my sons eyes Christmas morning. Now all I see is a pile plastic sitting on the floor. He can't even play with it. As eveyone has said the slide doesen't stay on at all,(ready to throw that), and the foot just falls off. I hope this toy is recalled because it sucks. Disney you really owe the kids something for this Christmas's biggest disappointing toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo disappointed!!","review":"Thank God I didn't pay the inflated prices on Ebay! I bought the entire set (Clubhouse, animated figures and the counting car) for my son for Christmas because he has just fallen in love with Mickey lately! I was very disappointed with all of it! The slide and the foot part would not stay attached, the figures hardly worked (they had to be pushed down on really hard to do anything) and it didn't play the song! The only upside to all of this is that when I took the whole thing back and got back over $90 I was able to get some great after Christmas deals on some other toys for my son so all's well that ends well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas and finally threw it out today. He only played with it a few times because he would get so frustrated by the slide and boot constantly falling off. The sound also didn't work. I expected much more from Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprised that Disney would support a design this lousy","review":"All the reviews about poor quality are spot on. The door on mickey's head is the most annoying. They designed this thing with absolutley no way for it to stay closed!!! It really sucked to see my son get so excited to get this toy, and then get sooo upset because it doesn't work right. I hear \\"fix it Daddy\\" more than anything else when my son is playing with this. I have to use half a roll of tape to keep this darn thing together, plus the characters talk in the wrong voices half the time! I expect more from Disney than this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned the clubhouse and got her the counting car","review":"WE waited for months for find the clubhouse. I was so excited, had not read the comments. when we put it together we were so upset with it. My 22 month old was getting so frustrated everything she would push Mickey down the slide it would come apart. the door is hard to open the side door would also come off. We took it back and got the car. Its on $[...], counts and works- We are still looking for the rest of the figures, can not believe that they are so hard to come by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory book!","review":"More than a book this is a sort of personal show of the author.The book is quite useless to gain real knoweldge in the microwave engineering area.The developement of subjects is unsatisfactory because many times Mr Liao shows to you final formulas without saying much of the related derivations.The general impression is that the book tries to show too many things without really explaining anything.For a solid introduction to the microwave engineering area try instead \\"Microwave Engineering\\" by Pozar.2 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Microwave Devices and Circuits by Samuel Y. Liao","review":"Are you kitting. This is one of the best Practical book you ever have.Get one, if you're working in this field..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Edition was helpful for me","review":"I agree with the prior review that Liao's style is somewhat \\"cookbook\\". It does not have as many derivations as, for instance, Collin's classic book. There are even some logical disconnects. However, as working spacecraft payload engineer, for years I dragged a battered copy of the first edition around the world, stuck with post-it notes and tape flags at key points. When one could carry only one book along on the trip, this was it.It really bugged me to lose it so I even ordered a replacement.(First edition, of course)One has to match ones books to ones needs at the time. Liao is good if you have to get a number fast.Pozar (Microwave Engineering, 1990) is good too but has nothing in depth on vacuum electronic devices, so for that reason has not made along on as many of my trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short lifetime","review":"Similar Apacer memory stick (4GB, same casing) was in use as ReadyBoost stick and died in about a year without any forewarning.

No problems so far, and I don't anticipate any!On another note, while shipping cost me as much as the card itself, I was able to get 2 of these little guys for a little under $25 (which is still a pretty good deal)!

Siri writes about real life--and isn't afraid to tilt a few sacred cows in the process.

As a military wife, my life intersected with women different from me--and our differences deepened our friendships.

But it IS useful. I got one for our boat and it's been exactly what we need. It's made of durable and flexible plastic, so it won't break any time soon. It's bottom drain pan also acts as a lid when you stow it. So you can fit a couple of things inside it and snap the lid on without wasting a lot of space.I've used other fold-up type dish drainers and while they do save space they're often just not very good at holding dishes. This is. This will take up more space but it's worth that trade-off.So if you're looking for a decently made and well designed dish drainer for your boat definitely get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this dish rack","review":"We just purchased our first travel trailer, and while we didn't expect to, we absolutely needed this dish drainer. It makes cleaning dirty dishes a breeze. It is small enough so that you can keep it inside your sink if you'd rather dry your dishes in there rather than on the counter, or you can set it on the counter and it will drain into the sink. We have very little counter space, so it primarily lives inside one side of our sink. It actually fits alot of dishes, for its compact size. Highly recommend if you have any dishes that need to be washed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"This is a handy size for the camper - it fits in the little camper sink or sits on the counter.

It is the complete Wise protocol for training the Awakened Mind EEG pattern, not just another popular book on neurofeedback. This material is used by her students to learn how to teach this protocol and from that perspective may not be of interest to all readers.Anna gives the complete meditations used to guide people into the various brain wave states, alpha, alpha/theta, and the Awakened Mind itself. The various meditations have been carefully designed over thousands of hours of use to elicit each specific brain wave pattern as measured on the Mind Mirror. People can record these meditations in their own voices and benefit by listening to them...perhaps even develop their own Awakened Minds.The Awakened Mind EEG pattern is now discussed in most introductory texts on Neurofeedback for practitioners of optimal performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and unhelpful.","review":"I am a reader of manhy books on meditation as well with an interest in brain-waves neurofeedback etc.Throughtout this book there is a constant reference to the \\"awakened mind\\" pattern, but what it is remains not only vague but unreferenced- she claims this is the patterns of \\"masters\\" that her teacher (M. Cade) collected his data from; yet modern research clearly shows different meditations - produce difference brainwave patterns. Also, what exactly quality to her as a \\"master\\" remains unknown.I find it lacking some traditional or at least philosophical framework with which to place the multitude of meditations suggested; the fact it is associated with some 'brainwave' is too abstract to convince one to practice these sincerely.For meditation, I suggest looking at Adyashanti, or Shambhala materials.

We thought this book would help them gain a foundational vocabulary, and indeed it delivers in this area. I loved the individual pictures with the words in English, transliteration, and block text, right next to a \\"Where's Waldo\\" style large scene illustrating the use of the words. But as I began reading and looking at the book with my children, I realized that on most of the pages, the scenes showed unruly children and frustrated, flustered parents. Children are portrayed as disobedient, unhelpful, mischievous, and self-absorbed. Would it have been that difficult to create scenes wherein children were modeling good behavior instead of bad? If you do decide to buy this book, I would read it with your child and consider making the pictures into a game of finding \\"what not to do\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Stereotype!","review":"Frank is stereotyping Muslims when he writes about Sonia wanting to be a \\"good muslim girl\\".

The human mind is as vast and complex as the universe, so this book does not tell it like a literal guide when to see what and where, but it gives a location and time of the imagination. On the meditation route, there are certain landmarks that one encounters, like kilns on mountains, and this guide unequivocally reveals as it hides, but it is one to keep going back and re-reading.

He had no familial relationship with Geronimo (Golkayeh) or Chato or any other Chiricaua. He did spend a lot of time with some White Mountain Apache bands, after coming to live among them after his captors traded him off as if he were livestock. He shared the White Mountain Apache loathing of the Chiricaua.

It weaves a lot of very interesting concepts and thrills into such a tightly directed piece it is time very well spent! The acting in particular is top-notch from the four lead characters and really gives this movie a very convincing tone. It has been a long time that I've seen such a suspenseful and twisted short film and this one definitely succeeds in that area. I hope those who made this movie get the attention they deserve because this is the kind of intelligent and original productions that you don't get in mainstream Hollywood these days. If you are looking for something fast and entertaining to watch I'd give this movie a chance, especially if you are a fan of these kinds of shorts. You won't be disappointed. Very refreshing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanders in circles and then just dies","review":"This movie was done on a budget and shows it, but that is not it's main problem. As is so often the case, even with big budget films, the writing was not up to the task. The story was only crudely thought out, the pacing was very poor, and a number of times you felt like you must have missed a scene. Not that the author was deliberately jumping back and forth in time, that he messed up and completely left something out."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who love true science fiction","review":"The story, not the acting, is what truly drives this short film...forget the makeup, the settings, the budget filmaking...what this is, is a perfect example of what science fiction is really all about...the complex theories of time and space...and an ending that is absolutely the type that drives conversation of theories and speculation...any true SF fan knows that a good story is one that starts debates and even arguments on what the causes and outcome of such a situation could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible piece of work - gosh, I have watched thousands of films and finish most, but this one I ended half way..","review":"Don't bother, what a waste of a movie.

It is a terrible stupid movie, and not the enjoyable kind of terrible and stupid. Don't bother with it. Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"A very nicely-written story of first contact. Good world-building, well-developed characters, interesting plot. As another reviewer noted, despite the co-authorship, the parts are blended together into a single authorial \\"voice.\\"The book reminded me very much of Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Left Hand of Darkness,\\" in terms of style, plot structure, and its thinking about what first contact means and how to overcome its challenges.The animals were somewhat hard for me to visualize from within the book,so some readers may like to know that there is an animal-and-plant glossary at the end of the Kindle version of the book - I would like to have seen that extended to the aliens too.Highly recommended - a book that left me wanting to read more in this Universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super powerful with great mounting hardware.","review":"This is one heavy duty pump. I have a pump that is about 15 years old that I thought was a workhorse, but this blows that out of the water. I mounted it in no time (all of the hard work was removing non standard pipe sizes and installing adapters to accommodate the output into the main drain line), and it works like a charm. The pressure switch works well, but I thought my pump was DOA when I first installed it because of the hum that came from the pump when only a little water was in it. Once we started using it with our washing machine, though, it kicked into full gear, and discharges ALL of the water very nicely. It even will cycle 2 more times after the water pressure comes off the switch so you know ALL of the water is pumped out! I couldn't be happier. Best investment I could have made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump does not work","review":"This pump was easy to install but does not work well. It turns on as soon as water reaches the top of the drain which is great, but the pump will continue to cycle on/off for some time after the water is drained. I gradually closed the flow valve until the pump stopped cycling. Unfortunately, the valve has to be almost completely closed which runs the pump for an extremely long time to drain and cannot keep up with the water from the washer.If there was a way to manually adjust the pressure switch this would be a great pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money!","review":"For that price, I expected much more. You only get an overview of the camera's features. No editing tips or raw format handling tricks. Really not worth the money. Read your manual; you'll learn more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious lack of editing and proof-reading","review":"This is the first book I have read in preparation for the I-Net+ certification exam. Due to the many inaccuracies, I will have to cover at least one more prep guide before I feel ready to take the exam. While some of the chapters are well-written, the book as a whole is very poorly edited: the same concepts are described in more than one chapter, and terms and concepts are used freely before they have been explained. Also, as other reviewers have noted, there are many inaccuracies and mistakes - my favourite is the diagram of the 7 layer OSI/RM model that shows 6 layers. Additionally, the writer of the Network and Server chapters (I'm sure it's the same person) should be a poster-child for how NOT to write a technical manual - those chapters are gorgeous examples of dense, turgid and unnecessarily incomprehensible writing. I intend to use excerpts in my Technical Writing seminars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishing fodder","review":"This book respresents the worst of the certification craze - publishers trying to fill gaps in revenue opportunity rather than gaps in knowledge. The book is verbose without soul. This book reads like it was written by a pool of writers with, obvious, no first hand knowledge of the topic. Chapter 5 on HTML, \\"Understanding HTML\\" begins with the topic sentence: \\"The HyperText Markup Language (or HTML for short) is what makes the Internet graphical.\\"If you find this book at a garage sale, don't pay more than a dollar... and only look at the pictures (which is why it got 2-stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error Prone","review":"The errors that bothered me the most were those found in the practice test on the cd. Several of them were due to sloppy programming. As soon as I became aware of how many errors there were in the book as well, I never went near it again. Who needs to memorize incorrect info? Look elsewhere for more reliable help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little, Too Soon","review":"This book will not prepare you for the i-Net+ exam. It was published within a few weeks after the exam itself became available and it shows. Containing many technical errors throughout the book which can cause failure on the exam if relied upon, it does not even address the exam contents. If you rely on this guide alone, be prepared to face many unknowns on the test. The CD accompanying this book has a test engine that does not work properly either. I was so disappointed with this book that I emailed the publisher, and never got a response. As a result, I avoid any exam preparation guide released by Syngress Media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book that will get you pass the exam.","review":"Good book if you're just getting your feet wet in the I.T. industry. But Not a good source for passing the exam. I read this book thoroughly and went through all questions within the book as well as the CD-Rom. Failed the exam. So my next step involved purchasing Exam Prep and picking that apart. Passed the exam. As far as the Syngress is concerned, the consensus (regarding other certifications books they've published) seems to be that they don't have it down yet. Things like wrong answers to questions in the book and CD-Rom can lead to frustrating sessions, and as far as I'm concerned, that's unacceptible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree -- too much overlap and too fast out the gate","review":"I agree with previous who noticed this book has ALOT of overlap. In fact it got quite annoying after a while. This book could have been great had they cut the amount of pages in half (thus removing the unecessary fluff), and this would also limit most of the technical innacuracies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not helpful for the Exam","review":"This is not a good study guide. It really goes into too much depth and detail for the i-Net+ exam, which covers Internet basics. It also does not cover the exam objectives very well. Both the questions in the book and on the CD were way off base from what was on the real exam. I would recommend Exam Cram instead. It is much more relevent to the exam and to learning the basic concepts needed for understanding the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes.","review":"This would have been a great book if it weren't for the mistakes. There are too many typos, mistakes concerning the subject matter, mistakes with the practice questions...The one that was really an eye-sore was the questions about Internet Explorer that suddenly morphed into a question about Netscape? Or, the practice question on the CD were D was the correct answer because it referenced the correct answers of A & C but when viewing the answer, D is incorrect...A & C is correct! What the....?The mistakes became more apparent in later chapters and left me wishing I had waited for a better book and on-guard for the next error.Fortunately, I deal with about 70% of the material covered in this book on a day-to-day basis so maybe this is enough to pass. I feel sorry for people totally relying on this book as a source of *correct* information for the i-Net+ exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Info.","review":"Helped me pass- good info. on Business Concepts (Copyrights, Trademark law, etc.) Also enjoyed the eCommerce chapter.

Aside from the excellent lyrics and beat, the traits that stick out the most with this song are the background instruments and sounds. Many, many different types of effects (strikes, bubble guitar- you name it) coincide with the vocals to create an outstanding, all-around effect. This is definetely a headphones song ^^ Good Morning N.Y.C was alright as well, although it seemed very rushed and repetitive to me. This single also comes equipped with an outstanding jewel case design and lyricbook, and a video trailer for the Glay Expo 2001 (with Glay themselves commenting on it!) that can played back on your computer. All in all, this a very satisfying cd which I highly recommend adding to your collection :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but very cheaply made!","review":"The picture makes this costume look alot nicer than it is.

I've never played the actual 40K game but didn't feel confused by any aspect of this book. In fact, this book did a lot to bring the situation in the 40K universe into sharper focus. By telling the story from the perspective of Eisenhorn, Abnett is able to portray the Inquisitor's true feelings and gives the whole story a very personal feel. It must have been harder to write the book in the first person, but I think it enhances the power of the story.As in other Warhammer books, this one is non-stop, page-turning action. While sometimes predictable, this book is in no way boring. All of the characters are great and the plot is intense. The dark vision of the 40K universe is compelling and unique.Can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...simply amazing","review":"This book was simply amazing!

The shine is back, with no dull residue. I did make sure I gave her a double bath, not bubble bath; just to make sure all that other gunk was washed away. The rinse also sheeted again.

However, unlike many other car soaps, like Meguiars Gold Class (which is easy to find locally and less expensive), this needs very little to create a lot of suds.

The fallout from the torch stuck to the car like glue and nothing has been able to take it off except for a product called Super Gloss Ultimate.Unfortunately, the Super Gloss Ultimate is extremely hard to find, but for those interested it can be purchased at iShoptogive.com.

Firstly, you have got to get off on the images, which are like rotting fruit, and, secondly, you have got to wonder at the conviction of these actors, especially Deborah Harry, who all give the most extraordinary dead-pan performances. I have laughed so hard watching this ditty I wept, while my significant other was telling me to shut-up because she wanted to know what happens next! I made it up to her later. A couple of weeks ago I was in London - selling shoes, which is what I do - and I got back to my hotel quite late after a tedious meal and what do I find on Film Four but Union City.

It's apparent director Marcus Reichert was aiming at atmosphere and ambience, but in my case he missed by a country mile.

Unfortunately though the phrase you get what you pay for applies completely, while I would not consider this a well made in anyway it can actually take a beating. With a full load this pack is a terribly uncomfortable ride, and the suspension is not that adjustable. The bottom line is that if you are just looking for a casual summer weekend outings this pack is perfect for the price, but if you want a product that is dependable for the long haul then one should definitely spend more on quality that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I took this backpack for a 3-week Europe backpacking tour.

I couldn't even get it to function properly from the get go! It came defective with an improperly tooled tension clip so the draw string on the pack's main body couldn't be closed. I also found that it has a bad overall support system because a moderate load was difficult to maintain on the least treacherous of terrains. It seems best suited as a sleeping bag storage unit to be left in your attic for future generations to wonder! The final dissatisfaction with this purchase came when the distributor has ignored my request for a refund.

My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few good ones","review":"I was disappointed as I didn't realize how may bad songs Del Shannon recorded.

The main attractiveness to me (studio use, mostly permanent attachment) was price, cable length and cable configuration (two leads per cable). Basically you have two MIDI cables bound together which neatens some of the wiring over dual separate cables and eliminates my old trick of using twist-ties or cable Velcro to hold the cables together.

It is well-written and easy to understand.It seems to me, however, that the authors have some nostalgia for 19th century Russian imperialism.

Honestly, my impression of this book is that Ms. Cornwell had a publisher deadline to meet and had absolutely nothing to submit, so she threw this together. The first 3 or 4 chapters should have been a good indication to me that I didn't want to finish this book, but being familiar with her other work, I kept forging ahead, waiting for it to get better. It never did. In a review of a John Grisham book, I mentioned his character development was lacking compared to some of his other works. In this Cornwell book, there were no characters, only caricatures. The story line was unimaginative, and the most intelligent actor in the book was Deputy Chief West's CAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Cross","review":"Animals thinking? Aw, come on.

I have too many other good authors awaiting me, and at 67, I don't think I should waste time on more of this book. I hope Cornwell gets back to what she does so much better. As a former arts/entertainment writer, I frequently told painters that writers had the good sense to toss bad stuff into the garbage.

That seemed to be secondary to the endless colloquial dialogue of Bubba, Smoke, Weed and the charming Divinity. Southern Cross went nowhere, and stayed there. The ending did create some excitement; not how it ended, but that it finally did end. However, like some of the addicts about whom she writes, I am looking forward to my next Cornwell fix.

Although the way he thinks (trying to find an edge when setting up a trade) is correct the suggested strategies he likes the most are inherently short volatility and very risky. He also focuses mostly on commodity markets and I believe the edge that he found back then is gone by now.

The original Sony MDR 7509s sound much more real,detailed,accurate and flat which was perfect for recording. The Sony 7509HDs sound muddy,boomy, muffled and cheap compared to the original model. Since they don't make the original model anymore you're better off saving money by buying the Sony MDR V6s (still the same after all these years) and using the rest of your money for entertainment (cds,dvds,video games).

They wanted to make a game where they could get you into the plot and make you care about the characters and feel what they were feeling. So when you beat the game, you would have this feeling like \\"Wow, This was an incredible game\\" and it makes you think of all the things you've done to beat the game and all of your favorite things in it. I know once you beat the game, You don't really feel like playing the game or starting over like some games do (FF7) anymore because of all the fight scenes and movie scenes make this game endless.

The first portion of the book is a recounting of the earliest days of SRC, a story that will be very familiar to readers of the earlier Stack book. But the reading quickly becomes compelling as he continues the story and builds the irrefutable case for equity ownership throughout an organization. Jack Stack is a consummate teacher: experienced, entertaining, inspiring and entirely logical.

In \\"Harbinger,\\" David Mack has taken an approach that had yet to be explored in the Star Trek mythos. Usually, a television show or book will focus on the captain, first officer, security officer, etc... But Mack has brought in a very wide array of characters, from Tim Pennington, a reporter for the Federation News Service, to Ganz, an Orion merchant-prince. This presents Vanguard to the reader on a much grander scale than any previous Trek incarnation. The writing is witty and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, and familiar characters such as Captain Kirk and Mister Spock are written dead on. Hopefully, fans will be presented with something similar whenever the next television show rolls around. Vanguard is a book that has no problems appealing to all Trek fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Star Trek?!","review":"Very disappointing. A great premise for the story but sadly let down by an incredibly slow delivery. Half-way through the book before anything actually happens.As usual David Mack tries to tell too many stories at the same time and leaves the reader in a constant state of flux as he jumps from scene to scene. Some parts were soooo boring I barely skim read them.Most readers will buy a Star Trek book because they like a sci-fi action story with a touch of human interest. This comes more under the category of a romance/drama with a touch of action so that the reader doesn't fall asleep. He did much better with hisStar Trek: Destiny: Gods of Nightseries, but even then there were far too many plot lines being woven together resulting in a very disjointed read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow moving","review":"I have been reading Star Trek for 23 years and the Vangard Series is well...Poorly done. It is very poorly edited and a very slow read. The plot is disjointed and bounces around not connecting the story archs by giving you good clues to why a plot thread is being explored until the very end. Good reads tease you along and so far the new releases are not holding up. Vanguard does not pull together. This is only the second time I have not been able to finish a Star Trek book. I am now going to check them out of the Library first. Now many are give this series a 5 star yet not saying how long they have been reading Star Trek books so they may not have read but just the last 10 years or so.

The corny part here, though, is the sentient life that begins to oppose this - its too pat to be a great storyline and used too often in earlier stories. That apart, the characterisation is excellent - with cameos from some well-loved stars. There are some interesting and intersecting plotlines,too - with quite a few qs raised that , i hope, will be answered in the sequels. Especially liked the Vulcan security chief - her part of the story shaped out to be the most interesting one! All in all, a good read - even for non-Trekkies.

It's about a 16-year-old white footie player who writes (or at least reads a dictionary in the dunny) and who falls for an Aboriginal girl. The film starts out looking like an after-school special but then descends into exploring the dark side of racism.Perhaps. Or maybe it's just a bag of stereotypes, sad overdone melodrama that would shame the soapies, and a \\"gritty\\" plot that suckered some folks into believing it was sincere.It preceded CRASH by about 5 years but was, I think, every bit as bogus. I could be wrong, since I'm American, but I just don't think the writing was fair dinkum. I think the fine folks at Sundance got suckered by the first Aussie movie they'd ever seen that didn't star Paul Hogan. Ninety minutes that seemed much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Knowing that Alan Grant is a veteran comic book writer, the book was rather disappointing. Perhaps if you don't follow any of the JLA or Batman comics, you might enjoy the book more than I did. But, if you do regularly read JLA or Batman, then I think you will find that the book has a rather weak plot, cliché character dialog, and is a re-hash of earlier comic book themes, etc.There was nothing new, nothing interesting. It portrayed the JLA as a bunch on morons except for Batman. The novel insinuated that when a telepathic link that exists between team members is broken, the various team members don't know what to do (except for Batman because he is used to working alone). Didn't all the JLA members work alone for years before joining the JLA?It is like Mr. Grant had a contract to write a book so he just threw one together to meet the obligation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman saves the League","review":"For those of who have read my other reviews on Batman novels, you should know I'm a huge Batman fan.

This particular version of the book was published in 1982, but the first publication, with same information, was in 1963. This book is useless to me. The photos aren't even very good - extremely dated. I didn't want information on Mexican jewelry artists from 1963, I wanted much more current information including hallmarks. Adding the fact that I received a library book copy of this in poor condition which wasn't mentioned in the listing for $11, it was a complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For All ABBA Fans","review":"I have played disc over and over. Sound is great, very much 60's style and in my opinion far better than her solo albums in the '80s. The only negative factor is I have no idea what she is saying (all in Swedish). Never the less, a great disc to own if you are a Agentha fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a good eating book.","review":"If you like eating books, this is the book for you. I have been through many eating books, some of them competition-orientated, and I would say this one goes down easier than most. The author is the kind of author you can trust because he was hired by the International Federation of Competitive Eaters, which wouldn't hire someone to write a truthful book unless they thought they could trust them.

It's not a bad film at all, just remarkably slow. I really found myself unable to connect with any of the characters, particularly the main two. Acting was good, but I kept waiting for something to happen - a conversation, an argument, anything. When it did, we were two-thirds of the way through the film, and my interest had long since faded.The film techniques used, while artistic, made an already slow film even slower. At times, the directors would cast the audience to watch a scene with nothing happening. I understand this was designed to move or inspire thought maybe, but without any connection to the characters or plot, it just made the agony longer.I have seen many 4 and 5 star rated foreign films, but this was not one of them. On the same evening, after this film, I watched another foreign film (this one in English),Kawa. Fortunately, my night in turn ended with a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles","review":"I read all the reviews and searched through many movies and decided this is the one I wanted to watch.

In this depiction of the opposition of power and people, those of us who are sympathetic to people will have our eyes and our hearts opened by this amazing young writer's clear, polite emphatic voice, while those aligned with the power side may find a rationale to dismiss Ms. Roy's prose with the callousness of the Enron executive who authorized $13 million to 'educate' Indian politicians about the virtues of dams that would destroy the homes of millions and shackle the people to enormous long term debt in exchange for the capacity to produce energy at prices far beyond the people's capacity to pay.

He viewed his task concerning The Shroud with great scepticism; there have been far too many hoaxes in the world of religion.The book describes in great detail the events leading up to the team's conviction that the Shroud was genuine; last - not least - being Heller and Adler's verification of \\"heme\\" (blood) and the inexplicable \\"burned image\\" of the crucified man.Although carbon dating indicates that the image is not 2000 years old and that the cloth is from the Middle Ages, there is not enough evidence to diosprove Heller's assertion that the Shroud is indeed genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right for what we needed","review":"I'm impressed with this travel bed thus far.

The only thing I don't like about it is that, while the bottom is water resistant, it's not waterproof. If you have it on wet or really dewy ground, it will absorb some.

And then after the pups were nearly killed by a muskrat he grudgingly let the mom and pups stay on the porch until they could fend off marauders on their own?!?. To me this is animal cruelty and shows a deep disregard for life and selfishness. No mention of taking the mom dog to the vet before she whelped or the pups to the vet after she whelped.

His skepticism when it comes to Christian faith and The Bible are only proofs that he is one of today's \\"enlightened\\" philosophers who is too \\"intelligent\\" to fall for the ridiculously simplistic beliefs of Christianity.This book is a terrible anti-Christian screed, a total waste of time, and a sorry attempt at philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting stuff","review":"I got this for a class on philosophical inquiry.

For example, having introduced Utilitarianism in chapter seven, devoting a grand total of two pages to it, Rachels gratuitously gives utilitarian arguments in favor of abortion, euthanasia, and the legalization of marijuana. Why? I thought the topic was utilitarianism. The presentation is unfair. Opposing positions are dismissed with a few sentences. Clearly, Rachels's agenda is obvious.

It skips over Operation Olympic (the invasion of Kyushu)and concentrates upon Operation Coronet (the invasion of the main island of Honshu). The emphasis upon a somewhat limited cast of characters, while necessary for dramatic effect, in a sense glosses over the horrific cost of the planned invasion of Japan. Potential American casualties were estimated at about a million, with four to ten million Japanese deaths. It is all too easy to forget that the estimated 180,000 deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki literally saved the lives of millions.

It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the classic music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book.

Worth every penny, as a DUI or DWI will cost you a lot more!And as for the calibration issues. Recalibrate it by blowing compressed air through it or putting the mouthpiece out the window of your car on the freeway, mouthpiece forward, while it does its countdown. The blast of air during the countdown recalibrates the machine. Mine has worked, doing regular recalibrations, for nearly six months now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Recalibration Quickly","review":"Fine for the first six weeks or so...very interesting...but now reading 3.4 after 3 beers...Like most technology hardware companies these days, the margin is in the services. $19.95 to recalibrate...Not really pleased with the purchase, as I don't see long term value for your $100.

It gives grossly inaccurate readings. I had 3 shots within an hour and it gave me a reading of .01 (not .1) Anyway you're supposed to wait 20 minutes after drinking before using this thing.

Rather than draw interesting characters, Mr. Johnstone resorts to trite stereotypes. The protaganist, Ben Raines, offers the only shred of interest in the book. Apparently, he is a brilliant military leader who enjoys risking his life in commando-style warfare behind enemy lines. Anyone who has actual combat experience knows that even the most skilled soldier can have an unluckly day (and greatly shortened life). Given the number of \\"Ashes\\" books on the shelf, Mr. Raines has a career only found in comic books. Overall, \\"Betrayal\\" was a bit better than \\"Hunted\\" or \\"Breakdown.\\" My only thought is that Mr. Johnstone has found a group of people who will buy his books... no matter what he writes.

The content shows areas including Dublin, Waterford, Ring of Kerry, Aran Islands, Derry and Belfast, stressing historical and natural places. The narrative tells where you are and sections out special interests like horse racing, crystal, medieval banquets, and Irish music. There are two extras on Ireland's National Parks and the Galway Christmas Choir. This DVD is not an advertisement for hotels or restaurants.

There are elves, raindeer, children and snow fairies. Compassion, clear and deep thinking, and love and joy abound.

As A politically conservative Christian I say this book is NOT an unbiased examination of the similarities and differences in the Holy Bible and the Qur'an. First, there is a photo of Usama bin Laden on the cover; how does that shade the views about Islam in this book? Second, Muhammed is branded a terrorist instead of as a warrior; there is a difference between war and terrorism! Third, the book uses the old word \\"Koran\\" instead of the newer, more respectful \\"Qur'an.\\" This book looks to be only for Fundamentalist \\"Christians\\" who want justification to believe untruths and half-truths about Islam. A better book, if you would read it with an open mind is \\"Islam Denounces Terrorism\\"by Harun Yahya.

Her sense of humor comes out in her snappy dialogue. I did however find it very hard to like a leading man that would still be thinking about marrying someone else up until almost the end of the book! I also could't believe that any self respecting woman would put her friends well being so much above her own. I did like how she resolved Whitney's conflict. Very surprising! Even though this wasn't my favorite of her books, I am still looking forward to her future books. She is a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and slow moving!","review":"I could hardly struggle through the first hundred pages of this book.

A fan of both, all I can say is The Long Shot was a great disappointment. The backstory is about as cliched and predictable as you can get. The whole story rests on the premise of the hero loving one woman enough to do anything to win her love, and the heroine loving this same woman, her best friend, so much that she would give up her own happiness for her. The only problem - this friend is the most shallow, hateful caricature I have come across in quite a while. Overall the story crawls along slowly with the most transparent and sickenly convenient little plot \\"twists\\". If you must read this one - pick it up from the library. But I strongly suggest Hunter's Moon by Karen Robards as much better example of hourse country romantic suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"its my favourite","review":"i love this book,its the best ihave ever read! actually i have read it for 4 times without gettin bored,its full of surprises and really perfect...really words cant help all i wanna say"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"This was not worth the 2 bucks I paid for it.

The Dalits & Dravidians descend from the African regions of Sudan, Ethiopia and from the Bushman tribe Khoisan and some other areas. Places like China, Japan etc all descend from the Khoisan tribe. People need to know the truth, Africans populated this world long before others even existed, with that, civilization was brought forth and that's why scientists do their best to use genetic diversity/variation to trick ppl into believing that people who are genetically different are not of the same race. It's why they perpetuate the lie of back migration because they can't stand to know that they had nothing to do with civilization; they came on the tail end and that's the bottom line. Good book.

As expected, the 50 state \\"summits\\" are presented professionally.

I got this as a gift for someone who is in the middle of a journey to climb to the highest points of all 50 states. The author has done a great job of documenting his journeys in pictures and text. If you just want a quick glance, you can always skip the text and the pictures will keep you interested throughout the book. This book is about 10 years old, but still interesting and applicable. Some the photos from the top are familiar from our journeys. For others, it's interesting to see how the views have changed. There are also photos from along the route, especially along the more interesting/harder to reach high points.This book does not give directions, recommended approaches, or topography of high points. However, I would definitely recommend this book as a gift for anyone else on a journey to complete the high points as a preview of what they can look forward to or just as a coffee book table. It's an easy way to get a glance at all 50 states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly Amateur Production; Avoid","review":"I borrowed this DVD from the library, thinking any DVD documentatary on Hawaii can't be that bad. I was wrong.The production values on this DVD is along the lines of a cheap home-made video. The video is grainy, shot with an old low resolution camera. The audio is noisy, with very little dynamic range. The footage, if you can call it that, is someone's view of a parking lot, closeups of some plants, etc.This was so bad I started laughing at how bad it was.If you want to see how NOT to make a video for a video production class, this is a great example.

It read like a TV episode, not much happened, and there was very little in the way of plot or character development although it did have a fair amount of stunt casting. Why was Sisko in this book? He didn't actually do anything or play any part. The ending was completely from left field and I felt absolutely cheated as a reader.I suppose after having read some really good books recently, the stinkers are even more obvious to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly decent, but not much more. [some spoilers]","review":"I'm a huge fan of the DS9 relaunch, and I was eagerly anticipating this book as a continuation of the exciting storyline the various authors had established. However, after the great descriptions and plots of the previous books, especially the \\"Mission: Gamma\\" and \\"Worlds of DS9\\" series, I was very much disappointed by \\"Warpath\\". Like \\"Unity\\", the book does advance the plot, and provide some excellent action scenes, but not much else - it definitely does not share the depth and stand-alone nature of the other books. Furthermore, the author liberally reuses a number of plot ideas from previous Star Trek novels, such as the melodrama between Vaughn and Prynn, Ro and Quark. I also intensely disliked the ending, came totally out of nowhere, and didn't expand the DS9 universe at all, something the previous books were excellent at accomplishing. I hope the next installment follows the path established by the previous novels, instead of this new trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I'm working with a design studio that is now offering web services to its clients. This book has been very helpful, giving us a look at web projects and procedures.It is skewed to larger projects than we will likely be involved in.The best parts of the book are the descriptions of real projects and real problems.Humor helps the message get through: that these kinds of projects frequently change, new problems crop up, people don't always react the way you'd expect and that it's all part of the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Effective","review":"The scenarios in this book seem to only address large firms, and this book is basically useless for the freelance or 1-man design firm.

All those stories inspire hope and help us believe in the goodness of humanity, but this book is a large stretch of the imagination. Unlike the Diary of Anne Frank, which is a published diary and can easily have all the details and such that come along with an experience that she had during WWII, this book is relying on memory. And I admit that experiences like that burn themselves into your memory, but there is too much detail in this book for it all to be true. Add this to the fact that this is a rather boring account, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone except WWII buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a childhood memoir of the WWII Hungary","review":"As a student I read the \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" and indeed it was poignant and unforgettable. Magda Denes' book is the darker side, a memoir written almost 50 years after the war, and yet through the eyes of a young child. Her relationship with her beloved brother Ivan is central to the story, and their closeness makes you want to examine your own sibling relationships. Magda survives, but at a cost. I had a sense of immediacy and even awe, that she and her mother and elderly grandmother could be so resourceful, so brave, in the face of starvation and deprivation. I kept wondering, could any of us be so brave, and at 9 years old yet. This book is more than a holocaust memoir, it is an ultimately awe inspiring adventure tale, tinged with truth and sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't a Jewel","review":"Does not really stand out in comparison to other \\"memoirs\\" out there now. What made this pretty much bearable- the storyline was quite dull itself- was the humor. The author portrayed herself as a sarcastic little thing, with one liners that killed. The most memorable was when her family had to be checked and made sure they were Jews, as they claimed to be, by their rescuers. Her grandmother (I assume was in her late 80s) suffered from Asthma, could hardly move, and was nearly blind yet was accused of being a spy of some sorts. That isn't supposed to be funny under any circumstances, but the way the author worded it was hilarious. Absolutely hilarious. Which is odd contrasting against the wars and hardships she had to face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best memoir I have ever read","review":"This is a gripping, exceptionally well-written account of a child's life in war. The writing is beautiful and poignant. The reader is so drawn into Magda's world that listenting to her sharp wit in the midst of great tragedy is inspiring. This book will make you laugh and cry.

Mandelaris is also known as \\"Bill Manders\\", a right-wing radio talker in Nevada. Before the 2010 Nevada Republican Primary he confided on-air -- several times -- that he was considering a run for the U. S. Senate against the incumbant Harry Reid because \\"Rich people deserve representation too.\\" Seriously. He always addresses his radio audience as \\"folks\\" and \\"you folks\\" as if he and they are all of one mind with the same set of \\"Values\\". Talk radio listeners really listen alone, individually, not in a congregation (or mob), yet Manders, as so many present day radio hosts, employs active pre-screeners to pre-ask what the caller plans to say. \\"Manders\\" the radio personality, and \\"Mandelaris\\" the author and media critic, would have their \\"folks\\" stay \\"protected\\" like children from outside ideas and \\"values\\" that don't...\\"represent rich people\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song","review":"This is really a great song, by the greatest rock and roll band of history so far.I strongly suggest you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!

For some reason, my 9yr old son really likes squid's, so we found this one and purchased it. He seems quite happy w/ it. It is very life-like.

Yes, there are explicit jokes and some of them are a little crude, but this was never intended for children.

In spite of this, she LOVES the stuffed bone so much that the sewing occasionally is worth it. In terms of value, it is certainly worth <$10, but when you add 50%+ more for S&H it becomes borderline in terms of value. So I would give it 3-stars (OK product for $$) but my Lab would give it 5-paws up as it is one of her favorite toys to run and play with. But we've had to limit any tugging with it as the seams just do not hold up to too much strain.

Blanchard's explanation of the key IS-LM relation is very weak, very confusing- Mankiw does a much neater job. This book is full of complicated algebra and thus will be a huge headache for anyone who doesn't love the more tedious realms of math. Reading through the text, the content frequently waffles between inane digressions and examples, and equally useless mathematical derivations. I do give this book credit, 2 stars that is, for being comprehensive; it covers more than any comparable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book in macroeconomics","review":"This book covers most important topics in macroeconomics in an intuitive manner. Use of calculus has been avoided, which I see as a good thing, considering that (in my opinion) many authors seem use calculus to impress. Theoretical arguments are given substance with actual cases and data, which makes the reading all the more interesting. Principles of economics is, however, a pre-requisite in order to fully understand and enjoy this book. Someone pointed out that the book has exercises but no key. This is the reason why Macroeconomics does not get five stars from me. It is incredible how mistakes like these still happen. But otherwise, I highly recommend the book to anybody who wants to accumulate knowlegde in the field!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"Not a bad die for the price, considering this is made from HSS, I would recommend it for softer metals or chasing existing threads.

This book has to be viewed as a complement, a second volume, to Practical Watch Repairing of the same author. You have to read the first book to fully understand it. If you look at this book as a second volume of the classic Practical Watch Repairing, it deserves 4 stars. It does not cover new automatic movements from the 70s and 80s, but every automatic system used by the industry is documented. Well, if you can repair an ETA or Omega from the 50s or 60s, you can repair a movement from the 80s and 90s. That's my point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated Watches and their repair","review":"Not a very up to date book on watch repair. There are also very few pictures/diagrams available.

It is very based on evolution with de-evolution being a big part of the story. Secondly, there is a scene where two children sell their souls to a circus owner, signing on the line in their own blood. For those who do not object to these things, there is the rest. It is brainless, plotless, pointless, foolishness; not to mention very, very dumb. Kids do like the animated dinosaurs walking, talking, back to life.

Nope, Kinkade's kitch will never grace the walls of a major museum or art gallery (unless of course he happens to own the place). Instead, his mass-produced, brass-plated monstrosities can found at a mall near you. It's the fine art of \\"collecting\\" for the art-ignorant -- people who can't wait to dump their kid's college funds on an over-priced \\"limited edition\\" reproduction from a professional marketer.

The selection of tracks is very similar to Dream Dance however instead of including a few boring \\"Dream house\\" tracks Sunshine includes a few hard trance tracks.I felt the best songs on volume 11 were the pounding club tracks of \\"Days Of Glory\\" by Mellow Trax, Brooklyn Bounce's \\"Crazy\\", and \\"Attention!\\" by Commander Tom. One last thing to note is, even though most of these tracks are radio edits (which I like), Sunshine has the special ability of choosing the best mixes of the songs if the radio edit isn't very good. A perfect example of this is Commander Tom's song \\"Attention!\\", which is very average as a radio edit but the mix Sunshine live choose makes it a five star track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice looking and sturdy","review":"I like it a lot.

Robinson) and, on the other end of the spectrum, the movie I'm watching tonight, JAIL BAIT, written and directed by Edward G. Wood.Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed: the quality of the transfers is FAR from HD quality (some of them are from old prints, like the quality you'd see on an afternoon or late night UHF movie feature, with fuzzy sound, choppy edits, etc).But if you're like me and sometimes you just want to veg on the couch watching an old movie, this set is MORE than worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyber Law","review":"Cyber Law is an eye-opener for anyone who plans to start a web based business.

The book touts the benefits of Critical Chain with zeal; but with limited if any defensible evidence. For those new to professional project management, the book provides much cheerleading but little value related to delivery of projects within the context of a viable well managed, competitive business environment. The book's reference list is anemic. Assessment of the broad scope and depth of information related to PMOs and Portfolio Management is questionable.

It certainly gives you insight into the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and boring","review":"As an author myself, I understand the author's desire to make history enjoyable. However, her writing style fails at that. This story is so long and drawn out that I completely lost interest after one-third of the book. Her story begins from a young girl's perspective on life and love; she eventually becomes aware of the Depression. Before the plot even begins to thicken and capture the reader's interest, though, the reader loses interest due to all the long and pointless scenes about this girl's every day life. I had a hard time getting as far as I did due to all the meaningless scenes that did not advance the plot. Somebody had recommended this novel to me, so I kept reading with the expectation that it would go somewhere, but it never did. The author could have reduced the novel to half its size without losing any of the story. The only thing that would have been lost is the meaningless rambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"a room of my own - loved it!!!","review":"This story is a very compelling look at young girl and her family during the depression era.

The writing is really quite lovely. BUT the story is sooooo drawn out. Scenes that could have taken a paragraph or two go on and on and on. I realize a writer has to set the mood but Tatlock goes so overboard in detailing every emotion and happening that it TAKES AWAY from the story. I've read LONG books (over 1000 pages) and the story was so good I didn't want them to end, but this story did not have enough subplots ... or any.. to carry the long windedness.I'm sorry, but because of this major flaw I left this book near the end.

It focuses on modern lethargy and pulls you out of the mindset of \\"all or nothing\\" regimes.I found it to be informative on all levels, appealing to all age groups and above all, simple and inspirational in its straightforward concept, drawing on no particular technique or discipline it combines the simplest and more effective for a well thought out and equally excuted little marvel to carry with you wherever you go.I for one, am a convert to the 5 minute stretch and I have passed it on to my nearest and dearest whom I believe are all of the same opinion...that this is an excellent little book that everyone ought to have a look through, if you don't learn something....I'll eat my hat !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap knock off of the master's work.","review":"Unable, or unwilling, to secure the cooperation of Adams' estate, the publishers of this book have used images from the US national archive.These substandard images have been reproduced hair, dust and all!

Janeane had the hots for Jesse Hughes the guitarist at the time, unfortunately in her highly questionable infatuation she forgot one factor about the band: their music is awful. People will say \\"it's a parody of heavy metal; it's supposed to be awful and kind of fun\\". It's awful alright, but it's not fun. This band is very, very boring, with awful riffs and garbage lyrics. When I heard that the great, immensely talented Axl Rose kicked these guys off of a Guns n Roses tour after one horrific performance, my respect for Axl shot up even higher. He even christened them Pidgeons of (expletive used for describing fecal matter) Metal.Do yourself a favour. Skip this and buy Chinese Democracy.

There are a few tunes I liked such as \\"I Want You so hard\\", \\"Just Nineteen\\" and \\"cherry cola\\", but the rest either didn't have good chord progressions or were extremely strange melodies that made no sense usually. I got bored of listening to it at about song seven. don't buy this CD, it's weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Sleaze","review":"This album, \\"Death By Sexy\\", is a vast improvement on the Eagles' debut album. The first album showed potential, but all but a few of the songs had no individual identity and sounded exactly like the track they followed. This album, however, many of the songs have catchy, discernible hooks and memorable guitar lines. Warm bass explodes whenever needed courtesy of QOTSA main man Josh Homme, and Jesse \\"Devil\\" Hughes proves that he's more than just a badass moustache both on the guitar and behind the mic. Standouts include first single \\"Boys Bad News\\", \\"Cherry Cola\\", \\"Solid Gold\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", \\"Chase the Devil\\", and \\"Eagles Goth\\", which all highlight the strengths of the Hughes/Homme partnership. Melodies that smack of Queens of the Stoneage, frenetic vocals and varied song structures reminiscent of the Pixies, and crushing, bouncy guitar riffs a-la Thin Lizzy.

The sparks that flew between them were intense and nearly jumped off the pages. I also enjoyed the historical background of the Tenth and Ninth Calvary.

With the wind at my back I can throw this as far as a professional frisbee. You cannot throw it into the wind. If you are fail at throwing frisbees, this will run along on it's rubbery feet if it lands sideways. What may not be apparent from the photo is that it does not lay flat and is arched.

They serve their purpose at a wrestling arena, but how do they fare as stand alone music? Not that well, actually. Most of them are rather repetitive, with the same riff playing over and over until the fadeout. But a few of them resemble actual songs, like \\"Break Down the Wall\\" and \\"Oh Hell Yeah\\" (not particularly good songs, but songs nonetheless). \\"Big\\" and \\"Ass Man\\" are especially stupid.

The best ever, maybe of all time!","review":"I never thought it could get any better than this! My favorites are Test's, Triple-H, and The Big Show, but the best ones are Austin's new one, the Rock's new version, and the one that I've been waiting for: No Chance in Hell with Vince and Shane McMahon. I had thought, as some other people may have thought, that Austin's new music was going to be lame. Boy, am I glad I was wrong. His song rocks! Almost every music that they have here you can rock to, if you smell what the \\"Rock\\" iscooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was disapointed","review":"I was very disapointed with this album and would not recomend it to anyone. If you want the best current WWF entrance music buy volume 3. First of all Chris Jericho's music was messed up. When he enters there is that countdown with the noise, a pause and then a big boom before the music. Well none of that is on the album. It should have been because that is what makes Jericho's entrance so great. Stone Cold's entrance was not what he's came out every time I've watched WWF, which is every Monday, Thursday, And Saturday. I have no idea what this song was unless he's about to have a new entrance song. The real current Austin song is on volume 3. \\"What did everybody want?\\" Al Snow's music, which wasn't on the album. there were a few good songs though, like Triple H, The Rock, Mankind, and The Corporation. Over all I was very disapointed with this album though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best WWE cd out there","review":"They might have released a 3 cd set of entrance theme songs but this is the one collection with all the good songs you need. Sure Shawn Micheals theme song isnt on this, but No Chance in Hell is! That song rocks! Plus you can get this cd for a penny, I lost it and I got it for a penny!

Unlike volume 3 in the series it has no repeat of old songs from past titles. The best songs are \\"Break Down the Wall\\", \\"This is a Test\\", \\"AssMan\\" and \\"My Time\\". The worst song is \\"Wreck\\". For some reason Mankind never had a good theme song in the past although he is probably the best athlete in this sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to 5, best yet","review":"This Cd kicks, it is probably the best wwf album yet. The songs are updated, complete, and clear. My favorites: jericho, corp., hhh, rock, dlo, and edge. the ONLY problem is that some songs should have been replaced. Instead of christian, they could've had bossman. instead of mark henry, the WORST song, they should've had jarret, since he was wrestling in wwf when this was made.

I first was hooked by sing the sorrow and imediately bought art of drowning last year. Thirsting for more i wanted to be exposed to their roots and this was a good taste. Def. give this a shot even though its a little different from sing the sorrow(which might be the only one youve listened to so far). i feel they have an addictive sound whether theyre playing their old hardcore or the new darker/gothic?? stuff. p.s. the rolling balls lyrics are quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits?","review":"I can't really say I've gotten all the way through the album.

It's easily worthy of 10 stars. This CD allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to Sing The Sorrow, and to get more intimate with the band. I havn't purchased this album YET, because I already have all their albums, but plan on it.The new tracks are from the Answer That, and Very Proud Of Ya era. They've finally been released on CD.

The great selections of songs gives you a taste of what AFI was like before they became goth-like. My favorite is probably Days of the Phoenix or I Wanna Mohawk (But Mom Won't Let Me Get One). You should get this if you want to learn more about AFI or even if you haven't heard of them. Their a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"an introduction to AFI !","review":"This was the first afi album i bought and i wasnt let down.

They don't detract from enjoying the book too much, but they are a small nuisance. Hopefully TokyoPop will fix this in later editions.Also, fans of Clamp's artwork should check out the chapters of Rayearth that appeard in the old Mixxzine (Mixx being the company that later became Tokyopop). The magazine printed CLAMP's artwork at a full page 8-1/2 by 11 inch format, and it's amazing to see how CLAMP's work fills a page. The small manga format is handy, but it doesn't do their rich artwork much justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Knights Kick [...]!","review":"This is a great manga for any beginners new to manga (or shojo for that matter). This is shojo, but I have like a few guy friends who like it. And ya know what? This is probably CLAMP's best work.

I guess I was looking for a complete box set with everything they ever did and after looking at some of these reviews I think I'm better off sticking with the Ultimate Rascals. And what is up with some of these reviewers' spelling errors? You people can't even spell a simple three letter word, you need to go back to kindergarten.

The mirror comes with a spray bottle of anti-fog stuff, which I promptly lost.Cons: None.

The mirror tends to collect a little fog at first, but throwing hot water on it takes care of the fog instantly for the rest of my time in the shower. The mirror also has a little bit of magnification to it, which was a nice little surprise.Edit: After having this mirror up in the shower for about 7 months about 50% of the silver lining has disappeared (about a quarter from each edge), so only half of the mirror is still actually a mirror.

One wouldn't think that's a problem until you're about to put a razor against your skin and it's hard to judge exactly where the blade is about to land.The fogging isn't an issue for me because I prefer to hold the mirror in my other hand and dunk it in the shower stream if it does start to fog.If you're accustomed to the heft and fidelity of a flat glass mirror, you'll find this one difficult to adapt to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zadro","review":"So small.

Her voice is so mellow and yet so rough. She has the kind of voice and talent that needs to be seen and heard. All 14 songs on this CD are GREAT and you'll enjoy everyone. \\"Dime\\" is her debut song and has the video on the single only. It's a different style than the other songs but who would want 14 songs the same way. You'll be glad you bought this CD and you'll want to hear more from Beth real soon. This is by far one of the BEST Spanish music CD's I've heard in a long time.

Gameplay is what I'm about and this game delivers. I HATED Morrowind, but decided to buy it anyways. I'm glad I did... My wife, not so much.Fun, not impossibly hard and you can juggle numerous quests at once. Your character can be as original as your imagination. I still haven't exactly figure out how to level up, but this game is so immersive that for the first time I'm not concerned with it. This game feels like Dungeons and Dragons meets Fable meets Knights of the Old Republic. It absolutely will suck up your life, so married people and parents BEWARE!!!Buy this game. It will appeal to anyone on some level whether it be gameplay, graphics or story. If you hate RPGs this may change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"We actually started out playing this game at my cousins house.

That sounds so bad but this game is so great. It is easy to play and the graphics are so beautiful. It is very interesting and I don't see how you could actually beat the game there are so many different thing to do. I would definatly suggest this game to anyone who likes any type of video games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but could be better","review":"I just bought this game and have been playing it for over 20 hours now. I love it It is a fantastic game but i do have some constructive criticism. One The creators spent a lot of time on the game world and not enough time on character anamation. The movement of the character when you are in a 3rd person view is verry chopy, or atleast i think so,. and the combat in the game is not as good as it could be. The combat could be more fluid. For instance why is it that when you jump you can not swing your weapon. And it is verry difficult to fight more than one enemy at a time because you have to turn and face them befor you can hit them. If anyone has played Fable for Xbox. you will know what i mean when i say the Combat should be more like that. But overall especialy for an early release game on a relativly new system this game is beautifull and the world is so expancive you could play it for years and never get tired of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Did not work when I got it.

We are planning a trip to Greece in several months. We found this DVD to be so tedious and boring that we almost wish we weren't going. It goes out of its way to show badly videographed scenes of tourist sites way too crowded with cheeseball tourists and ancient monuments covered in scaffolding. Interspersed are interviews with native Greeks who share insights like, \\"Athens is one of the most beautiful capitals, because it is beautiful and has beautiful buildings.\\" Or \\"I ride a motorcycle because it is very crowded and smoggy and I think the only way to get around is a motorcycle because I like motorcycles.\\" I am grateful we bought this DVD used and didn't bother to watch the whole thing.

That album featured the likes of David Bromberg, David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, Flaco Jiminez, Dr John and the infamous Robert Zimmerman. With a cast of legends such as this, it was nearly impossible to live up to the hype. However, I think that session produced more than it's share of standouts. Faded Love, San Antoine, Dealer's Blues and Dylan's great composition Wallflower are all praiseworthy.I did find a copy of Doug Sahm and The Band reissued on the Edsel label. So it's out theresomewhere. Until then, look to this Rhino collection to fill in the gaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost paradise!!","review":"I bought this CD because it includes some of the tracks of my favorite Doug Sahm recording...DOUG SAHM and BAND. I only wish the song \\"Its Gonna be Easy\\" was included in this compilation. Anyways the DOUG SAHM and BAND tunes on this CD offer a rough, unpolished but groooovy sound. Doug and his collaborating musicians offer up a delicious mix of tex-mex, blues and western music. This CD is not for folks wanting a clean polished sound....this is the REAL thang!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's only 1 Doug","review":"My collection of Doug's CD is more almost complete.

The tracks taken from their last studio album(\\"Short Stories/Tall Tales\\")include what is easily the *worst* track(\`Summer\`s Most Wanted Girl\`) from that album, and leave out \`The Life You Save\`, which is arguably the *best* track on that album, and one of three tracks that rescue \\"Short Stories/Tall Tales\\" from complete mediocrity. Very curious choice indeed. Fans of Horslips will know what I mean and no doubt agree with me. However, aside from this glaring error, this double CD is a good introduction to Horslips, although not necessarily all of the tracks are the \`best\`. Some of Horslips albums are concept albums and the tracks taken from these albums are best heard in the context of the album as a whole.

We all have to read this book, to see what warehousing all these millions of people does to us as a society. Do we really want to treat other human beings this way.

That was my anticipation when I purchased \\"Waiting to Die\\"...I thought I would get some juicy insight into prison life and gain a better understanding of what life is like \\"on the inside\\". What I got was ~150 pages of whining and complaining from Mr. Rossi. He spends lengthy sections of this book trying to convince his readers how terrible prisoners are treated on death row (duh...it's prison), and how these conditions are a result of mean-spirited politicians and a corrupt and inept judicial system. I was looking for insight into prison life...what I got was a 150 page diatribe on how inmates are victimized, mistreated, and lonely, and how America lacks morality and conscience.Warning...I NEVER write reviews on books or anything, but I'm taking the time to write this one.

Judging it by itself, I would say it is a good album to own. However, in the context of the first (the best) and the third (pretty darn good), it is relatively weak. The second one doesn't have the history-making power of the first or the pure talent of the third, although some of the songs are fun.I especially like \\"Grandpa Was a Carpenter.\\"I wonder why Johnny Cash didn't sing one of his legendary trademark songs.

I'd actually have to rate this CD at the very top of my list of desert island recordings. There are remarkable performances by dozens of Country music's best. This recording feels like you're in the same room, just a bunch of friends making music. All of the music is first-rate, the arrangements are stunning.

I recomend you look into getting this one instead - its great value and also a brilliant resourse for other basic elements of astrology. Plus - its understandable for the beginner.

It takes place after Armada and the autobots and decepticons are united for a period of time. It's the adventures of the autobots and later the battles between them and the decepticons.

I overlooked the fact that some characters call each other \\"Looser!\\" This is not what your target audience (5+ year old toy buyers) should be hearing. Regardless, I next bought \\"The Battle for Energon\\" and the previous reviewers were right on. The character, \\"Kicker\\", is so undescribably obnoxious, he makes you want to shut off the DVD player (I had to!). This DVD went in the trash. It IS THAT BAD.

I often wished I had extra copies of both to pass on to my movie crazy friends. Fast forward 20 years. The kids are out of the house and a new and improved version of both books are available at the bookstore. What makes this book particularly endearing is that it doesn't focus on a particular era of film making/celebrity......it covers it all!

The depth of emotions experienced by all was totally in line with Ryan's character as developed in previous books although this book can stand on its own. It was interesting also to get Mandy's life-story and I thought that it was very real and practical. I totally agreed with who the villain turned out to be because I found that he was too smarmy for me.The attraction between Laura and Ryan was there from the get-go and I liked the progression throughout the book.Of course I liked the spiritual element and how God was working throughout the story all along.

Their evidence is convincing.This is a good book for anyone who wants to know why the past financial crises happened and how to cope with them from both the public and the private perspectives. The authors also present the \\"ten warning signs of a financial crisis\\" based on macroeconomic data that can be used as a guideline to predict a crisis in certain economy. But the problem is they cannot predict when it will happen.The authors' objective to \\"offer some unique perspectives, case examples, and practical solutions, and an actionable, strategic blueprint that our clients can tailor to meet their specific needs\\" is well presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscure and difficult to read","review":"I was searching for the simple rendition of Brother Lawrence's teaching.

So I hunted down the version I had read, it is published by Whitaker House but doesn't appear for some strange reason with a search for brother Lawrence. I had to enter the isbn number to find it.

The book is divided into four sections: Italian, French, English and Spanish but they are literally the same plans in all sections with just simple modifactions to the front facade. Worse yet, most designs mix elements from all styles. You get a simple floor plan with a watercolor elevation that is often not completely reflective of the design. I particularly noticed that most designs had very large garages that are not rendered proportionally. If you are looking for unique designs that are true to the architecture of Europe this is not the book to buy. If you just want a \\"Spanish Look\\" to a ranch design this book offers nothing different than what you can find in the check out line of the local super-market. There is nothing unique or authentic in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"The cover claims that there are 65 floorplans, but its more like 22.

After that, the room smells like a combination of oranges and stinky diapers with the stinky diaper smell finally winning out completely by week 3.

I highly recommend this product for skin and hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"this does not really perform that well. it goes on like a dry type glue and makes little impact on your moisture level.

In the picture it shows the shea butter in almost bar form in plastic containers, so I expected it to come that way. Instead, my shea butter was melted in a plasic zip lock bag,.. so unimpressed. This makes it difficult to use and now I have to find something to scoop the mess into. I can totally understand it being melted as it's middle summer, but the zip-lock? It would've nice to know exactly what I was buying.AN UPDATE: after finding a plastic container to put the shea butter in things went well- from my experience this seems to be good quality shea butter and I recommend the SHEA BUTTER, but I will keep my review on the packaging so other buyers are aware of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those sensitive to smell, this isn't for you","review":"This product absolutely stinks. Many of the reviews refer to the smell as \\"not unpleasant\\" and \\"nutty\\". well, let me tell you: it's VERY unpleasant. and it smells more like burning rubber than nuts.The package arrived covered in black sticky goo, as if it had been sitting in some sort of dirty decaying sugary substance. Just nasty. Can't believe they shipped it in this condition, and can't believe Amazon sells this stuff.As for the product within, it did spread around relatively nicely. It's thick, but that's what you want when you order shea butter. That's the only good thing I can say about it. If you use it on your hands, you'll smell this burnt rubber smell for the rest of the day. So awful. I returned it the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too yellow, not 100% shea butter","review":"<UPDATED REVIEW>After using this for a few more days after posting my original review, I am updating it because I am now fully convinced that yellow coloring has been added to this as well as other ingredients. It actually leaves a yellow stain on my hands and clothes. This is NOT 100% shea butter. I actually went to an african market near me and showed it to them and they compared it with their real shea butter. It is nothing a like. Do not buy from this seller.<ORIGINAL REVIEW>Im a little suspicious of this product, it smells like shea butter and feels like it too, but dont understand why it is so yellow. I have been to africa and seen raw shea butter and its usually greyish or off white. This is way to bright and yellow as though color has been addded to it. Other than that, its still great for hair and skin but I dont think I will buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stretch marks and facial blemishes","review":"Is what I use this for. I like how it's different and I hope that it's working! The smell is strong, but it's not too bad in my opinion. It is thick, and a little \\"greasyish\\" but every single oil or cream you're going to use for these reasons are going to have some of these qualities. I regrettably gained over 50 pounds in my pregnancy, and I am a little unlucky and got stretch marks-- everywhere. In my experience it does help with acne. I've been using on my body for a little over a week twice a day, and I really do think I'm noticing them starting to fade!!!edited on 6/21/11: I finished my 2nd bowl and I have come Love this stuff.

It's a great moisturizer and so good for your skin! I love buying natural products so when i saw this and the price i definitely had to try it.

They responded quickly and professionally and I look forward to ordering (not the same item) in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not RAW","review":"I purchased this product because I could not get to my local store for raw shea butter. This product came quickly, but it was not raw. it appears as if they melted raw shea butter and poured it into a container. Raw shea butter is lumpy. When you rub it, it gets creamy and spreads evenly. This product is flaky and falls into pieces. Dont get me wrong, it is real shea butter. But it is NOT RAW shea butter."},{"rating":"2","title":"much softer and easier to work then","review":"the stuff I payed twice as much for at whole foods.

I put it on my sore feet, my nieces eczema, my skin, and of course my hair! It helps do a great twist out when mixed with my essential oils concoction- leaving the hair soft. I also told my mother about it who also is making the purchase. Very pleased with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"African Shea Butter not as I expected","review":"I was a little surprised because Ive been using pure shea butter for a while now and this one was very different. It's very grain like and perhaps doesnt work on my hair as does the shea butter Ive used in the past. I am not sure if I would buy this again. Nonetheless it may work for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Skin Softening","review":"I use Shea butter in my homemade skin salves. This butter is the best I've used. I rubbed some directly on my skin and was amazed at the silky smooth texture it created, not to mention it's medicinal benefits. I also like the fact that it is unprocessed un-like some bleached white shea butter I've used in the past. Very nice stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real Shea Butter","review":"I was born and raised in Ghana. I have personally with my own hands picked Karite Fruit from a shea tree and ground it into butter. I have never seen Shea butter in a yellowish gold color until I came into the United States. Shea butter is usually an off white, beige color. The texture is smooth and should melt directly if rubbed in your fingertips. This stuff has more of the texture of coco butter with yellow food coloring. The best Shea Butter I have found since I cant get it shipped from home is on CoastalScents.com. Its the closest thing to what I remember from home."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"very moisturizing and comes in it's unrefined state so you can add your own ingredients. the only thing i was taken aback by was the smell which was unpleasant, but im guessing that's just the way shea butter smells in its pure form"},{"rating":"1","title":"To greasy and doesn't work!!! (GUY REVIEW)","review":"Shipping was FAST but it's super hard and has to warmed up in micro for 15seconds to be able to use it but I got this for 2 stretch marks that I have recently noticed behind my legs and used this product twice a day for 1month and saw no results at all so I threw this junk to garbage where it belongs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of this product","review":"I purchased this product for myself and my mother. When the product was received it was shipped in a box with no accompanying packing slip and no labels on the product. I found this very strange. I have never ordered a product without a label telling you what the item was or what the uses would be. I contacted the company to return it and they accepted the return, however I had to pay for return shipping which was about 1/3 of the cost of the order. However, I had no choice but to send it back because after my mom saw it she said the shea butter was lighter than the shea butter she had and it just didn't look right. Unfortunately I will not be purchasing any more shea butter from this supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Heads","review":"Not very good at the selling. When they send you the wrong thing and its leaking too and then you confront them they dont understand it. And tell you to send a leaking package back through the mail knowing full well that you cant send things like that through the mail. Try to explain it and they say HUH? WE DONT UNDERSTAND. So buy at your own risk but dont expect to recieve what you ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful crumbly texture","review":"This is not a cream! I've never seen shea butter like this - when I opened the container the shea butter was dried out and crumbly, not a smooth cream/paste like other shea butters. Because I was in a time crunch I had to use it to make my holiday gifts (lotion), but the final texture of the lotion was also crumbly not smooth due to the low quality shea butter. The lotion moisturizes very well (though I do not know if that is due to the shea or the other oil I added to the lotion), but the texture is awful and I will never use this product again. Spend a little more money for a better product, this one is not worth a penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I needed","review":"Thanks for allowing me to save money on a textbook I'm only going to use once but have on my shelf for a lifetime.

Two years in the making and coloured with the pleasures of sampling, The Invisible Man is a journey into optimism and a fragile contentment by way of grief, regret, and stark introspection. A real human warmth shines through on Can You See? and Christian Science Reading Room is bitingly funny, but like some whispered privacy, eavesdropped on a late night corner, Steve I Always Knew stuns with its candour. Without You, and Anything, cut with a deep familiarity, confirming that no-one frames misery like Eitzel, but despite and because of everything the single and closer, Proclaim Your Joy, crammed with silly word games, completes the picture as a triumph over adversity. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the pile!","review":"These authors are perhaps best known for their book entitled 'Principles of Self Hypnosis' (now out of print) which for many years was the most regularly recommended primer on this subject. This academic work completely updates the former book and adds much new research to the subject area. It is very extensive in nature and written in a style that facilitates access to both the professional and the lay person wishing to use self hypnosis for their own benefit. The book is accompanied by an excellent audiotape which clearly demonstrates many of the techniques described in the book. Whilst appearing a little expensive when compared with other self hypnosis books, this book and audiotape (Available separately as Steps to Self Hypnosis) can definitely claim to be 'top of the pile' in quality of content, research and writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok,.....but,.....not really impressed,...","review":"Hi,...Maybe its me,..but I was not as happy with this as I thought that I'd be,...I will keep trying to listen to the CD,...& read the book,...though,.just in case,.I haven't given it as fair of a reviewas I should have,...,...LH"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK read till the middle...","review":"It starts out very well by going into the action and it is well written until you get to the center of the novel. At that time I felt that I needed a college degree to get thru the rest of it. The book goes into a metaphysical, scientifical, and all other ifical reasons and explanations for the origin of heroes.Not what I thought when I saw it. i read one other Justice League novel and it was almost the same way. This has turned me off to this type of novel.Use your money to go and get a comic book, it is better in my opinion.Welty69"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow was this bad.","review":"Ask anyone who knows me - I'm a GL fan. Especially of Kyle. What Dennis O'Neil did to this book almost makes me re-think that. O'Neil decided to, for no particular reason, and not done very well, was completely re-write the origin story for Kyle. The only thing that remained was the bar. Alex is gone. Major Force is gone. Hal is gone. Ganthet is there too much! It's as if O'Neil had a story in mind for the re-vamping of GL all those years ago and this was his version and he wanted everyone to read it. Guess what? Its bad. You don't feel anything for Kyle. In fact, you could care less about him or anyone around him for that matter.I had high hopes for this book and I couldn't have been more dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"why was it wriiten","review":"This book was so meaningless that the author did not bear in mindaction,adventure etc. There is nothing in this book that I like.I respect the author a great deal, but he blew it with this book.I hope that the next book of his I get \\"Batman Begins\\" does not disappoint as much as the Green Lantern story did."},{"rating":"2","title":"JLA books are the best!! (NOT a graphic novel)","review":"This was a really cool book! Im a huge comic book fan and I have almost everyone made. I still lack a few however and they are pretty hard to find. The best books that i have read have been the JLA series. I highly recommend them to any comic book fan. This book has a little bit of all the green lanterns. Hal Jordan is the Spectre, Kyle Rayner is the main character, Alan Scott, the original green lantern is Kyle's girlfriend's father. I am not going to tell you the plot other than it involves Sinestro. It is a very good book. Can't wait for the next one. By the way the other JLA books are Batman: Stone King, Superman: Neverending Battle, Wonder Woman: Mythos, JLA: Exterminators, Flash: Stop Motion . All are very very good!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck were they thinking???","review":"Ok. Kyle was the GL in the DC Comic book world for a long time. He took over for Hal Jordan who decided to take a long needed vacation (ok, he went crazy and killed a whole bunch of people but hey, my version sounds more real then what this novel did).This novel in one word sucked. It bastardized the entire origin of Kyle Rayner and how he became a Green Lantern. It destroyed what happened to Coast City and how it tied into Superman. It made the Atom seem like a pain in the tucas and the only character that was written correcly was Batman.Hal is in this but not in a good way. Kyle is in this and it too is not in a good way. When did Kyle ever call Ganthet \\"Gandy\\"? And why in the heck did the other Oan's want to remake the universe...wasn't that Hal's job when he became Parallax???In a nut shell if you like Green Lanter, any version of the character, read the comics and put this book down. There are much better novels out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"As annoying as Ryan Reynolds acting.","review":"The production of this audio book is excellent and that's the best part.

I spent most of the book trying to follow the convoluted storyline. I borrowed this and several other Justice League novels from a friend and, with the exception of this one, I rather enjoyed them. I did not enjoy this one at all and am very glad I did not spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"do you really want to read a book that has Superman say \\"Go ahead, lovers of evil,\\"??? because I don't, but I did...regretfully. I know that writers are allowed to write poorly, so this isn't an attack at O'Neil, he just seemed uncomfortable writing about the character. So, bottom line, the story is really bad, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the last paragraph is one of the best paragraphs I'd ever read"},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only; Experts AVOID THIS ONE!","review":"WoW! How can somebody gather up secondary sources and call this a book is beyond me! All it is is a listing of the websites where they sell products to you and the sites or stores features.

You will not hear crisper, cleaner harmonies. There are other groups and choirs that are as good, but none better.The variety of music genres on this double album is very impressive; Jazz and Swing of course, Latin, Rock, Fusion, Soul and Folk, all performed with such skill, and in a manner true to the genre.I saw Manhattan Transfer live recently, and wanted to buy one album that best decribed their work. I chose this album and was thoroughly pleased with the choice. If you like great music, and great harmonies, then this album will become one of your favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really nice","review":"Yeah this is kinda un-Orbital but it's not such a bad thing. The score that they make is creepy and it wouldn't be something you would listen to everyday ( unless you're seriously unstable ) but as a soundtrack it sounds thoroughly listenable and cohesive and not just something random thrown together. They make a good go at it and is worth the effort. It's also got this creepy ambience to it which is almost beautiful. Occasionally it gets into really noisy industrial territory so perhaps you'd have to be a big fan of that particular genre to enjoy this music. However this wouldn't be the best place to start if people are looking to get into Orbital. Look elsewhere if you are a beginner, this is only for the hardened Orbital fan ( and even then people are divided on this )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Import for $35","review":"This one is pretty much the epitome of mediocrity as far as sound tracks are concerned as it is just that, a soundtrack and little more. It definitely has a movie feel, and only a movie feel. I wish I could say I have seen the movie that this goes with, but that seemes even harder to obtain than this CD.There are maybe two tracks I would consider listenable if you aren't in the mood for pure movie ambience. Those being Moment of Crisis and Initiation.Even if you are a die hard Orbital fan such as myself I would not pay the premimium price to get my hands on this. I'd try Ebay first. It might turn out to be much cheaper that way....If you are looking for good Orbital for listening, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just so...

Though I do have to admit that if it did not flex as it does I would not have been able to fin one of my stands in it.2) It might be nice to have a couple compression straps.

It is not a coated tweed jacket like some of the pricier cables. Simply use a little care, though and it'll be fine.-The connectors are very solid, but because the connector housing is screw on, they can come unscrewed. If this is a problem, a little lock-tite on the threads will prevent this.Overall:For the money, these cables sound great, and (with a little care) will continue to look very nice.

Personally, I bought the CD just for the two gorgeous songs \\"San Francisco\\" and \\"Love is All Around.\\" Either one of those would be worth the price of the CD, but there are lots of classics included. A few of the tracks don't seem to stand the test of time particularly well, but may be worthwhile to those who have an historical interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"50/50","review":"This is only a so-so compilation. It does contain a few real, original tracks. But it also has some lame remakes and some songs that were never on the charts in 1967, or any other time. Those who can remember 1967 will find this unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing look at our misperceptions of Zulu history.","review":"Carolyn Hamilton writes with a commanding knowledge of her subject, in this case the Zulu founding king Shaka kaSenzangakona. Hamilton's efforts are essential reading for anybody who has wondered about the myth that is Shaka. She shows how he has been used to symbolise Zulu power, and how many Zulu historians have erred by casting him as a villain or a hero without having enough evidence to prove it. Hamilton's approach is highly refreshing. While she always respects the limitations of a subject that has bewildered many, her angle is intriguing. Her work ranks right up there with the great Zulu historians: John Laband, Jeff Guy and John Wright. And that is more than enough reason to purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a children's book???????????????","review":"Basically this book is about a man (Willie) who takes the boots off a dead man who he finds in the woods. Since it is so cold outside, the legs of the dead man snap off when Willie steals the boots and the feet are still inside the boots. Then Willie feeds the feet of the dead man to a cow.

Since they won't come off easily he breaks them off, legs and all, and takes the severed limbs with him. When a farmer refuses to let him stay in his house and sends him to the barn, the piper decides to play a joke on him, thaw the feet out and give them to the cow to munch on. The farmer flees in horror. This is a downright creepy and scary book that is not appropriate for children ages 5-8 at all. I'll be throwing my copy in the trash rather than donating it and risk having an innocent child pick it up.

The Keynote app has always suffered from its inability to share with PC users. Oh yeah, I know I can convert a Keynote file to Powerpoint, .swf, QuickTime, or PDF, but the problem is that, especially when converting to PowerPoint, Keynote loses all its buttery-rich goodness. It's a PowerPoint problem, I realize, but without a Keynote viewer, there's no way around it. Thus, Mac folks must rely on Microsoft for slide presentations if they don't want to lug around their Mac laptop.Also, installing Tiger will mess up the purchased Keynote templates you have saved. Even reinstalling them won't help.My humble advice is to wait a couple of years until Apple fixes the bugs in Tiger, then MAYBE think about using a Mac. Until then, I'm switching back from a Mac to a PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Here *was* my dillema. I wanted to create awesome looking documents. My choices were Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign. Word is too unforgiving and InDesign, while great, has a high learning curve and is too cumbersome for casual users. Pages is the perfect combination of both. You can even export it into Word for PC users (or if you work regularly on both formats). With Pages, you can create very professional-looking documents that will rival what your co-workers created in InDesign.In my opinion, Pages is much better than Word. While I like Keynote (which you can also export into PowerPoint) better than Power Point, I still think PowerPoint is a very good application. At $79, this product is well worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is really great!!!","review":"First of all I can't talk about keynote. I have been only using Pages, but it has repaid widely the price that I paid for the whole suite. I must admit that I have become an addict. Pages offers an awesome flexibility to produce documents with an incredible layout. I have a small consultancy firm and we have been using it to make our brochures and reports. It has of course some topics to improve such as better orthography checks or include an equation editor like MS Word.Besides that you could use it intuitively I would strongly suggest to check to manual to get a more professional finished document."},{"rating":"2","title":"iWork '05 Mac","review":"I have AppleWorks 6 and MS Office 2004 on my laptop, but I prefer to use iWorks.

Each member gets a turn to shine in the soptlight. Although I originally bought this because I liked \\"Cisco Kid\\" I found out that Cisco was by far not the best song here. In my opinion \\"Slipping into Darkness\\" is one of the best live songs ever recorded. Broken into 2 parts it ends up being about 17 minutes of pure joy. Another great surprise is \\"Get Down\\" a funk-driven, semi-protest song about race relations and police brutality.I would HIGHly recommend this to any War Fan (unless you think Low Rider was their best), any funk fan, or just about any live music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ALBUM, BUT RIP-OFF FORMAT","review":"I hate it when greedy record companies do this:The total track time of both discs runs under 78 minutes.

This thing makes it fun to trim hedges. It's easy to use, does a great job, and you get to see the fruits of your labor immediately -- unlike with some annoying yard chores. I'm sure you could take your finger off pretty easily with this thing, but it's light enough, powerful enough to get through half inch branches (although I'd recommend pruning shears for those to avoid stressing this thing) and the long reach of this blade makes quick work of even large hedges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker Hedgehog trimmer 23'","review":"Waited too long to buy this.

All in all a great tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker Hedge Hog trimmer 24 inch","review":"Good trimmer for the money.

I appreciate the light weight, the carry balance, the cutting power, everything about it works for me. During the past month, I have trimmed hedges that were WELL overdue to be trimmed and it cut through the branches to make a clean cut line. I trimmed mock orange shrubs, rosemary shrubs, fence climbing, and taller, shrubs, trail marking bushes, and many others. It has been easy and so it has been fun to see the great results. I must say, my opinion of B&D has been elevated a LOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice electric hedge trimmer","review":"I purchased this Black & Decker HH2450 electric hedge trimmer to use on our smaller hedges and bushes. It works very well on the smaller items, but the Stihl HS45 gas trimmer that we also have makes minced meat of it on the larger evergreens and shrubs. However, if you only have a few, we have 139 arbor vita evergreens along our back yard border, then this electric hadge trimmer is worth looking at. It takes a little effort to get the larger branches and twigs to feed into the smaller B&D HH2450 trimmer. But I guess this is because of the safety design of the blades on it. I will note that I have already cut into my jeans and some minor cuts on my legs with the larger more powerful Stihl gas trimmer and its larger opening teeth on its blades. You just have to be more careful when using the larger, heavier, noisier and smelly gas trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value and Good Quality","review":"I've used this product and was impressed at it's preformance and the ability to do the job very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, powerful, noisy","review":"Very nice hedger for the price.

It was definitely an improvement, not as much blade speed but greater cutting power. Hedge branches from 1/4\\" were very easy, but 1/2\\" took some work but still cut. I researched online many trimmers and for the price/usefulness thought this was the best for my money. I have 40-50 ft of hedges on both sides of my yard, but if I had double the hedges, I might have considered a more powerful and heavy duty trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"So I was a little reluctant to purchase these trimmers. I really wanted a gas one, but the price was ridiculous. I also looked at the battery operated ones and buy the time you purchase the battery and charger, you might as well have bought a gas trimmer. ANYHOW...These trimmers are amazing! Yeah, you have to be careful for the cord, but they are very lightweight and they cut through so much. They aren't lying when they say \\"3/4inch\\" diameter that it can cut through. Great power! The only issue I have had is with the lock down device. I feel like I have to consistently re-lock down the bar to turn it on. I feel like it could have been made better, so that you aren't constantly holding it, but then again, maybe a safety feature. I really appreciate the job it did on my hedge though and I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for about 15 minutes","review":"Worked great for literally 15 minutes!!I had high hopes for this product. B&D; isn't really known for their quality these days but the reviews seemed to be mostly positive. I guess I shouldn't really knock the product too much since I went the cheap option and got a \\"refurbished\\" one. Buyer beware. I guess refurbished means buying a formally broken one. If you really want this trimmer forget the $20 you will save by buying a refurbished one. I bought a new one from Home Depot for the same price. At least if it breaks I can just take it back to the store same day. With B&D; that is probably likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I purchased these shoes for my son based on the commercials and features of the shoes.

This movie chronicles professional wrestling in its glory days and one man, Lou Firpin's, struggles to purify wrestling and rid it from excessive violence and bleeding. A truly inspirational character, watch all about Lou's trials and triumphs as he struggles to take down the noble Sheik.

What surprises me most of all is that the author devotes the first half of his book to convincing people that marekts are inefficient. But what guy believing in efficient markets would ever consider buying a book on investing in the first place ? Right: anyone interested in this book can skip the first half. The second half is rather superficial and brings nothing new on the table for people familiar with value investing. My advice: avoid this book and buy instead 'The essays of Warren Buffet' of the same author. The latter is really a must-read for anyone serious about investing !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel book before travel was popular.","review":"Read this book many years ago from a library.

It aims to help you gain dynamic and rhythmic control with all odd and even subdivisions up to 8 per beat. The study does not focus on just one surface (such as the snare) but the entire drum set. The included CD is also very helpful with this; it is very much like having Chaffee as an instructor to explain how to apply these studies on the drum set AND play the ideas for you.I recommend you study this book along with Mike Mangini's Rhythm Knowledge (Vol. 2)--why doesn't Amazon.com have this book??

The departure of Keish (w/Blackie taking over vocals) and their hiatus has paid off in the newest version of the band. \\"Sunny\\" is the best pop-punk song of recent memory and is orders of magnitude better than the snotty, polished, and flaccid efforts now formulated by Blink-182, Sum 41, Good Charlotte, et al.

I recently bought the Japanese DVD of TETSUO 2 and it has got audio commentary by the director, a making-of-documentary and a photo gallery. None of the above are on this DVD which is a shame because TETSUO is cult cinema and a special edition treatment (especially a subtitled audio commentary track a la WINGS OF HONNEAMISE) would have been most welcome. The only good thing I can say about this disc is that MANGA at least offers the original Japanese version with subtitles as opposed to their DVD of the two DEVILMAN OVAs which you have to watch dubbed or not at all (the latter is recommended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Core","review":"Essentially, 'Bodyhammer' is the original 'Tetsuo', but with added commercial appeal. It's filmed in colour (black, white, *and* purple), and explains a lot of the action with a plot, one which unfortunately seems to be borrowed from a million-and-one other Anime films. Still, as with the original, the style is the important thing, and '2' has it in bucketloads. Pushing the boundaries of pre-Cat III censorship to the limits, although you never see anything particularly disturbing, the excellent grindcore soundtrack and furious visuals make you think that you are witnessing a hell on not-quite-earth.

The Brandywine Singers are known primarily by their commendable 1993 \\"World-Class Folk\\" album, but this reproduction of their first record album in the 1960s is considerably better. Each of the tracks is well arranged and beautifully sung. The original Brandywine group is not only superior to its later version (which has two of four members in common), but compares favorably to other folk groups of the era. For example, their \\"Raspberries, Strawberries\\" is much more poignant than their 1993 version or the Kingston Trio hit. Every one of the 12 tracks is excellent, and the only factor leading me to rate this as 4-star rather than 5-star is that, apparently following the original LP format, there are only 12 tracks.

I took it back to the local store to exchange for a new one of the same model. In case the first one broke because of rough handling, I treated the new one like a glass ornament. That one broke during its first use. Both times the thing broke I was running it almost continuously for about a half hour, so I suspect a meltdown of the drive mechanism as observed by others here, though I never took it apart to confirm.

The power of the motor is great, but that power is too much for the rest of the components.To wit: the spool housing is dense plastic connected to a metal \\"driveshaft\\". After only a few uses the plastic became deformed and stripped out. The driveshaft spins, but the spool does not rotate. The replacement part is about $15.00 delivered.

As you can imagine, this is also a HUGE waste of time and string to frequently have to rethread the spool. I usually cannot complete one edging around my yard without having to rethread. To me this is a tremendous inconvenience and waste of money.I have tried the original B&D; trimmer string and a different brand of string to see if that fixed the problem.

At first it seemed great, but the head stopped turning. There is a plastic drive gear inside that melts in many, if not most of these trimmers after relatively short use - check the internet for this common problem. You must replace the entire motor assembly to fix it because the plastic race that holds the gear also melts so it no longer aligned with the metal motor drive gear forcing the belt off the pulley. The assembly costs almost as much as the trimmer did and won't likely last any longer. I will never buy another Black and Decker product. In fact, I won't even take one for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out on third use","review":"I've used this product for little more than an hour total since I bought it last fall. After making a strained sound for about 10 seconds the motor runs, but the head doesn't spin. In hindsight, this was most certainly the gears disintegrating inside the engine. As other review elude, the motor is too strong for the shoddy plastic parts used to construct it. A very dissapointing product. The machine worked great when it did work, but that does me little good now, $100 lighter in the wallet with a have weed-wacked lawn.

The first few times of moderate use was OK, but the first 2-3 hour extended use showed it's true colors, or I should say did not, and that color is green... the green of the trimmer line. It stopped feeding the green plastic line. I worked on it for hours with limited success, (5 to 10 minute use before another problem). One time it spun off three or four feet of line in seconds, cutting it into it's 6\\" or so lengths and slinging it at high speeds in all directions.

I go through about 4-5 when I'm edging the lawn, and that's only in the front! It's not much fun troubleshooting or changing spools.

I am constantly resetting the string and it does waste lots of string. Also, the string mutilated the cap by breaking all the plastic molding inside and around the edges of the cap. I did complain to B&D about the cost of a replacement cap and eventually got an agent that was willing to send me a free replacement cap and a spool of string--and that is reasonable and good customer service.

It was hard to disassemble, because one screw is hidden under the long \\"PUSH and TURN for Edging, PUSH to adjust height\\" decal.

The trimmer spool design is horrible. (mine is not on the recall list) At first, I thought it was just me and dealing with a different type of spool, but in reality it is just the spool. Entire chunks of the green trimmer string unwind and break off, which makes it run out faster. Also, when you purchase a new spool and open it, it completely unwinds into a mess. Attempting to re-wind the trimmer string is impossible because it gets tangled and, therefore, useless.

I have had this trimmer for less than a year and while I was using it for the first time since the fall the string head stopped rotating but the motor kept going.

This is one of the most expensive corded trimmers and at the time that I got it the reviews were a little more positive and it had also gotten favorable reviews from consumer reports. I guess they just don't make things to last. Everything else about the trimmer is fine.

Upon the first time using it, the string advance was obviously broken from within the first 5 minutes of use. It managed to auto-advance the entire spool of factory stock string in the time it took me to do half of my front yard. I was picking up chopped string bits all over the yard that where anywhere from an inch to 4 inches long. Sometimes, the string would be advanced so far that it would get caught and pop the spool cap right off. My neighbor enjoyed the amusement, though after the 5th or 6th \\"Good Grief!\\" range out from me while trying to use this thing. I had to borrow his to finish up my yard.

The dual-line spool hurls itself and its cap like a hockey puck every five minutes, requiring an Easter egg hunt and dual respooling. Fun! Careful, though, when ya go to deal with this, cuz the business end gets so hot, you could burn yourself touching nearly a foot up the shaft.Today was my third stab at using the muther: after two de-spoolings it got creative and the protective cover vibrated off, which allowed it instantly auto-feed out an extra two feet of line and slash at my ankle. And so tonight, bloody and bowed, I brought it back and replaced it with a Troy-Bilt.What's funny is, it was still sorta hard to do, cuz this thing is beautifully balanced, a pleasure to the hand and the eye, and cuts like a maniac.

In their smaller model it is a small plastic swivelling piece which wears out.Apparently recognizing this, in the 7.2 amp version, the plastic knob has a thin metal jacket which, at some point, must have come off, since the small plastic knob on the mechanism has once again sheared off, preventing the line from feeding. Making the entire (small) piece out of metal would solve this problem.I would never consider buying this product again. The 10 cent piece that wears out is not replaceable.

On paper it looks good. In action it disappoints no end.First, the auto feed seemed like a good idea, except that the high rpm needed to feed the string cause unforseen consequences. For one you never know when it's going to auto feed. When it does feed it causes the head to dip and subsequently damage the lawn.Second the string feed cap flies off and ends up a long way from where you are working.Third, the build on this \\"dog\\" is cheap and probably won't last the life of the warranty.

Mine was well after any recalls - the thing EATS trimmer line. I don't have a large yard, but my single line trimmer could be loaded and would last me at least 3 mowings before needing to be reloaded. Twice now I have had to reload the spool 2 times in ONE DAY. As others have said - wear Army boots and heavy denim as the line will fling out and massacre your legs. I have had this piece of junk for 2 months and I am ready to throw it into the trash bin.

I swear I spent more time applying band aids (yeah I know, long pants...) and trying to get the line to feed properly than I did weed eating.Not only is it poorly designed from a shin saving standpoint but even when it feeds line properly (infrequent) it uses the .80 line like crazy. Sure, it has plenty of power and can cut through nearly anything, but the strong motor doesn't make up for the poor design and safety deficiencies. The best thing I can say about the \\"grass hog\\" is that as a string trimmer it's decent but extremely hard to control- it kept digging in and wanting to cut way more than I needed. As an edger it's flat out terrible and leaves pieces of line all over my yard and street.A real piece of garbage (literally).

About a month ago, I decided to get a new trimmer, so I cracked open the Consumers's Report and noticed that this one was very highly rated. Good enough, I thought, so I ran down to the local big box lumber store and bought one. However, I should have researched deeper and read the user's reviews at Consumer Report and also here at Amazon. They tell the real story. In my opinion, Consumer Reports really missed it on this one.It cuts great. It has more than enough power. The trouble is the self-feeding line feature that sloughs off line at an incredible rate. This is not adjustable. A good 3 to 4 minutes is all that the fully loaded reel will last. The large chunks of wasted line being cut off and slung is dangerous and will sting through jeans and break the skin if shorts are worn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap for Black and Decker.","review":"I bought this a few years ago and hate it.

Now I am back to using that old Sears trimmer which is a little bulky and isn't as fancy looking but still does the job.

I weed-whack for just a few minutes before I have to sit down and respool it.I got in touch with customer service last year and they sent me a new spool for free, but it's still the same problem. It HAS to be design flaw. That means, you can't fix it, you can just avoid buying it. I HATE this trimmer, and I so rarely use that word because it's an ugly word; however the pitfalls heavily outweigh its advantages.DO NOT BUY THIS THING! :O AAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Breaks - Poor Quality","review":"The rotating head broke on the 2nd or 3rd use. After 4 months of usage the drive mechanism, between the electric motor and the head, failed because of stripped teeth. This is the worst trimmer I've had among the 4 I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major defect","review":"This is my second GH1000. Heres the problem: there is a toothed drive belt with metal pulley on the motor and a plastic pulley on the trimmer side. Run this very powerful trimmer for more than a few seconds at full power and the plastic pulley will melt, often times breaing the belt as well. B&D should rightfully recall and replace the plastic pulley with a better one. The feed mechanism works like this, when the strings get short it releases about 18\\" of string on each side, which will cut through your pants, untill the blade on the cover cuts the string to the proper length. I have been cut more than once. Solution is to manually pull out the strings. Love the power but I am amazed this mess is still on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very expensive to use - too much trimmer line","review":"This trimmer (newer version without any recalls) is awful. It was great when new, but just a few months later I can barely trim around our small front lawn without using an entire spool of trimmer line. I've used more trimmer line in a month than I would in an entire season with the \\"old technology\\" version. If it snags on anything - look out - you've just lost about 2 feet of trimmer line. And if you're edging along a fence, you can count on having to reload the trimmer line by the time you finish one side.It is also very difficult to control and heavier than other corded trimmers we have had in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!

Then 1 month, and now (this is 15th of July, 08) they will not be available until Jan. '09!!! Customer service told me nothing they could do, except i could order an entire replacement head, which with shipping & handling would cost almost as much as a new trimmer, which I am going to buy, but it will certainly not be a Black & Decker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going to look elsewhere..........","review":"I have owned the Grass Hog XP since last year and I have one main complaint: when edging, there is not enough resistance in the line to cause it to feed. It just gets shorter and shorter unless you turn it over and engage the string with thick grass. The edging guide keeps it too far away from the ground for the line to come into contact. And when it does advance while edging, it throws the head around and diverts the cutting path, making it very difficult to cut straight. It is quite frustrating. My dad used it as well - somehow the button that allows the head to rotate from weeding to edging got stripped, it will not stay in the edging position solidly anymore. That could have been his fault: but the auto feed is not and leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money.","review":"I purchased one of these useless grasshogs thru Amazon in May of 07.

The metalic shaft sways freely left and right. It's loose at the button that allows to change from horizontal to vertical orientation. Top of the shaft would sway just a little bit, but head (the far part with the string) would sway much more, in sudden jumps, making straight cut very hard to do, keeping me in great tension all along. I checked more B&D; GH trimmers at the store - all had swaying shafts. Beware.2. As many others have noted, the string melts in the casing and then feeds too fast, and then none at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice trimmer, so far so good","review":"I bought this trimmer after I noticed the $50 lower price on Amazon compared to my local brick & mortar store.

I spent more time taking the spool off and pulling the string out than i did actually weedeating. The spool was very difficult to remove. It was a total hassle.

I had two models---a Craftsman and a Ryobi---that were rugged, dependable and quite powerful---they lasted for years. Now they just put these toys and rechargeable ones on the market. Battery power is okay for small jobs, but would you ever get aboard a battery-powered airplane?This is the only corded one I could find...a total piece of junk.I guess I should have read the reviews carefully---I thought B & D might have fixed the spool issues.Seems powerful, but the line kept breaking off inside the spool housing. Once the housing comes off, trimmer line leaps out at you like a spring-loaded snake. After two tries with the same result...forget it.I managed to cut a 4 x 9' swath before giving up on this.Update: I found a Stihl corded trimmer that is a fabulous corded machine--- the FSE 60.

After four fruitless attempts to contact customer service (once online where I received a form response that didn't help, and three disconnections on the phone) I gave up. I used to be a great Black & Decker fan, but this was the last straw. I earlier had to replace a useless power vacuum that burned out.Since I wasn't getting any help on line or by phone, I dismantled the Grasshog to find that the plastic gear had been worn smooth. The teeth were totally worn...after only two uses! Who makes a plastic gear on a \\"heavy duty\\" grass trimmer? I strongly urge you to stay away from this product and I urge Black & Decker to go back to making products that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"GH1000 is garbage","review":"This thing will break after a few times under normal use. My broke while in warranty, which means that they will send me a replacement so it will work a few more times before it breaks again.UPDATE: Well, I've used the replacement unit 3 or 4 times and it hasn't broken yet. However, it goes through about one full spool after every use. Therefore, still 1*.I am buying a new trimmer and throwing this one in the trash. I wouldn't wish this thing on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Do you want a really powerful trimmer that will flail your legs while spooling off all of the string in about 15 minutes? Do you want a really powerful trimmer that grabs the ground and cuts your grass right to the roots no matter how firmly you hold it? Do you want a trimmer that requires good hearing protection to prevent deafness? This, then, is the one for you. Apparently the designer has never heard of speed control because this unit has none; it just screams at full speed all the time that it is on. I didn't bother with the fix it because no fix it kit is going to fix all the things that are wrong with this trimmer.

At the time I shopped for mine, last year, it was the best in its class. And it did do a great job, right up until last week when the belt and plastic gear melted and fused together, which is apparently not a rare problem on this trimmer. I can't see buying the whole motor assembly just to have this happen again, so I guess it's time to throw it out and shop for a replacement. This time, the Amazon reviews will be consulted first.Real nice power, though, while it lasted, so I'll allow it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big hassle","review":"The line constantly binds and doesn't feed even with the pre wound that B & D sells.

I liked the large swath it cut so bought another GH1000. It was used twice and is now in the trash. In both cases the fibre belt slips around the plastic drive gear, heats it up and the gear melts. Did not send in the warranty registration because they wanted many,many questions answered about everything from \\"do I own a dog?\\" to \\"is this for weight control\\" and written in microtype light grey ink on trash paper.

For almost two minutes it worked perfectly...then nothing.The GH1000 was exchanged through Amazon.com and the second one arrived within a week. This one wouldn't even start. I checked the cord by plugging in another tool, and the second tool worked fine. So, the GH1000 was returned for a refund.

If you long for the good ole days when Jimmy Buffett songs were fresh and he still could relate to the common man then Burns is your answer!! This album is loaded with great tunes that if discovered by parrotheads will rocket up the sales charts!! My personal favorite song is Down in Paradise, followed by Vacation, If it's snowbird season then why can't we shoot them, and Livin' the life. There isn't a bad track on this CD so order it right away!!! You won't be sorry unless you miss out on discovering Brent Burns!!!

I carried my 11 year old niece to see him in Orange Beach and he now has a new head of his Fan Club. The only regrets I have about Brent's music is that I have worn out the first cassette he released several years ago and it is no onger available. This second CD is just as neat and just as much fun.

Go buy Far Side of the World instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Mr. Burns is trying to capitalize on Jimmy Buffett's fame, and if he had any talent at all that would be fine with me. He however is sadly lacking in talent and for me to pay $16.99 for this amateur effort was a waste of money. I guess I qualify as a Parrothead, and I was looking for a similar sound--tropical, laid-back...What I found was a guy using Jimmy Buffet's name in the title of his CD and insulting him in the lyrics. Livin' the Life is the worst song on this CD, followed by Vacation. Too Lazy to work...was a cute song, but not worth buying the CD for. I have never written a review about a movie or CD before, but I feel I must warn others--save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor vocal talent and unfounded lyrics.","review":"If I could give this album less than one star I would. Brent Burns has virtually no vocal talent which obviously why he only lays on the beach while Jimmy Buffett (spelled with two \\"T's) counts his money. It sounds as if he tape-recorded the album on a home stereo system with a Karaoke function. I also found the song \\"If It's Snowbird Season Why Can't We Shoot 'Em?\\" to be interesting since the beach he lays on is not located in Florida but in Alabama. Maybe he should stick to writing about the ten mile stretch of land he uses as a beach instead of writing about Florida beaches for which he was a tourist on as well. In short do not waste your money on this CD your money is better spent on something credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"leather is better","review":"i have been playing since i was 7yo. i have always played with leather grips. i returned to tennis after a long break and bought a second racket - it had synthetic grip. so i found this leather grip on amazon.com and bought 3. it is very good. works well in the middle of the summer (heat, humidity) and in the middle of winter. no slippery holds. ages well. i bought a third racket. and now have since replaced all of the synthetic grips with this leather grip. easy to wrap. not sold in most stores. told my teammates. 3/4 of them bought this grip, and now they are hitting a little more solid.... wait. um...whoops... oh weeeell. lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality leather grip","review":"I replaced my old grip using this Gamma Leather Replacement Grip and could not be happier.

Eventually, Gabrielle discovers the rumors are all lies and that Connor is actually a kind person whom she can trust. Turns out, it's Connor's brother, Colin who has the unsavory reputation.The only problem I have with books like this is when the author chooses to write the dialogue in a Scottish accent. I know the story takes place there, and that's how people talk, but to read it is very difficult. I found myself skipping over much of the dialogue between the Scottish characters.

I never realized how much the editors toned down the first edition. It is like Bill W told me, for example, that I should either reread the book again or throw it away but the editors decided not to allow him to tell me this (see page 27, paragraph 60.2 of the manuscript).

This way it's easier for the food mill to separate the skin and seeds. It might be a pain in the rear, but the final product is fabulous. If you don't want to bother with fresh tomatos, then I suggest purchasing canned tomatos (preferably Ciro). That way they are already soft and ready to be put through the food mill.

It is 42 minutes long and the transition to CD is very good.This album had two killer tracks, the 8 minute Roads To Moscow and the 9 minute Nostradamus. In between those 2 songs was the very good 3 minute Terminal Eyes, which reminds of the Beatles Come Together or I Am the Walrus, but not quite as wierd.The first side of the album consisted of some boring, tedious songs. It seems like Al Stewart is at his worst when he sings about the Navy (just like Lord Granville on the Year of the Cat).This was one of those LP's where you played only one side. You listened to the other once, and would never play it again.

The photos are a jumble of eras, sometimes totally irrelevant (such as two enormous photos of opera productions that have nothing to do with Mascagni's work at all--why? and why the largest photos in the book?) The logic is totally missing - no continuity, and simply wrongly stated facts, such as Pasi averring that \\"Isabeau\\" was based on a work by D'Annunzio - and then illustrates it with a picture of D'Annunzio, after correctly saying it was a libretto by Illica.Don't bother!

There are quite a few very good books on the subject like \\"In Cold Blood\\" and \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" (although some may not consider this true crime). However, \\"The Copeland Killings\\" is awful. The book is not well written grammatically, is fairly slow paced for such a short true crime book and is not even a good journalism story. Basically, Ray Copeland was a bad guy all along, so you never really get to the question, \\"What went wrong\\"?

I purchased the book because I inferred from the title that the book might be a useful source of information for some research that I am conducting. Unfortunately, the book is simplistic and does not cite a single outside reference. The book is a soft cover booklet of less than 100 pages, a book of this caliber would typically retail for $10-$12, a booklet of this age is worth perhaps $5.

The way the book explains grammar is confusing to native english speakers and the DVD will break on you...so plan on getting a back up. If you plan on getting al-kitab for independent study...GOOD LUCK!!! I only succeeded because I was under the care of a professor, al-kitab had little to do with my success.

In this follow up to \\"Too Much Temptation,\\" author Foster proves that plot and character development need not be present when you inundate your story with plentiful acrobatic sex and cardboard characters.

With TMT, I liked the characters of Noah and Grace (even though Grace was annoying at times) and felt the chemistry between them. With NTM, I never really felt anything for them.

Where were the usual sexy, fun characters? Where were the sizzling hot love scenes between the two main characters? The secondary characters of Ben's mother, Brooke, and Kent were the best part of the book. I was more interested in their story (which was minor) than in Ben and Sierra's.

It would be great to have the flashcards advertized with the book, but another reviewer says that neither they nor the advertized audio tapes come with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another MGM musical gem uncovered","review":"For those who love to watch or read about MGM musicals, Athena is a real treat. I first learned about it when Rhino Records released the newly remastered soundtrack some time ago. It may not be MGM's top musical, but it's great to revisit the MGM talent in a very good original film musical which was perhaps 20 years ahead of its time. The theme deals with healthy lifestyle living and nutrition. Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, and Vic Damone are at their peak and watch for Steve Reeves, better known for his Hercules film role. Great score by Meet Me In St. Louis team Martin and Blane. The tune Vocalize is one you will hum for days after first hearing. MGM musical fans enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever made","review":"I can't agree with the other revues. I am a big fan of MGM musicals and I love movies such as \\"Singing in the rain\\" and \\"Seven Brides for seven Brothers\\".But this movie is unbelievably bad : The plot is totally uninteresting and univolving; the playing is weak and the songs are boring (except \\"love can change the stars\\")This is one of the worst movies ever made"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good good good","review":"I've read many other fiction writing helping books (2!), and I can solemnly swear that this one is the best. Instead of destroying your dreams of being a writer by constantly reminding you that writing is a hard business to get into (as if I didn't know that), it offers you hope. The author obviously is experienced at writing fiction, as he teaches a class. This book is well garnished with many interesting and helpful anecdotes. The problems he adresses are things that I've been concerned about in my writing, but had not been able to find answers to in other books. It's written in a very easy to read and noncondescending manner, and has good eamples. I wholly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH ON MY LIST OF FAVORITES","review":"Fiction First Aid, by Raymond Obstfeld, is packed with practical, no-nonsense tips for troubleshooting a manuscript that \\"needs something.\\" It's organized simply, with chapters about plot, characterization, setting, style, theme, and the writer's life. Each chapter has sections describing symptoms, the ailment, diagnosis, and treatment. Because the author's approach assumes that the reader has already written a manuscript, I wouldn't recommend Fiction First Aid as the very first \\"how-to\\" book for a novice. But this one is high on my list of favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"below par","review":"I got this knife in a large set and was not pleased with the chef knife at all.

I haven't had any problems with all the other knives in the set, they are all well made last a long time before needing to be honed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Baba Yaga be evil, please!","review":"I am seriously conflicted about this book. No doubt it is well written and excellently illustrated. My problem is with the basic story and the \\"revisionism\\" of Baba Yaga's place in the world which seems indicative of a general trend to root all evil out of children's literature. In my opinion evil and fear are important elements in fairy tales and they prepare children to deal with the real world. Classic (pre-Grimm) fairy tales were incredibly graphic and scary (see Marina Warner's \\"From the Beast to the Blonde\\"). Baba Yaga has a definite and clear place in Slavic fairy tales--she is the main \\"evildoer\\" who eats children, etc. Let her be that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, describes every class of warship","review":"This book is quite entertaining when it comes to the quality of pictures.

World War 22. Cold War3. ModernEach time line come with explanation on different type of warship and classes. However, not everyship are covered.

The first half of the book you meet and learn all the suspects -- then the crime -- then the investigation of the suspects -- and finally a twist at the end when we learn who really committed the crime.

Their father seems happy, but they feel shut out. Many people had reasons to dislike Clio in the exclusive upscale Long Island town where the Fair Lawn Country Club is the mecca for the rich. When Clio dies during a tennis tournament there are many suspects. Frances puts her job as a lawyer on the line when she investigates Clio's murder over the wishes of her boss. The case develops into a voyage of personal discovery as she uncovers the true lives beneath the facades of the rich neighbors. Frances comes to a new understanding of the patterns of love in her family and in her own relationships. Uncovering the killer brings Frances even more revalations about her own character. The author shows how many faceted our motives and characters are. As Nancy Geary shows us, we rarely understand what drives other people fully, even our own families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous !!!!","review":"Ms. Geary's book is wonderful on a superficial level as a perfect 'who done it.' However, what sets the work apart are the subtle layers that lie beneath the basic plot. The human condition is the foundation from which the more complex, and wonderfully interesting, story springs quietly, yet poignantly. The portrayal of an aristocracy that is so foreign to most Americans is both approachable and intriguing. Ms. Geary has appeared on the scene with an unbeatable combination of force and grace.

The authors give great passages and problems specifically for the objectives in the 2nd grade curriculum. The practice items enforce what kids taught in school that otherwise just forgotten. The book offers many fine reading comprehension and vocabulary exercises. Your kids can never have too much of them.I like such practices as the reading is checked by the questions, so you know objectively how much is understood. Otherwise, your child may read many funny books but still has a poor comprehension. Another great resource like this is the Beestar ELA programs (www.beestar.org). They cover everything required in the curriculum, so you are confident that your child has obtained the expected knowledge and skills regardless how his teacher teaches him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful workbook","review":"Another great Scholastic reading comprehension book.

Also the back of the shoe comes up high on the ankle and caused a blister but I put moleskin on it and now it's fine. I have a wide foot and these are not narrow at all.

It was irritating and the sentences don't always make the point because some are from a different context. In one case he speaking in 2006 about his forecast of energy of the future, predicting that in 2010 New Zealand and Australia will be having rolling blackouts due to energy shortage.

Too often he used second/third hand works instead of going to the source. If you're going to quote B-P, read his works and cite them, not someone else who quotes him from another source.

On that score, suffice to say it is very well written, and revealed aspects of the war, its details, and personal histories (from various sides) that were fascinating throughout, and often proved completely eye-opening to me. The chapters on the Battle of Guadalcanal, for instance, are standouts. Leckie's other books are excellent, too (particularly his tome on the American Revolution), but this one is my favorite.

The way Mr. Leckie uses small chapters to explain specific events is interesting and gives the reader a sense of the the way the event was viewed by people at the time.

This CD has only the cheap 3:26 version of 'Strange Way' when the LP had the whole 4:45 version of the song. The VINYL LP is better than this newer CD. Hey Atlantic/WEA: how about a CD with the \\"LP version\\" of the songs - unless you want to call it \\"The Singles\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, Intelligent Novel.","review":"I was more than happily surprised to discover Huston's Balance. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience--Balance is a perfect blend of military, legal and Constitutional drama. The \\"dusting off\\" of the Letters of Marque and Reprisal is brilliant! I cannot wait until Huston's next effort.(And what is the deal with that Clancy/Pieczenik novel under the same title??? I have heard that it is not even in the same universe as Huston's book. Boy, are they going to look silly.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"James Huston has delivered a very good, fast-moving, pretty well-written first novel. His experience as a carrier-based fighter pilot has led to a great amount of detail in this aspect of the book, and it appears as though he's done a lot of homework on the behind-the-scenes of Washington and its power brokers, all the way to the White House. The story is almost hauntingly plausible, considering recent events in Southeast Asia, and should make more than a few heads turn in the foriegn policy shops of this country! I'll be looking forward to Mr Huston's next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but not interested......","review":"I found the entire book to be predictable and uninteresting. I am a huge fan of adventure/military fiction, but this one, unfortunately right after I read rainbow 6 (another loser) makes me reconsider. Try Cobb - Sea Strike instead or Steven Hunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very improbable","review":"I'm sorry. There are a bunch of 5 star reviews on this book and I just don't get it. Let's see - 3 best friends from law school are now the chief aide to the Speaker of the House, a counsel to the President and the top clerk to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. That's just preposterous.I also have a hard time accepting the basic premise of a Navy Admiral disobeying the Commander in Chief.The book seemed to have a distinct right-wing conservative philosophy - if that works for you go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, but a waste","review":"I bought the book, hoping it would be an interesting summer read. It had a great premise, a battle between Congress and the President, so the timeliness was attractive. Unfortunately, the action was anti-climactic, both on the political and on the military side. Characters were not well thought out, and could easily be lost in the shuffle. In the end, it was unsatisfying, and I missed the money I had dropped on buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of drivel I have attempted to read in years.","review":"I certainly won't be wasting any more of my money on a book by Mr. Huston. His characters seem to have never gotten past 10 grade. All relationships and dialogue reminds me of sophomoric stupidity. The so-called love story between a couple of VA law school friends (one now advising the president and the other advising the speaker of the house) is no relationship at all. The characters have no depth. The plot is thin and totally unbelievable. The idiot at the Washington Post Book World who penned the \\"If you like Tom Clancy you'll love 'Balance of Power'\\" line shown at the top of the back cover needs to find another line of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read and an interesting plot.","review":"I was really impressed with the author's knowledge of Washington politics, naval procedures, and the constitution. Like a Clancy novel, this scenario could actually play out in real life - scary, huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading, good background","review":"This book was based on an interesting premise. I also thought the background to joint military operations was well done-- as good as I've read. When he gets into the actual combat operations, it does become a bit apparent that the author was a pilot, not a ground pounder. As a retired special forces soldier, I found some of the ground operations a bit lacking, but not enough to detract from the overall book. If you want realistic ground special operations, try Bob Mayer's special forces series of books carried by Amazon. He's about as real as I've read-- which he should be considering he was also special forces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"After reading the other reviews, I was looking forward to a riveting book. But I was greatly disappointed. The quality of the writing was very uninspiring and basic. There were times I thought I was reading one of my child's fourth grade book. The characters were poorly developed. Finally, the book came to a simple ending, as if the author ran out of interest in the remaining pages. I was hoping to enjoy it like Vince Flynn's recent books, Term Limits and Transfer of Power, But this book palled in comparison. I will not read another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, fun book. Congress should read it.","review":"An excellent, fun book using the facts of our nation's Constitution.

An exciting techno thriller utilizing the American Constitution as the focal point for military action against terrorism. Author Huston, a former Naval aviator, really nails down all the battle components, whether they be with Marines on the ground, Seals all over the place, and fighter pilots eating up the sky.

I found myself reading well in the the night despite having to wake early. This book will draw you in.Mr. Huston did a great job with this one. I read 'Flash Point' and liked it equally as much.

I highly recommend it.Excellent work Mr. Huston. I think the Intelligence community could use your insight these days. be well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know how Joan of Arc felt","review":"I did read this book, and I did enjoy it. It is not only biographical but also philosophical and psychological. It covers the life of Morrissey from his childhood and influences to his days with the Smiths to his solo career. It is moreover a character study of how such a celibate, asexual man can be so sexual to so many people. The book has many pictures and memorable quotes from the artist, but it also prefaces with how the author himself has been influenced by him, and this prepares one for what mindset one should have in reading the rest of the book. It is a good read if you are into the Smiths, music, or if you just simply want to learn about a very unique human being. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozturbation.","review":"This is a great book. It provides a deep-dish psychological insight and fanalysis into Morrissey, and also more alliteration and word-bouncery than any sane human being could ever want.

The orange pc the tool snaps onto was outside of its slot and I had to file it down and then force it in with a screwdriver and hammer.

When I turned a page of the Kiribati story and realized that the story had ended, I actually laughed out loud and thought, \\"That's it???\\" It's not that the stories are bad, it's just that they lack any relevance or substance, anything to make them stand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"This book of short stories left me completely unsatisfied. The first story I enjoyed but was disappointed it didn't go farther. The second story was even less satisfying. I won't waste my time with the third. At least the price (free) was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good start...","review":"As some of the other reviewers noted, this book has a lot of potential. There are some great story ideas, but they are pretty much just that- ideas. I would have liked the stories better if there had been more character development. It felt like the stories ended just as I was really starting to get into the characters. It also might have been nice if all the stories somehow came together. Perhaps they do in a printed version (the kindle version only has 3 or 4 stories), but it was somewhat disconcerting to jump from one story to another without any real connection between them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"I tried really hard to like this book but just couldn't make it work. The plot line in the Kiribati test is jagged; one moment the lead character is trying to keep his head down and in the next his wife is literally being offered spa treatments. The story is filled with details that don't seem to add anything to the story line in one moment, only to forget to take the time to provide details that might explain seemingly bizarre behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kiribati Test","review":"This book has three separate stories that do not connect. It is almost like the author of the book had three very good book ideas but never fully elaborated on each of them. If the author of the book played out each story making each one it's own book it would have been good. Instead there are three different stories that don't relate into one book. Either I am not getting why he did this and am just ignorant or the book is not written well, not thought out well, and is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential","review":"The book, \\"The Kiribati Test\\", had lots of potential to be a great read, however it fell far short of it's potential.With one exception, all of the characters were under-developed. There are many plot items that are unexplored, and then the book just seems to end. There was no closure, no sense that the book was supposed to end. It just ended.The included short story, \\"Cuda\\", was much the same way.The one redeeming thing about this book is the short story \\"The Con Artists\\". There was just enough development to make it worth a read.Overall, I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"This book is OK, considering that it is free (for the Kindle). If I'd paid for it, I'd be disappointed. The writer's ideas are not bad, but they are a little predictable and not terribly unique. The writing itself needs some serious editing. There are places where the author seems to lose focus on the story, and there are a number of grammitcal errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs plot polish.","review":"The theme for these three stories is similar, the plots similar in one. In each, there's some skillful character devlopment, a situation contrived, and then a rush to a premature solution that collapses suspense and ends the story.I found them disturbing only in the observation that they each are too thinly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"This is the best lullabies tape. I got it as a gift and have since chased down several other Kevin Roth CDs and tapes. My daughter was hard to put down for her nap in her early months and she always feel asleep by \\"Quiet Times\\" so I remember it fondly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story line,","review":"Laciel, has been made the head of a strange group to follow an unknown person who stoled the one stone that keeps the world from falling apart.

I have worn VanEli 8N for years, but this was not comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Suspense Movie","review":"I really enjoyed it when it first came on the USA network 1990 i watched 3 different times. Sammi Davis is awesome as the Bride who kills people who gets in the way of her finace. If saw another one I recommend is Called Hush Little Baby it is the same type pf movie. There are some very talented people in The Perfect Bride like Kelly Preston (John Travolta's wife) Liden Ashby (from The defunct Melrose Place) Tamara Clatterbuck (Alice Johnson from The Young and The Restless. So i really hope u liked it like I did. It keeps u on the end of your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Bride","review":"Sammi Davis stars as a psycho bride who wants to prove to herself that her new husband is not like most men - piggish and self-occupied - and when she is eventually deceived, she plots his murder and the murder of friends and family of his who get in the way. Even the chase scene towards the end and the performances of Kelly Present and Davis can't make up for the otherwise bore and amateurish feeling of this film. The script is written as though it were a SCT skit, and the stunts are terrible. It's often entertaining in some ways, but the majority of the time, you're left sitting there looking at the screen and thinking: \\"Did I once have that sort of haircut?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bad copy","review":"I thought I paid for DVD's and they are tapes and most of THEM are copied and are not even clear!!!

Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after a few uses","review":"This sifter is poorly made and lasted me a half-a-dozen uses before it completely broke. The turning mechanism separated from the mesh pieces. I hadn't relized this until after I had filled it with powdered sugar, so I had to manually smack the sifter against my hand in order to get the powdered sugar out. Extremely laborious and irritating. Even before it broke I didn't like how it worked. The spring on the handle was really tight so the squeezing action made my hand fatigued before my sifting jobs were even close to being done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got rusted in less than 6 months","review":"Although this product is listed as stainless steel, it got rusted in 4 months of use. Also, I does not work very well, when sifting flour, the flour will stuck between the blades after few pulls. I will try to make a video review showing the rusts and the stuck flour. Don't waste your money with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever","review":"My wife and I bought this with money given to us at our wedding. One morning we decided to make waffles and about one cup into the sifting and I was so frusterated. I have helped my mother cook before and she has a crank sifter, which obviously works. This is by far the worst product i have ever used. I threw it away so that I would be forced to buy a new one the next time I needed a sifter. My advice is that you never purchase this, you are better off burning your money for heat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I got this sifter because my old one was a last-generation inheritance and on its last legs, but I swear, the old one works better than this one does. Two sifts in, you have to hit the side to get the flour to move around, and, worse, its inner gears are either rusting or wearing away to discoloration after only a month of using it every morning for pancakes. For the time being, I'm going back to my ancient sifter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after several uses","review":"After much research on Amazon, I finally chose this as the most likely to work. It was a gift for my wife who loves to bake. However, several weeks after it arrived it stopped working. The little wheels no longer spin when one squeezes the handle. Lousy quality. And since its been more than 30 days, I can't return it either. Do yourself a favor and buy a product that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three good study Bibles and one to prepare you","review":"This is an excellent tool. I do not consider the NIV a Bible, because it contains to much of what the translator thinks the words meant instead of just translating all the words, but the other three versions are very good and very handy to have in one place for study, and having the NIV helps a person to prepare themselves to deal with misunderstandings others may have due to reading the NIV, which is now a very popular pseudo-Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soviet propoganda. Buyer beware.","review":"This book was produced by the former Soviet regime to support their case for discriminating against Jews. It is an evil book full of lies and never should have been written.

Unfortunately, it has many problems which makes it function poorly. The cover threatens to come off when you pour, and leaks burning steam. Also, the pour spout is very narrow making the pouring process excruciatingly slow. To top it all off, it the spout drips as it pours. I love the way this pot looks, and will keep it for special occasions, but when I want to boil a lot of water and pour it out fast, I'll have to get another pot:("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking teakettle","review":"It's a very pretty teakettle.

Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but dangerous","review":"I burned myself two times with this kettle.

He uses it about everyday and it seems to be holding up very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent teapot","review":"Shopped around and was not impressed by the ordinary tea pots, until I seen this one. Loved the curved spout and the no whistle. My mom loved this as her christmas present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"Loved the tea kettle, however, after two months it developed a major crack and started leaking. I took all the precautions and read reviews on how to take care of the product, but it still failed. Now I'm out $40.00. I don't think that the cermaic holds up well to a gas burner, even though the manufacturer says you can use this kettle on such burners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tea kettle ever","review":"I love this tea kettle. I've had one for over 8 years now. I destroyed the original one I owned by leaving it on the heat after the water had boiled off - this is a no-no with this kettle. If you are willing to overlook the lack of a whistle and make sure it is always full of water, this little baby will become a beloved treasure. First of all, it looks really cool on your stove, because it is made of ceramic and wicker, so it gives a beautiful organic feel instead of the cold hard metal that most kettles are made of. Secondly, ceramic is a completely non-reactive material and safe, and you don't have to worry about it altering the taste of your water. Asians have used ceramic cooking vessels for thousands of years, this is by far the safest type of cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased this tea kettle in replacement of one that I had of the same brand. Less than one month after receiving the kettle it developed small chips in the outside bottom. I mailed it back to Amazon last week and am awaiting a refund.

Arrived promptly. Played without any interruptions. (Also, this movie was way more intense than I expected. A true horror story. If you like SVU you'll probably like this movie, but it is very graffic and the acting is superb.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and Well-Done","review":"An interesting story, very well told and passionately acted by Rachel Weisz. Balance between the business-like police work and the atmosphere of impending menace holds your attention and keeps you guessing. Cameo by Vanessa Redgrave is worth the price of the rental. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE IS NO GOING BACK","review":"Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a Lincoln Nebraska police officer. This is not the savvy Rachel Weisz role we are used to seeing. The beginning of the film tries to dummy down her character. Needing money she accepts a job in Bosnia as an observer, quickly moving up to a position of authority. She uncovers a sex trade scandal which involves the local police as well as her fellow co-workers and several international agencies.Attempting to do the right thing is a challenge especially when the victims fear to cooperate.This is not an exploitation film as the topic might suggest. There are no horrific graphic scenes and the nudity is on Polaroid photos. The script did not build the suspense, drama and excitement as one might expect. The actors were not as convincing as they should have been. Worth a view, but not owning.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whistleblower","review":"I thought the subject matter was very intense and dramatic, but well done.

But what I didn't notice is that the product description for the version I ordered says that the dialogue is dubbed. I consider the vast majority of dubbed movies to be tacky, and have little use for them unless the original audio track is also on the disk. So I haven't opened this disk to watch it, because I might need to return it. The actual back of the dvd case says that it has English, French, and Spanish subtitles, but who really knows?

I loved the movie too. Mary Higgins Clark has written some deliciously suspenseful novels. All the books she wrote before \\"You Belong to Me\\" were very good...excellent!

The unusual color combination is every bit as vibrant as it is depicted online, a great surprise.The laqueur can make them a bit slick for tackling dishes like shark fin stews -- I have dropped mine a few times, but then again, my notorious ineptitude with chopsticks may make that more likely to happen to me with or without laquer -- but they are well constructed and hold up well after multiple washings and heavy use.For entertaining, nothing beats these gorgeous chopsticks.

I am not surprised that the NY Times chose it as a Notable Book of the year. It shows the pain of a dysfunctional family living in Los Angeles, a typical enough theme. But the prose is both gentle and violent, the story very strong, and the themes of biracial indentity as complexly rendered as the subtly complicated characters. The two boys at the heart of this piece are half Filipino, and feel estranged from both white people and their mother's Filipino relatives. Rowley gets at their sense of being outsiders as aptly as Richard Yates. The ever present, but rarely seen father is a nice touch, for like the boys we rarely see him, so that he is an elusive memory, but always feel his powerful presence.

It's probably worthy of 3 stars if it were sold much cheaper, but I have to take off a star for price inflation.The best thing to do for people on a $100-150 budget for quality headphones is to shop around, and defintiely to check out forums like Head-Fi.org where users share their views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kick yourself for not knowing better","review":"These are the hype of headphones you are so excited to get home and see what the $$ gets you and when you plug in... let down to say the least!

The Sony MDR 7506's are less expensive as well. The triports are just a bit lighter, smaller and have a thinner cord, which you may find useful for mobile use. My choice between the two for serious listening would be the Sony MDR 7506.

A watch-sign is how Bose doesn't disclose this unit's Ohmage, range or diaphragm set-up, in package or at the official site.Will use them while they hold together, not much choice.Not at all recommended.

If they could just sit on your ears with no suspension design that would be a dream come true. However, for what ever reason, Bose has decided to make the headband not more than about a centimeter in width. The pressure of the band, after a while, wears a groove in the skin of my scalp, which is then very uncomfortable. Also the plastic of the headband is very cheap and will break in many pieces soon, out of stress wear. Keep your superglue handy. Mine have been repaired about 4 times. I inquired about parts from Bose and was told that if I sent the phones in, that it would be only $65 to repair them.

After a few more weeks of listening, they didn't get any better and when compared to my cheapie Koss KSC75 headphones, the Triports didn't do too well. The Koss was a better overall listening experience and made the Triports sound lifeless. This fact was made even worse by the fact that the KSC75 only cost $20. This infuriated me since I had just paid $150 for something that didn't sound as good as a $20 set of headphones and on top of that, the headband just broke!

Where'd the bass go? Why so much mid-range? So, I shouldn't be surprised when I listened to the Bose Triport headset. Nice sound. Bass? Nary any. Midrange? Plenty. Highs still silky smooth, but impossible to balance without an equalizer. Big disappointment... they don't sound as good as my $50 Phillips set.

It includes her renderings of the best known compositions from the Bacharach/David songbook including \\"Walk On By\\", \\"Anyone Who Had A Heart\\", \\"I Say A Little Prayer\\" and \\"Alfie\\". It also includes some wonderful near-miss hit singles like the exquisite \\"Looking With My Eyes\\", on which Dionne punctuates her delicate pop phrasing with some gospel shouting. \\"April Fools\\" showcases Dionne's interpretive gift -- the rare singer whose voice caresses both the melody and the lyric. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chic grooves; should become a legendary collection","review":"All Burt Bacharach has to do is plink a little on the piano keys and Dionne Warwick is already warmed up. They were both in the right place at the right time when they connected and, along with incredible lyricist Hal David, created the perfect team for '60's pop music. Radio played these songs all the way into the disco era, so strong was their force and their following. You can't resist the opening la-la's of \\"San Jose\\" or the emotional fervor of \\"Don't Make Me Over\\". The music is a heart-rending tidal wave of nostalgia, simplicity, sensuality and bittersweet longing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawlessly-crafted pop","review":"Dionne Warwick may not have the gusty soul of Aretha or the flashy divatude of Diana Ross, but she, alomg with Burt Bacharach and Hal David, recorded some flawlessly-crafted pop tunes of the 1960s. This collection is the best of the bunch. Of course, there's \\"I Say a Little Prayer,\\" which has been butchered countless times, but there are also some lesser-known tracks of note here as well. \\"I Don't Know What to Do With Myself\\" is an underrated and crushing breakup song, while \\"Always Something There to Remind Me\\" is the original recording that Naked Eyes would later cover in the 1980s. For over twenty tracks on one disc, this collection is a solid value and is recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality but great songs!","review":"Needs remixing badly.

Practically every track is a polished little pop gem, beautifully sung, well-produced and well-engineered. Light R&B, yes, but the singer projects abundant grace and charm, with drama kept to a minimum. And you just don't realize how many hits Dionne really had in the 60's until you hear them all like this, one after another. If you are a fan of her 60's work, and especially if you remember AM radio, this collection will be to your liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dione Warwick Collection:Her All-Time Greatest Hits","review":"This is a fabulous cd....a collection of all her great hits...listen to over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought it!","review":"Wow - what a flashback.

It is amazing that music so poor would be on a \\"Greatest Hits\\" disc (one would wonder what the \\"non-greatest\\" sounds like). Popular music would have been much better off had Ms. Warwick chosen not to make this music. \\"Walk on By\\" is an over-rated pop song that deserves a better vocalist. \\"Windows of the World\\" is pitiful. \\"The Empty Place\\" is uneven and indeed empty- very poor.

They have created a following over there and have cultivated curious people over here. Some male/female duos have been very disappointing in the past, but Devics have a real fresh sound. They are like an art rock version of The Beatles and Sparklehorse. Sara Lov sings on \\"Distant Radio\\" and it sounds very powerful. The descending four note patterns are pretty nice sounding. Dustin O'Halloran sings on \\"Song For A Sleeping Girl\\" which is more like The Arcade Fire and Sparklehorse. \\"Just One Breath\\" is a cool song. \\"The Way Love Talks\\" is more like a ballad that focuses on the qualities of Sara Lov's voice.

Some people talk about 'lifting the veil' when changes like this are made, to me this sounded more like 'lifting a horse blanket' !My only criticism would be it is very bright and this took some adjustment to get used to, but than what is bright?Does Vinyl sound warm because the set up may lack detail? Does adding detail in spades make it sound bright? If that's the case, adding in everything that the artist produced, bright really means accurate. The 440 sure is accurate than because there is detail by the truck load. I've rated it 4 stars because on some LPs it does sound to bright, but that may be the result of poor mastering and not the 440s fault.4 PLUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a really good needle.","review":"Those who aren't into hi fi will probably balk at the price. Those who are will be surprised by what they get for the price -- this thing's a bargain! It's not going to make your table look amazing but it will make it sound amazing, and for tables with finicky compliance needs (like my PL-518) it's just a dream come true.I regularly pull dirty old records out of the $3 bin, clean them off, CAREFULLY clean the stylus -- and find that the signal is clear, warm, static free and highly enjoyable. It's been going strong for two years and when it finally breaks down, I'll be replacing with another AT440MLA.Honestly this thing has probably saved me a fortune, because it makes my table sound good enough to keep it off the upgrade list, and on a number of occasions it's saved me from having to seek out better quality vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Technica AT440ML","review":"I have used a Shure M91 cartridge for years.

I moved on again. Quickly. This time to the comparably priced Audio Technica AT440ML. I was literally BLOWN AWAY by the sound of this cartridge! The AT440ML reproduces high frequencies with amazing detail and low distortion, while simultaneously packing a respectable low frequency punch. You'll be surprised at what this cartridge pulls out of your grooves. At this price, the AT440ML is an incredible value.

I've played many records with it, mostly rock/soul/funk and electronic.

If you are looking for a book that will give more practical, real world advice on finding your true love, I would recommend \\"Soulmates : Following Inner Guidance to the Relationship of Your Dreams\\" by Carolyn Godschild Miller.

It would have been a massive undertaking for Brinig and the results are a book that is very poorly written and edited. There are places where the exact same pages appear several times separated by 50 or so pages. While there are quantitative methods that attorneys should know, this book doesn't explain or present them. It has a smattering of cases and a lot of words that provide little information. George Mason Law ultimately quit using the book as it was such a piece of junk. I had to suffer through the book.

Then my wife used it and only pressed the trigger while she trimmed. She loves it and there were no issues with time restraints. We were able to trim out the entire area of our flower bed (about 20' by 20') with no issues at all. Then I trimmed for another 20 minutes using her technique.

I get frustrated when cutting grass because I have to make about three or four passes over the grass before it cuts all of it. I used to have the Craftman brand cordless shears but the sears I've been to don't sell that one anymore. Another thing is that the motor is slow compared to the Craftsman model. It takes me about three times as long to do the same area as the Craftsman. The only thing better is that the battery lasts longer with the black & decker.

Overall satisfied for this type of use. Expect about 15 to 20 minutes on a charge.Have owned this for around a year and a half. The grass shear could not cut anything. I agree with another review that all you do is pull out grass. It finally would just jam the two blades whenever you tried to cut. I liked the hedge trimmer to manicure our shrubs, but now the battery is failing. This seems to be typical with Black and Decker and DeWalt Brands (the same company).

Almost every character on the \\"Ryan\\" had a twin on the AE19, USS Diamond Head, right down to the whale boat crew and stewards. I certainly can relate to the collision having lived through one with, coincidentally, the aircraft carrier USS Independence. The shock, the terror, the confusion, every emotion that the mind can conjur up came crashing from the pages. It literally brought me to the seat of my chair. I could feel the power of the carrier and frailty of our ship through Mr. Poyer's words. This is a gripping novel writen by a man that obviously has been there before.

Coup d'etat is the best song on the record and it's a five star song. High price on our heads is a four star song. The rest are one and two. Like so many bands they seem to change their sound and instead of appealing more to the listener, they go off on their own and re-invent themselves.

It's well written and gripping. I've read a lot about WWII battles, but none of the books I read held me like this one. It was difficult to put down.Along with outlining the usual strategies and causes behind the battle for Guadalcanal, the author produces a good portrait of the individuals involved --- on both sides.

When I inquired with a local servicer, I was told that NO PARTS can be obtained in the states, and that this difficulty worsened after DeLonghi's purchase of the manufacturer. I had terrible difficulty myself trying to get through to DeLonghi for servicing information. Fortunately, wiggling a loose wire resurrected the machine and made my husband a hero... until the mixer truly dies.

Sixty-something dollars later I found out the hard way that this text is not compatible with the e-ink Kindle, meaning that while it's still readable I'm anchored to my hulking powerhouse of a computer instead of being able to read anywhere I want. Worse, Amazon's debatably draconian DRM policies render me unable to reformat this text to something more suited to my reader. I come away from this whole experience with a bad taste in my mouth--unwilling to shell out another sixty bucks and give the company a free pass, so to speak, and in need of a text that I can actually read in places other than my computer room.Time to head to Barnes and Noble's website."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"It gives a good basic understanding of the policy process in Government.

Unfortunately, the authors present a strong dualistic bias in their analysis, pitting good \\"liberal\\" policies against evil \\"conservative\\" policies. The result does not make for a balanced nor objective book, and as such mostly serves as rhetoric material for partisan purposes, not a genuine scientific analysis. As such I do not recommend the book unless one wishes to build an argumentation from a strictly partisan perspective, not a public policy perspective, at it lacks in intellectual rigour and objectivity, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super great!","review":"This tale of Farmer Brown has quickly become one of our family favorites.

The bulk of the instruction is on different drills to do, almost all focusing on hip rotation, with a minuscule amount about kicking. Neither one says anything about arm movement, and you can't get a good idea of what the arm movement is supposed to be from the video.

This was one of them. Every note on this album is a ripoff of either Covenent or Apoptygma Berzerk. I listened to it twice and could not tolerate another. I've read that some people call this ebm. A thumping 4/4 beat with equal emphasis on every beat is not ebm; it is reanimated Disco Frankenstein. The only reason I gave this album a 2 star rating instead of no stars is because there are many people who obviously enjoy discotized \\"industrial\\" dance, as evidenced by the large number of Covenent fans. If you are a Covenent fan, buy this album. If you are not, buy Empires. It is far superior to Praise the Fallen.

In fact, I probably still haven't reached that point just yet. There's just something about it that makes it very compelling. Bleak is probably the best word to describe it. The songs tend to deal with wars, and the entire album has a kind of futuristic, apocalyptic feel to it (it's great to listen to while playing war games).My favorite track on the cd is definately Honour, but Solitary and Procession are both outstanding as well. The album closes with the very serene and peaceful PTF2012, which is followed by one minute of silence and a dreamy harpsichord-like track. This serves towrap up thhe intensity of the album nicely, and leave you feeling rested and at peace.

Anderson does a great job of providing simple, ready-to-use games and techniques that will help combat this problem. I found many of the ideas useful and easy to use right away. Other ideas were not so adaptable to my team, but I still used the nuggets he have in the book and manipulated them to meet my needs. My athletes responded with enthusiasm. While nothing can take the place of mileage, the mindset an athlete has during the mileage can set the tone for the whole training experience. Although this book may not meet the needs of the reader to a tee, it is broad enough to enable the reader to create his/her own variation on the theme.

Each chapter and subchapter barely grazes the surface of the subjects. The section entitled \\"Kitchen Witch or Pagan Goddess?\\" reads like a bad essay by a grade school student. However, a responsible reader will make a notation to further explore this subject and probably find much more relevant information elsewhere. Those who close this book and feel they are ready to present themselves as witches to the world is akin to an antheist reading an article on the New Testament in the morning and expecting to be ordained by the end of the day.Bottom line, you should only come away with a stirred interest in learning more on the learned arts rather than the confidence to start casting spells at whim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of tips that will help even seasoned eBay sellers.","review":"An excellent read full of vital tips and hints (or \\"Tricks\\" as the author calls them).

Yes it has an off button but guess what the brains trust set it up so everytime you turn it on the motorised head starts up again.We have little kids who delight in turning the machine off then on again as you vacuum.

All that and a 5 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is from the guy's point of view","review":"Ok my wife came home with this,It looked crazy but it works extremely well .I love the bagless design which is very easy to empty,no more wasted money on bags you throw out.Great suction use it on hardwood with dog hair The only complaint i have is the cord length is way to short and the cord recoil is so slow it makes me want to design a upgrade kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Wand","review":"We had high expectations for this vacuum, and it may be a great vacuum for carpeted areas, but since our home is all hardwood flooring, it doesn't satisfy our needs. We like the bagless canister and sturdy polycarbonate construction, but the expandible wand is over-engineered for hard flooring, too bulky and ineffective, with the hard floor attachment installed. Our (Fein) shop-vac consistently outperforms it in its ability to pick up all forms of debris. The wand is so bulky it's near impossible to raise it above eye level for cleaning various trim pieces and windowsills, et. al. I see that Dyson has introduced an \\"All Floors\\" bagless canister, but for $750!? There's really nothing wrong with this little machine, if we could get a different, less bulky wand that works on hard flooring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Suction VERY POOR design and engineering","review":"Dyson knows how to build a vacuum that can really pull the dirt out, but has failed on all other accounts. The cord is so short that you have to pplug it in 3-4 times on one level of the house and the cord retract is so bad you have to hand feed the cord back into the unit. The telescoping wand collapses at will and the hose kinks up constantly. The canister is very small and fills easily. The telescoping wand only has 2 positions; all the way out or all the way in. The unit draws so many amps that it blows a 15 amp breaker with nothing else on the circuit. The attachments fall off easily and are cheaply made. There is no on switch on the handle- very inconvenient. The handle will not lock in the vertical position so you either lay it down or or hold on to it.

As much as I have pursued activism, there is clearly a range of great work like this film circulating around.The astonishingly unlikely circumstances of the filmmakers' accomplishment convinces me of the underlying spiritual significance of this piece. The extent of documentation and of the different sides is tremendous, really deserving the inclusion of this film in fair trade coffee house screenings. I have also recently seen Romero, and intend to see Of Love and Shadows again. I also discovered an oldie, Viva Zapata!, which bears on similar issues.The tragedy of the genocide and propaganda of US Foreign Policy and Multinational Corporations is disgraceful and a betrayal of the culture's underlying religious ethics.The directors commentary is an incredible treat, on top of the filming, dramatic recreation, and splicing of Rigoberta Menchu."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if it were true?","review":"Since this film was released, it has been shown that virtually nothing that Menchu has written about is true. When asked about why she misled so many, she blamed her editor. Fortunately her editor had the tapes of Rigoberta dictating her book. Silence followed.She ran for President of Guatemala last year. The country is more than 60 percent indigenous. She got less than 5 percent of the vote. Only the Noble Peace prize committee, Susan Sarandon and gullible gringos give her any credibility.The movie shows the beauty of the Guatemalan mountains and the people who live there but the movie fails to say why Rios Monte, the notorious killer of indigenous people in the movie, received more votes for President from the indigenous population than Rigoberta.It is a good myth but if you want to understand Guatemala you will have to do your homework.

It seemed as if Van Sant confused reality with fiction and it was hard to tell where one left off and the other began. At first I thought it was a tribute to River, a way for Gus to deal with the young man's death and I guess it was but the more I read the more I felt like it was a love letter to Swifty(Keanu). Naturally I was surprized because I had never consider that the two might be lovers. Perhaps it was just Gus expressing his feelings about a time in his life...making a record of it. I'm really curious about the story of Cowboy Nemo, a movie produced by two of the main characters in the book. Many of the chatacters seem to be real people in Gus's life, trying to identify them was fun. I must say I'm sure most of the book is beyound my understanding but when Gus said he f--ked Swifty, that I understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting experiment, but boring story","review":"Though I appreciated and respect that Van Sant tried to create something different here, that alone was not enough. The central problem with the book is that the story line is far too weak. Some of my favorite authors also use a style that jumps around a bit and slowly pieces together a story (e.g., Vonnegut, Dunn, Robbins), yet Pink fails where these authors succeed. Initially, I found the book fun to read because of the varying style, fonts, perspectives, etc., yet quickly became bored with it as I searched in vain for an interesting story line that could be construed as gripping. Nothing of the sort presented itself. If an experimental and loose writing style alone does it for you, than this is a good book to read. If you desire content that will captivate you and sustain your interest, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it worth it?","review":"I initially purchased PINK after seeing on the jacket cover a quote comparing it to Robbins and Vonnegut. Unfortunatley all I found was the style of Robbins without the wit and the essence of Vonnegut but without the closure he provides. I had fun reading it, peeling through Van Sant's veiled references to contemporary pop culture icons Kurt/Courtney/River/Keanu,etc. But was ultimately dissapointed in the lack of \\"story\\" in this novel.

At the end of the list are names followed by the designation \\"abandoned race.\\" That's how it was for me with this book, about 70 pages into it I abandoned it due to lack of entertainment or interest. I like Gus van Sant's movies, I like the book jacket a lot, and I like the little drawings in the book, but as for the actual words... No. The book is a convulated mess, sprinkled with characters loosely based on real people van Sant knew or knows (Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix among them), but none of whom are worth investing any time or energy in. It's really an experimental work at best, and even on that level fails to do anything new or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Heat, No Flavor","review":"First let me say that I just got an order in of 5 different spices, all are great except the cayenne, I do allot of cajun cooking and know cayenne very well, I have been using the no salt cajun mix for almost a year now and it is as good as the mixes I get in Louisiana ( Tonys ), I wanted to get some cayenne to bump up the heat for marinades and was disapointed with this product, has more of a parika taste than a pepper taste.

Yet, the plot intrigued me from the get go and I couldn't resist. Call it a guilty pleasure.Revolving around four best friends, the story finds Mandy, Kai, Debbie, and Eva vying for a unique $160,000 scholarship, one that requires its applicants to be \\"pure.\\" The problem is that everyone, including school personnel, are stumped on the purity portion. How can you judge who's really pure?To answer this burning question, Mandy (with her friends' help) brings The V Club to life - an organization uplifting the virtues of virginity. Yet all four girls are keeping secrets that could dismantle the club before it even gets off the ground.With all these secrets, tensions are flaring. Through it all though, the girls learn valuable lessons in friendship and what it means to pure at heart ... and that's where it really counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"the pope's choir","review":"trying to sell this recording to listeners of joe lovano, michael brecker, and james carter, the 3 guest tenors, is preaching to the choir. sorry to say, as far as i know, this is my first time hearing of odean pope. so odean pope is one more jazz musician playing great tenor overlooked by me, a tenor fan of many years. his strength here is his arrangements and selections, both of material and musicians. 9 horns, not counting guests, labeled accurately saxophone choir, resonate harmoniously in the ellington tradition, brecker and lovano at their best, brecker on 2 tracks; one of them, coltrane time, is a heavy blowing session with odean pope. unfortunately, things fall apart, horns scatter, each going its own way for muntu chant, the final track, the track featuring james carter.along with the horns, the choir includes piano, bass and drums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance? Musik on the dubby-side.","review":"I suppose that it's possible to dance to, but it hardly fits into any category of club music you'll ever hear (at a club). This compilation is composed of dubby, minimal and dark overtones - not the type of hi-energy dance tracks DJ's would dare throw at a crowd. But it IS very 'listenable' and great for those arm-chair dj's who enjoy the deep vibes in the car or at home. Obtaining various ep's from the artists that comprise the catalog of Raum Musik (and other labels), their presence on this collection is simply astounding. D. Krasemann, D. Diggler, Dub Taylor, and others - all are excellent producers, and are masters at this style of house. Here's to the dark matter of music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not typical romance novel","review":"I enjoyed this book even though it disturbed me. It was so well written that it seemed very real.

Still, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally well written and captivating","review":"The dangers with books like these is they get tossed into a \\"category\\" before anyone opens the cover. This is not pulp romance trash. It is a beautifully well written (rare today) story that takes you in and along with its characters in a personal, thoughtful and responsible way. No gimmicks. Reynolds is a gifted writer and observer/participant in life and it shows. My only surprise is that she hasn't written more. This book makes you hungry for her next novel. I hope she is listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb blending of present and flashbacks","review":"I rarely find \\"flashbacks\\" a satisfying medium in keeping with the flow and mood of a story. Ms. Reynolds, however, has a true talent for capturing the characters feelings and the flashbacks enhance and enlighten. She captures relatively well the depression grief and guilt can create. I look forward to upcoming books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little love in this \\"love\\" story","review":"Honestly, I didn't like this book and can't see why anyone else did. It's basically about a woman who loved and married a man with no integrity, then settled for his best friend who had always loved her after her husband died. No one wins in this book - the hero gets the heroine by default, the heroine ends up with a man she settled for rather than chose, and her first husband is never punished for being such an awful person. It's downright depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST read for recent male college grads","review":"Being a recent college graduate who does not have a set plan for what he wants to do in life, this book was right up my alley. It appeals perfectly to a young guy who does not want to jump right into the cookie-cutter corporate world right away.It gives the reader excellent insight, as well as many laughs, into some of the adventures that a rowdy, young, thrill seeker can experience with some motive and planning.Besides the commonalities i've shared with the mindset this book promotes, I've had a lot of fun reading it and plan to use it as a motivator to get out there and make the world mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a waste of paper","review":"Unless you are an 18 yo male this is a big disappointmentCannot get rid of it soon enough...one needs a shower after the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they had negative stars!","review":"Use caution when ordering any plans from Frank Betz.

I also admit I didn't look at how long the warranty was but it seemed as though the product already knew! Just 1 month after the warranty expired, the handle stopped engaging to force the rod and compress the tube of caulk. The price I paid for this, I thought I was not only getting comfort and ease of use but I thought I was getting quality. Units I paid $3-5 for 10 years ago from the local hardware store might not be as rugged looking or as comfortable to operate but at least they are still going.

I don't know what everyone else was reading, but using his wife as his chief editor was the start of the decline of this book. I took this back to Barnes & Noble immediately after I read the first two chapters...the grammar is horrendous and his story is very disinteresting. It sounds like the same ol' BS cop war stories, nothing that people who don't watch a TV show like third watch or CSI couldn't learn.

However, he violates the cardinal rule of non-fiction writers by changing many place names into unrecognizable titles. For example, he claims to have worked undercover at a Los Angeles high school in the late 1960's. Why the need to change the name of the school? He changes a lot of street names and other details that make a non-fiction book much more interesting. He also bends way too far over to apologize for all the awful things he did as a young rookie. A lot of true crime/non-fiction readers take great joy into researching sections of the stories they read--they can't do this if the author is vague about details. If you want to learn about L.A.P.D. in the 60's and 70's, this is not the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"She looks so cute with it!","review":"My wife loves this chain and the dragon fly really makes it for her!

This wok is listed as \\"round bottom\\", so I ordered one for use on my gas top stove. I specifically wanted a round bottom wok as I not only believe they cook more evenly, but I have a wok ring to use with it. Amazon suggested I buy a wok ring to go with this wok. When it came, it was FLAT BOTTOM! I was so disappointed, but ordered another (which shipped very quickly, thank you Amazon) and the second one was ALSO FLAT BOTTOM! I returned it, too. I am taking a break from the order-and-return cycle, but hope to shop again here with Amazon. I just won't order the Joyce Chen Round Bottom Wok...although the quality looks superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labor intensive to maintain","review":"This wok cooks OK. The thin material doesn't hold heat like a heavy cast iron wok would, but it gets hot enough, and doesn't weigh a ton either. I found it somewhat difficult to keep it steady on the stove, I suppose it depends on what sort of grates you have. I bought the separate metal ring which improves stability, but it raises the wok a little higher reducing the heat a little. My main gripe is the amount of maintenance needed. I seasoned it according to the instructions, which took a while. After cleaning, I make sure it's completely dry (by reheating it), then let it cool, then coat it with a little mineral oil (vegetable oil can turn rancid). Despite all that, it still rusts. If I don't use it for a few weeks, it gets a light coat of rust which then has to be scrubbed off with a scouring pad, or you'll taste it in the food. Maybe if you use this thing 4 or 5 times a week for a few months it would get so well seasoned the rust problem disappears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts!","review":"I followed the seasoning instructions, yet wok rusted after just one use.

My favourite of his books have been The Tulsa Kid and Toujours L'Amour, but I've loved everything he's written (even the small-press oddity Poems I Guess I Wrote). His direct language, his enthusiasm for goofiness, his smart playfulness -- all this stuff moves me and inspires me.But with You Never Know, Padgett moves beyond the 10th rung of a 10-rung ladder. He's still nuts, and often hilarious, but this whole mortality thing has got him doing stuff so perfect, so condensed, so magical... geez.You know, people generally hate poetry. But shove a book like this in their shaking paws and they might have second thoughts.It's a lovely looking book, too, but it would've looked better mimeographed and stapled down the side with a line drawing by Joe Brainard on the cover.Yeah!

It's about listening to our self-talk, and choosing to realize when this \\"mental chatter\\" is not truly benefiting us - when it's wrong - when it's judgmental - when it's hurtful; and then to realize our personal power to change what we think/hear/say, and how we behave/act.This is a wonderful book that includes many great insights - Although I must admit that I don't necessarily agree with all of the Zen-Buddhist thoughts included here, but then again, how do we learn about ourselves & other's if we read only those works that we are in full agreement with?...Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality &/or compassion - I think it has a lot to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Which You Are Seeking is Causing You to Seek","review":"This was a very easy book to read. I think the handwritten print style made it relaxing and enjoyable to follow along with her thoughts. So much that was said in this book resonated with me, some made me smile, some made my heart feel heavy. This is definitely a good book to read if you are feeling stuck, confused or unsure of what you should be doing in your life. It does not tell you what to do, it simply reminds you that patiently waiting, listening and living is all that you \\"need\\" to do at this moment. Quiet your mind and pay attention.

There were moments that felt a bit preachy or sentimental, for example, the various talks among the soldiers about fighting for the freedom of all men, and so forth, but those conversations struck me as things that Civil War soldiers might actually say, a level of sentimentality that was present at the time, and, while a bit out of place in our society today, perfectly reasonable for the era Hummel was writing about.

You're going on a simple walk, and you don't want bulk. Also, sometimes your bulkier or more complex training bag can't isolate a really high-value (smellier) treat without mixing it up with something else. This pouch closes easily (although it is sometimes a two-handed action to close it), holds a convenient small amount of training-size treats and is made of a durable fabric.Special highlight: the belt clip is super easy and yet doesn't come off with everyday use unless you want it to! Some belt clips are sticky or extra-tight; this one is perfect, in my opinion.

A psychological thriller this movie is NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Born","review":"Another title written over \\"First Born' on cover in black felt tip. Didn't watch it. Gave it to Thrift Store. Waste of my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"first born is just boring","review":"Where's the scares? Where's the violence? Where's the movie going? Who cares? This movie is so boring the dog kills itself! It couldn't handle the plot line.A newly expecting mother goes into post mortem depression and spirals downward.The audience will too! Thank God I strummed my guitar keeping my focus on the movie at a bear minimum.DREADFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Worst Mothers Winner","review":"I suppose the acting was decent, but the movie drove me nuts. From the moment the dog dies to the end of the movie, I couldn't believe how insanely stupid the character of Laura was. Is it actually possible for a mother to be that horrible? I agree with the other reviews that the red herrings were annoying as hell, especially since they left more unanswered questions than anything. The ending was a twist, but a predictable one. Any mother that has ever done what happened at the end of this movie, or something similar, should be shot dead on the spot to save humanity and children around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"Just VERY boring!!! I thought it would be more suspenseful. I thought it would be a lot better!! I wanted to stop in the middle of the movie, but my husband wanted to see how it was going to end. The whole diary thing made no sense. This was the most awful movie ever, and I wish I didn't waste my time watching it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"--\\"Lola,\\" an eighteen-year old boy living at an orphans' home who writes a popular national advice column rounds up five other children at the home whom he likes: thirteen-year-old James, ten-year-old Annie (the narrator) and her twin brother Al-Willie, nine-year-old Edmund, and five-year-old Ben, and they set off for a small town in which they form a family and move into a nice house, dodging the neighbours' nosy questions and having a great time, that is, at first: soon, people start to wonder why their \\"grandfather\\" whom they always assure is around somewhere, is never seen, and why the family looks so suspicious in general. --I loved the emotions and excellent detail in this book, and it was lively and quick, making it a great book to read. --Marisa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book turned movie","review":"This is a wonderful book! I really loved the pace of the story and how endearing the characters were. This book was turned into a television movie called \\"The Beniker Gang\\" starring Andrew McCarthy. FANTASTIC film. It was very true to the book and wonderfully acted! I recommend both the book and the movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic design","review":"I purchased these straps when I was in a lot of pain thinking that its design made sense. The minute I received it and saw it in real life, I knew I had been taken. I never returned it because i lost my receipts and just procrastinated. Its been years since I bought them but I finally took the time to write my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better products available","review":"This item is very poor quality and is uncomfortable. You would do much better going down to your local drug store and purchasing something from the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support whatsoever.","review":"I already have inserts for my shoes, but as I was instructed by my doctor not to walk around without my inserts, I was hoping this would work around the house so I could walk barefoot/in slippers since I hate wearing shoes in the house. This thing does absolutely nothing and I honestly feel like I'm experiencing MORE heel pain with it. It also spins around on my foot thus rendering it completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"If I could give this zero stars I would have. This item is soft and provides no arch support. Wish I sent it back, but unfortunately I did not. I bought this for my son who has very flat feet and this did nothing for him. An ace bandage would have worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I submitted one review to Amazon already, - apparently they must have deemed it too negative to publish?Now they send me an invitation to review, - like i might have changed my opinion, possibly?in short - this item is worthless, IMO...and may even be harmful, IMO.I'm not a doctor or a health professional BUT i am a PF sufferer, and i'm a good observer.....it doesn't work as described, and in my case at least altered my walking locomotion in such a way that added to pain in my ankles and stressed my knees. Not good, not good at all.Message Ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this!","review":"The theory is great but the product doesn't deliver. I have had something else similar to this product and wore it out because it worked very well and decided to try these. So cheap! The velco straps that go over your foot are thin and very uncomfortable and cling to socks and sheets and come undone. The arch support itself is very unflexible and uncomfortable. Returned them as fast as I could! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FootSmart Arch Brace","review":"By itself the FootSmart Arch brace is virtually useless, as it has no real padding at all. I sometimes use it to hold the FootSmart Adjust-to-You arch support in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The support this item provides is so light that I would say provides none at all. Not sure who this is intended to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Didn't really give any support to my arch and wouldn't stay where it should. Ended up buying something different to use instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"this is uncomfortable. even after getting used to it. The straps hurt the instep. It slides.
