Amy Jo, Clare and Kate's daughter, who has a very close friendship with Belinda becomes especially close to Melissa and Belinda feels her and Amy Jo will no longer have the closeness they have once had. All three girls become involved with the sam guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DELIGHTFUL!","review":"While some of Oke's books were better, this one is still very good.

Now there's this one. Nine of the 12 songs from this can be found on one of those other records. The three that aren't are nothing particularly new and nothing to write home about. \\"Diamonds\\" is ballady track that's a bit over the top, and the other two newbies are filler compared to the rest of the album.Moreover, the pop vocal songs from the movie OST/Ask DNA (\\"No Reply\\" and \\"Gotta Knock a Little Harder\\" and \\"Cosmic Dare,\\" great songs all) don't quite mesh with the more jazzy selections from the show. It's a rather weird selection.

Lady M has a nice personality and demonstrates the moves well; she shows you how to do exotic and sexy chair moves and slinky floorwork. There is a little choreography and at the end the performance is demonstared by Lady M, showing how you might put it all together. I really enjoyed this DVD. I don't know if I'd recommend it to someone with NO dance experience, but if you've done some dance and want to learn some eye-catching exotic moves, you should check out this DVD. I would call it \\"moderately challenging\\".One thing to note though, is that I felt the format of this DVD was more like an instructional dance DVD rather than a workout, but dont get me wrong you will get exercise with this DVD...

Cookman sets the race in its time, describing how different American life was then. Social classes were more separated from each other, and lives were shorter. Cookman depicts the main players, nearly all of them rich and powerful men who looked down on ordinary mortals. The most interesting commoner is professional yacht racer Charley Barr, who captained the great three-masted schooner Atlantic to victory despite the yacht's self-centered owner. Racing across an ocean was more dangerous then; no radio, no global positioning system, no weather faxes, no emergency beacons. The outcome was unpredictable until the lead yacht appeared off the Lizard. If you like sailing and adventure, this one is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"stumbling journey of a spoiled aesthete","review":"This is the story of a callow boy, destined for an elite education, who passes some time with a faded, decadent uncle. They sit around talking, he is introduced to sex, and fears for his financial missteps. The most memorable scene is a heart attack, with its sudden fear of death. The philosophical discussions, for me personally, are utterly flat and lifeless, a waste of time unless you have never read any philosophy or even non-fiction. As such, this is a badly failed \\"idea novel\\" with little action and lots of shallow sentiment, the characters being mere vehicles for obscure ideas. I do not mean to argue that ideas are not worthy to be pursued, but this novel is not the place to do it. It is a boring read, for high brow afficianados who feel they are \\"up to\\" it intellectually.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written. Boring.","review":"I think this book is poorly written. The authors go a long way describing all kinds of taxonomies (look at the abundance of 3d diagrams such as Figure 4.11) without letting the user grasp the major ideas. Just check the discussion on the 10 types of distributed databases in chapter 4.They also spend a lot of time and paper describing relatively simple concept without actually making the concepts any clearer. Some concepts never get defined so it's not clear why they had to be mentioned, check 13.4.2 and try to figure out what the convoy effect is.I think the main problem of this book is that it tries to please to wide an audience: undergrad students, database researchers, and practitioners.

For a CS course on the subject, it is an obvious pick since not many related texts exist on the market. The text is good, but needs updating since it was published in 1999.

From just reading a couple of chapters, I can see where this book is going. It is clear that the book was published in a rush, and never reviewed properly. The author takes too much time struggling to explain the theory, and when it comes to the example, author simply tells that its obvious, although the theory behind is explained in at least 3 pages. Also, the amount of mistakes I found in this short period is enormous and unbarebale. You start to get lost when following the example and feel you can move forward.My advise for you, if you are not obliged to buy this book, then don't do so, specially if you look at the price of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam creates another great CD.","review":"I wish he came out with more CD's.

I didn't even twist very hard, because I discovered while learning to use it that the other end would slip if twisted too hard. So even when I babied it, it still failed.Then I tried to fix it using a strong cable tie, but gave up after trying to figure out which strands of a steaming wet mop I needed to attach to make the darned thing wring correctly.This mop lasted me about 5 seconds and one tentative wring. I never even got to use it to clean anything. (If you doubt me, go to a store that has one and try wringing it.

Mine has held up since then, so I'm not sure why theirs didn't.Another problem I've had is that if you don't wring it in the right direction, it pops off the threads and hangs loose. So you have to turn it back the other direction to re-thread it and then wring it.Speaking of wringing, it doesn't do that well either. It's very wet even after, so I end up mopping the whole floor with it and then going back over to clean up the excess water.This is very poorly designed and made, bad enough that I'll stay away from ALL Quickie products in the future.

Back to the box, I hand them the broken one, and get another new one. Opened it up today and it came apart before I even put it in the bucket. While trying to see if it was repairable, I discovered that the top end of the mop is attached to the mop handle by means of a cable tie looped around a piece of plastic. At that point I realized I'd been sold a product that was so shoddy that it couldn't work properly, or if it did, it was only by accident.The shoddiness of this product has made me avoid all Quickie products.

The overall usability of this stylus/pen is great because of its dual functionality. It has a solid quality feel to it. The capacitive stylus works great and is easily used on both my iphone and ipad. The pen has a nice feel and writes well but it does tend to skip a little when writing in my journal which has a very smooth paper surface. My only suggestion for the design of the pen would be to allow the pen cap to fit over the back of the pen. As it is, I fear I will lose the cap one of these days since I usually do not have a place to put it. Overall this is a product I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a drag","review":"The rubber like tip has much to much drag. It started a little dragy and got worse with use. The pen works well. I liked to clip mine to the spine of the apple standard issue case, unfortunately the clip on the boxwave styra is not made to handle bing clipped onto something this thick and broke off after a couple of months of use.The pogo sold in the apple store works much better, but does not have a pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"A truly excellent product. I use it daily for extensive note taking. It feels as comfortable as note taking on paper. The tip is perfect for my style of writing. Much better for me than the light weight pogo.

Really love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 2 weeks, then became worthless!","review":"I bought this to use with the note taker app for the iPad. At first I loved it, dual purpose both pen and stylus. After about a week, I noticed the capacitive tip began getting stuck in certain places, so I would twist the stylus to find the smooth spot. About another week later, a crack developed in the capacitive tip rendering it virtually worthless. The tip cannot be replaced (to my knowledge) so I now have a pen only.I also bought the Parker metal gel replacement cartridges and they didn't fit. Better stick to the plastic cartridges.I ended up purchasing the Just Mobile AluPen and so far it is far superior. I would not recommend purchasing this unless they add a replaceable tip."},{"rating":"2","title":"BoxWave stylus","review":"Other than being over-priced, this is an excellent stylus.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It marks but.....","review":"..the stylus is like all of them, none are capable to make a definitive line between point and pad. Plus, all of the pens are like writing with a bulky marker-- even with the smallest brush or pencil size. In order for me to use a stylus for art on the ipad, I need a precise point. Someone should make a more durable one using the amateurish (?) principle of capacitive health bar wrappers and paper points on a ballpoint pen shaft (see Utube designers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Boxwave Styra stylus is exactly what I needed for my iPad. However, the capacitive stylus doesn't last. I expected the quality to last beyond a couple months of daily use. But, it didn't. The Boxwave representative with whom I corresponded told me that their product was defective and should have lasted more than 2-3 months. When I asked if I could return it for an exchange, they said I would have to work with Amazon because I bought it through Amazon. I didn't have the required original receipt, so I didn't return the defective product.There are so many other choices out there, don't waste your money on a stylus that lasts 2-3 months. Get one that's cheaper from another manufacturer - one who has a satisfaction guarantee and who stands by their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Stylus","review":"I purchased this stylus to use with Notetaker HD on my iPad.

Over and over they reject what they know and listen to people that have been proven evil--Would you believe someone who tried to kill you when she says she's looking out for your own good? A few of today's colloquialisms slipped into this medieval novel--Off Limits, for example. The situations become so contrived and far-fetched that it was ludicrous.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good storyline, not so good writing","review":"I think Ms. Mason's storyline and setting are exciting and the plot has a lot of ups and downs, but the writing itself is not so exciting, nor is it very good overall. I've read tons of great books, but I could never really put into words what made them so great. In this instance, I can plainly see why this book didn't do it for me. I think the main reason why I didn't like her writing style is because she just lays it all out on the table, without adding subtlety or taking her time on really important scenes. Some sections are even embarrassing in their cheesiness (i.e. the last line of the book). I've never written a review before, and I don't like to put people down (obviously my writing skills aren't fabulous) but I would hope Ms. Mason would take this as constructive criticism and maybe work on her craft, and readers would take this as a helpful guide when deciding whether or not to purchase the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"I hated the characters, all of them.

There were times that I laughed out loud at some of the more intense moments when the characters are recognizing their own glowing physical attributes and sharing with us. I'm sure that Mason never intended to give this perception, but sadly that's the way it came across to this reader. Over and over and over again. The editor needs a serious reprimand for allowing this book to ever be put into print. We've all heard that the publishing industry is a beast, that it is next to impossible to get published.

Unless you want to apoxy glue this thing together it is impossible to keep the pieces attached. Secondly it does not float. The toy is design flawed and it takes on water to the point that it becomes lopsided and submerges itself, which also contributes to the toy not holding together.

To hear the story told from Mitch's side is very interesting, especially if you are a drummer. If you were inspired by either Mitch or Jimi I highly recommend this book. The book reveals some very informative behind the scene stories and events (some which are quite historic). One thing that really impresses me is how Mitch talked about his relationships with Buddy Miles, and Ginger Baker. From a drummers standpoint, that is what it's all about, we are all brothers. Reading the book gives you a chance to relive the days of the Experience when Jimi, Mitch, Nol, Buddy Miles, and Billy Cox were rolling full stream ahead. Unfortunately Jimi left us much too soon, thank you Mitch Mitchell for sharing your experience with us. From end to end, this book is a treasure.

But before spending fifty dollars on this book, you should know that, despite the fact that it's been in print for 30 years, it is full of flat-out typos, misspelled accidentals, mislabeled parts, unexplained divisi, and other musical grekh. The publisher should be ashamed. If you plan to use this book for a performance, be prepared to spend many hours correcting it before rehearsal. (It is also often musically different -- even in the melodies -- from the Original Cast Album, but I don't know who was responsible for that.)As an example of how slovenly the engraving is, consider the word \\"Stained!\\" in \\"We Beseech Thee\\". In the first place, it doesn't read \\"Stained!\\", it reads \\"Strained!\\". But, more than that, it's on two notes, so what the score is actually telling you to sing is \\"Strain��d!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music - horribly printed score","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer. This is one of the most mistake ridden scores I have ever come across. The compositions I love, but the printer needs to reprint this score, making a ton of corrections.

It has the wrong clef at the end of ALL FOR THE BEST. It list the wrong chord changes in Prepare Ye. It leaves out the repeat vamp in Save The People. In one bar of Alas For You there are too many beats in the measure. The list is endless.

I don't think any CD can compare to the originality of Baduizm (I wore that CD out), but this comes pretty close. Her voice is so striking (listen to 'Green Eyes' and you could almost swear you're listening to Lady Day) and her lyrics are so engaging(I laughed so hard during 'Cleva', the people in the store thought I was nuts) that you'll like this CD even if you've lived under a rock and never heard of Baduizm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and Mellow","review":"I will admit, at first I wasn't all that satisfied with this album, just because the radio version of \\"Bag Lady\\" wasn't on it. Plus it was kinda strange that the number and sequence of tracks listed, didn't match the album. But after a few more listens, I started to appreciate it more and more. The slower version of \\"Bag Lady\\" started to grow on me, and I found it to be more intimate. My other favorites are ....&On, Cleva(which I can relate to), Booty(off the hook), Kiss Me On My Neck, AD 2000(which for some reason, I found sad), Orange Moon(beautiful song), and last but certainly not least,\\"Green Eyes\\" on which she sounds so much like Billy Holliday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Badu is Back!","review":"From the first whispered words of \\"Penetentiary Philosophy\\" to the last notes of the beautiful \\"Green Eyes,\\" this CD is a masterpiece. It is definitely not Badu by the numbers. After hearing Bag Lady, and liking it but not loving it, I was a little worried that maybe Ms. Badu wasn't up to the task of creating an album as stunning as her first. Like D'Angelo's \\"Voodoo\\" compared with \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Mama's Gun\\" does not stick to the formula of \\"Baduizm,\\" it strikes out into new territory. The fact that she changed the order of the songs at the last minute is a little bit annoying, but not just because the booklet doesn't have things right--but because she dropped the song she wrote with Bilal. Guess there just wasn't enough room! Buy this CD--its the best of 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love her style","review":"Over all sweet package. Badu's marketing strategy separates her from them all in the R&B/JAZZ category. Can't touch this.

I started listing to Baduism when I was in the 8th grade, and now in my junior year the maturity of the this CD reaches up there and makes a lastin impression on me.

I own, listen and enjoy Jill, Macy, Rashaan, et al., but Ms. Badu has blown me away with this disc. The lyrics, production, her voice--everything is first rate. I have heard from friends and read on this board criticism of \\"Mama's Gun\\". Although I trully feel everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion, I wonder if the critics were expecting \\"Baduizm II\\"? Instead of merely recycling the old, Erykah clearly takes her artistry to the next level (even the samples from \\"Baduizm\\" seem fresh and new)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bomb!","review":"This is easily one of those cds that I have to buy two of, one for my car and one for my player at home. I have to say her first album didn't go over with me but this one is a masterpiece.It flows and flows and flows! From penitentary pholosiphy to green eyes. This album is everything and more and shows that Badu has come of age. My favorites are: all of them, but if I had to pick, In love with you, Booty, Cleva, Didn't cha know, Green Eyes, AD 2000.

Mama's gun may not be like Baduizm, but it still is worth anyones time who is into unconventional R&B and soul and whatnot. This lp is something else, I guess you can compare it to D' Angelou's 2nd lp. Some people were'nt feeling it, but I thought it was pretty good. Not like the first at all, both D and Badu have a more slower, soulful feel to their Sophmore efforts. On her first album she displayed a nice little album with some nice catchy beats and some nice lyrics and hooks to get YOU hooked (I know I was). On this album there is some definite experimentation. And for the most part I like it in Penetetiary Philosophy, and Green Eyes which finishes up the cd nicely.

From beginning to end this CD grabs the listener and makes you pay attention to Ms. Badu and her GUN! THIS, (like the music of Jill Scott, Music Soulchild, India.Arie, Maxwell...the list goes \\"ON&ON\\")IS SOUL MUSIC; fresh, original, emotional, life-affirming...music you feel.

If you are expecting songs like Apple Tree, forget about it. And if you think you are going to get the Bag Lady song you hear on the radio, think again.

You have this feeling that if you can't appreciate \\"Mama's Gun,\\" it probably means that you are too tied down to the pop song structure and can't appreciate true experimentation. After some consideration, you realize that no, Erykah Badu is just overly in love with herself and doesn't really care to make music that actually sounds good. This album is more or less designed to make you feel obligated to appreciate what she did here, but don't waste your time, especially when you can listen to the Jazzyfatnastees, D'Angelo, Lucy Pearl, or Dionne Farris instead (of course the last three aren't likely to release anything anytime soon...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"erykah is maturing musically. it's almost as if you can *feel* her pain,and her passion. this follow-up cd is wonderful! i especially love tracks 9-14.please don't listen to any of the other reviewers that are not satisfied with the cd. it is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebel Music","review":"Who in the age of materialism and captialism dares to say forget the profit margine, \\"I'm going to make my music.\\" The music from my soul not what will sell.

And finally #14, green eyes, this song in it's 10 minutes take the listener through the many emotions of an ex-lover having someone new in their life.

I had read some reviews that didn't really say anything good about this one, but I had been holding out for a little chocolate love. I'd been trying to keep the Macy Grays and the Jill Scotts at bay and so I just said I was going to buy this one. This is a great cd. Its got fantastic production value and some serious melodies and groove, which is all I can ask for from my sista!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Second Effort","review":"Erykah Badu is one of those artists whose work can take time to grow on you. Her first cd left me cold after the first listen, so I decided to give it another try, and soon found myself popping it in my cd player more and often, and even humming some of it's tunes to myself. Badu's second cd has much the same effect. Given the success of her first cd, the pressure was on for the follow-up, and Badu deilvers here, showing more diversity than she did even in her first time out. The opening track is unexpectedly jarring, and in the style of Lenny Kravitz, but the rest of the cd is a bit truer to Badu's earlier style. Standout tracks here include: Didn't Cha Know, Booty, and Bag Lady. \\"In Love With You\\" with Stephen Marley is also worthy of a mention, and the Billie Holliday-esque delivery in the opening of Green Eyes suggests that Badu could carry off a foray into Jazz as well. All in all, a fan of her earlier work will find much to enjoy in this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama's Got a Gun","review":"Badu is back at it again.

I heard growth & beauty in this disc and hope that those who listened once and truly didn't \\"get\\" it, listen to it again when their musical tastes mature because this is one of the most beautifully put together soul/r&b; albums I'd heard in a long time.My favorite tracks: PENETENTIARY PHILOSOPHY - funky & soulful; DIDN'T CHA KNOW - melodic with a great chorus; HEY SUGAH - nice interlude, 70's groove; CLEVA - love the music production of this one; KISS ME ON MY NECK; ORANGE MOON - beautiful love song; GREEN EYES - this is an exceptional track, it starts off like a really old jazz song with the scratchy backgroung then got really jazzy & soulful; it almost sounds like 3 songs in 1.I would highly recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys good music - it's an excellent representation of an artist growing right before our eyes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Booty","review":"This CD has some very funky tracks. \\"Booty\\" has a very funky beat, but the lyrics alone makes it better. Ladies, there is a message in the song. \\"Didn't ya know\\" has an even funkier groove and the harmony is superb. \\"Orange Moon\\" is a very sweet song. Erykah has a little twist of Billie Holiday in her voice which really brings out the melodies. How good it is!

That was not the case. As soon as we got it out of the box I could tell it wasn't going to last for long. It looks great but as soon as you touch it parts start to fall off. The horses don't stay attached to the carriage. The gold pieces fall off and won't stay on. My daughter grew tired of having to fix the carriage and horses time and time again. The carriage now sits on the shelf collecting dust. If I had to pick the best part of this item, it would be the horses. They are the only thing that doesn't fall apart. (...)

I know it warns that it's not for under 3, but I still don't expect over 2 dozen little things coming off as easily as they did. At first the carriage was set aside and the horses were played with. Now, not even those are played with. My girls can be rough on their toys, but this is ridiculous.

I told her he gave us permission to return it for a better toy, so this morning (the day after Christmas) we packed it up and took it back. If I had my way I would return the $100 castle as well but she wanted it so badly. There is no way to play with this toy without the horses coming apart from the carriage and falling over. Are the toy companies even testing things before they release them to the market anymore? Mattel needs to test their toys with actual children (to make sure they can even be played with) before they allow anything to be sold. As consumers, we need to let the toy companies know that we will not accept toys made under poor quality standards. The only way we can let them know that is to return items that are unacceptable or not buy it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"My daughter wanted everything princess & the pauper this year from Santa.

It started out as just a random phrase here and there, and then it was constant. There is an off switch in the back, but now it's scary for my daughter because she knows you have to touch the doll to make it talk, and why is Dora talking without being touched?

Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Buzzing and Static - Difficult to Hear Baby","review":"I agree with the above review. We've had this monitor for a year and a half and it's terrible. It always seemed a little noisy but it got increasingly worse as time went on. The buzzing and static got so bad that we could not longer use it in our bedroom because it would keep us up. Luckily by that point my son was sleeping through the night so we could turn t off. Also, we could only use it unplugged for the first month because after that the batteries would drain out really quickly. Then you couldn't tell when the monitor was working or not because there was always just enough battery power to keep the \\"on\\" light working - but no sound would come through which meant you couldn't hear the baby. Ugh! The only reason we've had it so long is because we got past the point we couldn't return it and I'm too cheap to go out and buy another. We'll deffinitely buy a different brand with the next baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready for static!!!","review":"I just bought this monitor two weeks ago and it's awful. It worked fine for a few days and then the static came. I switched channels and the other channel was worse. When we would get up and move around the room the static would get louder or softer, depending on where you were you went to in the room. At night the static was so annoying it would keep me up. I would recommend you not buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"lights on monitor make it easy to know when baby's awake","review":"Excellent monitor for the price. Seen family/friends w/ monitors that do not have light feature and they spend a lot of time w/ their ear to their monitors. With just a glance, even with the volume turned down, I can see if my son's stirring even the slightest bit. Very sensitive and none of the problems with static or crackling like a few of the other reviewers have experienced.Highly recommend this monitor. In fact, I bought a second set for my in-laws house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This moniter is not worth the $19.99. I got one before my baby was born tried it out and it worked great so I threw the box away. After 2 weeks of use it had a lot of static. We put up with it for awhile then it got to the point we couldn't even hear our daughter. It is worth it to spend a little more money and know that it wont stop working in the middle of the night when your baby may need you the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so bad!","review":"I did not recive the monitor I had registered for my shower. I had read many reviews searching for the \\"best\\" monitor. After my shower my parents seen that i had not recived a monitor. When they purchased my crib they had recieved this monitor for free. I decided it was worth a try. Living in A large apartment complex and behind the police station I was expecting noyhing but static. This Item has none of that.I am VERY pleased with this monitor, I just wish i had recived the one with 2 recivers. It picks up everything in my house, even the people that live around us when they go up and down stairs and close doors. the static is not bad at all only when you turn the volume all they way up. Which is not needed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR SANITY AND MONEY!!","review":"This monitor is TERRIBLE!!!! It doesn't even deserve one star, it deserves to have taken one away!!! Channel A is nothing but static and buzzing, I mean, you cannot hear ANYTHING over it!!! No matter where in the house I set either receiver up, it didn't matter.Channel B's static is a bit better, sounds like a transistor radio, and picks up other people's phone conversations....We just got this monitor, but it's packed back up, receipt dug out, and ready to go back to the store.I am so dissapointed in this product that I decided against getting another FP Monitor, but completely changing brands here..Do yourself a favor and safe your time and sanity!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while...but","review":"I recieved this monitor in July 2002 when my son was born. It was wonderful. Crystal clear and no static. I could hear the clock on the wall ticking in the nursery it was so sensative. Now 2 1/2 years later, it is STATIC CENTRAL. Maybe it is just old and worn out. But I still feel secure using it to monitor my toddler at night. It is the strangest thing, but when I use the 9v battery, it is clear. But when I use the wall adapter, it is Heinously staticy. It does go through 9v batteries rediculously quickly, so I can't afford to run it on those alone. I will be buying a new one, and one that I would hope has a longer life to it. This is the cheapest one out there, and hey, I guess we get what we pay for! So if you want it to work for only 2 years or so, it will do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights are nice, but static is ANNOYING!","review":"I wish this monitor had worked for us. I know some people have had good experiences, but I can not stand the static. Many times, I can hear my baby cry, but nothing is coming through the monitor because the static is so intense. The light up feature is nice, but it's not worth dealing with the poor reception and loud static."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This monitor is terrible! I was not sure if I wanted to buy another one since our old one worked okay. But, it sucked up 9 volts like you wouldn't believe. I finally decided to buy another and bought this one.

We can't even hear the baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best monitor ever...","review":"I've read the other reviews and this CAN'T be the same monitor! I've had mine for a while now and it's never staticy and I can hear every sound my daughter makes. I can even hear the dishwasher running in the kitchen through it. It's very quiet and I forget it's on until my daughter makes noise in her room. I've tried a few other monitors and this one is by FAR the very best we've tried! I don't use batteries with mine though. We just plug it in. HTH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"This is a horrible monitor.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone, but...","review":"A touching and humanistic look at a young female necrophiliac. Explores the roots of her fascination with death and her adult sexual conflicts. I like how this movie de-categorizes people with sexual deviations; we cannot so readily label this woman a \\"pervert\\" after we see this movie. We can identify with her because, we all have secrets and skeletons. \\"Mental disorders\\" are not so easily dismissed when we see how they develop from circumstances that could've happened to any of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting film, yes, very interesting","review":"i would have to say that i greatly enjoyed kissed, however, it really isn't for the faint of heart. it takes a huge leap in looking at a subject, necrophilia, which is taboo in our society, and does it in a way that gets you to feel for the heroine of the story, rather than be repulsed. i would highly recommend it if you're in the mood for something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow..What can one say?","review":"Parker takes on a role that few have tackled.And, she is just outstanding.This isn't for the faint of heart.It is for those that like the \\"unique\\" movies and who like Parker, who absolutely is riveting in \\"Kissed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done","review":"The star, Molly Parker, is luminescent and a terribly challenging topic is addressed in a very sensitive way. I first saw this Canadian movie on VHS years ago and was quite disappointed that it wasn't available for so long on DVD. I added it to my wish list as soon as I found it was available. Very recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"This is one of \\"those\\" movies...you know, the ones released because the lead actor got famous somewhere else and the drawers of previous work is emptied. In this case, Molly Parker from Deadwood fame.I didn't connect the dots until I got it home, I gave it a try because it sounded creepy and I have deep roots in the funeral business. The best thing I can say is it's only 79 minutes. My finger hovered \\"at the ready\\" over EJECT for the entire flick. It's pretty low budget to boot. The casket props looked like leftovers from an old horror flick (trust me!) and the embalming school scene was shot at an empty junior college. No Pushover recommends dropping in at a stranger's funeral instead of watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"the girl likes dead guys....","review":"I found the idea interesting but the execution lacking. The movie was boring. I didn't find it that shocking considering the other movies we have seen. A girl daydreams of having sex with dead guys, dates a live guy who thinks he needs to die for her to show an interest in him. **Yawn**"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what we've all been waiting for!","review":"I guess any subject can be rendered into art with beautiful lighting, attractive actors and a sensitive Sarah McLachlan song in the background. Like this movie: the first necrophiliac date flick. Yes, you read correctly: I said a movie about a necrophiliac. My stomach was literally lurching as I watched this film--not only from the graphic embalming scenes but from the subject matter. The 'heroine' of this piece is a, shall we say, extremely disturbed young woman who would have disgusted Krafft-Ebing. And the dialogue surpasses belief. We've all seen romantic flicks in which one member of the couple tears off melodramatically, uttering an oath or a line of poetry over their shoulder to their loved one. This is the first in which that line was, \\"I have to %$^% a corpse!\\" Yikes! The last taboo has been shattered. I did walk away from this movie having learned one thing, though: have your loved ones, and yourself, cremated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and uniteresting crap !","review":"Nothing interesting, stupid and boring, A girl with a sick mind likes to have sex with dead bodies, I'm sure it has happend at one time or another somwhere, but it does not make an interesting movie at all. 75 minutes that felt like 750 minutes, I saw the uncut version, you could see her breasts and bush once, that was it !

If you know the rules of Omaha, all the book says is the following. bet the nuts, call the nut draw, throw everything else away. you typically need a full house to win high, and can sometimes win with a flush. forget about any low hand worse than 6-high and be careful even with that as you often split the low half.there's simply not enough knowledge in this book to sit even 3-6 at a casino."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointing Omaha Book","review":"There are very few modern books on the topic of Omaha Hi-Low Split and I was elated to find one written by Andy Nelson. His books on Hold'em were pretty good--short, but good. This book was useless. I can honestly say that as a novice Omaha Hi-Low player, I did not take away even one piece of information from this book that I wasn't aware of from simply observing and playing a few hands. A much better Omaha book is \\"Winner's Guide to OMAHA POKER\\" by Ken Warren. It's written well and offers fantastic advice for the beginning and even intermediate player. I would not recommend Andy Nelson's book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"For true beginners only","review":"This is a very thin book, with little substantive information. If you know the rules of omaha and know how to read the board, you are a step ahead of this book. The only substantive information is regarding good starting hands, but it is mostly common sense. For the small price, you will get your money's worth only if you are a true beginner to omaha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely true story","review":"I started playing Omaha about a month ago (beginning of April, 2000) and played in the $3-6 limit games about five times. I had very dismal results, so I knew I had to get help and get it quick! I received Andy's books (Book 1 and the Intermediate book) on Tuesday and read both by Friday night. The next day I played in an Omaha tourney at the Bicycle club and, because of reading Andy's books, my game had improved enough so that I finished third, winning over $1500! I enthusiastically recommend Andy's books to anyone just starting or wanting to improve his/her game."},{"rating":"1","title":"You could write this book","review":"Respectfully, this book and its sequal are both hardly worth the paper they're printed on. As others have said, Mr. Nelson barely skims the surface of this rather complex game. He describes a couple of hands he's played (and won - big surprise!) and expects the reader to generalize correct Omaha/8 play from these few examples. There is no systematic discussion of starting hands nor play after the flop, turn, and river, and the reader is left knowing only that Mr. Nelson likes to hear himself talk. Better to use your eight dollars to raise when you have the button than buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for the money","review":"The only flaw this item has, is when it is loaded up with pictures the book doesnt close flush. In otherwords if te book was flat on the table, there would be a noticable angle lift becuase the binding didnt give enough room for expansion....not to the point that it would stop me from getting another (becuase I would), but if you and or your 'other' wants perfection....not so sure. The book itself is very well made, the leather is not as think as i would like to see, however it is a good product for the money and since there are few products like this with seperator tissue pages this is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medici Leather Photo Album","review":"This is a great looking photo album, but I didn't know the sleeves were fixed.

That alone is enough to change a man's life.* This book just hit the right notes for me, after years of practicing various spiritual methods and getting distracted with Asian philosophies to match my Asian martial arts practice. One day, I had an insight/ inspiration in the matter... and this book made it all so much clearer for me when I found it about a year later.* It's a shortened version of all the more traditional methods of consciously creating your own reality. It makes ritual more internalized, which means ordinary men/ women can afford it.* I recommend the book. At the least, do like I did... go to your library and borrow it, make copious notes, and take it back. After a couple years or so, you may actually still want to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i didnt really read the book i need help with something","review":"well first of all the guy who said he thought there were good looking women in this book is a sick sick man.....and second of all i need someone to mail me the tilte of a book that will teach me, or teach me to color my anime drawings, i never can seem to get it right.....my e-mail is shad0w3919@aol.com (note the 0 in shadow is a zero)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good purchase, with a few minor flaws","review":"I have spent many hours flipping through this book, just reading entries at random--not really the reason it was written, I suppose, but it's probably the most fun thing to do with it. The fact that it was alphabetized using Japanese words can make it hard to look up things that you don't know exactly what are, but that's no reason to not like it. However, I, like others, have found that the author uses Ms. Rumiko Takahashi's work a little too often; she's a great writer/artist, but there are others out there that deserve mention as well. All in all though, a fine book that's definetly worth a purchase by any otaku."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been nicer had it adhered to the title...","review":"Yes, it's Japanese, and it's Anime, but an Anime companion? Probably not. At best, it's probably \\"the Random Japanese Word You Overhear: What's it all about?\\" I agree with other reviewers and it's Takahashi Rumiko following is a little excessive. What I mean about adhering to the title is that it would best have been a true Anime companion... start watching Ranma 1/2 (or A-ko, or whatever), pull out your book, turn to the series (or, even better, episode by episode) and it would go into what's japanese about each episode. You see a carp? What's it mean? That whole episode of UY with Kintaro? Who's Kintaro? What's he doing? WHY is it strange. The information is fairly accurate, however, and in it's current form is quite interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE NEVER RECEIVED IT OR A REFUND?????","review":"WE NEVER RECEIVED THIS UNIT OR HAVE HAD ANY CONTACT WITH THE SELLER????

Any parent looking for guidance would do well to start here. But the variations in school law, state by state, are huge. What's okay in Michigan could be illegal in Illinois.

He writes directly and succinctly. When I first studied canon law in the mid-90's, I made use of an earlier edition, but this updated version reads very nicely. I had given consideration to using it in a canon law course that I am teaching. This textbook is not a canon by canon expository, although it does, at least cursorily, follow the schema of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. It is thematic in its approach, with more attention given to those elements of ecclesiastical law that are applicable to everyone, i.e., rights and duties, and elaborates nicely on the three munera of teaching, governing, and sanctifying, with a useful overview of temporal goods, general norms, sanctions/penal law, and procedural law.I would recommend this Introduction to anyone who wants to examine the Church's legal tradition as it applies to today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photos, edition doesn't do justice to them","review":"These photos of Douglas R. Gilbert, which depict Bob Dylan in a very different mood from the ones found for example in 'Early Dylan' have unfortunately not received the quality edition they deserve by Da Capo. It is a shame, since they are certainly worth the price of the book, but one wishes more care had been taken when preparing the book for publication. When compared with the four accompanying prints which really show the value of Gilbert's images, one gets rather disappointed with the reproductions printed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Young - Forever Disappointed","review":"As a Bob Dylan aficiondo, I decided to add this one to the home library...Big Mistake. The quality of the photos are substandard and appear to be taken by an amature photographer.

We both had such a great time... I had to buy it. We have now played it with other friends and relatives who have visited our home, and EVERYONE seems to love it! It is an easy game to play, and perfect for all ages! Unlike other games - where once you have played (or used a certain card in play) you cannot play again - with Hit or Miss, it is a new game everytime you play! New responses are given in various categories, and some are just hilarious!We recently played with a group of friends, and the category was \\"Things you do to make yourself look better\\" - the responses varied... makeup, plastic surgery, etc. My answer got so many laughs... \\"Hang out with ugly people!\\"My son and his fiance came for a visit with some friends a few weeks ago, and we busted out this game.

This has become one of my favorite party games... one that people always ask me to bring to get togethers. What I like most about it is that it doesn't force any one person to act, sing, or be silly (ex. Cranium), which is nice for people who tend to be shy or inhibited. It is very easy and straight-forward (you can teach a group of people how to play within 5 minutes) and although it may not seem that funny, it always inspires many laughs! I've had mine for about a year now and have got a lot of use out of it, so the cards are getting pretty worn and we have used up a majority of the category cards. I wonder if they will come out with an expansion pack? Or maybe we'll just make up our own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"If you are looking for an erotic story, like the back of the book and the cover suggest, look elsewhere. This book, while it may be a good book, really disappointed me. For those of you that find the idea interesting, but aren't into sexual situations, don't worry... This book doesn't have any. It is all implied. I don't know if the author or publisher did this on purpose to sell more books. If I could, I would try to get my money back for false advertising..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun But Sort of Disappointing","review":"I liked this book, but it doesn't live up to the sexy cover. In fact, there wasn't much sex or bondage at all. The story is about an Earth that has become a breeding ground for sex slaves that various and sundry aliens enjoy; the main character is abducted, stripped naked and sold to a vile villainess that we see only briefly and she doesn't do much to our heroine before the rescue begins. Our heroine then shares the book with a host of rebels, bad guys and whatnot. The story then spreads out into a Star Trek plot which makes sense since the author is a Trek-novel writer. This is fun sci-fi but boring sex slave stuff. There is no threatening male master on female slave situations, if that's what you're looking for. But well worth a first read because the spaceship battles are highly addictive. This is the first of three books so there is still time for our main character to find herself in the clutches of a male master, alien or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Yes, the cover is misleading and the actual story is misleading but that isn't what is wrong with this book. The writing is distinctly poor, character development is sketchy at best. This reads like a piece of B grade fanfiction. This is not a book to buy unless you pick it up from a used bookstore. I def think this is one the average scifi fan can skip. The plotline is neither provokative nor original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Stories of Inspiring Southern Women","review":"One of Becky Freeman's best books yet. She makes these women's stories come alive. Each story exemplifies the power of faith, hope and love, while showing that each of these women are human.

As a Dora nut, I figured she would adore this but we have come to find out that it just makes her upset. First, the bracelet is TINY! It barely fits around her wrist and is almost impossible to get on. The ring is huge and fits my size 7 finger. The necklace is bulky and heavy. Not only does it fall right off her because of its weight but it also barely fits around her neck because the chain is so short. She loves to pay with it but it makes her upset when she can't actually wear any of it. This definitely needs to be redesigned. Overall, spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Dora toy","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old's birthday online thinking it would be cute to wear with the Dora costume. Had I seen it in the store first I wouldn't have bought it. Whoever designed this needs to be sent back to the drawing board. With today's technology you can't tell me that the necklace, which plays music, couldn't be made lighter and smaller. The ring is even too big for me to wear, let alone my little girl. The bracelet fits my 11 month old better than my three year old. I don't know what kind of measurements they used designing this one, but they evidently did not try it out on an actual child. The necklace is too heavy to stay on and the \\"chain\\" part is just large enough to go around my daughter's neck so that the HUGE flower sits just below her chin for the few seconds it stays on."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!

The ring is TOO BIG, the bracelet is TOO SMALL, and the neckelace is TOO BULKY. My poor child tries to play with this but it is so poorly designed that she hurts herself trying to wear the bracelet and the necklace is practically as large as her head.Do yourself a favor don't buy this.

Though I would agree with some of the reviews about it being bulky my daughter, who is 3, plays with it every day. The bracelt fits fine and the ring is big but she, like another review, puts the ring on two of her fingers. It's a fun toy and she loves it is as does my other two daughters, who are 4 1/2, and 12 monthes old. The baby drags the necklace around the house and plays the music.

Many of the interviewees covered areas I hadn't thought of or motivated me to change my previous plans. Peter Bieler (Thigh Master & Body Solutions) and Rick Cesari (Juiceman) were particularly insightful, while AJ Khubani (Telebrands) was intimidating and Steve Scott (American Telecast) inspiring. Much of my research groundwork was covered through reading about how media buying works, writing scripts, retail distribution, etc. If the industry hadn't changed as much since the book was released and dated some of the information, it would be a perfect research source.

This book is what led me to become a serious Christian and dedicate my life to serving God. The advice given in the book is excellent, and I found it very inspiring to hear Rachel's story from top to bottom. The excerpts from Rachel's actual journals and writings were my favorite part--I loved being able to see her original drawings and even her handwriting. This book is great for those just starting out in their faith, or who are experiencing doubts and difficult times, or even people who are well-established in their beliefs. It will make you laugh, cry, and really think about life. Even all these years after Columbine, I still think about Rachel Joy Scott and her legacy, and I continue to try to lead a life based on her example. This book is a real life-changer."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational teenager","review":"I really like this book because it shows that even though she had her doubts and struggles, she found a way to be a positive influence on those around her.

You guys need to quit being witch hunters. Oh well, arrogance is just an anonouncement of inferiority.Okay, this cd is pretty tight. Everyone should check out the song \\"infected.\\" This song is a lot like o cross between \\"not ready too die\\" and \\"my heartstrings come undone\\" from the Summer of Darkness album. Not all of the songs are catchy, but they have a very cool very heavy groove to make headbangers smile. Great band, even better second cd, but both are very good. This band has a future and to have national recognition as a Christian band by the second cd, they're doing better than most bands.Anyway, If you don't own Summer of Darkness buy it first, if you don't own Blindside's cd \\"Silence\\" buy it second (or first), and ithen by this cd.

This cd does have a little potential, and I do admit that My Throat is an open grave and the gauntlet are very catchy. This Album can be defined as nothing other than a Nu-Metal album which, in no way resembles the band Slipknot. I guess Solid State saw the need to release a Nu-Metal album to promote themselves, and I don't blame em, cuz a lot of people seem to like demon hunter. They just don't appeal to me, I'm just more of a hardcore/screamo kid. Some stuff I would recommend: Norma Jean, The Agony Scene, Underoath, Evergreen Terrace, Poison the Well (old), As Hope Dies, Narcissus, Zao."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music deserves a good rating","review":"as I read some of the other comments about this album, I did notice that people were complaining about this band being \\"another christian band\\" and to be so truthful, who cares. the music should speak for itself, reguardless to what type it is... as for this album, if you like music classified as Rock or Metal, reguardless of the type, you will like this album, I have listened to it multiple times, and can not say anything bad about them, I am not a christian, I am far from it, but this is not about that either. as for them sounding like other bands, I think that is all but rude to say, each band has their own sound, reguardless to how they actually \\"perform.\\" If you like metal type musics, this album is for you, just listen to samples somewhere online, you will see, good music comes from those who can do what they feel, and for those who can complain, let us see you do what they do and let us complaign about you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big surprise...","review":"I'm from the \\"old-school\\" death metal scene with impossible guitar riffs and drum rolls and I'm usually not very impressed with this more recent stuff. However this cd kinda surprised me. While not nearly as intense as the kings, Living Sacrifice, this is one great debut. The guitar playing can be dull and boring sometimes, but for the most part it's played very well. The drum playing is very tight and adds alot to the songs. The bass playing, while not in the forefront, adds an eerie touch to a lot of the songs; and is very well played on the \\"ballad\\" track.A great twist to this band is the singers great \\"singing\\" voice, as well as his \\"screaming\\" voice. He sings cleanly very well. Alot of the songs, while heavy, have a lot of singing in them...which seems like the new fad nowadays. Anyhow...great debut. I'm sure these guys will only get better with time...they definately have lots of talent. Oh yeah, their cd insert is really cool, and their website is really stunning as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid songs","review":"I can't really justify paying this much money for any cd but, if your going to buy cd's buy christian cd's. They need your money more. The songs here are done really well. While not being and never becoming a Nu-Metal fan, i found Demon Hunter being more Metal than Nu-Metal. I think there songs are kind of in the vein of new In Flames. I love the melodic choruses with double bass and screaming. I see there singer being more a Nuerosis look alike then the band being a Slipknot ripoff. They must have some appeal for Jesse Sprinkle to play drums for them. Go Demon Hunter take over the scene! See them on tour with EXTOL! the metal masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite as good as their other album","review":"although this album is good, i dont think its as great as their other album.

I really don't see why Demon Hunter has such big status in the Christian hardcore scene, there are a few good songs though, like \\"my throat is an open grave\\". Seriously, if you like this you should check out some Norma Jean, Underoath, Zao, Few Left Standing, Living Sacrifice, Beloved, Narcissus, or Unearth. Those are some good bands.

They think that yelling and screaming into a microphone isn't Christian-like. Well let me ask you...when pastors are suddenly filled with the Holy Spirit do they not suddenly yell or shout? Also don't you feel the same way sometimes when you are filled? On another note...this band is extremely talented. I would love to go to one of their concerts. If you like heavy rock you shouldn't be disappointed with this band and please don't diss it because it's Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good cd 3/5","review":"This cd was pretty good , but when I got it I had already owned Summer Of Darkness, so it wasn't as cool, because I think Summer Of darkness is a little bit better.

As soon as I plugged this in and turned on the receiver, all I heard was loud buzzing. I guess it depends on where you live, and apparently this is a good one for some people, but not for us. I much prefer the Graco SoundSleep. We never had any static or interference, and even when turned up very loud it made little noise. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a baby monitor. The only problem that developed was one of the receivers (it comes with 2) has started to go out, but I am going to continue using it with one receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled at all","review":"These monitors were priced reasonably, but I would have rather paid more if that meant better quality. My husband and I have to sleep with the monitor in our bed because it seems to be much less static if a person is close to it. If we touch it, the static seems to decrease. I do like the two monitors and that it can clip on your hip if you are moving around, but I find the static extremely annoying and disturbing. Many other reviewers say that it may be their area. Where is a monitor that will work in anyone's area??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound N Lights Monitor","review":"I purchased these as a gift for my daughter's baby shower--she loves them. They are much better quality than most of the others I looked at, and the price was reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor has so much static","review":"Perhaps it's because we live in a high traffic area, but we have nothing but static using this monitor. If you walk by the receiver using the cordless or cellphone it completely loses all reception and all you hear is static. The receiver also seems to have trouble around our direct tv boxes.With all the electronic gidgets and gadgets out there spend the money and get the higher end models that really do block out interference.The real kicker of this was I was asleep one night while my husband was out working and I heard a males voice in the monitor. I immediately freaked out thinking someone broke into the house and was in the baby's room. I jumped out of bed and was ready to run into the baby's room when I heard the guy talking to a girl in what appeared to be a cell phone conversation from who knows where. Talk about almost having a heart attack on the spot!FP should just stop making this model period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like to hear a constant buzz while you sleep?","review":"If you don't like to hear a constant buzz while you are trying to sleep, then don't buy this product. Yes, this product has a constant buzz when it is turned \\"on\\". Very annoying. My husband hates it and I just deal with it. The buzz is there even when the volume is turned all the way down. I'm getting ready to shop for a video monitor to replace this thing.I do need to address the static. I did not get static when it was new and but I have experienced it. I've had it for 18 months and I noticed that I get static when it's windy outside. The static can be so bad that you wonder if someone has shut it off to cause it to static. Otherwise I hear BUZZZZZZZZZ all night long.Hope this helps someone.

We go to bed hearing static and interference all night long! And like one of the other reviewers, we looked all over to see if there was something that may be causing the static, and there isn't! Last night was the worst, we actually picked up somebody's conversation on it!!! And when we tried to change the channels the static was terrible (yes, we did change the channel on both the reciever and the monitor!). So last night we ended up not using it and hoping we would hear our baby cry if she woke up. We totally DO NOT recommend this hunk of junk! I guess those who have had no trouble with theirs are the lucky few. We thought that with the name Fisher Price on it that it would be a good product, think again. We bought ours at Target, I went online to their website to write a review on it and they don't even have it online anymore, hmmm, I wonder why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a mind of it's own...","review":"I read all the reviews but figured we lived in a small enough house and really won't use it but boy was I wrong! In the middle of the night the monitor will go to LOUD static and won't stop. It has made me jump a few times and even one time we left the downstairs one on and I made Hubby get up to see what it was! Tee hee. The thing is haunted. It works great one day and the next you can't even have it on because of the awful noise it's making. And we have heard neighbors talking! My advice: save the box so you can take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"this monitor stinks","review":"I don't know if it is because some of the neighbors have this monitor or what but the first night I let my baby sleep in his crib (which causes enough anxiety!) I kept hearing cars go by, beeping, cell phone conversations and I even heard other babies. I heard a Mommy tell her baby good night and the little girl said \\"I love you mommy.\\" It made me wonder what the neighbors may have heard from me! We took it back and got the Sony Babycall and it completely rocks. We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We liked the two receiver idea, but the poor sound quality was not worth it.

I am on the second monitor, thinking something was wrong with the first one. Nope, still the same static roar as the first. it works as long as you are holding it.

This was an absolute waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good monitor for price - works perfectly for us","review":"Although many reviews have been bad for this monitor, we got this as a shower gift and have found it to work perfectly. There is zero static and it picks up my baby's every little sound. I was actually amazed at how well it picked up his sounds. However we live in a rural area, so maybe that has something to do with a clear signal/no static. I would definitely recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The static is horrible!","review":"Our old hand-me-down monitor died, so I bought this one. It stinks. I had to turn it all the way down, otherwise there would be loud static. Thus, I could't hear my son unless he cried out very loudly. I've since tried both the Sony Baby Call 27 channel and the Summer 900 megahrtz with rechargable battery and they're both GREAT. The Sony has a few more bells and whistles, but also costs about $20 more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product - works well for us!","review":"True, we get some static but nothing too horrible.

It is horrible. It has a continous annoying humming sound while you are trying to listen for your infant.

I have tried to move my monitors around but the noise is still there. I have tried to turn down the volume but then you can barely hear your child. I would advise you not to purchase this item. It should be $9.99 for how it functions. I am now online looking for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price Baby Monitor","review":"The monitor worked great at first. Now my baby is 15 months old and after we have the monitor on for about 15 minutes, you hear a loud noise. There is only a 1 year manufacturer's warranty. I am not sure what to do.

I got them on my registry so I don't have the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out ok but not anymore","review":"I registered to receive this item for our first child. At first it was great. All you had to do was barely turn on the volume and you could hear everything from her waking up to rolling over. It has been just a little over a year and it sounds horrible. The static is terrible. The minute you turn on the monitor, it makes a terrible roaring sound. After great research, we are now on our way to purchase a video monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Static","review":"I am a first time mom and received this monitor as a gift.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static","review":"I agree that this monitor has terrible static. It is so loud. It is better when it is plugged in but that isn't practical. Actually it is too sensitive. If I just watch the lights, it picks up every sound from other parts of the house. Spend the money & get a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Reception!","review":"I was very disappointed with this monitor! You have to crank the volume way up to hear the baby and when you do there is very loud white noise. Also at times the level of white noise gets very, very loud for no apparent reason. I would compare it to what happens when you turn off the monitor in the baby's room but leave the other one on. I've actually had to get up in the middle of the night to change channels when this happened because I couldn't hear the baby. Sometimes during the night when the baby was crying, the monitor barely picked it up, I could actually hear him better through my open bedroom door!"},{"rating":"1","title":"major interference and constant buzzing","review":"I like the previous reviewer had the older version of the sound and lights monitor and it worked great. Since they have updated it, it does not work well at all. Last night I woke up at in the middle of the night thinking our baby was crying and it was someone else's baby!!

We have been very pleased with it so far, though we have only had it in use for three days. We are surpised at its ability to pick up even the tiniest sounds, and though there is some static (as several other reviewers pointed out), it seems to only be audible when our baby is not making any noise. If she makes even the slightest sound, it comes through the monitor crystal clear. Overall, we are very happy with it, and are even hoping to find additional receivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"We returned this monitor for a variety of reasons. We have another set, firstly. Secondly, this monitor picks up the conversations of the neighbors from their monitor better than it picks up our own babies upstairs. The static was unnerving, and if you didn't place the unit just so it sounded like a TV on a dead channel. Plus, the lights lit constantly, so it wasn't exactly doing its job there. We could only handle it for a few days and gave up. If you have this one, I wish you better luck than we had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the monitor for us","review":"This monitor has BAD static. And having to sleep next to this thing while it is making a buzzing noise it not going to happen. We are looking for something better at this very time. The reason I got this monitor was because of the feedback that people had written on it, And it was all good fot the most part. But the product does not work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static and Loud Obnoxious Buzzes","review":"We registered for this monitor based on a Baby Bargains review and the fact it had two receivers. Unfortunately, it produced lots of static, but even worse were the intermittent, LOUD, very sudden buzzing sounds it produced. There is no way we could sleep with this in our room! We switched to the Sony 900 megahertz and it was definately worth the extra money! Crystal clear reception and no static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking...","review":"This monitor has a lot of static on it, even when used with the AC adaptor. Took me awhile to get used to sleeping with it on. My biggest problem with it though is that the turn button for the volume is very hard to adjust...you just can't get a good grip on it and is very difficult to turn which really aggravates me. The only good thing about it is the two recievers, but I'm certain you could find a superior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Static!","review":"We bought this monitor because it was recommended as a Best Pick in a baby magazine. I have had nothing but problems with it. The static is horrible and it makes a constant humming on one channel and a buzzing every 2 seconds on the other. I have an old Graco monitor from 1997 that we still use for another child - still to this day we have no problems with static! We're taking this one back and exchanging it for a different one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toys yes... electronics NO!","review":"We got this monitor as a shower gift and at first, it worked OK, but then it quit working all together when our son was 10 months old. My husband said there's a short in the base antenna , so he pulls on it and twists it until it works again. It works for a few days and then we have to \\"adjust\\" it again, which has gotten ridiculous. Also, the static is HORRIBLE and always has been, but we tried to live with it. This morning, it finally stopped working for good and we barely used it for a year. Try the Sony Babycall Nursery Monitor -- it's so quiet we have to tap it to see if it's on! A big change from this staticky piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static and interference","review":"We got this monitor as a gift from our baby registry after reading good reviews in books and online. I was very disappointed in the sound quality, as I was unable to eliminate static and interference even by switching channels, and moving the unit around. There was an annoying hum from the unit when it was plugged into the wall, and the baby could hardly be heard when it was in battery mode.Overall, very disappointing, and now I have to go and try other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, I'm sure there are Better.","review":"This monitor is \\"staticky\\". I mean if it's the only one you have then it's fine because you can still hear your child, but the amount of static is annoying and kind of distracting if you are trying to do work. I would suggest that parents shop around before purchasing an item that is cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"the light works well but there is a lot of noise because of the staticI'm not using it and I'm planning to buy another one to use when i will put the baby in another bedroom during the night"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"We bought this item when I was still pregnant with our son. This monitor may have certain cute features but they only lasted a few months before they stopped working all together. The \\"montitoring\\" part is the worst of all. It picks up some sort of interference and actually makes a loud \\"CB\\" sound. So loud it has been waking up my son and we didn't know it. We thought he was just restless or teething. Our son is now two, and we are finally tired of this poor investment. We are going to buy one of the cheaper ones. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"this monitor is the worst. i bought it for my 5 month old and it quit working after 1 month. the static is so bad. all i ever heard was static and more static. it was even worse if i had the ceiling fan on. this is a warning to all. Don't BUY this monitor. you will be wasting your money. listen to these reviews. it sucks and is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static all night long!!!!","review":"We received this monitor system for a baby gift but have not used it until now, our daughter is 7months old and now upstairs in her room. We tried many locations in our room as the directions said and still had nothing but static and red lights. This system worked wonderful for our friends but terrible for us. My suggestion is to keep your box and receipt and give it a try, we kept neither and now are shopping for a new monitor system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static and feedback","review":"I also ended up having static and feedback with my monitor. It didn't happen at first though, only like a month after purchasing it. It was so bad it kept us up at night. The company says to send it in to fisher price but what am I supposed to do in the meantime. We have to have a monitor and now TRU won't take it back because it is past the 90 days. I do not recommend this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price employees must be writing the good reviews","review":"Tonight has been ANOTHER frustrating night trying to get a decent signal from this piece of garbage. One channel is useless, as it blasts out deafening static. The other channel only occasionally is tolerable, but mostly has an unacceptable level of static that gets worse when it is plugged into the AC adaptor.Maybe Fisher Price sells a special wrench that can get a grip on this poorly designed on/off/volume knob. I can barely turn it using both hands, let alone try it one-handed with a sleeping baby in my arms.May God strike me down if I ever consider buying another Fisher Price product that plugs into an outlet. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 5 months cannot even hear my baby cry!","review":"This is the first time I have ever written a review, but I am so dissatisfied with this monitor that I want to voice my opinion. The sound quality has gotten worse and worse with more and more static and interference. We were horrified to hear our 5 month old crying in her nursery and hear NOTHING on the monitor. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first, but...","review":"We received this monitor as a shower gift before my son was born. It worked GREAT for the first 6 months or so, but now one of the receivers makes a horribly loud static sound, and only works when it is turned up full blast. The other one doesn't do this, and it doesn't matter where either of them are located.The other terrible thing about these is that sometimes the plug in attachment slips just out of its connection, so the lights work, but no sound comes out. I look at the monitor, think it is working, and then hear my son crying upstairs - the monitors lights are going, but NO SOUND! I don't have monitors so that I can sit and stare at them. This happens all the time - without touching the machine - it just STOPS WORKING.I'm very disappointed with these monitors. I'm shopping for another brand right now for our second child."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've Worked Well for Us","review":"I guess it may depend where you live, but we didn't get much feedback or static at all from this product, and the reception is crystal clear. The only time I got static was when I had it on the wrong channel. (If you're getting static, try the other channel. Also, you don't need to have it up on full volume to hear; full volume may be leading to feedback.)This is a very affordable product and has served us well. I like that there are two listening monitors and that you can put batteries in them-that enables me to take them outside and do yard work during my baby's naptime. I don't use monitors at night (our room is close enough to hear her crying); I only use them during naptime when I am working in other rooms of the house or outside. These have functioned very well for that purpose, and they are less expensive than most monitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"The static is terrible!","review":"This monitor does the job...I can even hear my baby breathing if I turn it up loud enough. It's cheap and works. But, my two major complaints are that 1. the batteries die in a matter of a couple hours. All the devices can be plugged in, but that isn't the most convenient option all the time. And, 2. the static it gives off is incredibly annoying. Not so much static if the devices are being used with battery power, but as soon as you plug them in, forget it. We've tried different channels, different locations in the house (away from cordless phones, microwaves, anything plugged in) and nothing makes is better. We've lived with it for 10 months now and my husband is forcing to buy another one, no matter what it costs. Just buy another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great, but works well enough for the price...","review":"This monitor I received as a baby shower gift and I hate it! It has horrible static. If you walk around it or get too close it gets worse. If the phone rings same thing. I didn't expect to much from it, but I must say I can hear my son pretty well, and I like the fact that I can see the red lights. They help me to determine if he is just groaning and searching for his thumb, or if he is actually in distress. Great concept, needs some work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"We received this monitor at our baby shower. I liked it because it comes with two receivers, as my husband is often in his office while I am in a different room. However, the monitors have a TERRIBLE static problem. The first night that we moved our daughter out of her cradle in our room to her crib in the nursery, the static was so bad that we could not hear her at all. We tried both channels, and all we could hear was static. The static was so bad that the light on the monitors was constantly lit. We have tried to use them repeatedly, but the static never goes away. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible static","review":"After seeing so many positive reviews of this monitor, even that it was one of the \\"must haves\\" in a popular baby magazine, I was so disappointed once I got this home. Not only did we have static, we also had a horrible high-pitched squeal. Changing channels helped the squeal, but the static was still really bad. And I kept getting up out of bed to check on my daughter because I kept hearing a baby cry through the static - but it wasn't MY baby!! I guess it was the neighbor's child. Not once was I able to hear my own baby through this monitor!!We switched to the First Years 900mHz Attachable monitor (it hooks right onto the crib). What a difference!! Last night, for the first time since we moved our daughter to her own room, I was able to hear her sigh in her sleep and roll over!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible buzzing Noise","review":"I bought this monitor because I own a previous Fisher Price Sounds N Light monitor and it worked great. It had crystal clear reception. It did look different than this model though. This model has been horrible. The buzzing noise is constant, even on the lowest volume setting and if we try it on the alternate channel it lets out a rythmic high pitched warble. I thought I would just deal with it, but today I am returning it because I can barely hear my baby the static is so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst monitor ever used","review":"We've had a few different monitors for our children and this is the worst one by far. Through all the static I can't hear a thing. If someone is standing right next to the monitor talking, you can't even hear it. We've tried moving it around, different channels, nothing works. We're going to throw it away and get a new one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better","review":"This is my 4th baby monitor, and I can honestly say I like this one the least. My other ones were Safety First (I think that's the name).But I couldn't find that brand with 2 portable units, so I bought this instead. My other monitors were so clear I could hear the clock ticking in my daughter's room. This monitor I can only hear my daughter if she is actually vocal. Which kind of sucks. I also hear CB conversations. And I never did with my other monitors. It also is staticy. It does it's job, you do hear your child and a few other things you may not want to hear.But it's just not as sensitive as my others, and I miss hearing my little one sucking her fingers when she's in a deep sleep. Or sighing in her sleep, or yawning, all the cute little noises are gone. Well I can't hear them anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"We purchased this monitor based on the features that it offered. I have just read the other reviews on this model which talk about \\"white noise\\", that is putting it lightly. Regardless of where the parental monitor is located, there is static. You cannot hear little noises in the room that you can hear with many other monitors, once in a while you can actually hear your baby. Baby monitors were designed to allow you to hear little noises, for example coughs, sneezes, etc. You will not hear any of this using this monitor. The second night that we had the monitor, we had the parent unit in our bedroom at night and were barely tolerating the static on it, our son woke up at 3:00a.m. and if it weren't for hearing his cries down the hallway - we never would have heard him. This monitor was a major let down and is going right back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of batteries","review":"I've had this monitor for 10 months and am looking for a new one! It works as far as hearing my daughter, but that is the only good thing about it. We keep one plugged in and use the other one wherever we go around the house. The batteries run out really fast and after changing them too often we stripped the screw on the back. We traded it for the one we keep plugged in, but now the volume dial is messed up and makes a ton of static everytime we touch it. I am done! I am ready for a new monitor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We went through two of these!","review":"We like Fisher Price, so we got a set. we got some static sometimes, but after a couple of months could hardly get anything but a blast of static! Also, we got feedback that was horrible if we opened the babies' door. We have twins, so we need both receivers to work if one was in bed and one of us in our room. Both sets have died by stopping completey or only getting awful static after a couple of months. Today I got a Graco monitor, so we will see. I will never get a Fisher Price monitor again, and do not reommend it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Static, noisey and not worth it!","review":"We registered for this monitor based on the fact that it was one of the only monitors on the market that offered two handsets. This monitor has the loudest \\"hmmm\\" that I have heard from any monitor - regardless of which station we put the monitor on. It barely provides coverage to the outside deck on our house. There is no range on this monitor and the backround noise it makes is unbearable to have on in the room while we were sleeping. I would return it - however we didn't keep the box. Very disappointed! Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static","review":"We got these monitors for our first baby thinking that all monitors were the same. We have found these to have lots of static even when the volume is turned low and with changing the channel. Also we have travled to PA and VT to visit family and have had the same problem with the static like we do at home. So, I don't think it has to do with where you live.The lights are a great idea and comes in handy for when I'm running the vaccum or hair dryer. I can easily see when baby is making noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful quality","review":"I think this is a great monitor system. Like the previous posters, I've had no problems at all with static. Then again, I haven't really tried using the monitors at greater distances. The nursery is upstairs and so is our bedroom, and that's where we use these monitors. We have an audio monitor that we use when our daughter is upstairs and we're downstairs, so we don't have static issues with this set. We keep one in our bedroom and one in our bathroom. They pick up all of the sounds our daughter makes (and some background noises as well-even picking up noises outside). We love this set and have had no problems with it so far...hopefully it stays that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Static","review":"The receiver stinks. I know someone with the same one and they like it but they are too static-y. One can barely turn it up without walking the baby with the static. We are getting rid of it and getting something else.And to add insult to injury, first time we had it on and I went to the room to make sure it was working, our brand new TV that was in the line of fire of the monitor and receiver got a damaged picture tube. seems something in the electronics is messed up. No, this monitor has to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall, doesn't work long range","review":"This monitor is good--it comes with 2 receivers, which is nice--one in the living room, one in the bedroom. I love the \\"lights\\" feature, so that if the TV is on, I can tell from the lights going crazy that baby needs me, even if I can't hear him.Only complaint: These work great if you are only a room or 2 away, but anything more than that and there is a loud buzzing or it won't work at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Static, Great Range, Can hear everything","review":"I keep reading the other reviews and have to say I have not experienced any of the problems others are having and I have been using it for 15 months and plan to use it with my next baby. I am still on the original batteries (it is usually plugged in) and don't get any interference. I am on a message board and most of us have the same monitor and not one of us has had any issues. Well worth the $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad static","review":"We have been using our monitor for 4 months now. About a month or more ago it started to get static. Now it's just so bad I am not getting any sleep. The static drowns out the noise of my son. I am definetly getting a new one ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can't hear the baby over the hissing","review":"We bought these monitors when our son was born and didn't realize that monitors aren't supposed to have a hissing sound until I bought a second pair to travel with. These never stop making noise - unfortunately the convenience of having two parent units doesn't make up for the poor quality. We now use our travel monitor exclusively, it's the 900mz Attachable Monitor by The First Years, and it's excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound N Lights Monitor","review":"I really wish I could say something about this item; but I never got it, I would like my money credit back to my credit card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usless product","review":"We bought this product online and it is no good.

Waste of time and shipping money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get them to work","review":"My husband and I spent 3 hours trying to get these monitors to even work! What a waste of time. We tried moving them from room to room, channel to channel, and outlet to outlet. We put the radio on in the baby's room (as the direction stated)and all we heard was a horrible buzzing noise. We tried everything and nothing worked. I gave this product one star because it made me put at least one in, it doesn't deserve one! We are returning them today. What a piece of junk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My husband and I registered for this monitor because of the good reviews it received in the Baby Bargains book. We also liked that there were two receivers. Once our daughter was born and we started using it, all we heard was STATIC. We returned it and got the Sony Baby Call monitor. It only has one receiver but worth it because there is absolutely no static. Skip the Fisher Price Sound and Lights and go straight for the Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for a different monitor.","review":"This is a horribly annoying monitor. It has an amazing amount of static. The only way to hear my child is to turn the volume high and only then I might be able hear her through the static interference. The red lights are always illuminated, no matter if my child is talking or not, so clearly they are not doing their job either. My 8 year old Graco works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only so-so product","review":"This is our first child so we weren't really sure what to get for our son, but we made a mistake in trusting the Fisher Price name. This product did well for the first month, but that is mostly because we didn't need to use it that much, since our son was in our room in a bassinet or downstairs with us in his pack and play. Now that he is in his crib and we are in need of the monitor - this one is just not getting the job done. I have been awakened four times in the past two weeks from another child's cries. I don't get enough sleep as it is as a new parent, we can't afford to be awoken by someone else's baby. We've tried changing channels but will only get static from this. At times all we are getting is static, other times it works just fine. I need a more reliable product than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monitor allows to hear all kinds of static and white noise","review":"Not what we expected. We just tried this monitor out, and it doesn't allow us to hear anything. We were interested in a monitor with 2 receivers..there aren't that many out there, so we picked this one. Back to finding one that works...very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely too much static, lights don't work","review":"I bought this because I thought Fisher Price products were good. This monitor is not work the money. At night you have to turn it as low as possible to still hear your baby, but to where the static won't interupt your sleep. Save yourself the aggrivation and buy a digital monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"we can hear every breathe she takes....","review":"I want a monitor that picks up every noise, and that is what this one does! I can her my daughter breathing, sighing, even tooting in her sleep. If I want to turn it down a little, the lights keep me alerted to any noises.We got a little static with this one, too, but after changing the location of the receiver to another outlet, it is fine.BUT BEWARE ALL MONITORS: if you are in the nursery and you want to make a snippy remark about your mother in law who is down stairs, turn the monitor off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Versitile","review":"I received this monitor as a gift and I couldn't be happier. Before baby came, my husband and I tested it from the basement to the backyard and it gets excellent reception everywhere. I leave the door closed to his room all the time (Cats like to sleep in the crib), so having a monitor with the option of plugging in or batteries is a must (For when my husband's snoring drives me to the couch!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I usually am a fan of Fisher Price, but I have to say- don't buy this product. It worked well the first few weeks we got it, but over a year later, it only offers static, no matter what channel I set it. I wish I'd read the reviews first. I still trust their toys, but I'm very disappointed and frustrated with this monitor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"This monitor was highly recommended to us... unfortunately it has given us nothing but grief.Regardless of what channel or volume it is set to we constantly pick up a high pitched static feedback. There are only 2 channels to choose from on this unit, one of which picks up the static worse than the other. Unfortunately the less static filled channel also picks up a neighbors signal (and they have a constant crying baby, ugh!!!) so a lot of times I will check on our daughter to find she is fast asleep while the mystery baby is bawling its head out via our monitor. In order for me to sleep at night, we have to run our fan to create enough white noise to drown out the static.Going to shop around for another system..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static and feedback","review":"Despite good reviews, we had nothing but trouble with this monitor. Lots of static and feedback. We bought a Graco monitor instead and we have zero feedback, we just hear the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We bought this monitor when we moved to a 2-story house, and only used it at night. There was so much static that I could not turn the volume up very loud. We finally decided to buy a monitor that was a little more expensive when our older son had to come and wake us up at 3 am to tell us the baby was screaming, crying. We could not hear him because of all the static. I went out the very next day and bought another one. If you spend a little more money (about $20 more), you can get a good, clear, crisp sounding monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"My FP monitors that are 9 yrs old work better than this one!","review":"With baby #3 - we decided to get a new monitor because our old Fisher Price one is kind of dingy and you have to jiggle the cord a bit. Bought this Sound and Lights one and it is PURE MISERY! The STATIC is horrible and worse yet...if it does happen to pick up the baby's cry it immediately turns itself off. We've tried everything - batteries, jiggling the cord, taping the dial, different plugs, different outlets, different houses - All the same STATIC. There is absolutely no way we can use these monitors. We've given it a few months but my patience is gone. Off to find another option and have some quiet in my home again."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Nothing but static and humming from this monitor! I've read some other reviews on this product that included \\"hints\\" on how to get the static to go away...turning it around, using batteries, doing a jig...you shouldn't have to do all that!

Go for the Safety 1st monitor instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never had any problems with static","review":"We got these monitors for our shower. Although they are not the ones we wanted, we kept them. We have used them since our baby was 2 weeks old. He is 5 1/2 months now. We have never had an issue with static. We barley have to turn the monitor up to be able to hear him. If I'm watching tv I love that I can look over and see if the lights are moving with out having to turn the volume to the max. The dual receivers work great. We have one in our bedroom and one in our kitchen, our house is pretty big, and thats all we need. I would recomend these to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Static - 2nd Receiver Died","review":"In the beginning these worked fine as long as I placed the monitor far away from the baby's crib. Although if you run any type of humidifier, fan or a/c in the nursery - forgot about hearing anything! Also, the 2nd monitor died after about 8 months and we couldnt get any feedback at all. I will definately be switching to a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Static","review":"I purchased this monitor set from BabiesRus and my sons' room is about 15 feet from mine and all I get on the monitor is static. Now I could understand all the static if the base and the receiver were more than 50 feet from eachother but 10 to 15 feet with a line of sight from the receiver to the base through the doorways of the rooms is crazy. At this distance with a line of sight you should get no static at all. I would NOT recomend this monitor to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, for about a year","review":"This monitor has great range, a clear signal, and worked wonderful for us, for about 11 months. However, after about two months of use one of the receivers died, the light function quit working, and a year later the other receiver ceased to function as well. Also, if your power ever goes out in the night you won't be able to hear your child since the monitor comes without a battery option.So, now we are on the market for monitor number two, and although this one had its drawbacks, I am considering it again since it was terrific for the first year."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints","review":"I was quite pleased with this monitor. It really serves it's purpose. I haven't had any problems whatsoever. The reception is clear. There is however a quiet \\"white noise\\" hum when the receivers are running. This didn't really bother me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Static!","review":"We just pulled it out of the box to try it out and it is HORRIBLE! We are taking it back and exchanging it as soon as possible. The amount of static we were getting was ridiculous - and we don't even have the baby here yet. You could barely here the radio coming through the monitor the static was so loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"This monitor was recommended to us by a friend and I purchased it for the dual listening monitors and the fact that it had AC and battery power options. The big visual display also seemed like a plus.However, when we tried to use the monitor all we heard was interference. We tried switching channels and adjusting the volume and still only heard static or feedback. We have a lot of wireless equipment in our house and my husband thought that might have something to do with it not working. I ended up returning the monitor to the store. Since then I purchased a Graco monitor and have had no problems with static."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor.","review":"I originally purchased this monitor because of the two receivers. That way I wouldn't have to keep moving one around. I leave one plugged-in in our bedroom for at night and the other is in our family room. I really like the light indicator on the monitor. At night I can have the sound turned down low and the light wakes me up when my baby cries. My only problem is when you try to use them with batteries. All I got was static. As long as you use the AC adapter there is no static. But since I tend to leave these plugged in this moniter serves its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been disappointed with this monitor. I didn't think that there would be that big of a difference between monitors, but when my second baby was born (my girls are only 18 months apart) I needed a second monitor. I chose Fisher Price for my second one so that I could tell which monitor went to which girl. My first monitor was The First Years. Unfortunately, the Fisher Price model has MUCH more static and white noise when turned on than does The First Years monitor.I can hear my daughter on it but the amount of white noise/static is quite annoying--even when the volume is turned down really low."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying monitor","review":"I am completely annoyed by this monitor.

The buzzing is so loud that we can barely hear any sounds the baby makes over the annoying sound!I called Fisher Price to comment and they said that various electrical equipment can interfere... cordless phones, secruity systems, satellite dishes, etc. We have tried every troubleshooting tip to get this monitor to stop buzzing and nothing works.The dual receivers are great, but not when you can't hear what's going on over the buzzing.The previous model of this monitor was fantastic! I would not recommend the new model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static problems . . .","review":"We had major static problems with this unit -- even with it just in the next room from us. Once we switched to a 900 MHz monitor (we chose the Sony babyCall) we had better luck. We never heard anything through this monitor *other* than static. Though this is cheaper than other 900 MHz models, if you have a lot of electronics around you may want to save yourself some time and aggravation and start off with a 900 MHz monitor (rather than trying this and risking having to return it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to the reviews.","review":"I looked at reviews for this monitor and several others before we went to the store to buy one. I thought maybe it would owrk in my house. I was wrong. All of these reviews are right. There is too much static and if you have the tv on it is worse. I guess you have to be a cave man to use these. So we took it back and got the Sony Baby Call monitors. More expensive but worth it! There is no static whatsoever and i can hear my baby wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAZARDOUS","review":"My son just turned 7 months old, and he's started to crawl around. Thank God I got to this monitor before he did. The monitor cord has exposed itself. There has been no stress or tautness on the cord, yet the electrical wires are exposed. It's a known fact that you need to hide the cords from your children, and i'm glad that I hid the cord from my son. This monitor's defect is hazardous, and I'm definately going to buy a new one. Don't buy it! I just notified the CSPC (the recall people) and hope they take some action. I'm sure this defective device is in millions of nurseries in the U.S. Please.... Don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant buzzing noise","review":"I registered for this monitor because the reviews were overall good. When I got it for my shower, I decided to open it up and try it (thank goodness I decided to test it right away). I had the reciever on the lowest volume setting and could still hear a constant buzzing noise. The louder the volume, the more static and buzzing noise I could hear. I went back to the reviews and they said that other electrical equipement can interfere with it and it suggested to move the recievers around to different spots in the room to find the perfect spot. Well...that did not work. I have tried everything and the monitor is still not quiet. I now have tried the Graco Clear Range monitor (it too has two recievers). I have tested it, and so far it is clear and there is no buzzing or static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Static","review":"This monitor is aweful!!!!!All we hear when we turn it on is static. At first we thought our baby is moving an aweful lot, until we went into the room to find her snoozing quietly. There are all sorts of sounds coming from the monitor, including a conversation between another mother and her child !!The monitor is unbelievably loud and truly a waste of money.We cannot tell the diiference between just static and when she really moves, so everytime there is a noise we are up on our toes-what a pian and isn't this what the monitor is supposed to prevent??????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check your cordless phone if you have static problems","review":"For everyone who has trouble with static - if you have a cordless phone, it's MgHz could be interfering with the monitor. If the phone is running on the same frequency as the monitor, you will likely have buzzing or static problems. Just wanted to pass that along. Generally, the monitor will operate just fine when you eliminate in-home interference. If you live in an apt. or in a zero lot line neighborhood, the interference may be coming from your neighbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible static","review":"I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet. I found this product had terrible static. In comparison, the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static!","review":"We enjoyed this monitor for a year until a neighbor w/ a baby moved in. Now, we have tons of static, and we can hear their baby crying on the other channel! At first, I thought maybe our monitor was getting old, so I bought a new model. That did not improve the situation at all. We have to turn down the volume so much at night because of the static that we can't hear our son crying. I'm giving up on this monitor. I would only recommend this monitor if you live in a rural area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Money","review":"As most of the reviews here say, mine too had lots of statics and was noisy. For a little more money I bought a \\"first years\\" one and it was a world of difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off fine but don't let that fool you!!","review":"After reading the reviews for this monitor, I registered for it anyway. Several people wrote things like \\"Has some static but what monitor doesn't?\\"... I should have known right then I was in for trouble. We've had the monitor for 10 months now and it was fine at first but the longer we used it the more static it had. I went online and read the manual over and over to try and troubleshoot where my problem was. I tried EVERYTHING it suggested to no avail. In the last month the static has become so unbearable that I had the volume almost all the way down and I could bearly hear my daughter and I could STILL hear the static!! I went out and bought the Safety 1st Soft Glow monitor because all the reviews had 5 stars and now I know why - IT'S GREAT! It is so silent. I'd say go for that one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"I was given this as a baby shower gift. Its reception is HORRIBLE! All I can hear is static, no matter what channel I use or where I place it in my house!! The static is so loud, you can barely hear the baby. Also the on/off switch is impossible to use. I am returning this today to try a different brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hear baby over interference.","review":"When I went to the store and saw this monitor, I had remembered buying it for a friend as part of her baby shower gift a few months back. I even recall asking her, after she had her son, if it worked good and she said that yes, it worked just fine. So, I thought, &quot;It's not expensive, it lights up, and it works great. Cool.&quot; So I bought it for myself. When I brought it home and set it up while my 7 month old daughter was sleeping last night, I was surprised that I could hardly hear her breathing over the constant &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZ&quot; sound coming over the monitor. I've tried both channels and have even tried setting it up in different places, but the interference is here to stay. On the box it says that this product has &quot;Crystal Clear Reception&quot;, but I have found that to be very untrue. So now I have to go back to the store and return it. Thank God I kept the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"This monitor got static no matter what channel and where it was in the house. I had it turned down so low I couldn't even hear my son's music right next to it and still got annoying static. Definatly not something you want right next to your head in the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much feedback","review":"I got this monitor because it had two recievers. It has horrible feedback. I didn't have the volume up too high. At times the volume is so bad that you would think aliens were landing. Now we need to try to find a new monitor for our twin girls.Linnea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Features, but Static is a big problem","review":"I've been using this monitor for 21 months now. I love that there are two receivers as I live in a multi-floor home. I love that it has lights to show the decibel levels.What I hate, and the reason I am getting a different monitor for my next baby is the horrible static! I've tried both channels to no avail.I called Fisher-Price. They said it was a problem with the AC adapter. They sent two new ones, but the problem remains. I notice it is much better when on battery power, but this chews through batteries so fast that it's not practical to use batteries all of the time.Overall, I think the monitor is well designed, and sturdy, however I hate having to listen to static every night all night long. Next time I will be trying a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest piece of crap!","review":"I bought this item before I had my daughter thinking it would be a great product. Boy was I WRONG! It hardly ever works on either channel, the static is defening. I have a better chance of hearing my daughter crying without the monitor on. The receivers will work in some rooms but not in other. If I could go back I would definitly pick something else. I am due to have another baby in a few months and I will definitly be buying a different brand of monitor, maybe I will be lucky and get one that works this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static/feedback","review":"I am ready to buy new monitors. Not only have the receivers always had static and feedback but after less than a year use, the one contact for the receiver is bad. Depending on the position of the cord, the receiver disconnects and therefore, is not very helpful in monitoring my son. I really dislike the amount of 'white noise' both receivers produce. We have experimented with moving it to different outlets and different positions in our house and it is NEVER quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static and stopped working after 6 months","review":"I registered for this monitor thinking what could be the difference between this one and the more expensive - as long as you can hear the baby - right. Very wrong - this monitor had so much static it drove my husband and myself crazy. There were nights I had to turn it off to sleep. We tried changing channels, batteries, moving it around - nothing worked. My neighbor had the Sony and after I saw how quiet, the range (reached to my deck from her house accross the street) I went out and purchased it that night. The Sony is great - no problems and I give that 5 stars. I did keep the fisher price as a permanent monitor in several rooms, but found myself carrying the Sony since the static was so annoying on the fisher price AND they seem to have stopped working after about 6 months of use. Don't waste your money or lose any more sleep than you already do with a baby. I gave one star since I liked the dual receivers concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the fuzz!!!!","review":"We put this monitor on our registry and it was one of the first gifts we received. Like some of the other parents have described, there is always lots of static. It has a persistent \\"white noise\\". No matter what channel you choose, there is always static. It picks up every other noise in the house (the dishwasher, the toilet flushing) You name it!!! We can't get a clear, \\"fuzzy-free\\" reception to hear our little girl. Another thing that irritates me are the knobs used to turn the volume up and down. They are not finger-friendly-It is impossible to get a good grip. I would think twice about purchasing this monitor if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"We registered for this & received it at our shower. After setting it up we found there was a LOT of background static. After our son was born we had trouble hearing him over the static & that caused us to turn it up. This only caused MORE static. After 3 days, we took it back & got the Sony &quot;BabyCall&quot; monitor. It was more expensive, but WELL worth it! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality!","review":"We were very disappointed with this monitor. It has a constant background \\"hum\\" that is so loud it is difficult to hear the baby, and distracting when trying to watch TV or sleep. We returned it and bought the Sony 900 mhz, and are very happy with how quiet the Sony is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static","review":"I thought this monitor was pretty good (I've been using it for 12 months now) until I visited a friend in Colorado. Her monitor (First Years) was so silent I had to check over and over that they were on. That doesn't happen with these \\"Sound n Lights\\" monitors, there's so much static I always know they're on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a month","review":"The monitors were great when they were first purchased but after a month all we could pick up was static. We have moved the monitors from room to room, put them in different positions and still all we get is static, we can't even hear our baby when he cries. Eventually the static goes away and all you constantly hear is an annoying buzzing noise. I would recommend a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Items were not the ones shown in the picture, disappointed","review":"Promptly shipment but items received do not like the picture shown in the web site which has a hen chicken shown on the top.

Enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on keeping your word","review":"I read this book after picking it up at a garage sale a long time ago. It is an excellent book on the key things that sales people struggle with. How do I sell without lying? How do I keep integrity with what I say I will do when there are other factors out of my control? etc etc.It has a couple key stories that really make it worthwhile to me....paying back your debts, allowing your integrity to sell your service/product, and in general focusing on how integrity can make things happen.No question i found the book very insightful and reinforced things, that may be quaint, but are obviously hard to follow when you look around at your peers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be better to take integrity lessons from Ken Lay","review":"Saw Karl Eller speak in January on entrepreneurship.

He invited investment opportunities and I approached him after the session. He invited me to send him my business plan, which he would review. I promptly did so and heard no response from him for a number of weeks. I then followed up with a number of emails, all with read receipts simply asking for acknowledgement that he received the plan or to be referred on to someone else who may be interested. Initial emails were never responded to; concurrent emails with receipts were deleted without being read.If this is integrity in business communications, especially to a fellow entrepreneur, perhaps the concept is best left described by an individual more familiar with the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong color","review":"The Jug is very nice but I orded black not blue, did NOT get what I requested.

It has internal pockets for SD cards and cases, and very soft padding for the camera itself. It features a handy belt loop that keeps it near to hand at all times.

It played the same songs over and over in the same order and did not play all songs. We contacted Samsung in search of a solution for the malfunction but could not get support. Sent the T10 back and bought the YP-S5J which daughter thought was even cooler because of the speakers. It has the same random/shuffle malfunction.

It makes for a great traveling alarm clock. You can wake up to one of your favorite songs, and it stores up to five seperate alarms. Battery life on the device is excellent. This is the best MP3 player I have ever owned. The only complaint I have, and it is really minor, is that there is no menu option for viewing the clock outside of the settings menu.

With modern day sensibilities and some really likeable child stars you say? Aye Aye I say.Pirate Kids operates under some very different pretenses. The movie is not a swashbuckling high seas adventure in any sense. It's not a rollicking ride filled with explosions and death at every turn. It doesn't take place in olden times like so many of this genre.It DOES however deliver on a very inventive treasure hunt with villains of a caliber more akin to that of a cheesy Disney movie than that of a serious swashbuckling adventure. It also has lots of heart, and tons of fun along the way.

I still had problems with the dialogue and use of ellipses - a common issue through her books - but I liked the story and how this story not only had Native Americans, but Chinese, and the main character Amelia spends some of her time in China after being kidnapped. However, Ms. Edwards should have done some more research because while overall the China parts were fun to read, I could tell that Ms. Edwards did a minimal amount of research for this. Still, it's one of the more interesting Savage books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth my .50 cents","review":"I hate to say this because I love Cassie Edwards' books, but this one was so bad.

I'm 25 and I know I have to accept that all action movies are designed to satisfy the mind of a 15-year-old (even if the young dudes aren't allowed to watch the gore-fest in the theater), so I didn't ask no questions about the stupidity of the military tactics, the spaceship-destroyer bug spit, how the irrational (with the exception of the brainy big fat one) alien bugs sent an asteroid to earth and about so many other laughable things in the plot. I just accepted the absurd but highly enjoyable universe of \\"Troopers\\" the way it was and I had a great time! I can't give 5 stars because that is the rating of the great serious movies of sci-fi, like 2001 and Solaris. \\"Troopers\\" is a guilty pleasure!

I was overwhelmed by the eye-candy, giggled a bit at the stupid and obvious irony of it all. I'm actually a bit angry at myself since I found this movie so entertaining. I usually have much better tastes.This movie is either the work of genious or plain stupidity. But I didn't care, since watching the heroic efforts of our star carve a hole in the back of a giant acid spitting bug and throwing a gernade into its body cavity to explode green goo everywhere is just good enough.This highly imaginative dribble has nothing really to do with the book. But it's one of those DVDs you find yourself doing frame-by-frame replays (for the 8th time). A must own DVD that really shows you what the technology is capable of. Watch it while your face is 1 foot from a 21\\" PC monitor and you'll be blown away.Did I mention that I hate this movie?G."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick, although not true to book","review":"This is a pretty good movie, it's exciting, easy on the eyes and has a decent plot. It's based loosely on the book although the movie can't really decide whether it wants to be inspiring like the book or a satire on war. Some reviewers have suggested that the book is like this which I completely disagree with. In my opinion this movie turned out a lot like director Verhoeven's Total Recall -- it started out as a serious, intellectual movie but as work on the movie progressed, the special effects took over and the acting [was bad], so they made it seem like they meant to do that. And like Total Recall, they pulled it off. Overall it's a decent flick but completely different in tone and purpose than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be seen a few times...","review":"I hated this movie the first couple of times I watched it, but the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. It's got evrything that makes a good sci fi action flick. Giant bugs, big starships, big guns, legions of troops, etc. The plot seems really weak at first, but after a few viewings, the plot seems more sound. All in all this is a pretty goofy film, but it is a lot of fun to watch. One warning though, this is an excessively violent film with lots of blood and gore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well underrated","review":"I admit the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was really stupid and a really bad adaptation of the classic Heinlein novel. But now that I've re-watched this movie a couple times, I gotta admit that it's a pretty good flick. Yes, it's mindless and features pretty boys/girls with perfect bodies. But there's a lot of social commentary in there and the technology was pretty revolutionary for its time. If you turn your brain down a bit and just enjoy, it's a pretty fun way to spend 90 minutes or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great special effects, Horrible acting and story line.","review":"The story stinks but it has the best special effects I've everseen.

Anyone who expects a moral lesson from the film will be disapointed: it's just about killing the enemy. Hence, the film includes much violence.The director has tried to bring some finer points across, though. To those who care to look a little bit deeper it will become evident that the government and the army aren't really the \\"good guys\\". In facts they are portrayed as fascists - evident for example from the soldiers' unfiforms which are nearly an exact replica of German uniforms during WW2. The stylized symbol of Earth Government also looks suspiciously similar to Germany's imperial eagle. But I guess such points are lost on 99% of the American audience (see the reviews above)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the five stupidest movies of all time.","review":"(I was so aggravated the first time I submitted this, I forgot to set the stars!)This movie ranks as one of the worst movies in history. Its fans will tell you that it is satire, but satire requires a minimum of intelligence in execution. This atrocity appears to have been created by folks without a thought to call their own. Any story requires at least some level of suspension of disbelief. The only way one can manage that with this movie is through braindeath. I know, lets all stand in a circle and fire our automatic weapons inward. Yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have movie for sci-fi fans","review":"The few connections to Heinlein's book were well done (the political idea that citizenship should be earned, not doled out based on where you happen to be born; the lack of body image taboos...). I've read all but a couple of Heinlein's oldest works, and where the movie exerted some effort it did a fair job of representing his views.But the movie doesn't really connect to the book very much, does it? What this movie is, is a Die Hard-esque romp through space with lots and lots of action, some overacting worthy of Shatner and Takei, and heroism like you'd see in a comic book. Fun, lot's of fun.My only quibble is with the choice of what scenes to delete. The DVD's deleted scenes included two Carmen scenes (one with Rico, another with the pretty-boy pilot) that added some depth to her character, and would have changed the audience's reaction when she got in trouble later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminal","review":"A tolerable action movie worth viewing once. Otherwise it just goes to promogate the myth that Heinlein was a facist. For someone who has read the book, the director either refuses to get Heinlein's point due to personal issues on the subject matter or he is a truly dense individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bomb","review":"Starship Troopers is by far the worst movie created in the history of movie making. The blood and guts aren't needed, along with Casper Van Dien. The only decent scene is when Dina Meyer is naked. Verhoeven did well with Robocop and Total Recall, but this is by far going to be the worst movie of his career. When Verhoeven wrote this, he did to make a few extra bucks, to make a story with his extentious use of special effects. Think of the plot. We go to war with bugs who are smarter than us. Instead of killing them with bombs, we decide to exterminate them with, uh oh, a machine gun. In the future, I hope by the time we reach the capability that they had in space travel, that we will have a better weapon than a machine gun. I'm surprised Verhoeven didn't try to use insect killer. Maybe he should of called the exterminator. Maybe I should call the exterminator on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but cheese","review":"I serioulsly don't understand how anyone, specifically a previous reviewer, can say that this is the \\"most realistic sci-fi\\" they're ever seen. The whole permise is so stupid and unrealistic that i couldn't get past the first half without rolling my eyes many times over. Seriously, if we had ships that could reach other worlds and far more advanced technology than we do today, we would never send in a single troop to fight these things. All we'd do is send a few automated ships (no need for pilots) out there to drop a few massive nukes and we'd kill all traces of life on the planet within seconds. there'd be no need for a single person to die. dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic movie","review":"Many people hate this movie because it is not accurately based on Robert A. Heinlein's famous book. Frankly, I'm glad it's not because I found his book incredibly boring. The movie was much more interesting.As for the Nazi references such as Carl's uniform: Do people really think that a director born in Europe and BOMBED by the Nazis would support them? The point he was trying to make was that democracy had failed, and they now lived in a \\"perfect\\" society governed strictly by the military.Definitely worth your buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad.....","review":"Its too bad that the director and producer couldn't bring themselves to follow the book, or give this film a differant name. Under a differant name this film may have garnered 4 stars, but as an \\"adaptation\\" of Heinlein's book, it is pretty sad. It's too bad, properly done it could be another Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray version does not play even with external memory, ok on PS3 and PC","review":"The two stars reflect the quality of the Blu-ray disc, not the movie itself, which I like.What kind of dumb arse made this disc? I can't believe it's actually a disc from Sony, the originator of the BD format. Do NOT buy the Blu-ray disc! It won't play in any BD player (even the newest ones), although some have had luck getting it to play with external memory (USB flash drive or SD card, 2GB or less) plugged in. I can't get it to play on any of my latest BD players, even with memory plugged in. This just sucks big time. Should have stuck with the DVD format.UPDATE: After writing the above it occured to me to try playing it on my PS3 and Sony BD-equipped PC. Voila, it played fine on both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb meet dumber","review":"While the film may share a title and character names with a great novel that is about as far as it goes. One could easily have simply titled \\"Dude wheres my car\\" as Starship troopers and come up with the same results. Only the film Dude wheres my car has better acting, better directing, better screen writing, and an ability to hold the attention of the audience that this film just does not have.One could only hope for a real zombie Apocalypse so that Heinlein might visit the director and exact his vengeance upon him.

But what do you expect from a director who once famously stated: That he, and some of the reviewers here, try to defend this turkey on the basis that it is a work of satirical genius is laughable. I agree totally that Heinlein must be spinning in his grave, and that Verhoeven, if he ever bothered to read the novel at all, failed utterly to understand it's meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars For Dina Meyer in the Shower.","review":"You people giving this a lengthy and thoughtful review have too much time on your hands. This film? Jocks in space. Sci-Fi for dummies. Hokey special effects. Melrose Place level acting. Dougie Howser in space. Denise Richards looks great. But after watching this it occured to me that that is what she is really famous for... but she is not in the shower scene that everyone was buzzing about either. This is a silly film about earth in the future having to send the military into space to fight giant arachnids that want to snack on homo sapiens. It plays like a tv movie right from the start with a little bit of nudity and extra gore thrown in. But essentially this is a guilty pleasure that will never be in the same category as Star Wars or ET."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raunchy and Gross","review":"Definitely not for the squeamish and not too much in common with the book. I don't really like Caspar Van Diem. He looks too pretty to be playing a soldier and seems more suited for a Soap Opera. Denise Richard gets her start here, but she did not seem right for the role either.It seemed like very poor casting all around, even if Doogie Howser is in the movie. None of the characters had any on-screen chemistry. And the whole look to the movie is a bad cross between Dune and Beverly Hills 90210. Yuck. The only real character I liked was the female commander.Even worse than the bad sci-fi/high school crossover theme in the film was all the goriness. It was simply just gross. I know the bugs are meant to be horrible man-killing beasts, but we could have done without the extra goop.Skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody Allen did it better","review":"Let me start by saying that I am one of those folks who read (and loved) Heinlein's book, and believe that there should be truth in advertising. Other than the title and the names of the characters, any relation to the book is purely accidental. I have read the reviews which praise this dreck as high satire and a dark look at a fascist future. The book, which this stole the title from, is a completely different story which deals with honor, civic responsibility, and maturity. The best comparison I can make is that this reminds me of Woody Allen's \\"What's Up Tiger Lily?\\" when he took a Japanese spy movie and dubbed it in English with no connection to the original plot. Entertaining - but no one walked away feeling they had been given a high-tech bait and switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dog of epic proportions","review":"That this movie even has the same title as the great book is in bad taste.

Send more ships into orbit (where they're promptly picked-off left-and-right), and send in ground troops again!

My daughter ( age 12) had just finished reading the book. I had also read the book to my son ( age 9). Both had liked the story and wanted to see the movie. We did and walked out in horror. Nothing in this movie is right! The troops in the book had full combat suits. The soldiers in this movie had about as much armor as a policeman. The tactics in the book were fast in/out types. In the movie they acted more like they were playing capture the flag. Finally the whole lesson of citizenship and honor were plowed under. I love the book and have an insane hope that someone will make a movie of it that focuses on the story, not the effects. In movies like Star Wars and Aliens the effects were good, but the story is what made them special.I cared about Luke or Ridley. This movie just trashes the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starship troopers excels at many different levels","review":"Paul Verhoeven has managed to take a classic Sci-Fi masterpiece and make it better. his screen version hits us at different levels. First it is an action picture of massive dimensions, utilizing state of the art special effects to make the \\"bugs\\" incredibly real and dangerous. However, on another level, Verhoeven shows us how easily young people can be \\"brainwashed\\", so to speak, into accepting Fascism as the normal state of being. The whole movie is a primer on how nations have brainwashed their population into sacrificing themselves for the state.

The special effects do deserve a thumbs up as does the concept of this future earth - the propaganda videos are actually quite interesting.

But all the humans in this film are members of Nazi society who are brainwashed into killing aliens. We can't relate to these people, or care about them - it's hard to even like them; so enjoying the movie is a struggle. To make things worse, the main characters are hammy, and given a feeble plot (I suspect deliberately so, to emphasise the satire).What this boils down to is a retrospectively amusing 90 minute satirical statement about Nazis and propaganda. But I found it impossible to enjoy as a film because of the lack of the key elements that any good film must have. The only people I can imagine liking this are people who enjoy CGI and don't care about characters (the very same people who like Star Wars Episode I)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book","review":"I first read \\"SST\\" in grade school, not so many years after the book was published. I loved the book then and love it now. But I cannot say the same of the movie. A great many Heinlein and SF devotees eagerly awaited the film based on the naive expectation that the movie would resemble the book. But the director said publicly after reading all of 40 pages, \\"This is not the film I want to make.\\" Well, he should have made something else.It's regrettable that Heinlein's estate signed with Verhoeven. Apart from the near absence of the book's philosophical basis, much of the \\"factual\\" aspects are lacking: Skinnies are absent; Bugs excrete their own highspeed plasma (or something) into space; no bio-mechanicals; on & on.Despite the many lapses, this is an enjoyable film to watch. By that, I mean \\"To Look At.\\" The leading characters are extremely cinematic; Denise Richards is an absolute Babe; Caspar gets girls glassy-eyed.And that's about all you can say for SST: The Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low level sci-fi soap opera !","review":"I am a fan of independent movies .

If there is a story, it's a very understated one, but the move is \\"colorful\\" and mildly entertaining. The FX are mind boggling, but the \\"feel\\" of th movie was too idiotic for me to give it more than 1 star, but the fact that Dina Meyer and Denise Richards were in it makes the movie watchable. Other than that, the movie was bad in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effects/picture, bizarre script","review":"I must confess I didn't read the 500+ reviews here, but of those I read, many saw the blithely fascistic tone of the film as being \\"ironic,\\" \\"subversive,\\" etc. I must have missed something. At first I assumed that the cheerful retro-50s propaganda commercial that begins this film was intended as sarcasm. However, everything that occurs in the film supports the goofy value system portrayed, and nothing contradicts it, except for the one kid's parents, who are killed - apparently as a result of their \\"unpatriotic\\" attitude.If there's anything subtle about this film, it's buried under so much gore and jingoistic blather that it's completely unrecognizable. What's left is an ugly film that does nothing to indicate there's anything wrong with the world view that Heinlein's book apparently satirized. I would never let an impressionable child see this sickening film."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL movie\`","review":"I am a devoted science fiction fan, and, having read the book twice, I can say that this is a TERRIBLE movie. The attitude of the army is quite the opposite of the attitude of Heinlein's army. The powered armor is missing, the troops disobey orders on a whim (Which Heinlein's army NEVER would've done), and the main character's friends mostly survive to the end! Do NOT see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a dead Melrose Place Star is a good Melrose Place Star","review":"This movie is probably the dumbest one of all time, well perhaps Rambo III and Godzilla are even worse .... And this outer-space trash from the director of two science-fiction cult classics called \\"Robocop\\" and \\"Total Recall\\". Verhoeven should be ashamed of having directed this nonsense. And to say one or two words about the \\"cast\\" I can only add to my embarassment that this movie contains no acting at all. The only good scenes throughout the movie are the ones\` when these awful \\"Beverly Hills\\"-teenagers are torn apart by the bugs, Hurray ....! Even the climax doesn\`t work ..... Everyone who calls this movie a masterpiece deserves to be eaten by an alien-bug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the Original Book","review":"This movie doesn't do justice to the original book written by: Robert Heinlein.

I'd rather read the original book, not the screenplay movie book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad movie","review":"This movie is not a glorification of fascism or brutality, although it often invokes people to think so. It is a call against both and shows how tight the line is between patriotism and fascism. Perhaps some of those criticizing it so harshly should compare its storyline to the not-so-long-ago McCarthy era: the bad are always on the other side, they eat children and we are the best and the brightest, what we do is only for a good cause.

Overall, this flick was predictable, and had it not been filled with \\"eye candy\\", I most likely would have died from boredom by the time the sappy characters all enlisted to save the world.

If you like gore and violence this is the movie for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good FX bad everything else...","review":"The graphics were great. But my problem is the tactics that were invloved. The ONE and only scene where the humans use air attack they obliderate the bugs, and the rest of the movie they (humans) use ground attacks and just get killed. Would a real army use no air warfare. I don't think so!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult, or a very bad joke?","review":"Why is it, when films like \\"Resevoir Dogs\\" are protested against and often band, that a truely offensive artical such as this is allowed full acess by the public? How can anyone actually enthisise with the society that the \\"Starship Troopers\\" strive to protect? A facist state which is glorified by bands and explosions and flat dialouge special effects epic. If the director was actually intending to paint such a lush picture of brutal dictatorship or not, that's how it comes across. This is like a version of the Dirty Dozen made by Hitler. On a technical level, the film only achieves one interesting feat. It makes you sympathise with a giant insect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fi at it's worst","review":"Most of the people up the top who have reviewed this vile, idiotic piece of crap don't know what real Science Fiction is. This film is corny and contains plenty of gags.A couple of adults in their early 20's attend a large war of man vs. insect and the results are beyond appalling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein spins in his grave, but that's OK!!","review":"The movie bears little resemblance to Robert A. Heinlein's classic book. But that's OK, because director Paul Verhoeven finds more creative ways to gruesomely kill people than in this movie than in any other movie I've seen. Bloody, intense fun! Those people who complain about the obliteration of RAH's admittedly contoversial political philosophy missed the point of this film. Verhoeven never said he wanted to pontificate about future society...he just wanted to impale people really good!!! Oh yeah, and about the removal of the robotic suits Heinlein fans seem so obsessed about: Verhoeven ditched the robo-armor because the special effects required would double the cost of the film. In my opinion, concentrating on the bug effects was the right way to go. Go ahead and see this movie, but leave the kids at home. Definitely worth renting, to buy it is up to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good specials effects but no more","review":"The visuals effects made by industrial light & magic are excellent but the script is so simple that fall down in the middle of the story. The actors are pretty bad and the direction is not under control. Well, if you are a fan of the specials effects, you will enjoy but if you are a person who like a movie with a good story, you will hate that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low for bad films","review":"This abomination of a movie will forever be my personal benchmark for determining rock-bottom, lame, movie making. A laugable plot coupled with grammer school level acting. If ever there was a candidate for being the poster boy of bad cinema this one's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"90210 Goes to War!","review":"This is one of those films that plays better on video (or in this case, DVD) than it did at the movie. The novel by Heinlein was much better, but it was written back in the 1950s, so Verhoven did need to update it for the 1990s. The DVD version is quite clean and has some nice extra features.Interesting aside: I used to babysit Anthony Ruivivar (when he was about six years old) who plays Shishumi. He's the first soldier to get killed by the bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic acting with too much gore and violence","review":"The camera views are horid, the special effects too overdone, the actors are practically reading their lines. Only children might think it real, however it has far too much violence, blood and gore to be acceptable material for any younger viewing audience. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven protect us from Verhoeven!","review":"Woodenly acted, the model mannequins have escaped from Baywatch and put on space-suits. I challenge anyone to care about the characters, including the actors portraying the roles. There was no commitment from anyone, with the possible exception of the CGI artists, who obviously spent a lot of time on this film - possibly to put together a portfolio reel. I'm not even sure Verhoeven cared, since the sense I got from the film was he was completing a three-picture contract deal by going half-hearted at this one.There are any number of really good science fiction flicks out there that examine the heroism, god, and country attitude missing from this dud. I suggest passing over this one in the vid-store, and changing the channel if it ever appears on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guts, blood and bugs","review":"A good film will never take itself too seriously. A good film will remind you that you are watching a film, not a slice of reality. In most respects, this makes it all the more fun to watch. Troopers is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek.Troopers never, ever, ever takes itself seriously. And it does it well. It's funny because it's ridiculous, because it's so... gross. You feel for the characters because they're so blatantly two-dimensional. You care about them.I mean, come on. Massive bugs that want to destroy humanity? Hardly an original set-up for a film. Throw in some megabudget CGI, some rather weak actors, a shower scene and LOTS of fake blood, this could have been a huge flop. But because it was tongue-in-cheek all the way through, because it acknowledged its own absurdity, Troopers has become a cult classic. Even if nobody 'gets' the satirical undertones, it's a fun film that's fun to watch, with lots of nice gory action sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful (or should I say \\"offal\\")","review":"I am an admirer of the Heinlein novel and Verhoeven's ROBOCOP, but I was utterly disappointed with this movie. I expected to at least enjoy it on it's \\"entertainment\\" factor, alas, there wasn't one. Being quite a cinema-lover, I was surprised to find no value at all in this work, and I would rate it a \\"0\\" if that were an option. If you want entertainment, see LOST IN SPACE instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascist or patriotic? Regardless, it was PUKEY BAD!","review":"Plot: bad. Dialog: bad. Believability: bad. Acting: tolerable. Redeeming qualities: none. If I could give this movie a zero-star rating, I would. I'm usually a fan of science fiction movies, even the mediocre ones, but I found myself actively mocking the screen after mere minutes. The characters were paper-thin, the message was indecipherable, and the plot was laughable. Infantry with bullets against a torrent of virtually-unkillable aliens? Butt-blowing bug baddies whose comet-like projectiles escape the planet's gravity well and knock out huge battleships? Gimme a break! How many dismemberments do we really need to see, anyway? The cheese-factor was too much for me, and I'm from Wisconsin, the Dairy State! And how come the residents of Buenos Aires were so...so...white? RA Heinlein, the author of the book upon which this trash was (loosely) based, must be spinning in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"The combat strategy makes no sense!","review":"The best part of this movie was the shower scene! Who in their right mind would send Infantry troops into hard-to-hand combat with the superior-sized bugs. That's what artillery, smart bombs, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons are for. A needless waste of lives, done only to maximize the gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effects, non-existent story line, plot for pre-teens","review":"I hated this movie, and I really like science-fiction and visual effects. It is horribly incongruous to show huge, sophisticated space ships far in the future, then show men fighting giant spiders with guns that appear to have the power of .22 rifles. It takes hundreds of shots to kill the spiders, which mean humans get ripped up a lot in this film. I was also irritated at the adolescent jump to nude shower seens, idiotic story line of love between soldiers, plastic one-dimensional characters. Some folks here have written glowing, five-star reviews of this movie...there's no accounting for taste, as they say, but they must be pre-teenagers who were drunk when they saw the movie, jumping up and yelling with glee as someone's arm got torn off and blood went everywhere. This is only the second of hundreds of videos I've rented that I turned off the video before finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A likely candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000.","review":"A sci-fi thriller of ugly bad actors, exterminating BUGS. A graphic VOMIT scene will send this film across the room, hitting the wall with a shaterring bang. A few decapitations here and there, people being spliced in half. I hate when films compare themselves with Star Wars. Leave Star Wars alone, and go to acting school. I can't wait to see this film on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I compare this film with SPACE MUTINY-:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected gold, got lead","review":"How truly, truly disappointing. I thought I would be watching an intelligent look at war in space and all I got was a smorgasbord of squished bugs and stupid people. Some folks actually seem impressed with the so-called antiwar message of the film, which is about as subtle and convincing as Marvel comics trying to teach philosophy with the Incredible Hulk. Putrid crap, from a director who ought to know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very, very bad...","review":"If you're hoping for anything like the classic novel, skip this turkey. It can't decide if it wants to be slapstick, satire or gung-ho. The acting is dreadful, the writing is worse. Skip it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book!!!!!","review":"As a generic \\"mean soldiers kill nasty alien bugs movie\\", this is at best okay (on a good day if you had a couple of beers). The book is a thousand times better. Heinlein beautifully weaves the growth of a boy into a man and soldier, with great action and a healthy dose of political philosophy, into a classic tale that leaves you thinking. It is a book you can re-read forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just hilarious","review":"First, take a look at Malachi's extremely funny review, I enjoyed it almost as much as the movie. The ironic attitude in this film is quite overwhelming; if you don't get it, you might end up not liking the film. But, anyone with a sense of humour and an IQ above 15 should be really entertained!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPERBIT DVDS ARE A RIP-OFF","review":"I did not notice any improvement with this superbit version of Starship Troopers.

Buy regular dvds instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play without memory card- and an editing error","review":"As many reviews have already pointed out, this U.S. region 1(A) blu-ray will not play without the addition of an SD memory card.

Send in my new disc with all the packaging, and receive a new disc with all the packaging. The let down occured when the customer service person could not tell me the replacement disc would play without additional external memory, or even that the editing problem (reported to be during the outpost battle scene) has been fixed. I for one do not have a memory card lying around that I can insert into my player just to watch this movie. Time to punt.

Either way I do not have a way to view this film in blue ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Movie.","review":"I really do love this movie. I think Starship Troopers is a great action packed movie. I thought the movie had an interesting idea instead of blowing up a major city such as London or New York, they picked Buenos Aires. The storyline was interesting it was about a bug race trying to eliminate us. This movie released in 1997 grossed 54 million dollars and it cost 95 million to make. This is a violent film and has sexuality in it. It is not recommended for children. The DVD is good but it should be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Starship Troopers was one of my favorite books from High School and I was looking forward to the movie. This has got to be the worse adaption of a Sci-fi book since David Lynch's butchering of Dune.God, where to start? A B-list cast of no talent mannequins, satrirical commercials that are a rip off from Robocop, but seem jarringly out of place, an awful script (yeah right, bug farts from a planet light years away cause an asteroid to destroy Brazil), and a futuristic army that basically isn't any better armed (or armoured) than any 20th century third world nation.The bugs are cool, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinlein would cry if he saw this.","review":"This movie is based...loosely...on the great science fiction novel of the same name written by Robert Heinlein. The book is an all time sci-fi classic about honor, politics, government, and personal struggle. The movie is a \\"90210\\" type parody of this great work. The movie is technically fine, with good special effects and plenty of gore. The story in the movie is silly and soap opera compared to the book. The movie is a waste of your time if you are looking for the great substance science fiction is capable of. If you want blood, gore, brief nudity...then have at the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out For Blu Ray Version","review":"I very much enjoyed this movie, and even more so enjoyed Heinlein's book.

I'd like to think that if we can transport troops to other planets, we could arm them with something better than 1970's vintage 5.56 rifle. And, maybe arrange for a few mortars or artillery.

Otherwise, a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars For The Eye Candy","review":"The rest of the movie needed some help. By all means READ THE BOOK.

Second, the Action is non-stop and interesting. Third, Denise Richards. Fourth, the story is a thinly veiled political farce. Five, the bugs are great. And did I mention, Denise Richards?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good special effects, but bland acting","review":"This movie bored me pretty quickly. The fighting scenes were a little drawn out, & too fake-gory to take too seriously. Not to mention some actors (AHEM, denise richards) need some acting lessons. It's got something for everyone I guess. Special effects I suppose would be the only saving grace, cuz the story line is pretty boring & predictable. Good looking cast for members of the opposite sex to both drool over (if you like the totally fake pretty ditsy types anyway), & at least Casper Van Dien's character did it some justice. I got most frustrated in some scenes where some of the characters should've died a LONG time ago, yet somehow nothing happens to them (ahem, denise richards). Ya, so movies aren't supposed to be realistic, but c'mon!! Worth watching for the fighting scenes, but everything in between, you're not missing much by doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action and violence packed science fiction","review":"If you go for action and violence you'll probably like this movie.

This is one of the most violent popular movies I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did They Read The Book?","review":"\\"What was that?\\" My exact words after leaving the theater after sitting through Starship Troopers. I don't know if the writers actually read the book, or just pulled a few character names out and threw something together after reading the back.Sure, if I hadn't read the book, this would have been a fine action movie, but I ruined it for myself and read Starship Troopers before seeing the movie. Whereas the book can be set alongside the same lines as \\"All Quiet on The Western Front,\\" with feelings of nationalism and the \\"War is Hell\\" oddessy; the movie pretty much was Rambo with a bigger cast.If you're looking for a decent action movie, this is it. However if you've read the book...you are in for a REAL dissapointment. If you want a less tacky \\"War is Hell\\" I'll recremend \\"All Quiet on The Western Front,\\" better script...I can't say anything about the actors because I'm sure they did the best they could with the materiel they had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verhoeven shows no respect for a great story.","review":"It is apparent that the director, Paul Verhoeven, has little respect for Robert Heinlein. He butchered a great and controversial story, and left us with a disaster of a film. Please don't bother watching this film. I do encourage you to read the book by Robert Heinlein. Even if one doesn't agree with Heinlein, he does cause the reader to think deeply about important matters, such as, \\"What is a just society.\\"Verhoeven's film doesn't encourage one to think. I wonder if Verhoeven read the book since the story in the film bears little resemblance to Heinlein's novel. For example, Heinlein valued public service. I can't tell what Verhoeven values except for indulgence.I would give this less than one star if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally Lost in Space","review":"I'm amused by all the four & five stars. You people are more entertaining than the movie. I'll just get some popcorn and read over 300-some \\"starry-eyed\\" reviews.

However, amazing special effects can't save what is a pretty awful movie. I won't go into the plot because it isn't worth it. It's just stupid. The acting is pathetic. Sitting through the entire 2+ hours of this movie was a test of endurance for me.This movie was major disappointment, especially given the very favorable reviews I've read on Amazon.

The book follows the career of a soldier in the future and examines the true nature of what it means to be a soldier. The description of a soldier's thoughts, feelings, actions, and motivations are as true now as they were in Heilein's time and as they will be in the future. This book was placed on the secretary of the army's suggested reading list for junior officers not because it is an exciting science fiction novel (although it is) but because of how accurately it portray's the life of a young military leader. The movie is fun and worth watching but the screenplay writers completely missed the point. Do yourself a favor and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan 9 was better!","review":"This is about as bad a movie as I have ever seen, there are some who say we are missing the point, that this is supposed to be satirical, but it is hard to get to the point with such a horrid plot and acting.

I saw it as a good adaptation of an excellent book. The satire not as satire at all. Propaganda you know is propaganda is its own satire. The militaristic future of Robert A wasn't one at all. In his army EVERYBODY fought. In his democracy you appreciated democracy because you had to pay a price. In his war you fought for a cause that mattered.There is more military tyranny in Halo than in the world of Starship Troops.And again, propaganda is its own satire. You cannot do it without being faintly ridiculous.I always thought that Heinlein's world would work. Today's US is bankrupt paying for mercenaries and bases in 150 nations.

Twenty-some years later, a Luke Skywalker wannabe, named Caspar, played a role in the worst Sci fi film ever made. When movies compare themselves to Star Wars, they open up a can of jellied whoop a**. Independence Day is the movie that got away with it. Starship Troopers (aka. Bug Squadron) doesn't even come close. One thing comes to mind when viewing this film- \\"Who---what---where----when????\\" and \\"Huh?!?\\". The movie tried to butch up by showing some ugly a** nude scenes, and a gross-out vomit scene (or chunky beef soup and soda pop being spat out) Some movies inspire us to make our own movies; this one inspires me to make my own gravy."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Melrose Place in Space with a few bugs'","review":"I watched this movie expecting a good action movie, with good special effects.

The special effects ARE good and therein lies the problem. Typical of today's films, special effects are apparently the only ingredient needed for a \\"entertaining\\" movie. It's unfortunate that the movie going public has little regard for character development, plot, crisp dialogue and texture in a film. \\"Starship Troopers\\" has none of these.I'M thinking of becoming a director because the public is so easily entertained these days. Can you imagine Alfred Hitchcok, John Ford or William Wyler with todays technology? They would all realize that story and script all still the most important components of a film- NOT computers. \\"Starship Troopers\\" is a glaring example of the lack of talent in Hollywood. Come on public, be a little more choosey! And Hollywood, please. there are people OVER 12 years old that enjoy going to the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people won't get it","review":"I heard (from some sci-fi fans, even) about how bad the Starship Troopers movie is. Bad acting, they sneered. Goes overboard on the violence, they said. Fascist message, they claimed. That's the whole point. Verhoven takes Heinlein's gung-ho novel and turns it into a propaganda film. The vapid, plastic, 90210 characters -- who were raised in a militarized society -- spout stupid, silly lines about guts and glory. Meanwhile, Verhoven gives the audience a (science-fictionalized) taste of what war is really like: Yes, the ultraviolent battle scenes will make you sick. This ain't Star Wars. Perhaps more Saving Private Ryan meets A Clockwork Orange meets ... uh, Star Wars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great effects, minimal plot, little to do with the book","review":"If you rate your movies in buckets of blood like Joe Bob Briggs you'll probably love it.

I'll bet she's kicking herself in the teeth right now for selling the movie rights to one of her late husband's best works ever. Even if all they wanted out of the script was the action they could have at least attempted to show the powered armor that attracted most of us to this book in the first place! As far as the 'anti-war' message of the film--bunk!!! The book was about social and moral responsibility not whether to be a war-monger or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I just don't see the relevance","review":"The first time I saw this I was sort of impressed. You know, the action, the FX, the over-the-top stereotypes put in to provide some kind of moral message. Then someone handed me the book. After that, I saw the movie again just to make sure. Yep, just garbage, and that's putting it lightly. Bad acting, cruddy adaptation of the novel, simple minded moralizing that probably wouldn't convince a hippy of the evils of war. But its relevant, right, since it trashes the military. Ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH, pure and simple","review":"Garbage heap of a movie made by folks who obviously didn't understand a single word in Heinlein's book.

With a silly, downright stupid script, this movie would have been better off if it had never existed. First off, the very idea of the bugs attacking, flying in on humans and sucking their brains out is just too much for a even remotely good movie. The only good part to this movie was the special effects, and even those were mostly super gross-out, gory alien guts fliyng everywhere. Like Saving Private Ryan without a purpose.

Admittedly, the alien animation was great, but the premise of the movie escapes me. Why send in ground troops when they were able to drop bombs from the sky with equal effect? For the action? I suppose so, but then why have the scene where they drop the bombs at all then? And with all of the other technology of the future, I'm supposed to believe their guns would only fire bullets?

One of the last films Paul Verhoeven has done in America, was a good one to be remembered by. He uses a great use of Sci-Fi and propaganda that he was subjected to in his native Holland during WWII, and of course, his good use of gratuitous graphic violence is always a plus. This film also broke ground in the progress of CGI, considering that they had less then half of the overrated Titanic did at only $90 million, it did a great job.Of course the acting feels labored at times, or all the time, and the cast seems like they just came off the set of Beverly Hills 90210, but that's what was intended. It was supposed to be these hot young newcomers, being sent off into a war and environment that they underestimated. \\"Everything is all fun and games until reality comes into play\\"And if you look past the propaganda, and themes of Socialism and the satire of it all, it is still the one of the best Sci-Fi B-Movie made."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a fun movie.","review":"I saw the movie and read the book. I think the movie took about as much as it could from the book. For instance, I don't think the characters could interact very well jumping around in super spacesuits.

The only reason I am giving a 4 star rating is because we didn't get to meet Carmen's twin sisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected....","review":"The book was great, when I heard the movie was coming out, I was jumping for joy. But not when I got into the theater. Where were the space suits and weren't the characters supposed to be Hispanic? I mean common they were recruited in Buenos Aires for crying out loud. And all they seemed to use were infantry...where are the tanks and heavy artillery, it's also the future, shouldn't there have been lasers and particle beams. The reason this movie got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the excellent CGI and gore. Better to buy the book than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and exciting","review":"All you people who did not like this movie should go watch Contact again.

I had read the book and was excited to see the movie. And it was well worth the wait exept for 4 minor details that bring the movie down. The first 2 details is its unfaithfulness to the movie. (1) where were the famous spacesuits from the book? They were a key part of the book and to exclude them was rediculous. (2) The characters were supposed to be hispanic (the earth scenes were in Venezuela). The next 2 faults center on its target audience. The book was intended to be a juvenial adventure but the movie only acted like it was for kids. Schlock-style gore and pointless nudity were definetly unneccesary.

Of course, I have a few questions about \\"Starship Troopers.\\"Was I supposed to root for the neo-fascist society and their complete lack of military, tactical, or common sense? How the $%#*^& did the bugs send asteroids half-way across the galaxy to smash into Earth? Why didn't the humans just nuke the planet from orbit?

They both are supposed to have a message written in blood, but they fail miserably in making any point at all (IMO). No matter what the director says his intentions were, it was obvious to me that he intended only to entertain the male teenage crowd who likes blood, explosions, sex, and nudity.

The feel of the movie, the power of the bugs, the sheer entertainment, all first class. Yes there was frustration with the non - effectiveness of the weaponry, but wasn't that the underlying theme of the first half of the film, how the Arachnids were underestimated ?

This movie gets one star only because I am not allowed to post with a lower rating.This book follows about 70 percent of the plot with less than ten percent of the depth of the characters.

Starship Troopers was one of Heinlein's classic novels that combined great shoot-em-up action with his message about individualism and the role of the state. What the movie delivers is a badly written, amateurishly acted heavy handed attempt at social satire that just doesn't come off. Gone is the first-person perspective of the novel, replaced by a rather impersonal view that leaves you completely indifferent to the fate of the actors involved.More than one person has said the movie should have carried the tag line \\"Adapted from the paperback cover of the novel!\\" and that's about as close as it gets to the original novel. The battle scenes do manage to convey some of the horror of battle, but the bug effects look kind of cheap, the spcaecraft look cheesy and in the end you've got a pretty forgettable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Paul Verhoeven once again shows his incompetence as a director in this gory, tedious and all too predictable sci-fi yawn. The cast looks like something from Beverly Hills 90210 and their acting ability is equally bad. The characters are one-dimensional and boring. The only reason that I give this movie 2 stars is because it does hold some useful warnings against propaganda and glorification of war, which was also present in the Heinleins book.

The human soldiers don't even know how to use tactics, their spaceships don't know the meaning of the word 'dodge' and by the end of the film I feel sorry for the bugs! The whole thing looks like a set up to me by the humans to start a war (but frankly that would give the film some kind of plot). There are no powered-suits, the training camp is a twisted, darker version of the one in the book and the generals in charge seem to forget that the idea is to win the war not just fight it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpler the better, it's all visual.","review":"There are Si-fic movies that have lengthy explanation for how things work and all technical detales. There are Si-fi movies that try to create its own world throughout the movie, which is limited to only 2hrs. The most great si-fi, including Star Wars, Aliens, don't try to explain to much or set rules for that world. Those things, we can get from books. That's what novels are for. Starship Troopers is a great si-fi movie, not because it creates its own world, with lengthy history and explanation for tecnological pregress. It's good, because its simply good for the eyes. FOR YOUR EYES only. Visually, it achieves the level of Star Wars and Alien series.

For complex, and moral, read the book. The film is a piece of trash masquerading as a movie based on a great classic sci fi novel, with flat characters who don't even have enough depth to make you hate them, much less like them. Rating this 1 star because there's no way to rate it lower, don't waste your time with this one, especially if you've read the book it was supposedly based on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mocks the book on which it was based.","review":"This movie is the liberal reaction to the book. This can especially be seen in the short films that litter the story. It makes fun of Heinlein's \\"militarism\\" by turning him into a jingoistic straw-man, following the well worn Hollywood groove of hating the armed forces and pretending that war is a silly game played by overgrown 9 year old boys.Here is a little Latin from Napoleon for you Hollywood:Si vis bellum para pacum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and yourselves!","review":"C'mon guys! This opinion of \\"intellectually silly\\" is really....silly. The idea that if you intentionally make a move so ludicrous that somehow it MUST have an intellectual undertone is insulting to those of us who really do know \\"Intellectual comedy\\"(i.e. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead). The idea that a solar system located about 10,000 light years away can shoot \\"bug bombs\\" acroos the galaxy in a couple of months time is ascenine. Couple that with \\"Melrose Place in Space\\" mentality and you have this...ahem...picture. The only thing missing was Jim Varney (aka Ernest Worl) as \\"Der Fuherer\\"...to make so satrical as to make it intellectually intriguing...yeah, right..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great escapist fare!","review":"This is one of the finest High Adventure films ever made. I was captivated in the first few scenes, and was on the edge of my seat until the closing credits. The monsters are horrific, and still inspire awe and fear, even though I've seen the movie a dozen times. If you love space adventure at its best, this is an excellent movie to purchase. It will continue to satisfy after many viewings. Sure, some aspects are a bit corny, but, for me, that simply adds to the aura of this soon-to-be cult classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It perverts a great novel","review":"Take a classic SF novel and give it to a director and scriptwriter who are both only semi-literate and who have never read any of the literature of science fiction. Add to that the attention span of an MTV junkie and this is what you'd get. All of the thoughtful, introspective parts are left out and there is more violence in the movie than in the original novel. Add to that the idiot depiction of both the training camp and the enemy and you have worthless tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unrealistic","review":"To be perfectly honest, the special effects and sound for the movie was amazing. If it wasnt for that I would have probably tossed the DVD out. I find it kinda a silly movie which ABSOLUTELY 0% portrays the real way the human race would deal with a problem such as that. First of all, we would NEVER attempt to send in troops armed with pretty much water guns against a gigantic insect with jaws that are able to rip apart a tank. Secondly, we would NEVER get rid of air support or tank support and move to just troops. Unless we are fighting chickens with sticks who the heck would send in troops against a big bug? We would carpet bomb, blast the area and pick up scraps later. A bug with a brain would not be the first thing we would care about, we would care about winning and being on top! They could have done a better job with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely awful","review":"No words can explain the disgrace with which this director should feel in the making of such a horrible movie. The original book was excellent, written by an extremely gifted author, Robert Heinlein. The director of this movie has seen fit to completely disrespect Mr. Heinlein by making a movie that is based on the book in title only. I watched this movie in pain and awe at its absurdity. They could have followed the book and made a science fiction movie to rival any that has ever been put out, but instead decided to mutilate this one into oblivion.The people that put this movie together should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been an ok movie","review":"The disappointing thing about this movie is the apparent hostility that the director and screenwriter had for the concepts in the original novel. For them to make a sci-fi action movie giving us their view of the future is one thing. To (apparently) deliberately take another artist's work and distort his vision is entirely another.I often find myself in disagreement with Mr. Heinlein on many issues, but to take his work, deliberately change the message of that work and then use his title in an apparent attempt to capitalize on his reputation is reprehensible and, for me at least, prevents me from enjoying the rather good technical aspects of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 defective copies in a row","review":"I ordered this from Amazon and it would not load. Exchanged it for another copy and the new copy will not load. It starts to load and just stops. I have about 50+ blu-rays and a new Sony player so it's not a matter of needing updates. I received both copies within the last 2 weeks. Anyone else experience this defect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Mr Rico?","review":"Starship Troopers is one of those books I read every year or two, and one of those films I never want to see again. The film omits character development altogether, so you never get to know Juan Rico, the main protagonist of the book, and ignores completely the thrust of the story, which is Mr. Rico's growth from a pup to a leader of men. I was especially bothered by the films cavalier attitude with regard to violence and sexual morality, which were the opposite of what Robert Heinlein's novel depicted -- a futuristic society that goes back to simpler, stricter mores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Its special effects are unrealistic and cheesy. The plot is so thin, it's transparent. I turned it off less than halfway through. I love science fiction and fantasy movies, but this one just isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor military tactics used in film","review":"The military tactics used by the starship troopers are inept and ludicrous. Rather than sending infantry with light caliber machine guns, all that is needed against these bugs is tanks and armored vehicles. Instead of dropping of infantry to fight the bugs the aircraft should strafe and bomb the bugs from above out of reach. Air power could have probably won the whole war. For being a futuristic film, the tactics used are pre-world war I. A few laser guided bombs to the bug holes could wipe out the bugs with no casualties."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"This is literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen. If you like those sci-fi, destrustion-based type movies, watch something else. Even if this fits that description, half of the things in this movie are random events, which make no sense at all. A total piece of crap.This movie falls way, way down there at the bottom of hill just like Mars Attacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unquestionably the worst movie ever made.","review":"The title says it all.This movie is so bad, it actually causes me physicl pain whenever I catch sight of it on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter, Complete, Shameless TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I've heard that Robert Heinlein's wife actually signed over the right to Starship Troopers to Columbia/Tristar Studios when they were looking for an idea for a invading alien movie. I'd love to get my hands on her so I could scream at her for a couple of hours. I hope that she's ashamed of herself!If you haven't seen it, there is another series out based on Heinlein's Starship Troopers. It's done in CGI and actually sticks to the spirit of the story while updating the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lust In Space","review":"\\"Lust in space\\" may have been a better title for this awful movie based on the book by Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein would cringe if he saw this lust story. Because, thats what is it when you get right down to it: a lust story. There's a catfight between the two women in Johnny Rico's life (although the two girls don't fight each other in the physical sense). One girl wants to get laid by Rico before the other girl does. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie, bad, bad, bad.....","review":"This is the kind of movie that gives the film industry - in general, and the science fiction genre - in particular, a bad name. Graphic mutilations, a cliched script, and horrendous acting might be palatable for those who have the lowest of standards, but what about those of us who believe that a movie should be worth watching, and above all, entertaining?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong movie","review":"I had wanted this movie for a long time. It came sealed in plastic. I was really disappointed upon opening the package. Inside the SEALED case was BLAZING SADDLES. Needless to say, I sent it back.

And its a great movie but the disc is junk! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was based on the book.....","review":"Look at the white Johnny Rico....When I heard that ST was being made into a movie I barely contained my excitement. Just think, powered armor, great effects, incredible sound, fascinating story. After ten minutes I thought I was in the wrong theatre. I had a hard time not killing the teenagers behind me who seemed awed by the \\"really deep story.\\" Apparently they have never read the book...or any book for that matter. I don't think this movie could have been worse. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. I guess Hollywood thinks all of us are mindless morons who like flashy lights, things that go boom, and actors (hahaha) we should feel sad for because their hair got out of place. I guess being \\"snooty\\" is expecting Hollywood to make an intelligent film based on an intelligent book. Independence Day was the movie to not think and just have fun. ST was the movie to show the world that most of the best SF was written in the 40's - 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Book, Movie/Video missed the whole point.","review":"The book presented a realistic soldier's life, in a future where one earns one's citizenship by serving the Government, in either a military or civilian capacity. Part of the impact of the book, is that, not until the very end, does the reader learn that the protagonist is Filipino. In the film, while this surprise identity would be difficult to conceal, the protagonist has been changed to a blued-eyed Anglo type, in the Hollywood tradition. The film is not science fiction. It is pure camp, fraught with cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I hadn't read the book.","review":"I had been wishing for a long time that someone would film a version of \\"Starship Troopers\\" that would do justice to the original book. I'm still waiting.The effects were good - especially the bugs - but the movie didn't make the CGI artists' efforts worthwhile. They left out almost all of the things that made the book great - the emphasis on personal responsibility, the bloody failures in the early part of the war, and the whole motivation for the war. I don't remember them mentioning the whole \\"we make them extinct or they make us extinct\\" angle anywhere.The amplified armor? Couldn't do that - you might hide the faces of the actors. What you ended up with is a goofy story of a bunch of teenagers shooting bugs, and a lot of extras getting sliced up.This movie sucketh, and sucketh mightily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Self!","review":"This movie was terrible. Terrible acting. terrible writing, terrible design. Sure, they have computer generated special effects, but hwo doesn't? They aren't even done well.Even the comedy of seeing Doogie Houser, M.D. looking like a 1940's German secret agent isn't funny enough to save this movie.Read the book - don't suffer through the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"action packed and adventurous","review":"This movie was very action packed with some of the best computer graphics I have ever seen. The plot was a little wierd in the sense that it dosn't follow the book at all and all of the fighting is done on foot. There were great special effects but they should have had tanks or artilery or something. Why waste the men if you can mow over the aliens with tanks. Overall a great well acted movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best movie ever? Have you all gone bonkers!","review":"This sci-fi (I use that term because this truly is garbage.) B movie is fun to laugh at, but it is a horrible movie in its own right. Bad actors, nordic looking Argentinians, goofy plot, annoying characters, sophomoric humor, moronic..... well it just goes on like that. I could see saying it is a fun brainless movie, but not that it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effects, weak plot, violence galore","review":"The special effects are really, really good: those big bugs seem to be truly there. The plot is almost preposterous: finishing off those bugs in their home planet would have been a piece of cake, even with current technology (assuming one could actually get to that planet.) I thought the explicit violence was sickening in several instances, but the fascist subplot was absolutely the worst thing: Verhoeven always manages to make something sordid and sinister of his plots (recall Robocop, Basic Instinct, or the ghastly Showgirls.) I was appalled to see in the theater families with young children. Talk about desensitizing children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good battle epic!","review":"If you like movies with huge battles and cool aliens then this is your movie. Sure the acting is a little week and the first half hour seems like a bad episode of 90210 but if you stick with it you wont be sorry! You haven't seen battles like this before thousands of 12 foot tall insects charging human soldiers with nuclear weapons. The epic battles extend from the ground warefare up to some of the most awesome spacehip explosions I have ever seen. This movie has some graphic violence and nudity so I wouldn't let your kid see this one. This is one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long awaited classic becomes reality","review":"Two famous names, titans of their occupation, work together to provide the public with the most spectacular sci-fi adventure since Star Wars. Heinlein's epic talent has given us a vision of how gruesome war really is. Verhoven has used talent actors and EXTREME special effects to relay this image of war into our minds. The effects of war haven't been shown this vividly since Born on the Fourth of July. 5 Stars, for excellance both on the screen and in the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive but not very creative or original","review":"This movie annoyed me quite a bit and pretty much insulted my inteligence in many scenes. I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I'd been drunk or had a labotamy first. On the other hand if you want nothing but action in a movie then you will probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate DVD / Surround Sound System Demo Disk!","review":"Thinking of laying down your had-earned cash on a home theater system? You've come to the right demo disk. If the salesfloor salesman puts this on a DVD-based surround sound system, you're in for a treat! This disk will surround you with great color, spectacular special effects, and an even soundtrack that really shows you what the speakers are capable of. When it all synergizes pleasingly, buy the system, and include this disk! Never intended as brain food, Starship Troopers is a fast-paced, bug-hunting, shoot-em-up, set in the distant future. One of the best sci-fi action flicks since Aliens, and a real must-have DVD for action flick enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starship Troppers is terrible","review":"This film lacked a good plot. The special effects were good but without a an excellent story to go with it. I did not like the fact that Humans were the bad guys. I like to think Humans will be better in the future not worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable soap at the start makes it difficult to watch.","review":"The feeble \\"SpaceCamp\\" type social interaction for the first 30 minutes lost my interest completely.

Not worth 2 Bob."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of Pick is Fine but Amazon sent Different Than Pictured","review":"I ordered the brown colored picks. It said confetti but l didn't know what confetti was and so l went by the picture. What l received was 2 packages of the ugliest picks l have ever seen. My husband said he would keep them but l am unhappy with the deception and there was no place for me to contact the seller so here l am. This was after we cancelled an order for the blue picks, which was what he really wanted, but after weeks of not arriving, we loomed at the order and it said they wouldn't be arriving until May- 6 months later! My suggestion- if you want picks, go to your local music store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item As Described","review":"item was exactly as described.

Just like many others here, the pick box opened during shipping, the amazon box got torn (which is a first for me) and several picks fell out. The way this keeps happening to customers almost makes you think that people in the Amazon shipping dept. must be stealing the picks! I mean, I've NEVER had an amazon box arrive torn until now. And whoever thinks an 8x10\\" box is appropriate for a 1x3\\" item should not be in shipping! I'm still waiting for some other picks I ordered to arrive through another seller - hoping for better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 out of 12 is a bad average","review":"I read the other reviews about receiving the 1.5\\" X 4\\" bubble pack of picks in a 9\\" X 12\\" X 4\\" carton. I thought I could avoid any loss by combining the shipment with two other items that were in the same catagory-a guitar tuner and a chord book. But it didn't work. They sent the picks as a single item. ALL the picks were out of their package and I received 8 out of the 12 I ordered. Avoid the frustration, Don't order them here. I read four reviews that warned me about this but I thought I was smarter. I was wrong.The picks are gorgeous and they are the Fender Mediums you've grown to know and love. But get your moneys worth-go somewhere else to get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Picks","review":"When I opened the box all that remained of the shippment was the small open plastic box the picks were once in.

Seems rather strange to return an empty pick box but hey, its Amazon's dime..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging Awful","review":"I read the reviews, but figured, I was ordering with a few other things that would be shipped together, so the little plastic clamshell of picks would be well packed with a few other small items (capo, strings) and wouldn't be stuck in a huge box. The picks were packed appropriately in a small box with my other items, but like so many other reviews it opened and the picks all came out. I was able to get 5 of them out of the box, the other seven disappeared. Don't order these picks, you'll only get frustrated.

Don't expect great tone out of them or anything. This type of plastic give the strings a darker tone. Another set back to these picks is that the medium size, I'm guessing about .6mm wears down very quickly. The type of plastic does not last long, and after about 20 minutes of straight playing it with become scratchy and uncomfortable to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"irresponsible","review":"I recently placed an order for a few similar things, and this one got separated from the other seller. The cost was $4.99, the shipping was $5.99. The 12(?) picks came loose in a box big enough for a toaster oven.

NO FIX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven out of twelve is awful...","review":"The one star here is not for the product itself. Fender picks are excelllent. But I only received seven out of the twelve I ordered. The remaining four were presumably \\"lost in transit\\", as the small plastic box Fender originally packages these picks opened inside the large Amazon box in which the picks were shipped. The picks fell out and scattered in the big box. Some must have fallen out of the big box during transport, because I could only find five when the big box got to me.Definitely not a good deal. Next time, I'll just walk over to the nearest guitar shop. Why does Amazon find it necessary to ship a small, easily-opened plastic box inside a huge cardboard box? This is objectionable on the practical grounds that items will not arrive as shipped and also on grounds of waste of materials. Heard of our environment? It's not in a state that would make such waste tolerable.

I was a bit worried when I saw all the complaints about poor packaging, but I think they've fixed the problem.

I use heavy guage myself, but the mediums and lights are equally good for their purpose.And notice that I'm reviewing the PICK, not the company that ships them to me. The rules here clearly state that we are to address the PRODUCT. Only. If I had a beef with Amazon, I wouldn't blame the picks -- they're just plastic triangles -- how could THEY be to blame?By the way, I play with the rounded corner of the Fender heavy pick, and this gives me a very mellow, \\"rotund\\" tone -- not too sharp, not so easily caught up in the strings, etc. I'm so old, I remember when these cost a nickel.

Add to this a box that is not sealed all the way around and you have another unhappy Amazon customer.I realize that reducing the packing is the green way these days, but come on, would a little tape on the plastic pack or just wrapping it in paper or putting it in an envelope hurt?.

Amazon just throws the set (which comes in a flimsy pop-open clamshell case) in a box to rattle around, open up, and fall out of the top/bottom flaps. So 9 of the 12 picks actually arrived at my door, which is better than most, however 4 of them I found under the bottom flaps of the box just waiting to fall out. The oddest thing is that I thought I was safe since I ordered 4 things at once but they shipped them in 2 separate boxes; in 1 box the items were shrink-wrapped together (and there is no real way the items could have fallen out of the box or been damaged from shipping) and the one with the picks was not shrink wrapped. ???Great picks, just don't order them from here since it's a well known issue but amazon just doesn't seem to care to fix the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picks fell out, but I got them all. Blame the shipper, not the product!","review":"I, like most if not all the people here, got my picks encased in a plastic box within a bigger box with all of them scattered throughout the latter. However, all 12 of them were in there, thanks to the taping. While I sympathize with people who didn't get all of their picks, that has little to do with the product and more to do with careless shippers who don't know how fragile the tiny plastic box is. The picks feel really nice, got exactly what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Package Broken Open","review":"Package was broken open and picks were all over the shipping carton. Half the picks were missing. I was offered a refund if I returned the product but declined since it was only a $3 item and wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is great, packaging was a problem","review":"The packaging opened up in shipping and instead of the 12 picks I ordered there was only 4 or 5 in the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"White picks are not as shown.","review":"Bought the white ones. Their not plain white, but rather that velvety pattern white. Still decent picks- just not what it looked like I was buying, and I much more prefer the plain white ones that I thought I was getting. Return shipping cost isn't worth it, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine product, fine package","review":"I read several reviews that said the picks fell out in shipping. I didn't have that problem. The package seemed well-designed to me, too, so maybe they've changed it.

I've only had them for a couple weeks and they're starting to brake off at the tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem Solved","review":"When I first ordered these picks, I knew that I would probally not receive all 12 in the package. To my suprise, it not only arrived early, but it came in the mailbox as well. It looks like the company finally corrected themselves and shipped them in and envelope, instead of a jumbo sized box that other reviewers commented on. And for the quality, I only just started using them but they are great just like others commented on. Now that the company finally listened to complaints, I would fully recommend to buy these picks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product good, Shipping bad","review":"I ordered this product for my son. The problem is the pack containing the picks was opened within the shipping box and due to the fact that the box was just taped in certain spots, all of the picks except two had fallen out of the box. There was no way to return it because there was no way to prove that I only received 2 of the picks. Would have been a great price, for a great pick, IF I had received all 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved replacement","review":"This is a much improved replacement to the original cradle that came with my Magellan 700 GPS. The original cradle developed a faulty power connector over time, probably from falling off the windshield and onto the dash a number of times (faulty suction cup, which I've also replaced.Recommended only if you're keeping your old GPS. More up-to-date technology in current GPS units."},{"rating":"1","title":"These cradles are a rip off","review":"The little tongs you see there a extremely delicate and if one gets bent which it will you will lose connection to the GPS. A couple of years ago we had to buy a replacement cradle and at the time they were way cheaper-like $30. Now I guess since they are so delicate and constantly needs replaced and this is your only option if you want your GPS to work they've jacked up the price to $70. Nice company. Not money hungry or heartless or anything. Since we've replaced the last one another tong has been bent so guess what that means? To be honest we're selling our Magellan and buying a Tomtom. I refuse to keep handing them money because they've sold us a bad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like mom used to make ...","review":"What can one say about an OEM replacement? They work like the one they replace. After 5 years, my original started having problems staying powered up and I traced it the power jack on the cradle, so I bought a replacement. Just a thought if you're buying one and you want multiple mounts ... Since these screw on to their respective mount, you might want to have one for each type of mount. I have the windshield suction as well as the weighted dashboard \\"pad\\" but to switch back and forth between them I need to unscrew the cradle. I know ... not tragic, but I like to keep one in my travel bag and the other in my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good GPS, bad cradle","review":"I've got a Roadmate 800 something. The Gps is great when it works. The Suction cup mount and cradle it comes with likes to fall off the windshield. Therefore, the GPS unit hits the floor with the power cord still attached. Eventually, the power end must have broken the small pin inside the unit that supplies power. I bought the replacement, and the unit works again.Magellan has a superior GPS technology, but design and durability is not that great. I also have a TomTom unit that is easly upgradable, and pretty stable on the windshield, but the software doesn't give me the same directions as the Magellan, but this is a review about the cradle. What can I say, if your cradle is broken, you MUST buy this one, but that doesn't make it better, just necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"Item was received bad, not able to use, and you refused to accept it back.The response from Amazon was to resell it!!!!!!!!I also contacted the shipper and they also refused accepting the cradle back.I have contacted Magelan and so far nothing.Either credit my account or send me a working part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I think I've screwed over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dale Novak"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRADLE IS WORST","review":"I BOUGHT MAGELLAN 700 & CHANGED 3 CRADLE SO FAR.IF CRADLE WORK GOOD, YOU HAVE THE BEST UNIT.I WISH IF MAGELLAN IMPROVE CRADLE QUALITY & LIFE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible setup","review":"Very old setup for a Magellan roadmate 700.

It was my first experience both with kayaks and kayak carriers. At first was pretty pleased. With time I found this product less than satisfactory. The tightening mechanism on these is pretty hokey. In today's manufacturing environment I expect good design especially on a fairly expensive product. The tighteners feel like off the shelf equipment. They take a fair amount of time to put on and off. As there is no locking mechanism this happens twice on every outing. Second, over time they these racks are feeling pretty wobbly. Third, the tightening mechanism destroyed the factory racks on my Forester. I also own a Thule hitch bike rack. I am disappointed there as well. Thule uses lots of metal and heavy parts but truly seems to be lacking in design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly addictive.","review":"Before I bought this CD tonight, all that I knew from Roxy Music was from the Avalon album and the song \\"Love is the Drug\\". I bought the album Avalon because of the title track, and loved it, but I didn't know where to go from there. So I decided to pick up this CD as sort of a sampler - a way to direct myself through the Roxy Music discography. I haven't picked up any of the other albums yet, but I haven't been able to put down this CD so far tonight. I am listening to it as a type this.I can tell that my love affair with Roxy Music has begun, and it won't stop until I have more. But until then, this sampler is thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying, at least for the time being. It is HIGHLY recommended for those that are thinking about getting into the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection of vintage Roxy with amazing sound","review":"This album format does justice to some very classic music. In the era of MP3's and down graded music fidelity, it is refreshing to see a format going the other way. The ONLY format where MP3's sound fine is in headphones. In anyplace else (like your house, your car, ...even your kitchen) the sound is tinny and without depth.The fidelity of the hybrid SACD is great however the selection of tracks could use some expanding. I would have liked to have more of the Avalon or Stranded albums on it. Overall you will like the disc, plus the low end is great, especially with a subwoofer."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic Roxy is right on","review":"Cuts 9 through 18 are spot on if you like the classic Roxy Music period that started it all. Honestly, I find my self skipping through the first 8 cuts, which in my opinion was a weak creative period for RM, reflective of less than inspired lyrics and boring music with hardly any of the hooks of their earlier material. But still worth the purchase for those last 10 cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good History Of Roxy Music!!!","review":"A good CD for those who just want a sample platter of Roxy Music.

I do not understand why a Korean company would bother to issue such a DVD if they are timid about showing the human anatomy. The continuous cuts are done with no regard to the the continuity so that scenes jump from one place to another constantly throughout the movie as the censors delete the offending frames. I am amazed that the copyright holders of this movie would allow this version to come out under the movie's title.

I would definitely recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We are unfortunately returning this item. Although we liked the look of the bouncer, the quality is poor. The backing is hard. The zipper to change reclining position easily gets stuck. The net covering hood gets in the way, even when folded back. Not easy to pick up and move from room to room. Not supportive - a 15lb baby nearly reclined all the way to the floor when placed inside. I suggest purchasing a different brand you can trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally useless and boring","review":"This is why you should wait to buy some things until you get to know your baby ! I regsitered for this bouncer b/c i thought i would like the way the neutral colors matched my decor... this is NOT what you need to base your decisions on !! This bouncer is flat with no head support, i had to buy a car seat head support to put in it. The toys are boring and not colorful so they barely get Katie's attention. She will not sit in this for long at all. Thank goodness Katie's grandma bought her the cute pink Sweet Daisy bouncer from Carter's b/c she likes that one. One good thing i am looking forward to trying next summer is the zippered bug screen, if she will stay in this bouncer long enough that will be a great thing for outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"My girl cries everytime","review":"My husband and I recieved this bouncer from our good friends. They bought it because of the zipper neating and the bed feature. My daughter who is now 6wks hates this bouncer. Everytime I put her in it she cries. If your baby is long he/she will not fit in this bouncer. The bed in this thing is hard as a rock. Also I noticed that the bouncer somewhat leans to the back so my babies feet are higher than her head. Sorry to say but I'm very disappointed in something with Eddie Bauer in the name. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for small infants","review":"We bought this several months ago. It was okay for the first month but we were unable to use it once my son was over 12pounds. When he was put in it, it almost touched the floor. It is very flimsy.

We didn't bother to read reviews etc. What a mistake - the \\"bed\\" in this thing is as hard as a board. Our baby girl didn't look too comfortable when we put her in it. Furthermore, the sound machine was terrible so we never used it.

Dont waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a piece of junk","review":"My baby was 10 lbs and too big for the seat. He did not look comfortable in it and the cushion was very hard, not soft at all. The straps did not reach around him, not that he was going anywhere because he could barely fit in the seat. The straps should be longer to fit ALL babies. I did NOT like anything about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too pleasing for a baby","review":"Three words...ALL ONE COLOR. Not very pleasing to a baby's eyes. Very pleasing for adults because it might not clash with furniture, but for babies, it is very, very sad.

Not worth it for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS","review":"This item was of no use to me. My baby was in it a total of 2 times. It was not soothing to her at all.

I received it as a gift from my registry. I ended up taking it back when my daughter was 2 months old. It did not bounce very well and she would end up in the most awkward positions and even banged her head against the sides quite hard at times. She seemed to outgrow it very fast.

Our baby grew out of it at two months. It's a total waste of money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Net gets in the way","review":"We registered for this bouncer because it was cute and the net on it seemed helpful. However, the net just got in the way. It doesn't fold under or go anywhere when your not using it so it is right at your baby's feet. Our son was a big baby (he has stayed above the 95% since one month old). He would get his feet caught in the net once he started kicking and moving around more. Also, the vibrations hardly work. My son loved vibrations (he had one on his bassinet) but this one didn't seem to do much. The folding feature is overrated. It does get flat, but is difficult to keep together to carry and kind of bulky.I guess if you have a small baby this would be ok, but if your baby is over 19-20 inches at birth (my son was 21\\"). I'd say pass on the Eddie Bauer bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"If you're looking for a seat that baby can kick and play and have a good time this is NOT the seat for you! If you're looking for a seat for baby to sleep in this IS the seat for you. I was looking for a seat to keep baby occupied while I took a shower or cooked dinner and this one was terrible for that. My 6 week old couldn't get comfortable in the upright position and her head would slant way down if she even moved her body a little bit because the seat is too straight up and stiff. When its time to sleep she goes in her crib so I didn't even really use the bassinet part of it. Overall this chair is not practical for a playful happy and wiggly baby which most are! I ended up returning this for another and it was also much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bouncer for the fussy baby.","review":"I bought this originally because it closed up with a bug guard and I thought that it was a cute \\"bassinet\\" like bouncer. I loved it when my daughter was first born. I put it in her crib and she slept great. Now that she is a little bigger I pulled the vibration mechanism off and put it about 12\\" below her feet and it vibrates her crib mattress. Works like a dream. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bird/music noise it a little too loud and well sounds more like noise instead of soothing music or nature sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this product!","review":"We, like many other parents, selected this \\"bouncy\\" seat since we thought it would be great this summer at the lake to keep the mosquitos off our baby. However, we soon found that she hated this seat because she rolled from side to side. This is because the bottom and back of the seat have a hard board in them which makes the seat rigid instead of like a sling to conform to a baby's body. Also, we felt like the seat always sat too close to the ground and was a little tilted. After some inspection we found that the seat was broken at the hinge that makes it collapse and this was after we had attempted to use it only a few times. Overall it is a poor design except for the netting and I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Where do I begin?! I bought the bouncy because I liked the color scheme and because it was an \\"Eddie Bauer\\"...what a joke. First, it is increadibly heavy and bulky. Second, the back (where the babys back rests) is flat as a board and baby will roll to one side or the other. Third, the color scheme may be nice for adults, but kids find it boring. Fourth, it is awkward to move because of the weight and because the legs flip around. Fifth, the toys are boring and hit baby in the head. Really, don't waste your money on this.(Note: I also bought the EB high chair and bassinet and they are both just as useless. What a horrible line)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT","review":"I initially received this item as a shower gift, however I quickly learned that my baby did not enjoy it...not only did he quickly outgrow it, it BORED him...If you have an active baby and would like to stimulate them developmentally...the Magic Moments leap frog bouncer is around the same price and it so much more enjoyable for your little one...my son is 6 months and still enjoys the Magic Moments one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful bouncer","review":"I would recommend this bouncer to anyone. Since it could be zipped up, we would bring it outside on our deck with us knowing that our baby wouldn't be bothered by bugs. The vibrations were very soothing to our baby and so were the nature sounds. The hanging toys were fun for him to look at and as he grew, he enjoyed reaching for and grabbing them. My son enjoyed being in here until he got too big for it around 7 months.

We thought that it looked comfortable and that the features like the vibrating/sounds and the zipper netting were great, but our son feels otherwise. He is now 4 months old and has never lasted for more than 10 minutes in his bouncer. I don't think that he feels secure in it. It's sad to say but, he prefers sitting in his carseat over being in the bouncer.I agree with one of the previous reviews in that the bouncer isn't very convenient to transport; whenever we move it from one spot to another one of the legs becomes detached.If we had saved the box that it came in, we would definitely return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is OK","review":"I got this product because it went with everything else I purchase for my now 13 mt old. my son really never liked it, I think that it was too boring for him.

Unfortunately, our baby despised this seat, and it took us a while to figure out why. Our baby always seemed to be seated in an uncomfortable position whether buckled in or not. He would last about 2 minutes, then he would squirm and arch his back. I finally figured out that the backing is made of extremely hard cardboard and there is almost no padding! I couldn't blame him! Another feature that we did not like were the fact that the seat did not stay closed when folded, therfore making travel quite difficult. The toys attached to the seat were very bland in color, but I liked the fact that I could remove them and attach toys of my choice with links (a feature you don't find with other seats). We ultimately decided on returning the seat after a month and a half. We have the Ocean Wonders seat now and our little boy seems much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great, but does not work!!!","review":"I bought this bouncy seat because I loved the way it looked, as well as loved the fact that it had netting to cover my baby when I took her outside. I had put the seat together and when I went to turn it on, the vibration unit did not work. I promptly returned it to the store and got another of the exact same unit. I brought that one home and assembled it on the same day. Again, the vibration unit did not work. I returned it to the store and asked them about this product, as two of the same bouncy seats did not work. The sales associate told me that this is their number one returned item in the bouncy seats and although it looks great, it has been a consistenly returned item from their customers. It was extremely frustrating to have assemebled 2 of the same item with neither of them working. I exchanged it for another bouncy seat by carters and was thrilled with the new seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"would buy something else if i could","review":"As a new mom, in my excitement, we opened this up assembled it and threw the box away. Here is why I am disappointed:1. Not very sturdy. Even less than some others of the same price.2. Doesn't stay closed when folded. Yes it is collapsable, but there is no mechanism to keep it closed so everything kind of falls this way and that.3. Really doesn't bounce. Definitely not as much as the others of the same price range.Overall, I like the mesh netting and the vibration feature but if I could return it for something else I would definitely do so.

My daughter used it for only about 3 months before she outgrew it. The straps are positioned poorly, so that her feet were hanging out the bottom at three months old, but there was plenty of room above her head. In addition, I had a terrible time unbuckling her. I couldn't squeeze the straps hard enough to get them to release. At one point, I almost thought I was going to have to cut my crying daughter out of it! I also agree with the other reviewer that the bland colors are boring for the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"We were so excited about this bouncer only to be completely let down... it is flimsy and very difficult to move from place to place (even coming apart!)

What looked like a safe, cozy choice has turned out to be of no use at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I thought I would love it because of the way it looked. We got it as a gift and feel bad the person spent money on this. It shouldn't even be called a bouncer. It doesn't really sit upright. When you lay it back, it touches the floor. Baby hates it and looks uncomfortable in it. Baby is confined and cannot stretch or kick legs. At 2 months this was already useless because it confined his legs. This was such a waste. There's nothing good about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed customer","review":"Product was not assembled correctly by factory and zipper broke. Eddie Bauer should pull their name from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this bouncer!!!","review":"This bouncer looks cute but that is really the only good thing I can say. It is almost too small for my 2 month old daughter. The buckle should expand more and the seat should be larger. My daughter seems to like the nature sounds but I think they sound annoying and hear a lot of background static. I would not buy this for a friend or use it with my next child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outgrown in a month","review":"My husband and I thought this bouncer would be great for outdoor summer events. Especially since our son was born at the beginning of June. By the end of July, at 22 inches and 11 lbs, he could no longer lay comfortably inside. The back nearly touched the floor even with the inside zipper closed. He's quite the mover and shaker and actually flipped the bouncer over once. On that note, we took it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!!!!!","review":"This bouncer's flaws out weigh any good points it MIGHT have.I received this as a gift and loved the way it looked, but it stops there. The \\"nature sounds\\" sound as if the bird is chirping through a walkie talkie that has bad feedback. A headroll cushion was not included so you have to go and buy one if you want to put your newborn in it. To top it all off, my seven week old daughter is long, so half an inch from now she won't fit in it anymore.Do yourselves a favor and get the baby papasan..that's the way to go.This product is useless for the kind of money their asking!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD BE ON A RECALL LIST!","review":"I received the bouncer as a gift. It looks great, but, as typical of most Eddie Bauer baby stuff, it's overpriced and poorly made.First off, it came with the wrong screws to put this thing together. Even after requesting replace,ent screws, AND after receiving a replacement unit (thanks to customer service) we STILL received the wrong screws. and thus weren't able to securely put this thing together. had we placed our baby in the unit, the entire thing would have COLLAPSED!!my recommendation? go with a cheaper unit from a company that KNOWS baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst out there. . .","review":"There is no soothing and definitely no comfort with this bouncer. It is like laying your baby on a piece of cardboard. The bird and ocean sounds are awful. The only use it got was when our son was a few weeks old and we padded it with blankets and layed him in it to sleep occaisionally. Safety is another issue. We had to be careful with a curious 3 year old flipping it over from back to front with baby inside. It looks cute and bears the Eddie Bauer name, but beware- it's functionality is less than minimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, no support","review":"My son weighs only 16 pounds and is too heavy for this bouncer that claims it can hold a 25 pound baby. When it is in the upright position and I put him in it, he is almost lying on the floor.The support is made of thick cardboard which is not enough to support a baby. I would not recommend this to anyone. We bought a fisher price bouncer for only $25.00 and it works so much better. He actually stays upright in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This bouncer is NICE!!!","review":"This would ahve to be my favorite baby item ever with any of my three children. its awesome!!!!

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"I bought this bouncer for my granddaughter because we live in the country and I liked the canopy netting for outside. She is 7 weeks old and just over 9 lbs. and the harness, at its longest setting, fits snugly. If she gets any bigger it will be too small. I cannot see any way a 20 to 25 lb. baby could possibly fit in this if a 10 lb. baby is a tight fit. Its too bad because the other features make for a nice comfortable bouncer for a baby that likes things a little less busy. And, like I said the netting canopy is great for anyone who likes to have baby outdoors a lot without having to worry about insects. I think if they made it a little longer and lengthened the straps on the harness this could be a good buy, but the way it is you can't get much use time before baby gets too big for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not very practical!!!!","review":"Although the bouncer is cute, it isn't very practical. I used it for both my babies and neither of them enjoyed being in it. I NEVER got the vibrarator to work. The protecting net doesn't close once the baby is in the basinette. It also takes up too much room."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I wont keep it afterall","review":"I only received this great looking bouncer this week. I had seen it at Babies-R-Us and fell in love with the looks....After reading sooooo many negative reviews, reluctantly, I guess I will return it. Have to admit though, there were so many bad reviews that I cynically thought maybe the competition wrote them!! With such upstanding companies sponsoring site, I'm sure there is no chance of that.However, it is too bad this product does not meet the high standards of many other Eddie Bauer products. Maybe they will listen to the reviewers and make some improvements. Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This is a terrible bouncer seat! Here is why:1. The back is HARD AS A ROCK. There is no way I would want to sit/lie on it so why would I make my child?2. The \\"nature sounds\\" are actually static with a couple of bird-like squeaks.3. At five weeks my daughter only weights 9lbs 2oz and the straps barely fit around her.4. My daughter is only 21.5in long and she barely fits in this contraption.5. The mosquito net that zips around it would be nice if you lived in the Amazon, but for daily use it is just in the way since it is not removable.So to summarize, your money is better spent elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"My daugter hated this thing. I registered for it because I had registered for the entire Eddie Bauer line but after putting her in it realized how unpracticle it is. Doesn't contour to her at all and she wouldn't last more then 5 minutes in the thing. Thankfully she liked the swing. Sold the thing on ebay and won't even bother with a bouncy seat with her little brother that will be here anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this was Pretty, but...","review":"I was excited that you can zip this closed, I have a 2yr old and wanted to protect my newborn.

I am taking ours back and exchanging it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"It was cool on the stand in the store. Our daughter stopped using it after 1 month. She hated it.

This is a huge waste of money. My son HATES it! I have written to the Eddies Bauer company and voiced my opinion, maybe they will discontinue it before fooling any other new mothers.

It is just plain AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good bouncer","review":"I thought this bouncer looked cozy and i liked that it zipped, but my son never liked to sit in it.

I will be buying a different bouncer for my next child."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT!!!","review":"I registered for this bouncer being that I live in Hawaii and plan on taking my daughter to the beach every now and then. I thought that it would be a good thing to travel around with.My daughter hates this bouncer. She refuses to sit in it. The \\"mobile\\" is made of earth tones and my daughter takes little or no interest in them. The vibration seems to only annoy her and the sounds will go on forever if you don't shut it off. I think there should be a timer, and also a better choice of sounds because my daughter is not soothed by any of these sounds.I am disappointed that this bouncer was a wasted gift. I was really hoping that my daughter would love it, but she completely hates it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute But Not A Buy","review":"We were really disappointed with this bouncer. Really it is just plain BORING. My daughter has not enjoyed it at all. The back is hard and the sounds are horrible! The toys are boring and have no contrast to the bouncer itself. We went out and bought a different bouncer and she loves the new one. It is comfortable, has music and lights and vibrates as well. I would not recommend this bouncer for any baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby hated this bouncer!","review":"He hated being in it...it makes creakin noises too... THe only time it was used was sometimes I could put him in there to sleep if the vibrating fuction was turned on.

There is really no \\"bouncing\\" involved...just vibrating and some background sound. The incline is at a uncomfortable angle and really can't be used until baby is able to hold her head up a little. We've used it some but would not reccomend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not stimulating...","review":"Not an ideal seat overall. It reclines too far back. I had to insert blankets to support my son's head to enable him to see out. Also he is 7 months now and one of the buckles just snapped off?I also didnt like the non-stimulation factor. Neutral colored over-hang toys dont offer any stimulation. I ended up adding my own colorful toys and hanging them to keep him amused.It looks adorable & simple but isnt practical in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 11 week old baby has out grown it","review":"I didn't register for a bouncy seat because my sister-inlaw said she would give me the one her daughter outgrew. I wish I would have looked into this one because she is already too big for this one at 11 weeks. They need to make it longer. Also it doesn't seem to be very strong, it goes down pretty far when I put her in it. I have never been able to unzip it so that she can lay down in it, because it is already pretty lower.

Any of the other bouncers are a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I rec'd this as a shower gift and was very excited when I rec'd it from my registry. Unfortunatedly, putting it together was a pain and when we did it was crooked, one of the rods was 1/4 to 1/2 inch longer than the right side so it sat off-kilter...also I didn't realize that in order for the baby to sit up in it, she must be zipped in. I was disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Favorite","review":"I was so excited when I registered for this bouncer. I had visions of my baby and I spending long hours over her first few months outside with her napping comfortably in her bouncer. Not so! She never really liked being in here, she would only sit for a few minutes at a time. The seat is very wide and did not contour to my daughter's body. She seemed much more comfortable in seats that were more shaped to fit her. Even when I swaddled her, she would still roll around in awkward positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the Eddie Baur Name","review":"I was disappointed by this product. It should fit a child upto 25lbs and my 10lb baby has already outgrown it. The slightest bump would set off the \\"soothing sounds\\" that sounded more like screaching birds over static. The zipper kept getting caught in the mesh and was difficult to transition from reclining to sitting up. The harness is a one-size fits all and cannot be adjusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I loved this bouncer when I first saw it. However, it pretty much fell apart. When my Daughter was 4 weeks old and laying in this, she would tilt the entire thing. When I laid her done in it, the thing would almost collaspe. The Vibration part didn't last long, I was changing batteries every few days! The bird chirping was so low, you could hardly hear it.After those first couple of weeks, we went out and bought a less expensive bouncer and she's still using it and she's 6 months old :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get something better for your money!","review":"I bought this bouncer because I figured Eddie Bauer was a good brand and it looks very nice. Come to find out just because it has the name doesnt mean its always a good product. I bought this product for my infant and she liked it at first it was the only place she would sleep in. Well she's 3mts. now and the reclining part doesnt seem to stay up she's 10 pounds and when i put her in it goes back down to the last notch and she just cries,she doesnt like it. So i bought the papasan bouncer by fisher price and its the best product in bouncer and swing i would recommend if you want comfort for your baby you will go with the papasan."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have 3 bouncy seats this is the worst one","review":"I agree with everyone else.....vibration died after only a few times. Toys are too close to baby's eyes...he is going to be cross eyed if I let him stay in there...there is no head support..baby rolls to one side usually wear the bear is.which is where they get 1 star since my son likes the bear...you can't get him in & out without having the toys hit him so soon enough my son will hate the bear since he keeps clocking him on the head & then this item will get no stars! I would not advise getting this bouncy. I got 2 at my shower & was going to return this one since I didn't register for it. I thought I would use it, but wish I had returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should have gone with my gut","review":"i had originally registered for the kick and play bouncer but changed my mind when i saw how nice and soft this one was. i also loved the fact that it could zip up and keep bugs out.however, when my baby actually use it for the first time, i realized i might have made a mistake. like others have stated, the colors aren't very stimulating, it doesn't realy \\"bounce\\", and it's very reclined. making it good for napping perhaps, but not for play. also, though my baby's only 4 wks old and under 10 lbs. i'm not sure how well this thing will hold up once he's a bit bigger. the back seems to be nothing more than a flimsy piece of cardboard.in any case, i'm going to be returning this this next week and getting the kick and play as i'd originally planned."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COMFORT FOR THE BABY!!!!!","review":"BOY, ALL I CAN SAY IS I WISH I WAS A BABY SLEEPING IN THIS BOUNCER. IT IS SUPER COZY. I TESTED OTHER BOUNCERS AND THE VIBRATIONS WERE HARSH ON MOST. THIS BOUNCER HAS SOFT AND MEDIUM VIBRATION. I LOVE THE SCREEN COVERING SO YOU CAN TAKE BABY OUTSIDE WITHOUT BUGS GETTING TO HER/HIM. BY FAR THE BEST BUY YET."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best built bouncer","review":"My husband and I received this as a gift and while we loved the zippered netting, the rest of the bouncer wasn't so great. Our son always managed to kick the vibrating part off of the bouncer. And, when he was lighter, that part would vibrate itself right off. We didn't like it much and ended up not using it very often. I'd recommend something with the vibrating part affixed to the seat and not removeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"This is more of a massager than a bouncer. Although it is great for putting her to sleep, I find that my little girl is constantly rolling to the side from the vibrating, even on the lowest speed. With the vibrating off she still seems to end up in uncomfortable positions. I have yet to listen to the sounds so no review on those. It is a pain to pick up and move because the bar never snapped in place so everytime we move it, it comes apart. The netting is great for being outdoors but i dont want to use it indoors and the top part doesnt stay up unless you use the netting so she cant look at the toys (which are cheap anyway) Not a great product and i would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"This was a waste of $50. The music is TOO Loud and way too annoying. My son is only 24 inches in length & 13 pounds at 3 months and has already outgrown the restraints and the length of the seat. The toys are not brightly colored and uninteresting to him. I hung different ones, but if you push the canopy back, they dangle on his head. The netting is not removable - I was hoping to use it this summer outside, but he has already outgrown it. If I'd kept the box (dummy me), it would have gone back to the store! Now it has to go in the garage sale or to the consignment store or on Ebay. When I bought this there were no reviews on it...hope this helps you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not confortable at all","review":"I think this a waist of money. The canopy just make the entire bouncer not comfortable for the baby. Also my baby was 2 months 14 lbs. when I had to retire this bouncer. My son was too big and felt very uncomfortable in it. The music is not appealing either. I was very unhappy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"We are so disappointed in this bouncer! Our little guy was only 7 lbs and the bouncer seemed too small, how can it support a baby until he reaches 25 lbs ??

We learned that the most expensive baby product is not always the best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better choices out there","review":"My daughter received this bouncer from an aunt. We tried sitting her in it a number of times, but she never liked it. It didn't look very comfortable for her, and the \\"nature sounds\\" were a bit annoying. We ended up putting it away--we should have taken it back to the store, but we waited too long. Although she didn't like this bouncer, she *loves* her Baby Papasan. Couldn't live without that one! Overall, the Eddie Bower bouncer just isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My son is 6 weeks old and hates sitting in this bouncer.

To be perfectly honest, it will be nice for outside, when our daughter is napping. Otherwise, the nice $20 bouncer from Walmart is her preference. Once she could see, she hated it, because she could not see her surroundings. Had we known this from day one, we would have gone with one more reasonably priced instead of geting this one, then having to go out and buy a bouncer she would tolerate."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"This bouncer is a waste of money.

The part the baby lays on is so hard..Its doesnt sling the body like the fp Kicknplay. My son always rolls to one side. There is no incline-when I lay him down inside his feet are higher then his head. It dosn't bounce at all! Also if you have a big baby like I do, he/she will grow out of it FAST. There is no leg room. Save your money and go for something tried and true like the Fisher Price bouncers-And they're cheaper!!!! I wish I would have saved the packaging to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it shouldn't be called a \\"bouncer\\"","review":"it doesn't really bounce, babys see contasting colors, this had none so the toys are kind of pointless in it. it doesn't bounce and the back is made of cardboard. it is great for camping though and to put her outside to sleep"},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"I registered for this bouncer primarily because you can enclose it by zippering it up and a net surrounds your baby- I thought it would be great because it would keep my two big dogs from licking her and keep the bugs away from her outside. Unfortunately, the seat is so uncomfortable she will not stay in it. The back is totally flat so you have to position the baby with blankets or she falls to the side but she still does not like it. It is also very big and not convenient to fold and put away. I wish i kept the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Bouncer","review":"My daughter only used this bouncer until she was 2 weeks old. She now screams if I put her into it. The seat is very stiff and not very comfortable. She would slide sideways b/c the seat is so stiff that I had to put rolled up blankets to hold her straight up. The only positive about this bouncer is the zipp up netting that provides protection from insects if you bring your baby outside. The color is soothing but also boring for baby. I should have purchased an activity bouncer for her entertainment instead b/c this bouncer does not sooth her or entertain her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for our little one with Reflux!!","review":"We found this product very useful for our baby with reflux!! The angle of the infant seat was perfect. Our baby loved to sleep in it and actually spent the first two months doing so. I also found the length to be of use as our baby got bigger. I am giving it a 4 however because it isn't portable, and the bird sounds our horrible!!! Some soothing music would be a plus!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as practical as it looks","review":"I registered for this bouncer because our daughter was going to be born before the summer months and we have cats in the house hold and did not want them to get into the bouncer. However in order for it to vibrate you have to have the sounds (nature) on which is really annoying and it turns on even if you bump it. The attachments are too close the the childs face when sitting up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I came across this book at a discount book store and that's where I should have left it. Thank goodness I only gambled an dollar on this disappointing piece of literature. The author (too many times) confused me with her plot changes. Although they are relevant, the set up could have been written better, maybe by chapter rather than by random paragraphs? I read often and was surprised with how confusing this book was. It was hard for me to identify with some of the main characters because of how little Mrs. Croft spent writing about them. I would have liked to have known more about Moon's son. Overall it's definitely a book to pass up. It's always unfortunate when the brief descriptions on the back of an book are more interesting than what's actually inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing!!!","review":"This book was really confusing.

Now the sound is fuzzy, periodically drops off, and sometimes sounds as if it were being played by a tape recorder with low batteries.

I think I'll just buy a decent set of headphones with a cord extension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Cuts Out Intermittently","review":"The audio quality was acceptable and pairing was easy. But the audio cuts out intermittently. Plantronics tech support suggested I remove the battery from the Sony Ericsson w580i with which the device was paired to eliminate the possibility of a static bubble around the phone's battery. That didn't fix the problem. I've paired my phone with other bluetooth stereo devices without this problem, so I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the Plantronic headphones, not my phone.Two possibilities occur to me: (1) the sampling rate on my music might be more than the headset can handle, or (2) the unit might have a weak front end and, thus, be unacceptably susceptible to RF interference from other electronic devices. To their credit, Plantronics offered to replace the headset, but I suspect this isn't a device manufacture issue, so much as a design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy and functional!","review":"I picked these up when they first came out and payed a ton for them. I have never once regretted the decision. Originally I was going to use these with my PPC-6700 when the A2DP hack was released. Unfortunately, stereo Bluetooth on the Apache never panned out, so I mostly used them with the transmitter to wirelessly listen to my iPod (and Zune) and loved it. I work in a noisy environment with a ton of electrical equipment and was constantly astounded by the range I could get out of these things. Of course, YMMV when you pair these with a phone, but the stock transmitter is powerful.Later, I bought a PPC-6800 (Mogul/Titan) and these pair nicely with the handset and provide full A2DP support with pocket media player. Call quality is poor, but I blame the buggy BT stack on the phone for that. On every other handset I've used it was pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic breaks easily","review":"Bought this head phone when it was still over $100.

I use it for gaming"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics Pulsar 590E","review":"The headset paired easily to my cell phone (LG Venus) and performed as expected. It is fairly comfortable to wear for extended periods, the sound is clear and the controls (volume, track) are easy to operate. My only concern is whether the flashing blue light will be too annoying to others in a dark airplane cabin (e.g. at night). It is perfect to use around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Bother","review":"This product is junk. Had it less than a month and it stopped working. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I'm using this headset with a Dell laptop; the sound is not all that good, there is an occasional lag, and I have yet to figure out how to make the mic work.Perhaps Bluetooth headsets have a little ways to go yet in development; I also use a bluetooth mouse with this laptop, and I've realized since trying to use this headset that there is a lag to get bluetooth devices going with the PC, which is something I've never noticed when using an ear bud with my cell phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this headset","review":"Very nice audio, flawless linking, BUT . . . all of this is pretty irrelevant if the device doesn't do that for long. Wanting to get a lightweight, stereo headset with well-reviewed audio, I took a chance that those who said it broke or stopped working were just the unlucky few. I have to count myself as another, as my headset stopped charging after a few months of moderate use and delicate handling. I advise readers of this review to take careful note of the relatively high number of people saying that their headsets failed after moderate amounts of use. I wish you better luck if you too take the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Failure","review":"I bought this unit about 15 months ago and had not used it for about six months as my iPhone did not support stereo. Now that it does I attempted to use it. It will not take a charge. I contacted Plantronics and they indicated the warranty was for 13 months so I am out of luck. Seems a battery should last longer than a year or so. Plantronics indicates the battery is not replaceable so my only option is to buy a new one. Think I will look for a more reliable brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great VOIP headset ... ok music sound quality","review":"This is definitely a VOIP headset more than a music headphone. The sound quality is ok , kinda sounds muffled but its decent enough to list to and talk on the softphone. I purchased several Bluetooth adaptors and by far the easiest setup was Callpod CPPD-0001. And all features worked perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough volume - too tight on the head","review":"The build quality seems good and the sound quality as well but I could not get enough volume for music with my HTC Touch Pro.

He was enjoying it for a few weeks. It doesn't preform well in low light settings. About three weeks later, there were no words or icons on the screen. I visited the Mustek website and they didn't even list this camera as one of their products. So I called their customer help line (a toll call) and received no help at all. I was on hold more than I was speaking to the rep. He didn't understand what I was saying anyway. Needless to say the camera has been returned and we will be buying a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother it with your hard earning money","review":"I got it in a week,and at the same day I returned it to Amazon. Now I AM arguing with Amazon why they would NOT like to give me a full refund for such bad product. It was the worst one I have ever seen in the digital camera field. I am not talking about the value itself on such price.I am talking about the quality of this product,particularly,when I found the lid of card-holder can't be closed at all. The LCD is awful too,although I even didn't turn it on. I can't believe how disappointing until I see it.Save your money.later, Amazon promised to give all my money back. So I am happy with Amazon service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustek DV 9300 Digital Video Recorder","review":"Bought this camera for my 14 year old granddaughter as a birthday gift.

Only shortcomings are files are saved in .asf format only and low level light performance is not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"I bought this not knowing what to expect. As usual I looked at the instruction book briefly to see where all of the parts were located and began trying it out. Well, I really like it. Once you get everything located ( all of the bells and whistles) it is pretty straight forward. I was able to shot a little two minute video, the reason I purchased it straight away. It's light and easy to carry around. I've converted the video in to a quicktime video and got it on the web in a little for no time. I still haven't glanced at form that the start up fold out. Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened to the other reviews","review":"I didn't care for this CD at all. I'm not sure if it's the singer's voices or what. I would find it difficult to listen to this CD during any type of meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have Toy!","review":"We bought Spike for our daughter Katelyn when she was two months old. Even though she was too young to really grasp the toy at that age, she was very intrigued by it and loved to stare at it and touch it. She is now 5 months old, and this is her favorite toy! As she learned to grasp things, we could see her learning new features of Spike nearly every day. This toy was designed so well to work so many development areas - there are different colors, different patterns, different textures, different sounds. Some days Katelyn just wants to stare at it and you can see her learning something. Other days she wants to hear the crinkles of the spikes (she loves that!). Now that she's teething, the tail makes for a great chew toy. She spends a lot of time just holding and examining Spike - he keeps her attention far longer than any of her other toys! She loves it so much we bought a 2nd one for her to keep at daycare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tail can be a choking hazard","review":"My son has always liked this toy, however the tail w/ ribbons can be a choking hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyping spike","review":"I rated Spike as 2** principally because my daughter only cares about one of Spike's features -- the claw with the little beads suspended in plastice. As for the rest of Spike, she could care less, rather unlike the reviews from parents whose kids couldn't stand to be away from Spike. I do like the durability and washability features though, because we throw Spike around the crib and on the floor all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and educational set","review":"This is a nice, themed little magic set. Our son used tricks from this for a mini magic show he did at school and it was rather a success. The tricks were fun and educational, though some of them seem a mite tricky and may take a bit of practice. Most of the items in the set (paper cups, paperclips, etc.) are things you could find around your house. You could actually get away with just having the little instruction booklet. Thus my four-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... For Only 1.5 Years","review":"I got this microwave a year and a half ago. It worked well initially, heating items up faster than others. But last week, the microwave died on me, after only 1.5 years (which is very poor performance for a microwave- many have been known to last 10 years). The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because when it worked, it worked well.

Turns out it's the inverter, which they only cover for one year, so I'm out of luck. (I have also seen complaints on other websites about inverter problems with Panasonic microwaves, breaking down with minimal use.) I had to go back to using my trusty 20-year-old Toshiba microwave, with no turntable, but it STILL works! I would have been happy if the Panasonic lasted 10 years, but I barely used it, and I think it should have lasted a LOT longer than it did.

I have owned mine for a little over a month and it's off to the repair center. It overheats and trips the 20amp circuit breaker. Overall, having mentioned the major defect, the unit is cheaply constructed. The door is flimsy, the display window light is too dim to read easily, and there is no light in the unit unless it is in operation. Thumbs down, I wish I had not purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice if it works, but . . .","review":"Now returning my second unit because heater unit stops working after a few weeks (note: Amazon did a fantastic job of processing the first return).

A little reminiscent of Moorcock'sDancers at the End of Time, in tone, but with more obvious humanity andhuman characters. It appears that the main character, now happily goingabout his business, was some sort of maverick in the past. The currentgroup of people in power, including his father, removed a large chunkof his memory. This is a long period of time, some centuries, are thepeople in this era are functionally immortal.He tries to find out why, and what he should do about it.

The jargony, overwrought prose of this debut novel might fool some of the people, but when you strip away the words that hang like too-ripe grapes, one sees that there is, in effect, no real plot. The Golden Age is vista after vista of astonishing sights and as vast as the ocean...if the ocean were about knee-deep.

However, once I was hooked, I literally could not put this book down, polishing it off over the course of this past weekend. I actually regretted that I finished it at 8:00 on a Sunday night--too late to run out to the local books store and find a copy of its sequel.

It's 10,000 years in the future and folks live forever if they choose and can do whatever they want...as long as their bank account is fat enough...and even the poorest of the poor seem to be living pretty good. Of course, people being people they still manage to screw up occasionally, but it doesn't matter since they just have their memories redacted and then they can go on living like the big screw up never happened. But what if they want the memory back? Oops, time to call in the all knowing mega-computers to figure out a plan to outsmart the other mega-computers that are cramping your style, er, memory.

Or don't imagine it and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugo/Nebula contender (and likely winner)","review":"For all the talk of 'space opera' and other genre/author comparisons, _The Golden Age_ is one of the most original novels to come out in years. John Wright lays out and tosses away more inventive, imaginative ideas in a few pages than many SF authors manage in a whole book. And not only has he developed a long-term extrapolation of human/technical evolution, he has done so in a story built on various intersections of myth and philosophy.Wright's writing is intellectually challenging without being condescending or obtuse (deliberately or otherwise). He never forgets the need to be a good storyteller, yet probes close to the bone on such core issues as the determination of truth, the nature of reality and the tension between individual freedom and social good.Utterly outstanding. I hope Wright gets the accolates he deserves. ..bruce.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unreadable","review":"Another of these SF books where the author thinks that SF is simply about making up obsure words and describing \\"future\\" sounding technology without any need for boring old-fashioned plot, character development, social parabole, internal consistency, and ... oh yeah readability.I'm sorry Mr Wright, but aligning 30 new made up words per page for the sole purpose of stuning your readers by some would be never-seen-before show of creativity gets boring very quickly. And the volume of random twists thrown in there solely for unpredictability, and without any sort of introduction or vague rationale is both very easy and lame.

BUT, but I really wish I had not gotten this book. This book was painful to read, due to the overly florid prose - kind of like reading court transcripts from \\"Olde Englande\\".There is WAY too much of the book that is spent in dialogue between characters. I finally got interested about halfway through, but then it dragged ON and ON and ON until the so-called resolution.

The author writes well and does an in-depth studyof the airline and how it came into being. She gives all the right personalities their due and carefully details the airline's move from its Ireland UK routes to its expansion in Europe. She effectively strips Michael O'Leary of his PR star status making him out to be juvenile, abusive, deceitful yet an effective swashbuckling airline buccaneer. When I came to the part about the way the Ryanair mistreats the disabled by charging them for the use of wheelchairs and making them claw their way up the plane's steps on the tarmac, the thought rocketed into my mind that I would exercise my rights not want to fly Ryanair even - if the price was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"The southwest of Europe!","review":"Ryan Air is the southwest airlines of Europe and has done very well against the inefficient Flag Carriers over there.

It is a gel and slings just as much as every other gel. No more, no less and I did apply it with an applicator. It does have a high gloss and looks great. My advice is to apply a very small amount, spread it evenly and wipe down the excess. It's a gel so waiting a few hours or overnight won't make a difference.Overall, i like the look but it def 100% does sling!UPDATE: it's now a few days later and I have had to clean the side of my car every day since applying. Tires look good but wow does it sling.UPDATE 2: Tried this 5 times now. Each time I used less and less product and applied with a foam applicator. Slings like crazy.

It is easy to apply and also smells nice. If you don't mind paying a little bit more than similar products on the market, go with this one.

The bulk of the book traces the history of Zionism from then until the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 and its victory in its War of Independence. The book concludes with a short description of Modern Israel and its more recent history.To the book's credit, it explains that Israel now faces a propaganda war from the Arabs, including oft-repeated Big Lies to the effect that Zionism is a form of racism and that Israel has deprived Arabs of their rights.

Critt and feel she does a wonderful job. Snapshot takes you into the world of hospitals and medicine and secrets they may hold. Carlotta is taken into this world by her customer who later cannot be found. Snapshot has many twist and turns (which I enjoy in a novel).

She jumped quickly into their relationship and the subsequent engagement and wedding went quickly without a true development of either Jasmine or Jeremy's relationship outside of sex.

No one believes her till she gives away all of her 100 dresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every child should read this book","review":"My eight-year old son was given 'The Hundred Dresses' as a vacation book report assignment. Wanda Petronski was laughed at at school for her name, for her faded blue dress that didn't hang right and for offsetting her poverty by tales of her hundred dresses at home. But her dress was always clean, washed daily herself because she had no mother and often it would not be dry by next morning. There was a drawing competition and Wanda submitted 100 drawings of her dresses and she won the girls' prize. But by the time of the announcement of the winners Wanda had been moved to the city because of the teasing. Some deep soul searching was triggered in a concerned classmate whose life was changed for ever as she realized that her passive role had contributed to Wanda's fate. Every child should write a report on this book and its deeper meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you like dresses? This is the book for you!","review":"The book I read was The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes. It was about a girl named Wanda who was shy and got teased. Diversity means Difference in language, dress, food, where parents and grandparent were born, and race, religion, are not only allowed but accepted as important. Diversity happened when Wanda moved here. She had a different language, she dressed different and she had no money. I liked this book because it is about how people don't like to be teased."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can get a good idea about the book.","review":"If you enjoy a story about how a little girl uses her im agination to over come her limited wordrobe of one dress you will like this book. The main character is young Wanda, a child who has a big imagination about her wordrobe. She is teased by her classmates in room 13 about her dresses How Wanda handles her prolem is a good reson to read this book. I enjoyed rading it and I think you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Story","review":"An incredibly ugly depiction of a little Polish girl and her classmates making fun of her. Promotes the stereotypical \\"Dumb Pollack\\" without showing any betterment of the little girl's situation. I found this book very offensive. I had ordered it as a gift for a little girl, but this book is wildy inappropriate in that there is no moral resolution at the end. The tormenters get away with their harassment, and there is only suffering for the Polish girl. The only thing it would teach a child is that you can get away with being bigoted and rude to others. Too bad Amazon doesn't allow for a zero rating because this because deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please don't tease!","review":"The theme of The Hundred Dresses is don't tease other people. The girls who always get new things tease Wanda, the main character. I think the theme is don't tease other people because you would not like to be teased. When Wanda was walking to school, all the rich girls came up to her and said \\"So how many dresses do you have Wanda?\\" Wanda replied \\"One Hundred.\\" Do you really think she has one hundred dresses? After this all the girls laughed and teased Wanda about how many dresses she had. I would not like it if people teased me. Please read this book and don't tease other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I really enjoyed the messages in this book.

That was over 30 years ago and I can still remember the stinging isolation and teasing. After reading this book in third grade, I recall so clearly my heart melting, and crying so strongly for struggling proud Wanda. Last month I read this book to my six year old daughter and we had a long tender talk about how important it is to not judge people for what's on the outside. This story was written around the time of World War II, and I can only imagine that Eleanor Estes was an incredible insightful marvelous soul. I think this book should be on recommended reading lists for third grades - fifth grades. It's so well written, that as an adult I've reread passages to myself in appreciation of their understated eloquence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanda Petronski lives up in Boggins Heights with no friends","review":"Wanda Petronski lives in Boggins Heights with her father and her brother in a shabby house .

They tease Wanda about her dresses.Until Wanda moves away to a big city.Then they feel bad for what they have done.I thought this story was a sweet story because the two girls Peggy and Maddie learned from their mistakes.

Wanda enters a contest and is the winner; when she does not show up at school for three days everyone wonders where she is .The conclusion of this book explains Wanda's feelings about her classmates and the way they treated her. Will Wanda ever know she won the contest and will Peggy and her friends find out if Wanda REALLY had a hundred dresses?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for teaching","review":"This book is a very good read for parents and children to talk about being nice to others, especially others who are different. It has some big words, but nothing too hard to explain. *Possible Spoiler* The ending is sad, so as a parent or teacher you want to be prepared to explain how things wont always end well. I would also advise reading it before hand so you know what's coming and how to best direct it to the child you are going to read to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a good book? Then check this out!","review":"The book that I read was the Hundred Dresses.The author is Eleanor Estes. The Hundred Dresses is about a girl who is teased and handles it by kind of lying.

I like this book because it is a good book for 7 and older so they understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hundred Dresses","review":"Wanda Petronski is a Polish girl who goes to school in Connecticut who claims to have one hundred dresses but wears same faded blue dress everyday. Her classmates tease her about it until finally she is pulled out of school and the family moves elsewhere. I did not particularly like this book because I did not understand the point of the book. It was easy to understand the wording but sometimes it is written from first person and sometimes third person so it was hard to follow along. I am not sure which age group this book is supposed to be addressed to. At my school it is a seventh grade book but some people suggest it for younger ages. It is short and the words are easy to understand but it is kind of confusing. The moral of the story is if someone is teased do not just stand there and watch them get teased. Instead stand up for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book THE HUNDRED DRESSES","review":"THE HUNDRED DRESSES was a good book.The story is about agirl nammed Wanda and these two girls.

I would reccomend this book to anybody who has never been teased because they know what will happen and they know what it feels like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic novel about self-knowledge, courage, and integrity","review":"Maddie may be poor, but she's glad she isn't as poor as Wanda. Wanda is an immigrant. Her family lives in a bad part of town. And, every single day, Wanda wears the same faded, blue dress. When Maddie's classmates start picking on Wanda, Maddie is too afraid to stand up for what she knows is right. After all, as poor as Maddie is, she could be next.The Hundred Dresses is a surprisingly emotional story about doing the right thing--even when it isn't popular. The simple language of the story makes us feel Maddie's heartache about making a mistake she may not be able to set right. The Hundred Dresses won the Newbery Medal in 1945."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sized too Big","review":"I have been successful ordering 11.5 wide oxford lace-up shoes from Johnston & Murphy or Bostonian for the last 10 years. I happen to be hitting a dead patch with zappo's and shoebuy in trying to find a new pair of casual shoes to go with the dockers, which is what I wear a lot, so I figured I would take a crack at these since they were cheaper than any other web site. The shoe is too long - I have about 3/4 inch dead space between my big toe and front of shoe - and the heel area is way too big. There is actually a bit of open space all around the heel. I assume the heel size will only change if I order a regular width, but my big toe is already pressed up against the side of the shoe, so a narrower size will get me in the situation I was in with regular sizes. Too bad, it is obviously a very nice quality shoe, but the last it is built on is weird (for me anyway). I may have to go to an AE store and have them figure out what last my foot is compatible with and then try to order online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable and Great Quality Scanner","review":"This USB Plug and Play Bar Code Scanner is a breeze to setup and use.

Sting is of course a classic figure and Kurt Angle is the real deal but its founder Jeff Jarrett always struck me as a guy who's position was due to his well position as founder and not due to his charisma or wrestling prowess. This DVD set , which I purchased out of curiosity and to find out what I wasn't getting only solidified my opinion that Jarrett is a second tiered performer. I can't really remember any 4 DVD set dedicated to a performer in any field that is so second rate..I guess if Andrew Ridgley of WHAM fame released a box set of his solo work we'd have a comparison to this. Jarrett should be the wrestler that goes on to put over new stars instead of borrowing shtick from The Honky Tonk Man and putting himself over and over and over.With so many amazing wrestling DVDs on the market I can't recommend this set to any serious fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good product for the price","review":"The headset does the basic well.

No explanations whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I first used BS&L over 30 years ago for my first Transport classes in Chemical Engineering. It's depth and breadth is such that it was a primary text for four other courses I took later in grad school. I pulled the book out a couple of days ago to review my understanding of heat transfer to help explain it to some youngsters.To those who complain that it has too much math...take up a new field. Math and science are inextricably linked. Science isn't just your high school teacher babbling about ecology and the \\"circle of life\\". This is hard science, the kind that builds nations and brings societies out of disease-infested environments. If you're using this text and can't take the heat, better get out of the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult but very good","review":"This book was very difficult to understand on first pass through for my classes in Fluid Mechanics. However I have used it several times as a reference and each time I read it I seem to get more and more out of it. Requires a very good undertanding of vector calculus, but the examples are very helpful and are general enough that you can apply the principles learned to other situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but need solid background to understand","review":"Overall this is a good book for learning transport phenomena, however, if you are lacking in some of the fundamentals (fluids, heat, etc) some of the steps in the examples don't make sense. Once you have a grasp on the fundamentals, the book is very useful in breaking down transport problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"What should be expected from people who take Forty years.","review":"While the first edition was the seminal standard, I don't see how the second edition can be considered the same. First of all just look at the back cover, that's glaring. The numeraters and denomenaters in the differential expressions are reversed from what they should be. Such things make me hesitant to trust any of the rest of this text. If nothing else 40 years is too long for a single edition to be used.

They are larger to accommodate prescription glasses.Some people were saying that these goggles are large. They're not - they're the same size as my other goggles, with the foam cut out so that it allows for glasses to fit inside. The elastic band is a bit small, but it wasn't a problem for me (however, if I had a bigger head, I'm not so sure). I'd say I have a medium-sized head.All in all, great goggles for a great price!

The main thing I like about this brand is the amount of breathing room these goggles provide.

They seem a good quality. I don't wear glasses, but the OTG style allows for a little more air flow. They haven't fogged up on me. The only thing is I didn't know it buckles in the back. Handy to have though. I use them with a helmet, so a buckle isn't needed, rubber grip on the straps would help but it doesn't have it, and the goggles are almost too big to comfortably fit in my helmet. Otherwise, great pair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big for me, otherwise a very good product.","review":"This snow goggles is perfect for OTG, GOOD for sunny day only. does not fog at all. If you wear this in cloudy day, the slope may seem all the same to you, the bumps are invisible to you. Do not wear this in cloudy day. The ability of preventing fogging is awesome, I snowboard all day for 8 hours. It does not fog at all. However, the size of this goggle is a little too big for me. I am 5'7'' tall Asian. Only a small part of my nose is exposed, it does not affect my breathing, just do not have a super good looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tall for helmet use","review":"Bought these to wear with my Red Trace II helmet and the goggles are too tall above and below the midline of the lens resulting in the helmet pushing the goggles over my nose. I haven't skied with them yet (would return if I could but I accidentally destroyed the box) but I imagine I will be bothered by the goggle pinching my lower nostrils. Ill try them this weekend and if I find the nose issue is unfounded i will consider adding a star. Even with no helmet I feel like a little motion will cause them to slip too low on my nose. No complaints otherwise. They fit over my glasses no problem and don't alter the position on my prescription frames. It seems there is ample room for a large set of prescription frames. Lens reflectiveness matches the picture for the citrus. They come with a carry case/cleaning cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"The lenses on these are nice, and it's a good feature for them to fit over any prescription glasses.

It is accurate, versatile, very stable and true on 90 degree and angled cuts. It fits nicely into the box after use and cleans easily.

A small but important part holding the fence in place broke (problem #1) and I went to Porter Cable to get a replacement part. Got one from a parts dealer (costing nearly $20 for a little plastic part) but it would not fit - the two screw holes were spaced too far apart and the part would not seat in the recesses in the metal flange where it needs to be firmly attached (problem #2). Got a second part from the authorized Porter Cable dealer with exactly the same problem. How can a manufacturer make a product and then provide replacement parts - replacement parts essential to the tool's operation - that will not fit??!! The tool is useless because Porter Cable can't do the easy job of making replacement parts that are like the parts on the original product!!

Surfaces are machined very precisely and it has a good weight. Creating pockets in birch plywood and MDF is so smooth it almost feels like like cutting through butter.My only gripe is that it appears the blade isn't perfectly centered to cut a pocket in the middle of 3/4\\" stock. If both the wood and the tool are resting on a bench, the hole seems to be about 1/32\\" too high. This really isn't a problem as long as you note to cut both pieces you're joining from the same direction so that the 1/32\\" offset lines up -- otherwise they'll multiply and your piece could be off by double that! You can use the fence and adjust it to center perfectly, but then both the work piece and the tool need to be hanging off the edge of the table.This kit doesn't include any biscuits so make sure you pick some up at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NO BRAINER","review":"I am just getting into woodworking and after reading various reviews purchased the PC 557.

So when I was ready to buy a buscuit jointer, Porter Cable's reputation, as well as the FF buscuit capacity made it a clear choice.As another reviewer pointed out the pivots for the fence are made of plastic, and do not hold up at all. I've had my jointer for 6 months, used it to make 1 face frame, and put it away. I went to use it again today and the right pivot gave out - completely worthless. I'll have to wait and see if they'll send me the replacement part, or if they'll make me ship the whole thing to them (on my dime of course).It's a great tool when it works, but if it can't get through 2 jobs without breaking, it's a pretty expensive mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't do a joint without it.","review":"If you are going to edge joint, or just about any other kind of jointery work, this is the machine for you. Even though Norm uses the big red machine, this PC will do just about anything you want. The only weak spot I have found in two years of use is the chip bag needs to be emptied after 15 or so cuts for a number 20 biscut. The joints are as strong as the wood, something I found out the hard way after forgitting how I had joined a face frame part and distroying the piece before it came apart. It may cost a little more than the compitetion, but the 135 degree feature makes it worth the cost if you are going to biscut join miters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Lamello","review":"I had the old style porter cable plate jointer and a friend of mine bought a new 557 and I was going to buy a 557 until I used his. The problems with the 557 is the open fence area makes it difficult to bisquit narrow with pieces. I had to use a plywood scrap under the fence to use on narrow pieces.My friends 557 has end play on the on the blade and this makes for sloppy bisquit slots. My friend also said that he has a difficult time keeping the slots all the same height from the top of the fence down to the slot. Over all I was not impressed. I sent and e-mail to Porter Cable but they didn't respond. I bought a Lamello Classic 2.

CD a little pricy.","review":"Never Too Far is one of the best songs in Glitter. I particularly like it to have amply displayed Mariah's flexible vocal capabilities and her wide range (it's scary, the range). Lyrics are pretty morose but she sang it with consummate skill and emotions, making it really moving. A beautiful ballade. However, Loverboy Remix and Don't Stop appear lousy beside Never Too Far. Don't Stop has been frequently derided for its minimal Mariah-touch. She merely sings no more than 5 lines (I think) which I can't hear clearly. Loverboy is, well, not as good as Heartbreaker. More than 10 bucks for this single... Recommend you buy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to Parenting a Diabetic Child","review":"I read this book as I sat beside my 13 year old daughter's hospital bed-- she had just been diagnosed with diabetes. It presented important information in a much more user-friendly way than the formal diabetic education we were receiving. It showed the challenges we would face, and helped me understand more the impact on the entire family.I highly encourage all of those involved with diabetic children to read this book.

It was a very interesting perspective from a 32nd degree mason who gave a series of lectures in new york at the turn of the 20th century. In it he describes our modern religion in terms of the symbolic ideas as well as the literal meaning. He analyzes the new testament and the life of Jesus and claims that all religions have connections to secret societies and it is necessary to understand the secrets of these societies to understand religious works and religion from this perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I made the purchase...","review":"This is a great shopping bag.

The dimensions that are given are for the bag prior to being washed. In other words, the canvas was not preshrunk before the bag was assembled. The bag shrunk in size by over an inch in width and height. I have several other canvas bags, so I know how to care for canvas bags. They are to be washed in cold water and hung to dry. The canvas material used in making these bags was very thin and inferior.

I just thought it could have been written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reference Handbook","review":"This is exactly that, a REFERENCE HANDBOOK.

It is much quieter than I expected. I can't help but say a quality vac all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Bother With Context","review":"The author like so many others lumped all Christian denominations and seeminingly monotheistic religions together as one. No, not all Christians are the same.

It wasn't about the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and dislike of Aileen Wuornos. He has a real problem with women, lesbians in particular. He made Ms. Wuornos out to be someone she wasn't. She had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but that wasn't what this book was about. Again, it wasn't worth the $. I actually threw my copy of this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book","review":"I was going to buy this book, but when I looked at the inside and how it was written, I decided not to.

Also about Aileen and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Expensive Cookies","review":"Good tasting cookies, with unique flavors.

Very little content followed the book and worse yet it made Mary Ingles 800+ mile journey home look like a short hike in the woods. Her journey home is a remarkable story of human endurance and determination but you would never have any idea of what she and the old Dutch woman actually endured by watching this movie. It's a great injustice to a very remarkable and true story. As another reviewer stated \\"Bland at best\\". Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"What a watered down, sugar coated telling of this powerful story! The enormity of the physical struggle to walk 6 weeks in the wilderness was portrayed with slightly mussed hair (with a few twigs thrown in) and a spotlessly clean blue frock with ruffled sleeves. In the book, Mary was reduced to stark nakedness and her hair had turned white. This was a very poor rendition of the book and it must surely be an embarassment to the author. The sugar-coated ending with the chief returning the perfectly intact children was the final straw. Arrrgh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric Schweig, The Only Reason To Watch This!","review":"This was a horrible movie! If you believe what you see on Dr.Quinn, you'll love it. If you know better however, you will be very disappointed, as I was. Sheryl Lee overacted her way all through this film. I pity Eric Schweig having to share the screen with her. However, Schweig remains the only true reason to bare out this film. While his acting talents were hardly tapped by this \\"The Olson Twins Survive an Indian Raid\\" type script, he was the most believable character. This story, like Schweig, has so much potential in a film medium. Too bad Hallmark did this with it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland at best","review":"A Hallmark Hall of Fame production, this made for TV movie has about as much true emotion as a typical Hallmark card.The Indians are not frightening. The women, after being prisoners on the trail for days, look like they had just stepped from the shower in fresh clothes. They mostly happily smile at each other, except during the requisite Emotional Outbursts and Tellings Off. The escape lacks even a modicum of tension. The whole film drips Sincerity.Eric Schweig, a good actor, is wasted.The best that this film has going for it is that it is inoffensive. Just like a Hallmark card.Maybe the book will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal for the money","review":"I have been using this vacuum for about 3 weeks.I have 2 dogs that shed a lot. With the adjustable heights it does a nice job on both carpets and hardwood floors. The hose suction has more than enough power to clean tight areas. Light weight and easy to push.

Bissell June 2005 - April 2006","review":"This vacuum worked well at first and it was great not to have to deal with bags. A few months ago the vacuum started smelling awful and got increasingly loud. We cleaned out the filter and the rolling brush which was a pain. Soon after, the belt broke and the rolling brush melted into the part that was holding it in place. It still has suction, but it doesn't help unless I'm only using the attachments. I called a service center and the parts would have to be ordered and costed more than what we paid for the vacuum. Needless to say, we're now buying a new one. It had a good run, almost lasted a year, but I did expect more from a Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"not completely satisfied","review":"I used the vacuum 3 times when a piece broke. I called Bissel and they said to take it to be fixed, because it was warranted for 90 days. I said I had no papers, they said no problem. I took it to be fixed and it would have cost me almost as much as the vacuum, so I didn't get it fixed. Not Happy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought one of this junk from Walmart with higher price and the belt driving the little brushes for carpet cleaning broke after 3~4 times using.The sealing of the dust collecting compartment is another problem.

Yet unlike the tremendous breadth and depth of Paul B. Newman's far more engagingly written \\"Daily Life in the Middle Ages,\\" Dyer's book seems to be as much about justification for why Dyer's view of life in the middle ages is accurate as about actual medieval life. This book is written more for the academic who cares deeply about sources for what is known than what is known itself, and the dry style and format (intro, argument, conclusion, and lots of footnotes, charts and tables) won't win many fans outside academia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read in bites.","review":"As the other reviewer stated, ELiME is typical Dyer, thoroughly sourced and thought provoking. Dry enough however to be read in portions over several weeks with your favorite libation.As to the other reviewer who commented \\"...marketed to a general audience...\\" uh..what?I think no one here is under the illusion any of Dyer's books will be recommended by Oprah's book club.As for dismissing sourcing, you do a disservice to those who labour over such time intensive minutiae. I'd rather have period sources that you can see, than contemporary supposition on 'facts' alluded to or gleaned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too useful","review":"The phrases are rarely used except the most common which can be looked up.

They are generally a waste of time. If one observes how most foreigners speak English when they visit us, we might try to emulate them when we go abroad. Italian is not a particularly difficult language to learn; there are many cognates with English....and Spanish and French. You will enjoy foreign travel so much more if your vocabulary can be extended beyond \\"Where is the Post Office\\". In fact, with laptops and e-mail, no one really uses the post office very much these days.

Any time we wanted to look up a word it wasn't in there (first example coming to mind, BLACK! - it was in the Italian to English, but you'd have to be translating that direction only). It's good for a laugh and has funny translations, like slow down the car or i will vomit, but realistically, will you really use that (OK, in Italy if not elsewhere, but it's not something you'd look up at that moment feeling that way).

I thought that all of the other films I have seen that were based on Arriaga's screenplays--Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Babel, The Burning Plain--were very good, some excellent, and all genuinely thought provoking, so I was really looking forward to this one. No such luck. As others observed, there was too much sex and it was pointless. The story was threadbare--whether Arriaga's own screenplay or the inadequate realization by the director is to blame, I have no idea--but, what was most maddening, there were enough little elements promising more than was delivered to make this film especially disappointing.Unless you are writing a thesis on Arriaga and are obligated to see everything that has his signature, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad: there is no conflict in this story","review":"This movie is bad. Let me explain why:First of all, the DVD box says it has Dolby Digital 5.1, but it sounds as if it were Dolby Surround, I mean you'll only get sound from the 3 front speakers, nothing will come from rear in this movie.There's no conflict in this story, the main character is not forced to make decisions, to sacrifice something to achieve his goals, he doesn't even have a goal, he doesn't develop, he isn't confronted with somebody or something, he just spend the whole movie having sex with every girl that appears. The story takes you nowhere.There are a lot of uncomfortable silences between the characters and the dialogs are very stereotyped. Don't waste your money and time watching this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Night Buffalo","review":"I just finished reading this book and it is a TERRIBLE book. I bought it for $1 and read the back, thinking it would be somewhat good and it was a complete waste of my time. I don't understand how this book was even published. And a DVD too?

The result is a book filled with excellent stories that force the reader to reflect on his or her own experiences with race. While reading, I realized that people of color experience most life events in the context of race - while most \\"white\\" people experience life without giving much thought to race. This book is not accusatory, but it is a wake up call. If some of us spend a little more time considering the effects of race in our society, perhaps others will be a little more free to think about it less. I sincerely hope this personal reflection will help me be a better friend and better member of our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD SERVICE","review":"I never received this item because was sold out, they debit my credit card and I haven't the credit in my credit card yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a band member's sister","review":"I love this band so much, because it reminds me of my childhood, and my brother was the singer in Sometimes I Hate You, that song makes me cry and so do some of the other songs...

A particular favorite is Track 4, a glorious 4 minutes and 10 seconds of breathing rhythm and riveting jazz action that is completely unique and practically unheard of in today's series television. An added bonus is the accompanying 24-page booklet that details the musical - and artistic - efforts necessary to provide each set of episode tracks.

(I do carry a small step stool to make it easier to tie-down the boat.) This product comes with quick draw bow and stern tie downs so you do not need to order a separate set unless you want to have a spare.

This is a great product. It does what it advertises and seems solidly built -- and fits my Toyota factory rails perfectly. Setting it up the first time took ~60 - 90 minutes of playing around. If I use all of the straps (provided) it takes 30 minutes to fully load the kayak and go. If I skip the front and back safety straps for very short slow speed trips it takes ~ 20 minutes.I put the kayak up on the roof without any assistance -- and adjusting its position is very easy. Once up on the roof the front \\"set\\" section really holds the kayak in place (when combined with the ratchet cables provided).

I have to agree with the 2007 review. I've listened to this recording both in this release and in its incarnation in the Essential Sibelius compilation, also from BIS. Heard over my reference-quality headphones, the string tone is quite annoyingly nasal compared to the vast majority of orchestral recordings even to other recordings from these performers (such as the Sibelius symphonies, also on BIS). Given the importance of the strings in Sibelius orchestrations, there are other, better-sounding recordings of these pieces that serve the music much better, such as the bargain box of the complete tone poems conducted by Neeme J?rvi(Deutsche Grammophon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Quake, different experience","review":"Surprisingly I never got a chance to play the original on the computer, but the N64 version seems to portray the insanity well. As I understand it the weapons, enemies and level textures are the same, but the actual level designs are N64-exclusive, which is a neat touch. Much like the first Quake it's not a thinking man's shooter like Perfect Dark or GoldenEye, but there are some surprising elements such as the enemies that take potshots at you in their death throes. And while there's no online component, it offers a commendable split-screen experience.The N64 did well with shooters, and Quake II is a solid addition to the library. My only real gripe is with the series itself; from this point on we lost the moody Gothic feel of the original for something much more sci-fi.

Nothing generally monumental aside from the detination center and stroggos lab levels, which churn your gut and offer a deep, lost feeling of despair. It had a hint of goldeneye, as well as the original quake control style. I wish that the music and enviorments had a higher creepout factor, as seen and heard in QUAKE 64. Could have used a few more levels. Also, the expansion pak usage for this game is hardly noticible. All in all, it is mpressive as a game, not to much as a sequal though.

A wide assortment of ships (X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-wing, Air Speeder, etc.), different levels of play (ground & air targets), & diverse missions (search & destroy, escort, defend) make game play interesting for children & adults alike.

I felt alone, lost, and hopeless without purpose.This book really helped me learn alot about how I got to be in the place where I was and how not to ever get there again moreover it helped chase away all my feelings of sadness and hopelessness and gave me a new perspective on life by giving me a daily dose of strength and encouragement to go on through the word of Jesus Christ and the many talented writers that contributed their unique and inspirational way of interpreting God's plan B for us all.If you are going through a tough time in your life and things just don't seem to be going your way.....I highly recommend this book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book","review":"I wanted the God Always has a Plan B by Hallmark and I got a different book in the mail with the same title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, as promised","review":"These geoboards have been GREAT for our home preschool time.

It starts out with a sunny premise -- Qwill decides he and the cats need some quiet time to reflect, so that's how he ends up in the bucolic Potato Mountains. The trip begins with Qwill getting lost on the mountain's long and winding roads. The house is bigger and more foreboding than he expected or wanted, and it turns out to be the site of a murder. It rains all the time, often accompanied by power outages. You get the idea. The mystery is intriguing and the story is filled with new, eccentric characters. Best of all, I thought I knew early on \\"whodunnit,\\" and I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CAT WHO MOVED A MOUNTAIN","review":"I LOVE ALL THE LILIAN JACKSON BRAUN CAT SERIES. THIS IS NOT THE BEST ONE BUT I DID ENJOY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"That cat THAT was a leftie!","review":"This was my last book: I can no longer stand Mrs. Braun's leftwing, environazi diatribes! She started quite mildly, with the use of \\"Ms.\\"--although for women known to be married or single--than evolved to perorations on smoking, economy cars and food. (I won't be there to see how long she'll allow Qwil to drink coffee!) She then started elaborating more, with the use of rainforest, wetlands, until this book, where the envirohippies are the good guys and the regular people are the bad ones. The climax is Qwil getting more and more annoying with his unsolved sentimental affairs--a man his age should have already solved his fear of marriage!--and his ultra-pampering of two ultra-egotistic cats. I got enough of her non-sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe what I've been missing!","review":"I discovered the \\"cat books\\" at a used paperback store where I was searching for back issues of Mary Higgins Clark's books for my grandaughter. The proprietor told me that I should try one of the cat books. At first, the book's size and title turned me off -- I thought it was more of a child's book. Was I EVER wrong! I was capitivated from the first sentence to the last sentence. The characters are warm and believable and the plot was intricate enough to hold my interest. I went back to the used book store and bought the 8 others. Now I'm fixed for summer reading. MORAL: Don't judge a book by its thickness or title."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start!","review":"The Cat Who Moved a Mountain was my first meeting with Qwill and his savvy cats. This flowed extremely well and left me meowing for more of the delightful characters. Lilian Jackson Braun uses a broad vocabulary that would not be intimidating to any reader, yet it keeps the reading interesting for those of us that love neat words. Braun does not include gory details and she does not include \\"adult situations\\" either. This discretion makes this book as well as the others in her series suitable for all ages. The Cat Who Moved A Mountain followed a very contemporary plot and held my attention to the very last page. The characters were rich and warm, and they all were written with a hint of ulterior motive. I strongly recommend this book--even if you are not a cat lover, you will appreciate the light, airy movement of this mystery and you'll be rushing to Amazon to order a few more in the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"real living","review":"This book is about a person I actually know, and who I first met in 1954.

The Ewbank Multi-Sweep is a solid, well built appliance. However, if you have pets, you will find that it takes more time cleaning the sweeper than it does to actually sweep the room. The Ewbank does pick up pet hair most effectively but emptying it is a bit awkward. You need to take a rag to clean out both dirt trays and then you need a small tooth comb to pull the hair out of the brushes and the wheels. To do a proper cleaning takes quite a bit of time. My old Bissell is easier to clean when it comes to pet hair and it does a great job.If you do not have pets, I would recommend this product because it is definitely well made and for small cleanups, it would suffice. For those who complain about appliances being made of plastic, unfortunately, these days, that's the norm. It's not great and plastic definitely does not hold up but, sadly, product quality is no longer a priority in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumps as fast as it picks up!","review":"This broom just spit the dirt out as fast as it picked it up.

In his world, wives are subordinate to their husbands, even if the husband is physically or emotionally abusive. In his world, it is not \\"suffer the little children to come unto me\\" but beating them with plastic tubing. Furthermore, his depiction of so-called \\"Biblical womanhood\\" conveniently overlooks such strong Biblical women as Deborah, Bathsheba, and even Mary, Jesus' mother. I am very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Bad Edition [Penguin]","review":"This is my favorite book. I've been through three different copies: a now out-of-print Classics Club copy, the Loeb Classics Library copy with the original Latin facing the English text, and this Penguin edition. The Penguin is by far the worst of those three. Among its faults is the fact that it's translated into prose, which makes for an easier read but in the end dumbs down the text and reduces it in beauty; and while the footnotes are sometimes informative, most of them I find insulting to both the reader's and Lucretius's intelligence. Go with the Loeb, or some other edition; chances are it's better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a better translation!","review":"Do not buy this book.

The power point slides have errors that do not tie to the examples from the text. The authors need to pay closer attention to updating, or hire someone else to do it for them.

Overall finish is well done, though on mine there's some noticeable imperfections in the finish and the binding around the neck and nut. A few frets high up the neck were sharp on the edges and needed to be filed down. Also would have liked the F-holes to be finished. Mine came with a few cosmetic blemishes but luckily I got it for a discount.- Hardware: 8 out of 10. The pick guard and tailpiece are good quality. The tuners hold a tune but are average in quality.- Tone: 9 out of 10. Very good tone with proper setup. Very clear sounding with good sustain.

The first Tomb Raider was decent, the second was lacking, and this one is basically the two combined with some new graphical specs here and there. And we all know graphics don't make the game, don't we? The game is basically set outdoors most of the time, with some temples here and there of pretty good size, but the sheer amount of frustration put into every level just isn't worth getting angry over. Whether it be the extravagant number of gunshots to kill something, or finding that little item on the ground to get you past the current area, you WILL get stuck and you WILL get frustrated way too much then it should be.

I recommend this game because it stands out from the rest of this series with bigger and beautifully rendered worlds that provide lots of entertaining moments, and it also has two new moves for Lara such as the cool monkey swing and a crawl feature which makes it a more challenging game. But I also have to say that this is a complicated game and for some of those big worlds you'll definitely need to use a strategy guide or you'll get lost and eventually irritated by this game. For those who weren't thrilled by the other games in this series I advise you to stay away from this one because you'll find out that it's \\"more of the same\\" and for the uninitiated this game should be a great way to inmerse yourselves into the phenomenon that is Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider games."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is excellent!","review":"Of all the TR games I've played thus far, TR3 is the best!

Explore all sorts of worlds including the awesome city tops of London in the pouring rain! This game is NOT for the inexperienced player.

Let's hope they excel at customer service so I can write a better review...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking Clock ......but","review":"Received the clock, installed new batteries and within a few hours it had obtained the signal and was working fine. Next morning, however, I found the sweep (seconds) hand had stopped even though the clock was keeping correct time (hours/minutes). I was able to tap it several times to get it going again but alas the sweep hand kept stopping. I replaced the batteries with a new set and same result. I ended up sending it back to Amazon for a replacement (defective). When the replacement arrived, one corner of the shipping box was smashed in and also the corner of the clock box also. Unfortunately, the clock was destroyed.....broken glass face and one of the hands was badly bent. Gee, I really did want the clock, but after two attempts, I gave up and sent the replacement back and asked for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this clock","review":"This is the households second Lacrosse Technology 16 Inch Atomic Metal Analog Metal Wall Clock - WT-3161WH.

Twilight Eyes Is the very best as well as the hardest book to put down.

It is my least favorite of anything he has ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me explain as if part of the book Twilight Eyes...","review":"...That every possible item, each character, all emotions and every action is repeatedly examined in excruciating detail from all possible angles and then reiterated at least twice. That nothing is ever left un-spoken (or un-written). That the descriptions of even the most inconsequential events continue for page, after page, after page. That the character dialogue and conversational banter chatter on and on like a mountain stream endlessly flowing to become the mighty Amazon before dumping its long winded babble into an ocean of excessive words......If this was actually a excerpt from the book, the verb-age concerning TOO MANY WORDS would go on for at least 5 or 6 more pages...Get the massage?... No?... Then read the book. All will be explained... IN DETAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea .... Poor Execution.","review":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet...uh... alright sour. Dean Koontz is a second rate author, he can be lumped in with other successful hackhorror writers (King,Saul,Laymon) who cater to the blue collar mentality or better put, the easily entertained. This book like all Koontz's books starts off good ,wanes in the middle,and falls flat on it's face in the end. His books are so cliche ridden and predictable that I have to cover my eyes in disbelief and think the horror of it all. Read Clive Barker, Simon Clark, Phil Rickman, or anybody for that matter instead. HORRIBLY UNORIGINAL! would have been a more appropriate title"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most fantastic books ever written ....","review":"Just fantastic, read it! Set in the sixties, ah the memories! (Though I was born in 77) But whatever, if this is what are parents lived through then I'm glad I missed out! Slim McKenzie - what a guy, still probably saving the world as we speak. Just take a chance! Though I'm not sure why anyone would ponder the potential of a $6 book. One of Koontz's best though. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you there right along with the story!","review":"As a child, I traveled on the carnival. When I read this book, I am right there. I can smell the diesel from the machines/equipment and the sugar from the cotton candy. It is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book, but definetly not one of Koontz's best","review":"Twilight Eyes was hardly a page turner, or a \\"go tell all your friends to read it\\" book, but it was not purely awful at the same time. Twilght Eyes was, to me, a rather boring piece of work from Koontz, and it was not very thrilling. Sure a twisted romance novel like this may intrest a few, but it did nothing for me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnivals are scary!","review":"This book proves why carnivals are scary. What's funny is that as you're reading- the plot seems possible! An insane man lurking in the dark shadows...This is a classic Koontz book. If you're looking for something freaky, crazy & suspenseful, this book will do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unclassifiable Horror","review":"I feel a synopsis of the book has already been done many times in other reviews so I will give my opinion on the book. By unclassifiable horror, I mean this book was not quite horror. Not quite science fiction. Not quite romance. Not quite thriller. It was a combination of these things built around a very down to earth breed of characters that everyone can relate to. I gave this book five stars because I enjoy long, detailed explanations of the tiniest element. The kind of book that just wouldn't be as good as a movie. Much like an Anne Rice book. There's too much subtext and detail to accurately transform to visual. But that's why it's such a good book. I am totally NOT a reader, i can count the novels i've read on one hand. And this being the fifth, (second Koontz) I must say this is the best. You feel the feelings and the thoughts. It is very easy to visualize exactly what is happening. So, do yourself a favor and read Twilight Eyes by Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, thanks","review":"I just re-read this as an adult, 15 years after reading it as a teenager. What a difference that made! Hoo, boy, does Mr Koontz like the sound of his own keyboard clicking away.There's some actual genius in the basic idea; that the most loathsome of human behaviour is not actually human at all (I suppose we'd all like to think that). But there's absolutely no excuse for the convoluted, torturous stuff that passes for his dialogue.An example, if you like:\\"I can still feel you within me, your seed, still so hot inside me, burning. I'll take it to bed with me, curl myself around the heat of your seed, and it'll be like a watchfire through the night, keeping the bad dreams away. No graveyards tonight, Slim. No, not tonight.\\"YEAH, CAUSE THAT'S HOW PEOPLE TALK.Idea? Muted yay. Execution? BOO. BOO. BOOOO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Eyes: What a Canival of Terror!","review":"You'll be pulled-in further as each page turns.A great piece of writing; as it slyly weaves together the behind-the-scenes life of society outcasts together with believable goblins, and frail human sacrifice and caring.Get ready to take the slow roller-coaster of terror; suspense and drama before the decent, and be ready as the cutting-edge chills will whiplash you with no mercy to the final chapter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Awesome!","review":"It's been a while since I read Twilight Eyes, but it's the sort of thrill that never leaves you! It was awesome, total first person, in-your-face, edge of your seat, cheer for the good guy, share the drama, hope we survive kind of thrill that belongs in an MTV commercial or Die Hard episode! Oh, did I say that it was awesome? Totally! Koontz seems to have two kinds of books: Really really good, and the \\"what on earth was that\\"s. Twilight Eyes was definitely really really good. Let me also recommend for the first time Koontz readers a few more: Lightening, Midnight, and Strangers! And oh yeah, Twilight Eyes is awesome! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh ye of little faith...","review":"By the time I read this Koontz tale, I had come to expect a frenetic pace and a quick, gripping page turner. You die-hards know what I'm talking about: boom! boom! boom!- pulse pounding, blood-pressure raising action coming at you on a constant, unrelenting basis. I didn't find that here. In fact, for the first time I quite nearly abandoned reading a Koontz, thinking it may just be a dud. Which is, quite honestly, unthinkable!Mayyyybe I was just having a bad day, because I ended up feeling this was one of Koontz's highest quality tales ever.Oh ye of little faith, please give this one a second chance. You won't be disappointed that you did. One of Koontz's best, and deserves 4-1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly tedious read","review":"I am ususally a Koontz fan but he can get irritably detailed on his details and descriptions. I could only make it through a few chapters of this particular tedium. Do not waste your time. Read a psychology text instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes","review":"OMG! This book was awful! I couldn't wait for it to be overwith. What was Dean thinking. He has written so many good books, but this one stinks! Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pretentious, but still a good read.","review":"Not sure why Koontz always feels the need to write so poetically and use big words, but the scary parts were scary, and that's all that matters to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a departure, but still very good","review":"This book differs from other Koontz novels I have read in that it is written entirely in first person. It was jarring to me at first but if you stick with it the story is rewarding, and every bit as entertaining as it is strange. Basically, the book is about carnies and sideshow freaks vs. some weird goblin creatures set in 1963-1964. The book has plenty of suspense, horror, stabbings in the throat, undead creatures rising from the grave, psychics, and human vs. creature fist fighting around a huge ferris wheel and a bumper car track that ends with even more neck and head stabbing. Weird, but really enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Eyes","review":"I've read them all, every book Mr. Koontz has every written, many more than once. Twilight Eyes is the very best of the best of them. Glad to see they have re-published this one, so a whole new bunch of Koontz fans can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing ending","review":"I've read two of Koontz' novels. It seems he often comes up with an interesting premise, which in the scond half of the book is ruined by preposterous and anti-climatic endings. I felt the same way about 'Cold Fire.'When the true nature of the Goblins is reaveled in this book, I thought to myself 'is that all they really are?' My imagination had dreamed up all sorts of interesting ideas only to be shot down by Koontz' less than amazing imagination.Perhaps Koontz fans like these sort of endings, but they are not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight Eyes","review":"The main character, Slim Mackenzie, lives in a carnival and has the ability to see the true nature of people. He sees goblins posing as humans with the intentions of wiping out the human race. I loved the fact that Dean Koontz went into such detail when describing the characters. You really feel as if you can see them standing in front of you. Slim was an exciting and alive character; also Rya and Joel Tuck were great characters. This was a well-written and fast-paced book, but I found it very hard to buy into. When the true nature of the book was brought out, I thought to myself is that all they really are?I was disappointed with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time","review":"This is a very thin plot padded with lots of sex and terrifying descriptions of goblins.

I cant speak for it's long term use but overall we could'nt be more pleased with this purchase. A few of the features we were pleased to get were night vision and sound, which both work well. In total darkness images in the center of the screen are impressivly bright. Picture has 420 TV lines, 0 Lux w/ IR LED, 0.2 LUX w/o IR LED. But for other areas you may want to install an additional light. Installation was a breeze, everything you need to start monitoring comes with this, except the VCR. The camaras are smaller than we expected(1.5\\"W x 1.5\\"D x 5\\"L), which is a plus for hanging them dicreatly. The 14\\"monitor comes with video imput, has a 2 to 20 second dwell time on each channal, 2 channels total, and states that operating tempurature for the system 32 to 104 degrees F.

Two, because the first was a light weight model that couldn't handle the stress of slicing a strawberry. The cutting wire separated from the frame on it's first use. It was replaced by the Leifheit; a heavy brute capable of dispatching all comers, eggs, strawberries and mushrooms alike. Depending on the size of the egg, the slicer made up to ten even slices with only the slightest pressure. Ditto for the strawberries and mushrooms. Good buy, great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best egg slicer I've owned","review":"I went through a number of egg slicers, only to fine that the wires broke or bent and THEN broke in relatively rapid fashion. One year, I went through 3 slicers. When I took the time to do the reaearch, I found the Leifheit and am now in bliss. It is substantial and the wires are durable. My only problem with it is that you need to gently wash the wires immediately after use or they are difficult to clean. If you put it in the dishwasher, you probably wouldn't have that problem but I hand wash mine. I highly recommend this product. I'm buying one for my sister today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I struggled through many pages of product reviews and descriptions before I finally decided to purchase this particular brand. Why? Because I didn't have a clue on which brand was good or bad, many of the reviews for mushroom/egg slicers were mixed, so I took a stab in the dark, and came up a winner!! This is a great product, stores easily, and works well. The curve where you put the mushroom (or egg) is just the right size and is just a wonderful time saver! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Egg Slicer","review":"Recently the egg slicer I've been using forever finally gave up it's last slice. I bought one from a local home store but took it back when the slicers broke the first time I used it. I LOVE Amazon and tried my luck. I was not disappointed. Cuts smoothly and cleanly each time.

They were the ones who sent photos of Pearl, etc. Throughout the movie, all we get is: \\"Did you see a foreigner in front of the Village Restaurant?\\" Boring. There needed to be more drama and tension. I don't consider winding up in \\"dead ends\\" to be drama and tension.

The acting is quite realistic. The dialogue is almost flawless. There isn't a false moment in this film. Hollywood may have come calling, but this came out very true to its somber subject matter. We are never really sure why Daniel Pearl would risk his life just for yet another newspaper article that would be instantly forgotten. That aspect of the waste of his life is never mentioned.

Although heavily edited, to the point where many of it's rich performances are sacrificed for the film's kinetic pace -- the effect seems to accurately recreate the urgency of Pearl's kidnapping without turning it into an episode of 24. Moreover, it was also refreshing to see the efforts of the Pakistani police force portrayed as being stuck in the middle of an endless political divide -- much like the Pearls and the countless number of bystanders tragically affected by terrorism.

Why would the writer of this movie write a line such as this and put it in a movie? Is the writer truly trying to tell us something about the jews and 911?.

The true story of the death of Daniel Pearl is heartbreaking, but not necessarily a prime of example of terrific dramatic material for a movie. In fact, this movie is incredibly dull. It's got a lot of heart at the center and, as I said, the real story is heartbreaking...There's nothing really great about the film version though. Even Angelina Jolie (who's performance has been highly regarded in film reviews) isn't TERRIFIC here. She doesn't quite get under the skin of Mariane Pearl, Daniel's wife...Plus, she's sporting a fake French accent that fades in-and-out through the movie. Everyone behind the making of the film had good intentions, but the film is really incredibly uninteresting.GRADE: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This movie was so hard to get interested in...

It is a difficult film because we know how the search for the missing man turns out. (He is beheaded.) Nevertheless, it is a story of triumph of spirit. The search team (with Mariane at the center) is composed of various races and cultures who work together in a demonstration of love, cooperation, and courage - ultimately countering the anti-Semitic terrorists' hate-filled act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of Darkness","review":"Ordered flashlight twice.

There's some great music here, much of which isn't Bluegrass at all, but old-time Country Music (e.g. Gid Tanner, Uncle Dave Macon, Charlie Poole, etc). But Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers, and Flatt & Scruggs account for 50+ cuts. There isn't a single inclusion by Reno & Smiley, The Osborne Brothers, Jim & Jesse, The Country Gentlemen, Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, Jimmy Martin, Mac Wiseman and others, however.

I read the other reviews prior to purchasing the full set. I am so glad I did. If I hadn't been aware that there was a learning curve to reading the Hours I would have been very frustrated and would probably given it up as too hard. It definately does take some insruction to use it. Because of this I bought several books of instruction in the Hours. The very best is \\"The Divine Office for Dodos\\". What an outstanding book!

Don 't mess with any other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liturgy of the Hours","review":"Liturgy of the Hours and the Divine Office, as presented in this beautiful and useful publication, is a powerful prayer. Praying it everyday allows the person praying to become immersed in prayer at all times throughout the day. The product itself is nicely produced and fairly easy to utilize, once some basic knowledge is gleaned. No extra books are really needed. I had ordered The Divine Office for Dodos but found it almost to be insulting me...because my breviary (this copy of the Divine Office) makes it very easy to pray. So just order this 4 book series and get going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, quality books","review":"For those who want to pray the Liturgy, these books are beautifully bound and the print is large enough for us older readers to use!

I don't pretend it should be used as a course for either quantum mechanics or functional analysis. It is at a level way above that necessary for quantum mechanics and it does not cover enough material to be a serious textbook for functional analysis.That said at 15$ it is a great addition to any library. A reader can move through the book and really get an understanding of the topics presented. The books by Reed and Simon are a must for any mathematical physicist but they can sometimes be intimidating. The material presented here is relevant and presented in a very straightforward manner. If you have a background in analysis and wish to learn more about quantum mechanics I would definitely recommend this book. Another possible use is as an additional text in a functional analysis course so students can see direct applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, Product but not as good as I expected.","review":"The circles were sprayed on and smugged and the anttenna's would not stand up as protrayed in the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glow Stix...sort of.","review":"Overall, a great product, but the glow feature is not all it's cracked up to be. The glow is fairly dim and requires a nearly pitch black night to be visible. You also need to play with the stix in the sun for 30 minutes in order to get 4-6 hours of glow. The problem I have is that I work all day, and when I get home, there isn't a whole lot of sun left! That's just me though, I get the feeling not all stix enthusiasts have full time jobs (I could be wrong). Oh, one more problem with the glow - I bought the red and whiteish model, and the glow is noticeably stronger on the white side! I highly recommend buying the solid color for more consistency. There are some positives - they're weighted nicely, and daytime play is dope. They are a bit heavier and shorter than I'm used to (been using crystalstix fiberglass, these are wood), but I'm starting to appreciate the challenge/exercise.

After putting up with the sort of sickening citrus smell and having things off countertop so this stuff could dry for 72 hours...I removed it and there was absolutely no difference--the oil remained as it had. I admit the stains had been there a while and maybe because of that it is more difficult. At any rate it was worth a try but very disappointed that I followed instructions exactly and ended up spending the money and the time for no results...if it had at least faded the stains it would not have been so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Don\`t Expect A Miracle","review":"We had light colored granite installed in our kitchen earlier this year. Just one day (and already three oil stains) later we realized that those had not been properly sealed by the seller/installer.

Of course I wanted to get rid of the stains completely, so I purchased this product. Sadly it did not make any further difference. At least it did not make things worse, which was a real fear. Seeing how slowly the solvent evaporates you better have nerves of steel. From reading through the reviews here it seems that the folks having the most success using this product are those with darker counters. We have now sealed our counters with SenGuard. It\`s supposedly a one-time application. After three months of heavy duty use I would give SenGuard ten stars.

If you listen to it, you can hear all those great elements that make Boston so great. A female vocalist was added to the band, and actually her voice is amazing. However, I think that there has been too much change to the group, with added members and song writing coming from some of the new members. The production is ok, sound quality etc. I think the bottom line is that the songs, and some of the arrangements, are just not very good.

Tom Scholz screwed up when he walked away from his original band members years ago - especially BRAD DELP - who he's reinstated here for the obvious.

I could go on with a track by track analysis of this mess, but what's the point? It's just not worth the time for me to write and you to read. By all means, stay far away from this ...! Too bad it's not possible to give this a zero or negative rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited 8 years for this?","review":"The first track is the only song that resembles Boston. In all honesty, these guys should have hung it up after \\"Don't Look Back\\". The CD is scattered and eclectic, with none of the great guitar and vocal harmonies of old. The pseudo dance beat on one of the songs had me reaching for the remote, if not the eject button. Perhaps a whole CD of Brad Delp's vocals would make it more appealing, or a reunion of the original line up. This CD will eventually end up in the used bin for $.99 and still not sell. How do I know? Mine is already there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry---not the Boston songs of old","review":"I took a chance and purchased this CD before reading any reviews or listening to any samples. After all this is Boston, and I love all of their music, until now. This CD is absolutely terrible. There are no songs in the spirit of Smokin', Cool the Engines, Long Time, Don't Look Back, or any other Boston favs. I cannot believe how bad this CD turned out, and I am disappointed that Tom and Brad would take our money. Just my opinion, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen up, you critical people","review":"Alright, opinions and preferences are one thing, but bashing something as great as the new Boston CD is childish to say the least. You may not like it~May not be able to let go and evolve as a person, like Scholtz did. Imagine the risk he took to create this new CD? He could have made JUST as much money pumping out another same-sounding Boston album as the previous, but he didn't. He took a risk. And, with this risk comes a new sound and a very modern and original sound. Some people bash it because they have eating potatoes all their lives, and when it comes to something different they say, \\"Hey man, this ain't potatoes, this stinks!\\" It's really pathetic that people desires are as limited as these.Trust me, if you buy this CD you will be shocked. But, you will grow to like it. And who doesn't like an expierence where you can grow from? Just hope you aren't one of the mean potato eaters..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Lame!","review":"I've been a BOSTON fan for 20 years and love their first 4 Albums(Yes I thought Walk On was alright)But, this is just ridiculous. There is only one good song in the LP and that's \\"I Had A Good Time\\" I actually like the song alot, but that is it. The other songs are as exciting as watching grass grow in the winter. It is so uninspired. Mr. Scholz needs to stick with Brad Delp and go back to their musical roots. That means those killer hard rock guitar riffs, and melodic guitar solos. A couple of years ago a rock station from here in Dallas did a live interview with Tom Scholz. It was a live feed from Dallas to Tom's Hideaway Studio II. During the interview Tom ran his guitar through his ROCKMAN amp and HYPER SPACE PEDAL. Man Tom played some totally awsome stuff. If only he would have lay down those guitar riffs to tape, and used them for this album, it would have made a huge difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rock With A Modern Twist...","review":"Corporate America is a long awaited album from the classic rock band boston. This is boston's 5 studio release not counting there greatest hit's record. Corporate America is a fantastic album with a unique twist of modern rock and classic rock n roll. This album is under the record company Artemis records which is planning on spending 1 million dollers to promote this album. This album needs no money to promote itself. If your looking for classic rock with a unique modern twist then you have found it... P.S (These song sample's have horrible audio, the CD sounds 100 times better)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it a zero, I would","review":"I loved Boston I. I loved Don't Look Back. I loved Third Stage. (Walk On...eh...) But, listen, Tom...take your tree-hugging liberal crap (and I'm talking about your latest music, not just your political views) and flush it down the drain in your famous basement.

This should not even be called Boston. These are lame songs compared to their first 3 albums. Boston should pay me $14.99 for the 40 minutes of my life I wasted listening to this junk. The music might be decent if it were presented under a different name- but no way does this represent the same band that invented such timeless classics as the first album. They need to hang it up, if this is all they have to offer. Buy some \\"RTZ\\" instead- at least Barry Goudreau remembers what a \\"Rock and Roll\\" band is."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ALBUM EVER!","review":"In spite of the fact that I am completely enamored with Tom Scholz's political views and scathing review of \\"corporate america,\\" I am sorely disappointed in the actual MUSIC. I really wish he had dedicated the rest of his life to the rescue of little furry animals that I confess I like to eat. I sure hope that he is donating all the proceeds from this album to such deserving organizations as Greenpeace, Audabon Society, PETA, Earth Liberation Front, and most notably - the People's Front of Judea! Too bad I can't give this tour de force ZERO STARS... honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't think it could happen...","review":"I've been a huge Boston fan for many years. I have every album they've ever made and eacho of them is a favourite of mine. Then.... I started to get worried when they released their greatest hits album. Two previously unreleased songs contained on that album were junk. I never though it was possible to call a Boston song, even two Boston songs \\"junk\\". Those two songs had me worried for 5 years about what this new release would be like. In one word, \\"garbage\\". A new backup/lead volcalist Kimberly Dahme is impressive and I'd love to here her solo, but she's not Boston. Fran Cosmo's son is now in the band and he may or may not have talent but he's definitely not Boston either.I never thought a band that was so good could sink to this level. I would have given this one star except for the fact that they're Boston and Boston's worst is better than most other bands' best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Enron Boston's Corporate America Goes Bust","review":"I have heard the new Boston album and was thoroughly disappointed with virtually every song. I am a long time Boston fan and as hard as I tried to like this album, it left me feeling as throw away as Enron's corporate pension plan.This album lacks the same spark and imagination of their previous albums. The new members of the band do not ignite any spark to this album with their contributions. For as long as it takes Tom Scholtz to produce albums I would have thought he would have come up with a much more worthwhile effort than this. It's too bad. I was really hoping for Boston to come back and kick some serious rock and roll butt, but not in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","review":"Boston has left many of their old fans behind. We have to wait 8 years between albums, and each one shows the band losing the main focus even more. Boston used to be a heavy rock band. They put out one of the best heavy rock sounds of the mid 70's. They have since split up, put together several low quality reunion lineups, and sucked since '78. Don't get me wrong, I love this band. They just don't have their act together anymore. Really, you only need their first two records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the band that stole Boston's name?","review":"I'm not sure who this band is but they are not the Boston that I've listened to for the past 20 years. Brad Delp's wonderful vocals are rarely heard but even more rare is the defining guitar work that made their early CD's so amazing. I generally like the earth-friendly lyrics but they tend to become a little sappy mid-way through. You'll want to listen to this one before you just go out to buy it. I wish I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"corporate america","review":"I have read a few reviews of the new boston cd and have notice a few of you saying you miss Brad Delps voice. For anyone interested in hearing brad at his best get your hands on a copy of Barry Goudreau's solo album. It was reissued by Razor & Tie in 1996. Brad sings lead on six of the songs and Barry does a fantastic job on guitar. All are great and sound like a Boston release. It was originally release in 1980, it also has Sib Hashian playing drums & percussion. Brad also fronted a band called RTZ from 1991 to 1993 both albums are very respectable, definitly worth the money. Check these three out you will not be dissapointed! As for \\"Corporate America\\" i do not like the drum programming or the way the vocals seem to get lost in the background. There are some redemable songs here, the reason for the two stars, but just not a strong effort overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, very sad","review":"This is one of the worst cases of good gone bad I have ever heard. Many would agree that Boston was a pioneer in creating a whole new rock sound back in the 70's - that music is timeless. I give them credit for that contribution and dont expect any more miracles but this is not fair for paying customers. This is not Boston.This corporate america album sounds like pure poopoo. The drums are not even real! Thats ok for the Eurythmics but not Boston. Its sounds like they used a drum machine to time out the other tracks, but then forgot to actually record the real drums. We got a taste of that on Third Stage, but nothing like this album. Its such a cheese ball sound. Its sounds like something my Mom could do with a four track recorder and a 12\\" casio keyboard.Shame on you Shultz, you could have done better by recording Dont Look Back backwards and giving it a new name. This one is a real dust collector!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Bomb...","review":"What is it? It kinda sounds like Boston, but not really. The drum machine makes me sick to my stomach. Tom, pay a real drummer, your machine needs to be put to bed. 8 years is a long time to wait for anybody to release new material, but this sounds like it was made in 2 weeks. There isn't any conformity to this CD. It's more like a tug-o-war between musical styles and genres. Why so many singers on this CD? Couldn't you make up your mind who should be the lead? It probably didn't matter since you can't hear them anyway. Is that a new concept? The Osmonds already have used the expression...I'm a little bit Country and I'm a little bit Rock-N-Roll, use your own. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't decide if the title is supposed to be irony or not.","review":"How the mighty have fallen. This is easily Boston's worst album, and Walk On was pretty tough to beat. Middling, mid-tempo rockers with faceless robotic vocals, broken up by a few twee power ballads. Boston has never sounded more generic and dare I say, \\"corporate\\" in their entire recorded history. If Brad Delp is actually singing on this album, he is so buried in the mix as to be unrecognizable. About the only interesting thing is the addition of a female vocalist, which adds a touch of warmth to this normally testosterone driven band. She is underutilized, but I give Tom Scholz credit for trying something different.If only the overall album hadn't been so uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm.....What happened to these guys?","review":"I'm not sure where the great rock band of the 80's went to but they are no where to be found on this cd. I guess if you're into N*Sync and groups of that ilk you might like this watered down pseudo pop cheese fest. However if you we're expecting anyting even close to their first two cd's, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple of good songs...","review":"& some that aren't bad. The one good song is I Had A Good Time. More Delp vocals. Try reaching out to Barry Goudreau as well. Stick to power rock. Get rid of the blonde too. Although very hot... unnecessary... & why the Comso father/son duo thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom's lost ...","review":"The first two Boston albums were made by a real band with a real drummer and a real bass player. This is the big difference with what Tom's been doing ever since Third Stage. The Boston Sound ( at least to me)is not only the Rockman ! \\"No synthesizers used\\" used to impress us, but \\"no other musicians used\\" is a lot less convincing. Use it all, Tom, and think about the words of \\"Spirit of radio\\" by Rush:\\"all this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted, not so coldly charted it's really just a question of your honesty\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"A great album! I can't stop listening to it!It may not quite sound like the Boston of old, but who said it had to? Delp's vocals and Scholz's guitars are better than ever. As for the Cosmos and Kimberly Dahme, they aren't original Boston members, but they are very talented musicians and contribute greatly to the band. I don't think there's a bad song on the album. Songs like \\"I Had A Good Time\\" sound like classic Boston tracks. The live version of \\"Living for You\\" is INCREDIBLE! Definitely one of the best albums I've heard in awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I'm a Boston fan from way back. It seems as though with each album they've made, it gets worse as time goes by. I'm at a loss for why, too. Scholz wrote most of the music back in the \\"old days\\" and Fran Cosmo sounds creepily like Brad Delp (for the most part). But this outing is far below par. Far below. The best song on here is Cryin'. It really sounds like they should sound. Cryin' is really a good song. The rest, to me, is filler.Also, all the feel-good environmental, save-the-animals stuff plastered all over the booklet is a big turn off. It comes off as some left-wing baloney to me. I'm all for protecting the environment and unnecessary slaughter of animals, but they go too far in the cd booklet.Of course, those that read this and disagree will have all kinds of nasty things to say. But that's the hallmark of the left today. Disagree with them and they WILL attack.I'm Libertarian, btw, for all the kooks' knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate America","review":"Man, this is bad. I was excited at the time to see a new Boston album. Then I actually bought it and listened, only to regret buying the thing in the first place. One of the few albums I wished I could take and get my money back. Sad. Totally uninspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quo vadis Boston","review":"Where are the powerful voices and crying guitars of the recent years?One of the greatest bands of the late 70s on mid class level - it's a shame.After eight years only nine new titles - I guess Tom Scholz ran out of ideas - this is an abuse of the name Boston to make some money. Something like this without the name Boston would probably not have found a producer or label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money","review":"First off I can not even give this album a \\"1\\"Is it just me or does this album sound like Boston has been de-nutted? This album has no balls at all. I did not think they could make an album as bad as Third Stage.....I was wrong!I hope none of the procedes of the [money]I spent on this turkey went to any of the WWW.Web sites that the boys and girl of Boston needed to share with us on the inside cover.This is what happens when you don't eat red meat!I had to go out and buy the new Ted Nugent Album just to get my head back on straight!Sorry Boston and don't try again please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishwater","review":"A weak and tepid attempt by a once-decent band to reach beyond their short legacy. Instead of sticking with what brought them to the charts, this album takes an abrupt and puzzling left turn.

Better yet, let well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is terrible","review":"Tom, if you want to make music, make music. If you want to save the world, save the world. But Tom, you obviously can't do both at the same time! This CD is terrible. And Kim, she may sing well, but help! She is not at all Boston. And half the songs are written by some new young guitarist? He may be talented, but what happened Tom, the trees in the forest not producing enough oxygen for your brain? I can't believe that one of the greatest bands of all time are having a 20 year old write their songs for them and a girl sing their songs for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Couldn't Be THAT Bad, Could It?","review":"Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Instead of buying this album, I suggest you do something more productive with your money, like throw it in the street.Ugh!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"8 years to produce this??","review":"Do not buy this. It is garbage. Brad Delp is not utilized enough and when he is his vocals are not very audible. Tom Scholz is just out to make a buck on this CD. He put forth no effort and just wants to collect his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar that fills valleys","review":"Obviously there are very mixed opinions here but after heavy play for weeks I have to declare that I love this album. Tom's guitar sings beautifully throughout with a great production and killer tracks.Like some reviewers I thought I only liked half the album - But I still thought it was 5 stars at that point because that half is so good. Now I like them all except track 2. An album that needs a number of listens - the louder the better.In many ways this maybe my favourite Boston album. A brilliant band and when those guitars crank up to full power - for me I guess it's more than a feeling. Hopefully we will have another disc before 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try it ,you might like it","review":"Contrary to alot of reviews i'm seeing online, i have to say that this recording is growing on me. Anyone who is a true Boston fan and has had their bowels shaken by that seismic live organ sound should find this collection of tunes enjoyable. I think this is a very transitional time for Scholz and his present crew. They are exploring some different avenues of expression and I say more power to them. There are a couple of moments here that leave one bewildered,like The title track....that disco pulsing rhythm has got to go Tom! And the \\"stare out your window tune\\" is like a blatant oasis rip off. My favs are (of course) the songs Brad delp sings . The ballad Kimberly sings is a beautiful song and i think her inclusion into the band is a bold and intersting move.And for all her detractors.. that song aint country. Its just a great song.I cant wait to hear what they do next.The main thing is..Boston lives on...All hail tom Scholz!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand it to Boston","review":"Boston never ceases to amaze me. Each successive album is so different and so far between. I have listened to this album nonstop for the past week and here are my conclusions: This album overall is pretty mediocre, but it has three of the best rock songs I've ever heard on it: \\"I had a good time\\"; \\"Someone\\"; \\"You gave up on love\\". Certainly three of Boston's top hits. While first surprised at the addition of the female vocalist, I now think she is a great complement to the harmony of the other vocalists. As usual, Scholtz's compositions are the best, but the others are also worth a listen. I can't wait for the tour and for the next album in 2011!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Well yes I have to admit this CD is mediocre even for a fan.Why 3 singers? Why is one of them a female country singer?There are only 2-3 really Bostonish good songs here.Couldn't you give the fans a little more than 10+1 old song live version?If this is your first Boston CD please check out Walk On that's real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Boston?","review":"Mr.Tom can try to play the guitar.(Walk On and C.A.)

Trust me, you'll be doing your ears a favour while simultaneously keeping Scholtz's ideals from straying. A worthy cause don't you think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Boston.....Scholz! For God sake, change the name!","review":"Tom may as well change the name to 'Scholz and clan' cause the power rock of Boston is gone. Without Brad there's no point. I much prefer to spin a Return to Zero album than this CD. I never did like Fran Cosmo, even during his Orion days. I'd rather hear Brad sing than listen to Tom's artificial violins, the boy's working in a vacuum....still. Tom's no spring chicken, he's old, lost his creative edge. (Some say it was gone at Third Stage)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoko must be proud","review":"Wayne Woodall's review of this album had a great comment: \\"I don't know who's girlfriend this Kimberly Dahme girl is, but she's got to go.\\" This was exactly my thought when I first listened to this album. I look at the band photos in the liner notes and see Spinal Tap in those \\"spirit guide\\" outfits the girlfriend designed.And all the vegetarian/environmentalist/anti-capitalism crap has to go, too. Why do stars keep thinking we care what they think? We buy because we care how they sound. I'll be careful to snag an MP3 or two of the next Boston release before plunking down my cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate America Flops","review":"First of all, I am a huge Boston fan, but this album does not do justice. I am extremely dissapointed with the songs. I think the mix sounds muddy and the drums sound fake ( a common complaint for all Boston albums since Third Stage). The fact is Boston is as much Brad Delp's vocal harmonies as it is Tom Scholz' guitar and song writing. Unfortunately, there isn't enough of either on this album. Finally, why are all the environmental wacko comments on the inside cover of the liner notes? Could it be because some people wouldn't buy it if they were on the outside?This album is destined to be found in quantity on e-bay and at your local used CD store. Cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer relevent","review":"What a mess! If this was a debut album from an unknown band, this would be their death knell.

Goodbye & good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this CD!","review":"Not one listenable track on here. The entire album is one big flop. Get one of their older albums if you want to hear Boston at its best, not this political propganda nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"This is by far the worst of the Boston albums. Ironically, it's also the most expensive. That's because it's so bad very few were sold. At least Walk On had a few good rocking tunes on it. This thing is all lightweight trash. The song With You is not even Boston. It's some gal singing along with a guitar and it can't even be classified as rock. If you like Boston a lot then go ahead and buy this, but just be warned it's not even close to the first two albums and far weaker than Walk On, which wasn't that great either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, jarringly bad lyrics","review":"I got this album used on a whim, just to see what they'd done. The music is mostly solid - great crunching guitars, power chords, harmonies, etc. Some of the songs are just not Boston, though - I normally salute expanding one's boundaries, but some of the songs just don't make sense to me. And the lyrics, good god, the lyrics. It's really hard to listen to them - they're so bad. Political rants mixed with the cheesiest vapid lovey dovey lyrics this side of Frampton. It's nice as a brief reminder of how great Boston used to be, and inspiration to put that on instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Boston to Nashville","review":"To steal part of a tired phrase, this is not your father's Boston. Tired is also how many geezer rock Boston fans like me will feel after about the first 3 cuts. The CD starts off promising with the first track - I Had A Good Time. Brad Delp's vocals are as strong as ever here and on the title cut, then he is relegated to bench backup duties on practically the rest of the CD. Fans yearning for the sophisticated, ableit packaged Boston sound of yesteryear will continue to hunger. Clearly, Tom Sholz is influenced by the folksy sound and stylings of newcomer Kimberley Dahme, a good talent,but a CD over-produced in this direction. The result is a hodgepodge of ballads and political message tunes with an odd country, discorock and daresay hint of folk, topped off with a sprinkling of Boston purist driving harmony guitars added as an afterthought. Buy it used and be prepared to put in under the tree this year for that Secret Santa who doesn't mind \\"music that grows on you\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate America Dissapoints!","review":"Tracks 1 and 5 are the only ones I cared for, the group instead of rocking with a CD that you can typically listen to every song bombed on this one. They change lead singers every other song, styles change throughout the CD. Also the lyrics do not match the music well and flow like most boston CD's do.Gave this one a VERY LOW REVIEW 2 stars for only 2 \\"decent\\" tracks on the entire CD.

While I am a big fan, Tom Scholz should realize when one is out of ideas to quit while one is ahead. Fran Cosmo is acclaimed to be a great vocalist by Tom, but I find his vocals to be subpar. He whispers his singing and the CD is mixed by amplifying until it sounds more like Brad Delp (Hello...use Brad Delp...one of the greatest singers ever)Instead Brad is delegated to backup and harmony vocals (what a waste....). The CD is produced very well, but there aren't many of the trademark Boston hooks from previous works.I gave it two stars, but I'm being very kind. If you're looking for Boston, don't waste your time and go listen to previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"As great a musician Tom Sholz is; I don't understand why he made a CD like this.

Are we hearing the same things? I have been a Boston fan for years, but this CD just doesn't cut it for me. With a couple of exceptions, every song contains electronic (or programmed) drums. Nothing kills a groove like a drum machine. Also, the songs don't seem to be on the same par as previous efforts. I gave this CD a close, fair hearing, and then I put on their 70's debut. NIGHT AND DAY. To me, this sounds like a demo tape done on a four track recorder. No offense to Tom, but WHAT HAPPENED?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Boston?","review":"I still get chills listening to Boston's earlier stuff - This CD produces very few chills. Brad Delp is virtually unheard on this CD - even on the songs he sings he can barely be heard. The other singers appear to be doing a Brad Delp inpersonation. There is just enough Boston sound on this CD to make you want to hear more, but unfortunately, at the end of the CD, your are woefully unsatisfied. This is not a Boston CD. Tom, change the name of the band so others wont get suckered into buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Boston","review":"At least Boston is consistent... consistently going downhill. Is it living in the past to say that Boston peaked in 1976 with their masterful debut album? Sure, there are always going to be people who argue that bands have a right to move forward as they see fit. Fine. But how is Corporate America in ANY sense moving forward? Boston was popular in the 70's and 80's because they carved out a musical niche for themselves, and then wrote and performed music better than anyone else in that niche. Now, with Corporate America, they try to carve out new niches for themselves (alternative and country?!) and fall flat on their faces. I would have no problem with Boston updating their sound and making musical progress. After all, quality is quality. This, on the other hand, is a desperate (and failed) attempt to stay current. Rest in peace, Boston. You were a great band in your heyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ...","review":"Save your money!!! If you really must hear this kind of garbage, find a teen ager and borrow their N'Sync CD! I can't believe they even released this with the name Boston on it!

What happened to boston?-they suck now.","review":"Well,when you come down to it now,Boston is only Tom Scholz.Brad is longer with us,[Rip]and the rest of the oringinal lineup is missing.dont get me wrong,I loved Boston's first two albums...you cannot get any better than those...but nowadays Boston sucks.for me Boston died when Tom released Third Stage.maybe he waited to long between albums to release another one? thats my feelings on the matter.third stage was okay but really not enough to make me keep the disc.I traded it for something else I think.first two albums are keepers though and my opinion,if you want see Boston in all their glory then,check out the first two albums and the rest,I wouldn't even give 50 cents for...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Garbage...................","review":"Listen to the record! What a piece of [junk]...a female vocolist........Tom pleasen wake -up! Your band became popular because of ROCK...what a copout..this CD is not even worth 1 cent as another reviewer stated.

Unfortunatly that is not what I got. There was too much acoustic guitar for me. It sounded more like a generic boy band than a refined rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Return!!!","review":"The yet again long wait for a Boston release has arrived. The newest cd by the seventies rock legends \\"Corporate America\\" is a well balanced disc.The first track \\"I Had A Good Time\\" with the very recognizable sound of Tom Scholz's guitar and original vocalists Brad Delp vocals takes me back to 1976 again. It's a very rocking song.I also liked the title track \\"Corporate America\\" a mix of the old and new sound with Delp and Fran Cosmo of the \\"Walk On\\" release sharing the vocal duties. I like the message of the song and it also one of the many rocking tunes on the cd.I like the addition of third vocalist Kimberly Dahme who does an acoustic track \\"With You\\" and also does vocals on \\"You Gave Up On Love\\". Both are very mellow tracks but I liked them both.Give these veteran rockers a listen, it was well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunities","review":"As a long time Boston fan what I was hoping to hear was that Boston had put rock and roll on its ear with this new album. Instead I hear a record that falls flat in a hurry.It typically takes Tom Scholtz years to come out with a new album. I would have thought for all of the waiting and effort that it would have been a far better production. This album pales in comparison to their earlier work.The new members of the band lack the vocal range of Brad Delp. Delp has been the signature voice of the band for years and to hear any other voice on lead is just not the same. The songs lack the technical sophistication of their classic blockbusters. Boston's time would have been much better spent going back to basics with the formula that made them a rock and roll band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air.....","review":"I really feel that the ones who give less than 3 stars for this album are not true Boston fans. Why are people always stuck on a bands past. Boston - Corporate America is a breath of fresh air for me. I love listening to all the songs. They sound like the band is growing musically. I love the different musical styles they use. I wish that brad delp didn't give up on his life. He had an amazing voice. I love how they evolved from through the 70's, 80's and 90's. This is an amazing album for me. I feel like it's the ones who wouldn't accept Boston's new music and totally shut them out because of it that possibly caused brad to kill himself. I know its far fetched but people come on. If you don't like it then don't listen to it. Simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not best but still five stars","review":"This is new age Boston album.Is even more different as Walk onand worst from all albums by this band but I still gave 5 stars because its very good and more songs are enjoyable.Best song is I had good time - classic Boston.Other songs are more slowly and not as perfect.Thank you boys for new album for 8 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gave Up On Boston?","review":"What angers me most about Boston's Corporate America is that it received so poor attention. This album is actually a fine album with a bit of experimental work. I bought the album because I was charmed by their first single \\"I Had A Good Time\\".Boston's return was applauded by Japanese music fans with high ratings. Compared with \\"Third Stage\\", the arrangement became less of pomp rock and lyrics come into my mind more easily. If you stick to 70's Boston style, I recommend that you start from \\"You Gave Up On Love\\" , which is truly the reincarnation of legendary \\"More Than A Feeling\\". Docking of one star is as a result of ...1:Refeaturing of Living For You(live version)2:Lack of instrumental tracksMy favorite tracks are \\"You Gave Up On Love\\" \\"I Had A Good Time\\" and Fleetwood Mac styled \\"With You\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was Free","review":"I signed up to win this CD on a radio stations website.

Back to the basic ,Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? Wow?, what is this?","review":"I am a big Boston fan of the past. Then I bought this. I called all my friends and told them they had to listen to this CD, that it was unbelievable (it is, not in the good way). Now I have a bunch of pissed off friends that bought a copy. I can't believe Scholtz has been reduced to using a drum machine on a rock album. The whole album is stiff, no feel because of that, b-side material, the kind of stuff that when you get done eating pizza at pizza hut, you go to the juke box and select the whole album to play when you leave, just for a good laugh.Now, there is hope here. Boston is coming out with a new album this summer with Michael Sweet from Stryper on lead vocals and there is new material and some material from this album in which he is re-recording (WITH A LIVE DRUMMER PLEASE). I have a good feeling about this and I can't wait. As far as this one goes, purchase at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to clean my ears out first","review":"Ok, this has to be a mistake. I thought I was reviewing a BOSTON CD. I just cannot believe what I am hearing. This might be the worst album I have ever heard since that Desmond Child crap from the 90's.

If you dont blieve me about how bad this album is Just buy it and tell me what you think. I got the album expecting Boston. I just dont know what to say.

Very disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political agenda over music?","review":"Very Sad! True hypocrites! A band that never really grew up. I loved all there early music, Boston, Don't Look Back, 3rd Stage etc... This one is terrible. First of all, let me say this, I bought this CD from a large \\"Corporate\\" retailer. They don't have a problem with selling their CD's thru them. The inner CD jacket taughts their political agenda.At first glance, I told myself, \\"Ok, they've become naturalist in the older years\\". I'm ok with that we all have a opinion. Then I took notice to the huge \\"unnatural\\" set of mam's Kimberly owns. Again, they want it natural but there is some exceptions.I being involved in the cattle business took offense right away to the CD jacket. But, being such a huge fan of theirs early in life, decided to put that aside and check out the CD. Terrible! to say the least. I wish I hadn't of bought it just so it wouldn't of marred my image of what this band had done in the past.Sholtz & Delp have shunned a old fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"what gives?","review":"Am I listening to boston here? Half the album sounds pretty good but the rest is [weak]. 8 years between cds and they can't even come up with enough material to fill an entire cd? what's the deal with the live song? Also the push for vegetarianism is a bit much. I mean come on, how many rock fans out there are going to put down their beer and brats and pick up some tofu(not that it [is bad] it just can't replace the real thing)? Not me. This band will drift into oblivion if they continue to put out cds like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"(EIGHT) years for THIS ? ? ?","review":"What a sorry effort this is. Production quality is weak. Drum tracks are off beat and sound like ..., vocals are weak.For BOSTON fans everywhere, if you wish to stay a fan, DO NOT buy this CD. However, if you must buy it, compared to their past works, you'll lose interest quick.What a shame to see such a great band just go down the tubes.Also, all the enviromental and PETA ...that's in the liner is not what the fans are interested in. It's the Music!!!!Just wish it would've been included in this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could you let us down Tom?","review":"I have been a die-hard Boston Fan since the early days. I always waited for each new album with great anticipation. I buy them without any reservation and pick out the right time to debut and savor the newest Boston creation. This was the biggest disappointment I have ever had in an album purchase. I would gladly pay someone a dollar to take this thing off my hands if they paid the shipping. I would gladly volunteer to get a root canal than to further taint my fond memory of this once respectable band by listening to this new album twice. The political literature about PETA, anti-meat, and anti-gun propaganda is insulting. Entertain us Tom, even wow us, but don't tell us what to think or how to live. That is not your role!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boston? Bawston? Not!","review":"Tom Scholtz needs to go back to the drawing board. Looks like we need 10 years in between releases here.. Only two tunes sound like Boston. \\"I had a good time\\" and \\"Corporate America\\"- the rest is Gahbage... I also can't believe there's now a female in the band... I was disappointed BIG TIME! And I'm from Boston!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I've been a Boston fan since the mid 70's. I don't recognize the sound on this album AT ALL except for some of Tom's guitar style. Hey, you may like this or you may not, but it is NOT Boston. It really irritates me that they would serve up this stuff under the name of a band that started almost 30 years ago as a ROCK band. This sounds like some kind of alternative/new age thing. Again, if you are into it, great. If this is where Tom and Brad are at these days, good for them. Pick another name for the band/project and get after it. I wish you the best. But again, this has nothing to do with the Boston that I grew up listening to and it is a complete rip off to market this as a Boston album. George Lynch tried to market a rap album as Lynch Mob a few years ago. Whats next? Maybe Sting will record some Gregorian chants and call it a new Police album. This kind of marketing BS STINKS! Keep your money and keep listening to the first 3 Boston albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S ...!!","review":"That's all I have to say to explain the album. IT'S ...!! BOSTON has a flute in one of their songs...HUH? BOSTON has a female lead singer...HUH? It's just funny how the rich can complain about the rich being rich (Corporate America). Congrat's Tom, it took 7 years to create ...! This album does not sound anything like the old Boston, it doesn't even sound like a new Boston."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BOSTON OF OLD!","review":"Please don't waste your money. This not the Boston of old. They have been replaced by a bunch of tree hugging wanna be song writers. The only good song is an oldie. I was sadly disappointed.

Really sad Boston, was expecting much greater things from a once great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The ____????","review":"This is horrible. I used to love this band.

I am a huge fan of Boston and thought that I couldn't possibly hate anything Boston writes, but this proved me wrong. Corporate America is a terrible remake of Higher Power. Tom wanted a little different sound, but junk is not the right direction. Not one song rates higher then a 2 star rating. This album sounds like it was some other groups music, but with Tom's rocket machine and organ. EXTREMELY BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase","review":"This is CD is as bad as the 1994 release of Walk On. This CD is awful.

Music is making a slight comeback with some new talent by old and new artists!! This is definately Boston's best album since Third Stage 1986. It kind of has the same feel as that album with all the synthesizers and arena rocking gutiars. There are some songs on here that are just signature Boston and would make anyone smile! Boston was able to combine their old sound, with the influences such as OASIS of the nineties, and make it work.This album has maybe 2 songs that could have been replaced or left out.Music tends to go with the times and whats going on politically in the world. This album blends in with 2002 and gives a feeling of the early 80's influences such as Asia and Starship."},{"rating":"1","title":"again I wonder why in the digital age a cd will cost 50 dollars","review":"why oh why are the record companies doing this.

It was refreshing to have someone tackle religious questions usually steered clear of with openness and thoughtful analysis while at the same time making it clear that he didn't consider his conclusions the last word on the subject. The book is not preachy, it is probing. In an era when most are asking how we feel about an issue, Dickson is actually asking us to think. Doing so allows him to hear the wise words of a religion other than his own without offense, and he often finds himself agreeing with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I thought this story was really good and I can't wait to read the other two books in the series to see what happens"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Warrior Heir","review":"I enjoyed this book so much I sent it to my oldest son.

However, he tells such a good story that I quickly got used to this and got on with the job of just enjoying his down to earth way of telling the story. Schama takes you into the hearts and minds of the characters at the heart of events, rather than simply presenting the events as cold historical fact.

Nuland looks at the strange story of Ignac Semmelweis, the man who discovered the simple means of preventing childbed fever which saved countless lives. The tragedy of his life was that he never went on to elaborate on a form of germ theory that was backed up experimentation or cogent writings (although he did eventually publish a rambling account of his theories that did more harm than good to his reputation). The author is best at setting the scene of women dying in lying-in hospitals in all of its graphic and horrific detail, and in demonstrating the ways in which Semmelweis's own intractable personality and the conservative politics of the hospital's at the time worked against him. The truly great achievment of this man is put into its proper context within its historical time period in a brilliantly succint manner. A nice addition to the Great Discoveries series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gray Be-gone","review":"Garnier Nutrisse covers the gray very well but the color only lasts for 4 weeks.

Not only does it lack insight into her situation, Cary consistently practiced poor word choice in her writing, leaving the reader wondering what her intention was. I also question Cary's editors at Vintage Books--why did they allow her to leave in page after page of lackluster prose describing the minutia of her life? (i.e., pp.60-61 in which Cary describes dropping her soap) I am shocked that reviewer Arnold Rampersad and the Washington Post Book World placed Cary in the same league as Maya Angelou and Richard Wright.

She did not tell us at all about how she changed. Or that how were her freinds were dealing with her. She was using too big words when she was a student. She seems to rush through parts which were important and go into detail with what was unnecessary. You don't get a clear sense of what kind of audiance she is telling her story to.

One other thing I didn't like was the fact that the words she used were dull and hard to understand.

Their way of explaining most subjects seems to me to be unclear, their wording such that I have to read a paragraph several times to figure out what they are trying to say. Finally and especially, their explanation of the key topic of socket states is flat-out awful. I have had a little experience dealing tangentially with socket states on my last project, and I still came away from this chapter confused and with my head spinning.I hope that there are better WinSock books than this out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book","review":"I'd not recommend to read this book - waste of time. First 13 chapters contain tons of unimportant information about specifications, history and general words about how networking is great. Although these chapters contained a bit of example code - this didn't work at all. Since the 13th chapter there is a terrible example of a full scale FTP client that is totally unclear. At that point I closed the book. My friend had the same book, he went further - threw the book away.In fact I learned basics of Windows sockets from the greatest book of Petzold \\"Programming Windows\\", where every code was working and then ported my knowledge of UNIX networking to Windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a bit less than what I was expecting","review":"I've read quite a few of Ms Wrights other books, mainly the offerings of her take on the Star Trek universe and was expecting a bit more when I read this book. Took me a while to get through it, especially as it started to plod after the first chapter. I picked it up again a few days after becoming bored with the plot in my initial reading, but even after steeling myself knowing what I had read, the plot really didn't get much better throughout.All in all I was quite disappointed with this book, I had expected better given my previous experiences with the author's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of the Killer Bee Guy","review":"This is a fun informative book which reminds me of something Hunter S Thompson would put together. There were parts of the book which made me want to scream with laughter, Mr. Booth has a wonderful sense of humor and wit. Intelligently written with great photo's the book is informative as well as funny. There aren't many books which I'd pick up for a second time and re-read, this was one of those chosen few. This book makes an excellent present for loved ones and friends. It also makes for a great present when looking for something special for people who have everything. Face it Humor is always a welcome present and when you can illustrate a story and learn something, well then you have all the elements in one. I can't wait for a second book to come out. Mr. Booth please publish Book two.Alfred L.Costanzo Phd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful advice on HOW to choose a middle school","review":"Hemphill's book on public middle schools does not cover every good school in New York City, but it provides the best available compendium of what's out there and what makes individual schools distinctive. Reading it is a lot like having a long conversation with the most knowledgeable and fair-minded parent you know. When you're done, you understand what the choices really are, what big issues are challenging NYC middle schools today, and how to spot the hype that so often surrounds the most popular schools. She talked to hundreds of parents whose children actually attend schools of all sizes and all educational philosophies in all kinds of neighborhoods. Their voices ring through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left out","review":"This book is entirely subjective. As an educator in N.Y.C for many years, there are excellent outstanding schools that are totally missing from the author's accounts and terrible schools that she rates highly. It is totally unreliable for parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding grill","review":"This is the best grill/smoker that I have ever owned. And I've owned them all. All parts were top quality, and they all fit perfectly while a friend and I assembled it. With more features for the money, like cast iron grates, this is the best value on the market. I have since ordered accessories direct from the company and they are very helpful and very prompt. Buy this grill...or any of their other models!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"I was really impressed with this book when I devoured it over a couple of days earlier this summer. Normally, I'm a VERY slow reader, but I really flew through this one.Reading Douglas Clegg reminds me of playing the electric guitar in the evening in the garage while I was in high school. His writing is raw and full of emotion and yearning. It's alive in your hands--you can feel the book hum and vibrate as it leads you through colorful fields under its own sinewy rhythm.I've read everything that Clegg has out in print (I found out about him last summer here at amazon.com) and I think \\"Naomi\\" is one of his best, up there with \\"You Come When I Call You\\" and \\"The Halloween Man\\". A must for any fan of Clegg's other work. And if you like horror and haven't read Clegg, you should really give this one a chance. Just remember to keep it down after eleven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I picked up this one after reading a short story by Clegg. I enjoyed the underground setting and the link to the past. With short sections and loads of tension, it read fast. The concept and the plot were great. The biggest fault was some of the telling could have been replaced with more action. It was predictable why the main character was being haunted by the ghost. Overall, I enjoyed it and will definately read this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull tale of a haunting.","review":"Naomi dies under the rails of a New York subway train. Or does she? Jake, Naomi's childhood friend and, apparently, her one, true love, goes to look for her. Something is dug up in yard of an old building being restored. What does this have to do with Naomi's death? Frankly I did not care enough to find out.Evidently Douglas Clegg's novel was an e-serial, which explains the fragmented and inconsistent narrative flow of the novel and how it seems more tease than actual terror. It's a literate piece of writing, just not scary enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like Clegg . . .","review":"But I keep running across his worst books.I'm a big horror fan, and I keep coming back to Clegg because other authors recommend him. His prose and characters are beautiful, but there is no action, no real point to the two books of his I've read: Naomi and Nightmare House.The positive reader reviews he gets puzzle me; I am just bored by what I've read so far. I like to read, and Clegg comes across as a likeable person through his writing, so I'm sure I'll give another of his books a chance. I just hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fast-paced read","review":"This is the first Clegg book I have read and enjoyed it very much. He does an excellent job of weaving plot lines and keeping you reading until they all intersect. He has some very beautiful and elegantly black descriptions of the underground of New York City and the Serpent that is loose there. The only real problem I had was too much unuseful prose when the character Romeo was at the forefront and a rushed, vague ending. This was a very good story, but deserved better to wrap it all up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda hard to get through...","review":"While reading this book I felt like I was underwater, meaning that maybe there was a good story there above the surface, but I just couldn't reach it. It was boring and the plot was very disjointed. I had no connection to the characters and there was absolutely no action whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I am a huge fan of Cleggs and always heard this one is one of his best. Unfortunately, that rumor didn't prove to me to be true.The story held promise, in a way - its fun to read about witches from older times and some of the characters, like Maddie, are easy to latch on to. For the bad side of things, other characters weren't given the focus they deserved, the story was muddled and poorly paced too much of the time, and a lot of it was just plain confusing.The style is a bit too distant and literary, and some of the action in certain scenes was uneven. The ending was a slight saving grace, being strong with it's impact. If you're a fan of Clegg, give this one a try, but if you're a virgin of his work, try another by him instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a first draft","review":"This novel rambled on aimlessly and the writing was poor in spots. I had recently read his NIGHTMARE CHRONICLES, which I thought was very good, and I expected much more from this author. I only got about 90 pages into it before I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very loose translation of Alice in Wonderland","review":"Aside from \\"Queenie\\" quoting \\"off with his head\\" every now and then and the useage of some of the character names from Alice in Wonderland, such as White Rabbit, Cheshire Cat et al, this is a charmless free-for-all adaptation of a most charming book. Any resemblance between the film and book is surely accidental. At times the music is irritatingly cloying though one or two tunes tend to stay in one's head, whilst the acting is never great. A film of curiosity value only, featuring (in minor roles) Jack Wild and Tracy Hyde who appeared in the wonderful cult movie Melody."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I didn't like this very much. Not a good tasting product. I wouldn't buy this again. And the shipping costs more than the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not your typical crunchy cookie","review":"I certainly don't consider these cookies at all they where very hard.My son who is on a gluten free diet won't even touch them the rest of the family just think they are too tuff to bother with at all so they are now just sitting on the counter waiting to be dumped.THe one star was because they came adequately packaged none were broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is rockin to the max","review":"One of the best song writers of this decade, incredible. His work with waxwing was amazing and he keeps expanding with each solo release although I honestly think suicide medicine is still his best work overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Step Forward","review":"Rocky Votolato is phenominal, but this hasn't alway been the case. From his first taste of popularity with Waxwing, to his first big step as a solo artist with Suicide Medicine, he has been consistently BECOMING phenominal. Where most people think that he finally got there with his last effort Makers, they were only right until the release of The Brag and Cuss. The Brag contains everything you loved about Makers, with an added diversity and musical prowess that is coming out in spades, as opposed to the occasional accompaniment on Makers. More harmonica and stellar organ/piano/accordion from Rick Stef (Cat Power) add to the traditional country feel of the record. Basically, if you liked Makers, you'll love The Brag and Cuss. If you didn't like Makers, you'll at the very least respect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 gifted singer/songwriters","review":"I knew all 3 of the singers to be great performers. Now (2001) they have joined and produced a beautiful album, with songs that are jewels in a crown. Each plays an own song in his/her turn and the others contribute vocals or instruments. This makes it a varied album with changing moods and topics, but as a whole it is a unity. Eliza sings some fine texts and Iain expresses his grief and bitterness, where Ad contributes some good songs. As a bonus some of the songs are added that were recorded live.All in all I like this album and it makes some fine listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"The was the dumbest book I ever read, a waste of time, paper, and money. I love the '50s, and I love cars, so I thought this might interest me. There is a weak plot here, and it is impossible to feel anything for any of the characters because they are not developed. The character of Claire Hathaway makes no sense at all. Morris was really stretching it for some substance, especially near the miserable end. No wonder it was in the $1.98 pile at Barnes & Noble's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was falling apart from day one","review":"I really don't reccomend this bouncer. We bought this bouncer for our third child and the previous ones were much better. The covers that snap over the rubber feet constantly fell off and were missing within a week or so. It does adjust back and forth, but one of the angles where the bars meet is cracked and almost completely broken. We have to adjust one side at a time with quite a bit of force, and sometimes can't tell if both sides are adjusted the same. The music/vibrating box is no longer on ours because the fabric is ripping and tearing in that area. My daughter loved the music, so that was a plus. She seems to enjoy it, but it's really starting to look rough. The toys are nothing special, so my 4 and 2 yr old took off with those a long time ago. Maybe better for someone who doesn't frequently use a bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"I received this as a gift, and kept it though I thought it might not work too well. Once my little girl arrived, she hated it. The seat jut sinks in in the middle and she just looked VERY uncomfortable. There is no head support, so I would NOT recommend this for an infant. The toy bar broke almost immidiately, and if you have children you know, it would be nice to be able to grab it by the toy bar and move it (without the child in it of course). I bought the Pretty in Pink Calming Vibrations and it is much better, I just have one complaint about that. My son constantly snatches off the toys (velcro) and hides them around the house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"disappointed in format","review":"This book was definitely a good read, however I was very disappointed with the Kindle version...many times sentences were missing as I turned the pages. Can you fix this problem for future books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy can sing!","review":"Jeff Scott Soto, owner of one of the most powerful pair of pipes of heavy music EVER, released his best solo effort with this album. Assembling a fanastic line up (including Journey guitarist Neal Schon, this ialbum is just amazing. THere is a general eighties \\"feel\\" to it, but it does not soung dated at all. The songs are well crafted, the guitar solos will leave you breathless. There is the obligaory power ballad (\\"If This Is The End\\") but that's not a total waste, because is has weight int it.This album is one of those albums that you will enjoy from the first listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found","review":"For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it as a story or do the experiments","review":"The good thing about this book is that it is interesting enough to read it (at bedtime, for example) without pausing to do the experiments or you can use it in conjunction with some great little experiments to learn more about magnets.It is not extremely detailed, but my five-year-old son found it quite engaging and he was absolutely fascinated when the experiments worked \\"just the way the book said!\\" With the book's simple structure, I know it won't be too long before he is able to read it to himself, also. (It is around the second grade level, I would say.)Nicely done for younger students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"Very useful book, clarifying some otherwise vague topics.A must have for anyone starting German, especially if you are like me doing it on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong With Boynton...","review":"Sandra Boynton's books are great!

I bought it for my daughter when she was a little over 1 and it was one of the only books that I could read to her. She loves all the animal noises and has gotten really good at matching the sound to the animal. Should would listen to it over and over. It was great for the airplane!

A priceless book that all babies should have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GEM FROM SANDRA","review":"Sandra Buynton's books for youngsters are among the best in the business. She has a distinctive and silly illustration style that reminds me of Sunday morning comic strips along with very witty, yet fun and simplistic rhyming texts that kids love.Moo Baa LA la la teaches kids about the sounds animals make. My two year old had already learned about animal sounds and loved to make them but when he go this book he really loved it still. he loves to chime in and say the sounds and repeat them back to us. it's one of the first books he grabs to read at story time. He gets a kick out of the words and pictures.

He has no interest in the book at all when we got it. I am so disappointed because I can see why my son is disinterested. The pictures are nothing great, they are the usual farm animals. My son has other toys and books related to animals and the sounds they make and those are by far much more interesting.I bought another book by Sandra Boynton \\" The Going To Bed Book\\". That too was a disappointment. I guess I'm too afraid to buy another Boynton title soon.Good Night Moon by Margaret Wise Brown and Pat the Bunny by Dorothy Kunhardt are stellar winners by far and all time favourite with my little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhinoceroses snort and snuff!

By chance, while on a trip to NY when my son was only 5 months old, I purchased this book. As sort of joke I immediately began reading this and other books to him thinking he was too young to respond. Boy was I surprised! If he even sees the cover from afar he grunts for me to read it to him! As soon as I finish he continues this over & over again! There are other books that he enjoys (Goonight Moon,Time to Sleep, Chicka Chicka ABC), however, none compare to his love for Moo Bah LaLaLa! As soon as those 3 words come out of my mouth he quiets.

She pulled out a file folder of keepsakes from his earliest years. In between the drawings and crafts and pictures was the gnawed on cover of Moo, Baa, La, La, La.We both had spent countless hours reading to our son and this was one of his, and our, favorite children's books.

I was very disappointed -- I wish I had my money back!! The 17 month old bats the book away with his hand when I pick it up to read to him -- he will only listen to a bit of the \\"Doggie\\" book because I make all those tiresome dog \\"barking\\" sounds. The pictures are so simplistic -- a few sketchy lines -- that only the 3 year old can make sense of them. I have noticed that all the children are drawn to pictures of real photo-looking pictures of children and animals. and they all love Margaret Wise Brown because the words and pictures are something that they already know about and recognize.

The graphics in this game is something to be proud of. Also, the use of color is very good. But the one thing that stands out for me are the castle secrets. When I \\"stumble\\" onto a castle secret it's like a big thing for me. I actually yell \\"YES!\\" or \\"UH-OH\\" when I'm given a star so easily or when I find a hidden realm. My heart rate speeds up when I'm playing the game. Especially when I'm so close to getting a star or when I'm about to win or lose a fight with one of the \\"bad guys\\". This game keeps me on the edge of my seat. I love it! And I know you will to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful who you buy from","review":"This game did not work.

It has 20 or more levels BUT there are six activities to do in each level. Bowser is trying to take over Peache's(Toadstool)castle and it is up to Me(Mario) to save her. In the first two levels of Bowser he wasn't very challenging. But the third time you try to beat him he is hard to beat.I like the way Mario can use wing cap, metal cap, and invisisble cap to help him. You have to collect a total of 120 stars. You won't get all of them just by completing activities in the levels.this game had me playing it for a long time. I got this game for my birthday 3 years ago and enjoyed it since. If you're a mario fan buy this game.One thing that bother's me about the game is I only have 119 stars, How do I get the next star?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Fun in Real Places","review":"This game involves alot of interesting chacters and it has 3D affects in every level.Mario has alot of new moves that will destory his foes.The game lets you have fun just exploring the detailed places Mario is in.He even talks and makes sounds while doing curtain actions.You can have hours of fun this great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Mario 64","review":"This game almost couldn't have been better. You're controlling that world-famous Italian plummer again, by the name of Mario, on a long and exciting adventure to restore peace in Mario World and conquer the evil turtle-like dinosaur, a \\"king-sized koopa\\" named Bowser. The only lacks are that you can't use Yoshi (you rescue him after defeating Bowser after he waits atop the castle) and you can't play with Mario's brother Luigi, featured in all other Mario games for Nintendo gaming consoles (Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 for NES, Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island for SNES, and more for Game Boy).

Mario finds himself going up against his enemy BOWSER who has taken over Peach's castle. You star as Mario who has to rescue and defeat his enemy. He does this by going through the 16 different levels and collecting the golden stars. These stars are the key to opening locked doors and rescuing Peach. Mario finds Stars by going through WATER, FIRE, A WAR, SNOW, A MINE, A DESRT STORM, and much more. He encounters sharks, 50 foot eels, evil bombs, and much more. You can't go wrong with this game!

But this review is perfectly legitemate. This game is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games created, along with SM World and Halo: CE. For it's time, it has beautiful graphics. The controls are PERFECT, although the camera is rather pitiful. But once again, compared to other games in during it's time, gameplay is nearly perfect. Levels can be replayed several times to gather stars, and after that, you'll want to return to break a record or something. The music never lets down; it's filled with a whole bunch of great 'tunes', as the kids say today. So if you have an N64, a bunch of free time and don't already have this... you know what to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion...

I really wished that Super Mario Sunshine would have been as much fun as Mario 64, but it just wasnt.

It's to traverse 15 levels in search of Princess Peach. On the way, you have to stomp on Bowser's head. Thrice. All your favorite enemies are back, with the exception of Koopa Troopas. The goombas, shy guy, the Lakita Brothers, the moles, Bob-ombs, everyone's back!At a graphics standpoint, Super Mario 64 is absolutely outstanding in every way, shape, and form.

It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64. It's a full 3D world. The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess. 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser. This game is really big too; you can fly, turn invisible and go through certain types of walls, and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64.

Gilbert Beers which I vastly prefer.I should say, however, that there is an 8-year old girl at my church who loves the Eager Reader Bible, reads it faithfully, and remembers the stories when they come up in church or Sunday School.

She uses a surprising mix of true 'soul-connecting' spirituality and delicious sensuality to create a story that is at once moving and arousing. Definitely better than the same old same old.My only problem was that it was somewhat unrealistic and at times I could feel myself scoffing in my mind... the hero was just a little too forgiving, committed and all-powerful and the heroine's problems were basically solved by one evening of good loving. What's the likelihood of that happening?Anyway, I guess that's why they're called fairy tales - anything can happen and true love conquers all.

The book chronicles what is a fascinating, years-long effort to build a case based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence against the mole at the highest level of MI5. It is riveting realism, for like most of intelligence work, it shows how tedious, thankless and unrewarding the life of a spycatcher can be.

The occasion was taking Italian musicians/singers to perform La Boheme in China and Pavarotti singing in the Great Hall of the People in Bejing. If you are a Pavarotti fan, you'll really enjoy this video. Otherwise, it's probably a one time viewing for most people, even opera buffs. Refreshing that Chinese people, in the city at least, are familiar with western opera and like it. Seeing a short clip of Pavarotti perform in a Chinese opera was also a novelty.

The speakers worked fine, but the microphone wouldn't pickup any sound.After some snooping on the web, I uninstalled CallCentral and then re-installed it. This time, I right-clicked the installation file and chose \\"Troubleshoot compatibility\\" from the drop-down menu. It leads you through some steps, and I told it to run it as though it was running under Windows XP SP3. Installation went through fine and now it's working as planned!

However, it was a bust when the remote user (who was using earphones and a microphone) tried to talk. The remote user heard very choppy audio during the time he was trying to talk and had to turn is receive volume off to avoid being distracted. It's sort of like you need a \\"push to talk\\" handset.

A completely hands free phone alternative. I use Skype for business calls and wanted a speakerphone so I can use the computer as I carry on a conversation. The problem is that it is extremely difficult to find a good balance between the microphone volume and speaker volume. People could not hear me clearly, I would cut in and out, or there would be an echo. All kinds of trouble. The only way to fix it was to purchase a headset which I plugged into the speakerphone, so now I use this set up instead of the speakerphone functionality. At least I found a work around without spending a lot of money on a new phone. But it would have been so much better if the speakerphone would have performed as advertised..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I received the fuel pump module I noticed it was covered in green dye (the kind they use to mark connections to make sure they don't miss anything).

Not what I'd expect from a brand new part. Fortunately the casing was good on the old part so I just swapped them out. This is the only reason I went with 2 stars instead of 1.

But this sounds nothing like either--and it certainly isn't power pop. Cornish and Danelli, both of the Rascals, and Bryson, of the Raspberries, were not the primary singers or songwriters of their original bands, so assuming a new band with them in it would sound anything like their old bands is a big mistake. This music is tepid, very emblematic of the late seventies. Frankly, what I felt like I was hearing was a so-so imitation of The Little River Band, and that's not power pop, not even remotely. It's \\"pop\\" for certain, but very little power. It doesn't ROCK. Stick to the best of the best, the Beatles, of course, and those four Raspberries albums.

From the angry crowds of concertgoers to the greedy promoters to the musicians just trying to perform, you get a real idea of what went wrong with the whole idea of the 60's free love movement asd it moved into a pre-cursor for the Me generation of the 70's.

Ten Years After's 'I cant Keep from crying' with extended guitar solo from Alvin Lee, was nearly 20 minuites long and they put barely 5 minuites of it on here. This could have been made into an extended package, like most reissued/remastered concert footage has been .

While we were aware of some minor conflicts with the folks outside the festival grounds, it never affected us negatively. My memories are of great music, little sleep, great music, meeting fantastic people, the great music, altered states of awareness (it was 1970 after all) and great music. Unfortunately,this dvd doesn't show much of the reason most of us were there---THE MUSIC!

Multiple errors..whether typo or not....are not acceptable in ANY book. It was poorly presented, poorly researched and just plain uninteresting. Why anyone would even care about these people enough to write about them is the first question. Low life druggies with no life behind or ahead of them. The only ones I felt sorry for were the kids. Having lived 6 years in Flint, I can say that Collier was just one of the most stupid of the many criminals who live there. The only one stupider was Giles and why Billiter hung with these people is beyond me. She actually seemed to have something going for her for a while. But even with this pathetic cast of characters I can say that any other good TC writer could have made this a better story to tell.

I especially disliked the use of phrases like \\"flashed the tin\\"--where the heck did that come from? It wrecks the author's credibility, makes him and the police look downright silly, makes light of the fact that a woman had died, and treats it all like it was a B movie or a cheap detective novel.

I was hugely disappointed to see that the majority of the songs were done with his acoustic guitar. This made for a much slower paced concert than I'd have liked. 20 minutes into I was bored to tears and FFW to the end song.What in the world has happened to Bob Geldof?? Good lord, he looked like he had just come down from 20 years in the mountains of West Virginia..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MASTER AT WORK","review":"No whistles or bells here - just pure talent.

David Gilmour covers it with acoustic guitars, simple amplification, and great backup musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice acoustic versions of Gilmour/Floyd classics","review":"David Gilmour does a fantastic job performing his classic material acoustically. I was amazed and impressed to hear him pull off \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\" without the help of a full band. The stage setting is nice and the sound quality is top notch. If you like Pink Floyd and especially Gilmour, you will enjoy this disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down on this one","review":"I Generally love any Pink Floyd music, including David Gilmour,and Roger Waters. I own DVDS of each one. This one is terrible.It gave me the feeling that David Gilmour is over the hill anddone for. I don't want to believe this but, thats the feelingI had after watching this Concert. Nothing Personal just verydisappointed by this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty grim","review":"I've loved Pink Floyd for years but don't expect to find anything but a very weak cry from the past on this DVD. I give it one star because Gilmour showed up but, beyond that, I can't think of anything redeeming to say about this DVD. If you're looking for Pink Floyd or even the David Gilmour of days gone by, you'll be sorely disappointed by this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like gloomy music","review":"I really didn't like this DVD. The music is very slow, and very depressing, and very uninteresting. I also don't believe that Mr. Gilmour's voice has held up very well. I think he chose a couple of songs which are clearly out of his vocal range such as the one with the French title. (However, he did sing well on about 5 of the selections.)The guitar work wasn't as bad, but his playing wasn't very expressive. It was almost like a dry run through and lacked emotion. I like much of his past work, but this DVD just doesn't do his talent justice. He is capable of much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"milking the 1,000 uddered cow","review":"floyd's 3rd and least effective frontman (barrett is 1st and waters is 2nd)once again trots out \\"the hits\\". after viewing this i have become un-comfortably numb..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst DVD I've ever bought","review":"Why can't people admit that they have bought something terrible? Four stars...five stars.....for this DVD? Didn't they seen Roger Waters \\"Live in the Flesh\\"? It's not a shame. I bought something terrible too. The only star for this dvd is for the woman on the cello who did a great job!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat bloated grimacing has-been.","review":"I know I am gonna offend a lot of Gilmore fans, but let's face it, Roger Waters at least has been keeping physcially fit. The first thing that came to mind when I viewed this was, \\"Gilmore has really let himself go.\\" It looks like he has spent his free time eating donuts, ice cream, pasta and McDonalds. And to add insult to injury, he plays wearing an old shabby t-shirt.I mean, if you are bloated and overweight, try to at least compensate and put on a decent shirt. It is painful looking at his grimace through his fat face. David, I respect your talents as a guitar God, but please get in shape or your gonna die early and not fully appreciate what you have accomplished in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for one song alone.","review":"....and that song is Comfortably Numb with Bob Geldof singing. Stunning. It is good to see Gilmour off the gravy train and doing music under his own name. It's a lot more honest than the stuff he was doing in the 80s and early 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast and easy!","review":"This is a must in your Pink Floyd collection!

The Pink Floyd would not be the Pink Floyd as we know, without the skills of this Guy.David shows strong competence and imagination on this DVD. I am too impressed with the happy integration of the acustic instruments (guitars, bass and cello - Gilmour and Caroline have outstanding performances).High Hopes and Fat Old Sun are the high points of this work.You can not miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent Talent Talent","review":"Gilmour has guitar chops, stage presence, as well as a body of work that even many of the great rockers would cringe jealously at. And here he is with a unique show, captured for us lucky humans on DVD. He is tasteful, never overstated in this performance. The accompanying musicians are just the right touch. Comfortably Numb, Wish You Were Here, and Shine On You Crazy Diamond are, of course, awesome. Even the Division Bell numbers are right on the money. His voice is flawless, even well into his 50's. Where the hell did Pink Floyd come from? How come they were so good? I've always been convinced, even when I was a young teenager, that they can't be explained by ordinary words. My college roommate referred to them as God, I suppose the way people in the UK thought of Clapton back in the 1960's. Gilmour may not be God, but his music is probably listened to by him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good musicianship as ever but dissappointing","review":"While Dave Gilmour is as excellent as ever the concert is not very engaging. Maybe it's me that just doesn't like acoustic versions of classic rock but it just didn't do anything for me. God knows who the guy was that did the intro to comfortably numb - even I could sing better than that - maybe it was his Dad :-)Overall, not bad but lots of the emotion in the music wasn't there for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS THIS IS A CLASSIC","review":"THIS IS A GREATDVD FROM DAVID GILMOUR AND IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.DISREGARD THE ONE STAR REVIEWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erm... No","review":"I'm a big Gilmour fan - love his solo output... think Pink Floyd without Waters was just fine... think his vocals and guitar was what made classic Pink Floyd \\"classic\\"...But, this DVD was sort of sad to watch. The acoustic setting makes it all to easy to see that Gilmour has gone way past his prime. He can no longer sing, and his guitar playing - without effects - is mediocre at best.I was absoutely certain that I would love this DVD when I bought it, but by the 6th song or so I was ready to turn if off. I don't understand all the 5-star reviews... search out some of the lower reviews and you'll see they echo(es) my sentiment.BTW, for a better taste of Floyd from the 21st century, check out Roger Waters' \\"In the Flesh\\". Even though I generally side with Gilmour in the Gilmour/Waters feuds, Water's DVD is infinitely more polished and entertaining than this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth as Silk","review":"Not your typical DVD from this legendary master. However it's a \\"must-own\\" for serious Gilmour fans. Many nice surprises including some incredibly talented backing vocalists, a Dick Perry appearance, a host of extraordinary instrumentalists, and bonus material including a look inside David's country estate in southern Great Britain. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny and more","review":"It takes me all the way away, the video and the sound are perfect, the music is perfect, I will own this forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think it is...","review":"First - I love David Gilmour...and believe he was more the 'sound' of Pink Floyd than Roger. Upon reading reviews of this DVD \\"David Gilmour in Concert 2002\\", I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD. Mistake. This one, though a quality performance, is not \\"Pink Floyd re-visited\\" and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s (David Gilmour and About Face). It is a bunch of slow, 'On an Island' type songs from I don't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same... I had to fast forward several times. The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras. The DVD is 'only' $10, but I don't see myself ever watching it again so...not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GILMOUR DVD","review":"THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE DVD'S FEATURING ONE OF THE BEST GUITARISTS GILMOUR WHO PERFORMS ALL THE GREAT FLOYD SONGS.I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS AWESOME DVD TO EVERYONE.FIVE STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you","review":"My husband is going to love this christmas present thank you so much for the prompt shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Old Is New","review":"The beginning of the DVD I first thought a little odd, it seemed like Gilmour was doing a sound check. But it quickly turned into Shine On You Crazy Diamond. He performed many of the classic Pink Floyd tunes and even though I was skeptical that I would like a lot of them played on an acoustic guitar, I enjoyed the whole show tremendously.Unlike when Clapton turned Layla into an acoustic version that had little resemblance to the legendary version, Gilmour's acoustic interpretation is very similar to the recorded versions. He does pickup an electric guitar -- a Gretsch -- from time to time and it's every bit as good as it used to be.David's voice isn't quite what it used to be, but he's not as young either like a lot of us fans. I didn't find it detracting from the entertainment and motivational value as guitar player.I highly recommend this video to any Pink Floyd/David Gilmour fan. I think you'll find it well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I had seen clips of the concert on one of the music channels on satellite and I just had to have this DVD. Not being a big Pink Floyd fan or having any of the CDs, seeing the clips got me interested in perhaps giving the music a second chance. I kind of strayed away from the music because of the imagery of the movie \\"The Wall\\" and the psychedelic culture associated with it. But as I watched the DVD and saw David Gilmour with an \\"older and wiser\\" stage presence, I saw the music in a whole new light. From old standards like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" to an excellent orchestral version of \\"High Hopes\\", David Gilmour puts a whole new spin on the music that was popular in years past. This DVD is strongly recommended for people of all ages who enjoy wide ranges of taste in music. This is coming from a twenty something that gave it a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance by a Great Artist","review":"I was privileged to be at both the Meltdown concert and two nights during Dave's three night stint at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Dave did this gig because he enjoyed the informality of the Meltdown concert at the Festival Hall the previous year. It could not and was not intended to replicate the Pink Floyd Earls Court Concerts and I can see how some were taken aback by his choice of music. It was a very emotional event and the audience just wanted more and more of the same.For me Rick Wright and the bands performance of Breakthrough was a real treat. Dave's rendering of Richard Thompsons Dimming of the day is beautiful. Please see this concert not as a Pink Floyd concert but as a very talented David Gilmour having a great time with his friends and enjoying every minute of it as we all did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate Sound of Dave","review":"Aging guitar master of Pink Floyd puts on an acoustic show that leaves you wanting more. The set list included many of the fan favorites re-worked into a very intimate soft sound. His voice faulters a few times, and his guitar playing sometimes gets overshadowed by lofty expectations of his fans, but DON'T let that spoil anything for you. Go out and get this DVD. I enjoyed all of the songs. The \\"non-Floyd\\" songs add so much to this concert. Digital transfer was a bit grainy in spots, but the sound is GREAT. The Home Video and Spare Digits section is a great extra...Plus: Pink shows up to sing Comfortably Numb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad we can't pick our relatives","review":"The reviewer from GA has the plot description.

West has written numerous volumes of Pokemon literature, and has made quite a bit of money. After reviewing some of the videos, I feel safe in saying that most of the material in the plot is a concoction of disappointing puns, a G-rated sense of adventure, all topped off with an American impersonation of Japanese culture.

Mary Jane suffers continual delusions due to emotionaltrauma imposed by a high school boyfriend. Not to be disgustinglyspecific (although the author was), but the trauma involves sex and a germanshepard. I didn't laugh at all, folks.

I could not keep my son in front of the TV when I turned this on. To my opinion, even though this is separated into themes, you just get for the most part random words, makes you want to buy all of the DVD's. We ended up finding a free signing dictionary online and always looked up a word we needed and then tought our son. That worked great for us, his signing vocabulary was growing very fast.

Although the strategies suggested for resume and cover letter writing (getting an interview and job) are nothing new, the second half of the book in which the authors describe five different career tracks are excellent in that they are directed specifically towards History Majors. While I originally pictured history majors going into either professional historian-type jobs (e.g. professors, authors) or classroom teaching, the authors very correctly pointed out that historical museums and other pubic education institutions are in need of people with history backgrounds as are businesses, etc. The advice is practical and the information proved to be very specific for me--a history major.

Horrible script and constant flashbacks that really did not allow the mostly talented actors to touch the audience. Absolutely no chemistry between the long lost lovers - no surprise here, \\"Harris\\" had the personality of a tree and the young Vanessa Redgrave (Claire Danes) was not much better.

It felt like a role reversal to real life - how very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morning, Noon and...","review":"Don't be fooled by the stellar cast: \\"Evening\\" is an endless B-movie bore from start to finish. There's enough plot for three films -- and with so many false endings you may feel as if you've been watching for that long -- but none of it means anything. The pace is glacial, the script trite, the characters whiny. And it's all presented as an extremely \\"important\\" exploration of love, loss and the human condition. Hogwash. This is an \\"Art\\" film that's so self-consciously \\"artsy\\" I wanted to run screaming from the theater. (And I LIKE art films.)

I couldn't wait for it to be over. For all the hype over Vanessa Redgrave and Meryl together again? For five minutes, at the end of the film, in a scene that begged for beefing up and more words.

The plot never took off, the acting was sub-par for those on the screen, and after about 60% of the movie complete, I just had to turn it off. Some may say that was a bad decision as the end justified the means, but I couldn't bear it any longer.I would not recommend this to anyone, but if you just have to have this movie I would be happy to give you my copy if you just pay postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't buy it","review":"The only reason I'm giving this movie two stars instead of one is that it has potential and a good cast. I think the actors did all they could with the material they were given, the problem was...there wasn't much material to go on. What I had the hardest time with was the character Harris. He is the love interest of three of the characters, and thus central to the story but he has the personality of a door! It made everything else fall apart, which is sad because the story probably had something more potent to say.To end on a more positive note, I was pleasantly surprised by Hugh Dancy. He really made me feel for Buddy, and I still want to know what he was going to tell Ann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy","review":"The main reason I wanted to see this film in the first place is because of double mother/daughter casting (Redgrave/Richardson and Streep family). More that anything, I wanted to see showdown of acting abilities by a younger generation. While Natasha Richardson knows her place in the film industry and deserves her place next to her mother, I cannot say the same for the younger Streep. As you can tell, I do not even recall her first name. Other than her mother's likeness, her acting is bland. The plot itself is slow moving and multi-layered plot that probably works well in the novel fails in the movie miserably. To be fair, if you liked \\"Notebook\\" and other similar movies from the same genre, you would like this one too. If it was not for the (female) talent of the casting in this feature, it would be hard worth mentioning it. Good to see only if you wish to satisfy your own curiousity about the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time","review":"Vanessa Redgrave's character in Evening states that Harris was the one that got away? Oh, good heavens, thank goodness he did. Harris was nothing more than an insipid and uninteresting man. In fact, no one in this film is worth rooting for. Clare Danes is doing her usual \\"on the verge of tears\\" acting and Hugh Dancy was just laughable - hopefully he asked to be killed off in the movie so he wouldn't have to prolong his ridiculous scenes. These are actors that I have admired in other films and yet everyone in Evening should have just gone to bed and pulled the covers over their heads.

Personally, there is no way I would not want to see a film with so many great (and on-the-verge-of-great) talents. I wasn't thrilled, nor was I disappointed. It is a moody work in which not much happens, but I was never bored. The cast was uniformly good. No one was great. Hugh Dancy was the best for me, but then it seemed like the screenwriters had devoted the most attention to his character. Mamie Gummer is mesmerizing to watch because she resembles her mom so much, but she doesn't have her mom's acting chops. This is a big, big story which suffers from being shoehorned into the usual time frame for a movie of this type. Consequently, it is frustrating that some of the characters are not developed as much as we would like. I still think it is worth seeing and will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Enchanting","review":"I saw a screening of this film last week and it was absolutely breathtaking. Each shot is absolutely gorgeous. Think of the hours but more scenic. The visuals made the entire film feel like a dream, as if you were the main character- Vanessa Regrave- looking back on her life. The beauty of the film was matched with the talent in the film. Each actress had an unbelievable performance. With a cast like this, it is hard to believe that performances would be anything less then perfect and trust me they live up to this standard. The story was moved along beautifully with each performance, each shot, and the overall story by Susan Minot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Actors Make A Great Film","review":"Saw a preview of this this past weekend and I was wonderfully surprised.

It was a good time, and I recommend seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed Unfinished","review":"On her deathbed, Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) reflects on her life through a series of flashbacks. What might she have changed? Her listening daughters wonder how much was true, and how much is drug-induced rambling, while dealing with difficult choices in their own lives.This movie has moments, and the premise (how much choices affect our lives and how much does it really matter in the end) is interesting, but we never really get to know the characters because it jumps around so much. I found the ending to be really disappointing...I'd have liked Ann to pass on some of her wisdom in last words to her daughters. The ending felt more to me as if the director looked at his watch and realized his two hours were up. Only two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointed","review":"Having read the book twice, I was incredibly disappointed by the glaring deviations from the original story, none of which seemed necessary or any kind of improvement. What was a pretty straightforward story about the chemistry and passion between Ann and Harris (shame on the moviemakers for \\"white-washing\\" his ethnicity) was infused with ridiculous plot complications (in the book, not everyone is in love with Harris). I had to force myself to get through the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a story about living","review":"I think that the films we admire today have some sort of huge plot that need to be fulfilled that a task or goal has to be done.

But they have, with only 3 exceptions, *already been published* in the books \\"The Sergeant's Cat\\" and \\"Mangrove Mama\\". If you already have these books, unless you're a truly rabid afficionado, don't bother with this one. Why? The remaining 3 are not very good stories, rating only 1 star.If you're new to Van de Wetering, you shouldn't start here anyway. Buy \\"Outsider in Amsterdam\\" (5 stars) instead.(Note: this review is \\"for the hardcover version only\\", because only hardcover buyers could have purchased Mangrove Mama, and only vdW. lovers would own The Sergeant's Cat (1987, out of print).)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction and explanation to Waldorf education","review":"Straight forward and clear information regarding Waldorf eduation and philosophy.

Dremel promptly replaced the tool with a 300i free of charge; that one has a real switch and works great. The Anniversary Edition comes with a nice retro tin box and a pocket knife, which are nice touches, but the tool itself was no good (at least in my case). If you are looking for a multi-speed Dremel tool just buy the 300 series and skip this Anniversary Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't used yet","review":"I was so excited to find this set so cheap @ $49.95 that I immediately bought it.

It's on the charging dock, which is small and easily portable.What I like most about this camera is the fact that the lens never extends past the cover, so it can be opened and closed quickly and easily. And it's so fast! Great for people who love taking snapshots on the fly.I will say that I got my finger in the frame a few times at first. You just have to learn how to hold it.Overall, this is a great compact camera. The look, the size, the speed, the features, and the picture quality make this one cool little camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy Shots","review":"Buyer beware! I bought this camera and tested it out by taking indoor and night shots. I downloaded them to my PC (which was very easy) and the pictures were grainy and many were out of focus. The picture quality was worse than most compressed .jpg's that receive via email. I have an older Olympus C-3000 which takes terrific pictures (indoors, night time, etc.). I am used to much higher quality shots. The Olympus has a much larger lens, which I think has something to do with it. I took the Fujifilm back and am sticking with my older Olympus for now. I am extremely disappointed, especially since Best Buy charged me a 15% restocking fee ($60)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera for the \\"not-so-picky\\"","review":"This camera does not have so many features, unlike the ones that a real 'pro' on digital camera is looking for. It is not overpriced and the quality is not the best but I'd say very good. It does not come with a leather case because you don't need one. The lcd display has a thick protective glass like a scratchproof material (just don't drop it for a test or something). It is so small that's why it's called portable. If you have big hands naturally this is not for you. All digital cameras have different features of their own, you just have to read the manual to be able to appreciate fully what you got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Camera, lousy service.","review":"I bought this camera for my daughter. She loves it, but it lost the sound recorder. I took it in to the Fujifilm service center, which happens to be located where I live and they can't even look at it for at least a month. There are no other alternative servicing facilities with a quicker response. It is the worst service time I have ever heard of. I would not buy another Fujifilm camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but lousy pictures","review":"It is a cute little gadget, for the price I thought it would take better photos.

The camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color. My previous camera was a Minolta Dimage 7($800) and I found that this camera's photo quality was just as good. The best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily. Owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.Here's the Bad News:Recently my camera broke and when I tried to contact Fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible. Their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.Summary:Great camera as long as it doesn't break. It's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get Fuji to repair it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but extremely fragile","review":"Bought this camera for my wife. Takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution. If you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill. Fuji customer relations is sub-par. Warranty does not cover any impact internal damage. I've had better luck with Nikon and Kodak and will steer clear of Fuji in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this camera. I returned mine after trying every possible combination of every possible setting and realizing that at best this camera takes pictures that are mediocre. At worst they're unusable, and most pictures fell into that second category. I have an older 3.2 megapixel Canon that takes significantly better pictures than this 5.1 megapixel camera. I bumped into someone at a party who had this Fuji, and they had pretty much the same opinion of it. About the only reason I can even give this camera 1 star is because of its compact size and portability. But, what good is that if the pictures are horrible? If you are considering this camera, I strongly recommend you take a look at the Canon PowerShot SD450 instead. It's very similar in size and price, but takes pictures (and videos) that are in another class entirely. It totally blows this camera away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flop of a Fuji","review":"It was a very sad day when I had to return a Fuji camera within one week of purchasing the Z1. I had taken over 200 pics in that time span with various lighting and options. I probably had 2-4 pics that were salvageable.My brother is a professional photographer who is a big Fuji fan and user. I was on the phone e:Mailing the Z1 pics to him and he was astounded at the poor quality of the pics, as well, even though some other reviewers had great quality pics. Perhaps the camera has inconsistencies in the manufacturing of it, as I could never see it taking a decent pic to want to keep on your PC much less print out?We took it back, paid 15% to return it, and went to a real camera shop and bought the Fuji E900. More pricey, a tad bit larger than the F1, but much better camera and the Fuji quality is back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Fabric but not a Boppy","review":"We went to the store to purchase a nursing pillow and came across this Nuzzle/Basic Comfort thing. We were told we had to get a Boppy Pillow but my husband talked me into purchasing this product instead. Big Mistake! The fabric was nice but when I actually started using the product I found that the darn thing kept moving around on me and my baby never quite got comfortable. At first I thought it was me but after borrowing a Boppy Pillow from a friend I discovered it was the Nuzzel and not me.

I have a whole library of relaxing cds and this one ranks at the top with the best of the best.The second disc is titled \\"Active Relaxation\\" and it's perfect for reading, studying and working on projects that require concentration. I use allot for writing and it seems the times I use it I get more words on paper and with more effortless flow than I do when I don't listen to this cd.I have some of Dr. Thompson's other cds too. However, what I like about this one is the music is actually pretty good and non-distracting. On some of his other cds, his music can sound too creepy or too strange like he is trying make music for an alien circus. So to hear something earthling-friendly is always a plus!P.S.

I have read this book to her so many times I have it memorized. My husband has it memorized and our daughter now 18 months old has it memorized. It continues to be her favorite book. It has stood up to some really heavy use. The rhymes are great. The imagery is easy for kids to understand, ie. brushing teeth, hanging towels on the wall, taking a bath, exercising, sun setting, saying good night. I cherish this book for helping us survive many long trips between KS and MI to visit relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ordered two box sets after this one","review":"We have lots of books to read, Dr. Seus and others, but my 15 month old son will only sit still for the Sandra Boynton books. Some of our other books have too many words, or hardly any words at all. This book is just right. Also, the cardboard pages it impossible for my kid to destroy. The rhyming makes it sort of like singing a lullaby. I read this book every night after any other books I read to him just so he is all ready for bed.

I like the Going to Bed Book - except for the exercise part (just like all other reviewers here, even the 5-start ones).I thought - you know, maybe the author would consider deleting those two pages from this otherwise perfect book! Well - apparently her and her -sister? sister-in-law? daughter? mother?...someone with the same last name - are so convinced of their perfection that she (the unknown family member) very kindly responded that there would be no such possibility since 'oddly, after all these years, the book continues to be a best-seller'.Wow - I applaud her success, but will definitely not contribute to it any longer - here ends my search for rhythmic Boynton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"toddler loves and mom does too!","review":"We read this at least three times a week at bedtime.

The illustrations are okay, not more than that. It is very confusing to small children that the animals are \\"going below\\" as they are unfamiliar with the constructs of a large boat or ship. This could be overlooked, perhaps. But the final activity that the animals participate in - after taking a bath, putting on pajamas, and brushing their teeth - is exercise! Any doctor will tell you that exercising before bed is a bad idea, for a number of reasons.

Now he's two, and we love to read it together.Besides fun illustrations and a cute, simple story, this book has great connections for babies and toddlers at \\"going to bed time.\\" The animals take a bath, hang their towels on the wall, find pajamas big and small, brush their teeth, and then exercise! Tired out, they go back down the stairs, say good-night, somebody turns out the light, and they rock and rock and rock to sleep.The rhythm and pacing is perfect for getting ready for bed. My son has already taken his bath and brushed his teeth, so it's fun to see the animals do the same things as they get ready for bed. The book slows and ends with repetition, like the rhythmic rocking that we do in his glider as we read. It's a great winding-down book for the end of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Bedtime","review":"My little guy loves this book at bedtime. He is twelve months now and it remains one of his favorites along with moo ba la la la and Not the hippopotamus. It gets him perfectly wound down for bed after his bath and it has that certain clever humor Ms Boynton always creates for our little ones. We just bought it for a little friend's one year old birthday and they are falling in love with it also. It is perfect for any baby book collections. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Children's Bedtime Story","review":"Reading to your child every night may, at times, pose to be a challenge. So finding the right books that will enagage them is vital. The Going to Bed Book illustrates the play, bath, and sleepy time routine mothers understand so well and reinforces how when the day is gone it's time to rest. It is a board book but the delivery is suitable for age ranges from 2 through 5. Great addition to the bedtime routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on Oil stains on Granite","review":"I have a Granite Counter top in my kitchen with oil stains due to a leak overnight from the container.

The alkaline did OK (mixed at the highest concentation), but the acid did a better job.

Acid won (and restored the grout to what it looks like in areas that have seen no foot traffic)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made no noticiable difference","review":"I got this to hopefully improve my ping and FPS with WoW and Lord of the Rings Online.

After the head of a large computer company dies, his brother has his brother's young son kidnapped so he can take over the company. To avoid a takeover, others in the company find a boy who looks like the missing heir. They make a deal with the fake heir: he will pretend to be the real heir temporarily, in return for a job for his unemployed father. There is one big problem: The real heir is a computer whiz and knows little about sports. The fake heir knows nothing about computers, but is a real whiz at baseball. It's interesting watching the real heir try to escape, while the fake heir struggles to play his part. Will the heir escape? Will his uncle get what's coming to him? Will the two boys finally meet?

After that experience, I decided I needed a bit of additional coverage since I plan to use the iPad 2 on plane rides much more turbulent than that.This cover provides a great additional layer of protection with little added weight or bulk. It also has a bit of a raised edge so should my iPad do another \\"face plant\\" the screen itself won't bear the brunt of any impact on the table.I dropped it down one star because the blue doesn't actually match the Apple blue cover.

For those of you who enjoyed this film, I'm sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tongue-in-cheek (or fang-in-cheek) fun, effects.","review":"A werewolf movie that is part comedy and part horror, The Howling is a genre classic. Joe Dante directed this with flair, and the leads are engaging, especially Dee Wallace and Elisabeth Brooks as her evil double. Wallace, a TV reporter, puts her life on the line to help catch a sociopath named \\"Eddie\\" at the film's beginning. But things go haywire and she goes to a remote colony with her husband to recoup. This colony is actually a colony of werewolves, and from there Wallace and her friends try to stop what is happening. Lots of good werewolf lore included, a ton of in-jokes and cameo appearances (including Slim Pickens, Dick Miller and Forrest J Ackerman), but the real star of this film is the make-up effects by Rob Bottin, which are still the industry standard (people made a large fuss about Baker's work for An American Werewolf in London, but Bottin's work is better). This is a load of campy fun. Avoid the sequels, avoid them at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up 4 THE HOWLING","review":"This werewolf movie rocks.I brought the special edition dvd andI watched it the other night 4 the 1st time.I watched it alonein the dark and with the remastered sound and picture I gotscared.I recommend it to everyone that loves werewolf movies andplus the dvd is at a very low price.The dvd contains lots offeaturettes on how they made the werewolf(pretty cool).Welljust go buy the dvd and you,ll see what i,m talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HOWLING","review":"THE HOWLING is one of the best werewolf movies I've ever seen.

This DVD also had a disk of special features. I had heard really great things about this movie, so I put it in before Child's Play. I didn't like it. I didn't feel any type of connection with any of the characters, and I found myself lokking forward to seeing them get attacked by the werewolves. That was, until the werewolves appeared on screen. There was some tense build up, the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars. The monsters themselves, hilarious in the worst of ways!! I literally couldn't stop laughing!! And the ending....OMG, that was the funniest thing about the movie. This movie was a joke to me, and one that wasn't funny enough to watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bay at the moon...or whenever","review":"Let's get this out of the way. I'm in love with the werewolf makeup and the adrenaline pumped attacks by the creatures...but notmuch else. This film disregards most of the werewolf mythos, like the pentagram in the hand of his victim and the lunar transformation. In this movie a werewolf changes whenever he takes a notion too. Not only is this stupid, but it damages the pathos we would have for the monster(remember Lon Chaney Jr.?).As to the beastly love-making..yeah. What is this, Anne Rice? For some reason, it worked in the 1992 Dracula but not here. Oh, I know..vampires are supposed to be romantic. There it is.

The acting is well done. Suprise appearance by John Carridine is nice!The subtle horror that grows and grows throughout is shown through Dee Wallace. When she finally witnesses a transformation in a doctors office the roller coaster starts downhill.Very atmospheric and still very effective, this is a true jump out of your seat thriller, and a classic at that.No humorous spots like 'american werewolf in london'.

It is sturdy nice looking and easy to use. I like how wide the pages are. I use this for my son's DVD's and it is easy for him to see all his movies.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the 360 capacity is a little misleading. It's true you can fit that many but only half that number is visible. I realize that someone who uses this as an album holder for CD's and puts the cover album in the front slot and the actual CD behind would find this perfect. Except it still would only hold half the capacity as well. I do not use the back slot which isn't visible since I need to see all the DVD's at a glance.

Not the usual intricately woven tale I'm accustomed to from Ms. Perry. I almost had the sense that the book was written to meet a publishing schedule rather than the natural continuation of a very interesting and entertaining series. Very often I'll think I know who the guilty party is only to find myself, as a result of a unexpected plot twist, to be mistaken in the end. I was disappointed to find out I was right this time.

She was vacationing in Paris with her sister Emily in this installment. Charlotte is usually a central character in the books and without her this novel fell flat.Thirdly, the focus on Thomas' mother in law and grandmother in law was too much. They are usually perimiter characters and they did not mesh with what we had learned about them in previous books.Overall, the character format of this novel was not as enjoyable as Ms. Perry's other books from this series.Come back Charlotte!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the mystery here?","review":"This was my first Anne Perry mystery and unless something else by her is more interesting, she is going on my don't read list. What was the real story/mystery here? It seemed like half of the book revolved around Caroline and Joshua and their marraige. I saw only a minor connection of this story with the murder of the photographer. Are Caroline and Joshua really supposed to be the central characters or is it Pitt and the murder. While I do applaud the author for tackling the tough subject of censorship and the right for women to divorce thier husbands, I can not in good conscience give this book any better than two stars, it just didn't flow or come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for a mystery - don't look here!","review":"If you're looking for a mystery - don't look here! The author began to write a wonderful book then decided to lose the main plot. The character of Mariah is silly and the format by which Caroline \\"learns\\" about life is pathetic. The murder becomes the secondary plot. The beginning of the book and the end of the book are overshadowed by the middle (Caroline's life lesson), which has a little to do with the understanding of the murderer's motive but really could have been skipped. The characters are created poorly to tie everything together."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same","review":"I have vowed that I would never read another Anne Perry mystery again. Then in a moment of weakness and in the absence of anything more appealing, I bought and read Half Moon Street. And it was more of the same tired, worn-out explication of Victorian mores, discussed inthe same dreamy, wordy, uninteresting way that one expects from this author. While billed as a mystery novel, the mystery part takes up no more than 10% of the book. Next time I really will know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"All hands up for Tree63","review":"One of the best recent alternative Christian rock CD's. Upbeat with great messages and lyrics. Tree63's 2 releases are amazing - with clear, haunting voice, wonderful tempo changes, and stick-in-your-head melodies. Super vocals and guitar with \\"Anxious Seat\\". If your looking for a fresh new sound, give this group a try. Your liable to get hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tree 63!","review":"Ok, this really is different then their first release. You can tell its them in several of these recordings though! Personally, when I got this recording by them; I expected that I was going to hear something else then what was recorded. I think that this group has much too offer to many listeners. I however, still like the first release much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic cure","review":"Please don't think that merely reading this book and following the steps the author took will enable you to become pregnant.

She has walked the walk and knows what it means to be told that a baby is not possible. She has found a path that works and she is generous in sharing her journey with us. The people who are disappointed are upset that there is no magic formula here. But I found hope in the fact that no one solution works for everyone, that each of our paths are unique. Like our babies! Read this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for those with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"This book has helped to give me hope. I had high FSH levels as well like Julia. My primary doctor only told me I was having post-menopausal hormone levels at age 31. My ob/gyn said I would be able to get pregnant by donor eggs as if that was my only choice. Julia faced the same naysayers in her story of overcoming the obstacles and sticking to her regimine of diet and hope. She never gave up and never let the so-called experts get her down. In the end she had a wonderful baby girl to show for it.I found it very uplifting and inspiring.Now I know trying to get pregnant is at least worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!!","review":"This was the alternative therapy book that I had been searching for.

I tried it also and it doesnt shave close at all . I will buy him a new Norelco like he had before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trimmer doesn't work","review":"Adequate shave for the price but the trimmer is useless. It's positioned about 2/3 the way up the handle, which means that when you try to use it the top 1/3 of the shave blocks your view of your face, meaning that you can't see what you're trimming! A ridiculous design. I chucked a 15 year-old Braun that finally gave up and bought this one. The old one had a trimmer that worked great. Update 2003/9/22: threw the shaver out. The above-mentioned trimmer mercifully broke a few months ago and now the whole shaver isn't working well. Will I buy another Braun? Probably, but not this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Braun like","review":"Braun is known for the innovation, technology, and design of its product. I read an article years ago that told a story of how Braun engineers tried to perfect every one of its products, one big honcho said \\"if it's a Braun, it must meet all of our standards\\". Well, those standards must have changed over the years. I bought this as an emergency replacement while I'm getting my 6525 fixed, what a difference. It looks and feels flimsy, and it is noisy when you turn it on. It doesn't shave close, and the spring-loaded floating cutter is almost totally useless.So save yourself some aggravation, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for an Irish themed wedding!","review":"Item is exactly as pictured.

An unexpected and pleasant surprise from Koch Records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Bummer","review":"Unfortunately this album does not live up to the Bomp history. The Warlocks first Cd was great, psych-rock but this album seems more like a pardoy of 60's music. Something has definitely changed here. There is some interesting guitar work but the overall groove is lacking. I could see one of these songs on That 70's Show or an old Lenny Kravitz album. If you like very typical and cliched 60's rock then check this album out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fatal Design Flaw","review":"The designers of this binder could have done a significantly better job than this. I'm particularly NOT impressed with how CD's on adjacent pages tend to rub against each other when the pages are turned. This is especially bothersome when you want to access CD's from the center pages. Moreover, you really CANNOT open the binder completely - with the hardcovers flat against a table surface, otherwise, you run the risk of cracking CD's stored somewhere in a middle page. My advise, DON'T buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!","review":"I bought two of these not knowing that if you fill them completely they will bust the bindings. And, I didn't even do all that much traveling with it. Just back and forth from home to dorm each semester.

Shortly after, the carrying strap broke. I've noticed my discs getting more scratched during the past year than I'd noticed with other cd binders. I've still had this thing for almost two years and I don't know why. Getting cd's in and out is really difficult and I seriously feel like it is damaging my discs. I'm treating myself to a new binder tomorrow.

In 1933, there was a special dinner party at the White House. The First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, invited the first lady of aviation, Mrs. Amelia Earhart. During the dinner, Amelia told a thrilling story about one night when she was flying in the dark sky. Inspired by this story, Amelia and Eleanor then decided to take a short flight to Baltimore and back. Eleanor was thrilled with the flight.This book captures the spirit and friendship between these two unique women. It is rare to find a children's book that is both historical and interesting for young readers. I recommend this fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 10 nyhc albums of alltime.","review":"AllOutWar never claimed to be anything they weren't they played along the likes of Biohazard,TrainOfThought,Madball and numerous others. With hxc of today mixing more with emo than metal Truth in the Age of Lies can withstand the test of time and it use to be in my cd player but now mp3 and is a classic. It reminds me of the first time I heard the pummeling sounds of CroMags:Bestwishes and Slayers:ReignInBlood all without the Ego. I remember seeing them when they got back together and played down here in Tx. Mike and crew had no ego and where nothin but hilarious. It reminds me of sophmore efforts like VOD's Still 7inch. It had me glued to my record player and finally bought the CDep with 2extra songs, it just pwns anything you put it up against. And Your right I vaguely remember way back having VHS tapes with them representing metal those guys and Stigmata."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good discussion of the philosophic issues","review":"This book contains a good surface discussion of the issues. It is a great place to start, but lacks a thorough covering of the scientific data and research one needs to go deeper into the issues. It covers animal language, children raised in severe isolation, Helen Keller, Autism, the Whorfian Hypothesis and more. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, especially the chapter on Raun, the autistic boy, and how his parents refused to give up hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to do","review":"We received this toy as a gift. This toy functions as it is supposed to for us. It seems fairly sturdy but, . . .There isn't that much to do with this toy. Just a hammer with some shapes to hit and push, they don't move very much, the faces pop up and play sounds or songs. A \\"measuring tape\\" to pull. The hammer itself was too large for my son's grip at the age when he was interested in toys this simple. Not a toy that will last more than a few hours with an inquiring baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea, but kind of boring","review":"This toy is really cute, but failed to live up to expectations.I find the songs catchy and enjoy them, and my son loves it when I sing along for him. He pulls this off of his shelf and plays with it for a couple of minutes, but he doesn't want to play with it very often and I don't think he'll still be interested in it six months from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triplets loved it!","review":"My triplets loved this so much! Helped with the alphabet and shapes and colors. Tons of fun!**NOTE: You MUST check the toy before buying to see that it plays the entire alphabet song. There have been some that only play to about letter J. Hoping they fixed this problem by now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing with our child","review":"Our son has actually had this toy since age three months. It fascinated him in the store and we used to press it to keep his attention on the changing table. Through many stages, he can finally actually use it at 11 months as it was intended (though his hammer is his favorite). He has slammed it on the floor, and done endless things to make me conclude this toy is invinsible. I would suggest buying it for a younger child who can grow into it. I wouldn't necessarily find it that stimulating for a three year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold attention!","review":"My son received this for his first birthday. He is now 18 months and NEVER plays with this toy for more than a few seconds. Big waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No regrets here!","review":"My daughter loves this toy. I was reluctant to buy it because she is too young to know how to use the hammer to depress the buttons. So, I figured she wouldn't get much enjoyment out of it. Boy was I wrong. She just uses her hands and mashes them. Her face lights up and she squeals each time one of the characters greets her. Anything that lights up and makes noise will thrill the average 6mos old, this toy is no exception. It's heavy enough that she can't lift it and drop it on herself, yet light enough that she can slide it closer to her. This occupies her attention longer than most toys do at this age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"If my child learned from this toy, he'd be missing out on half the alphabet! The toy is so cute, but only goes up to the letter P in the alphabet, then starts over. Personally, we think the entire alphabet is pretty important. Sadly, we had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this for my 22 month old son for easter. When I opened it the only thing it did was light up...I put fresh batteries in and same thing, just lights no sound whatsoever! I was hoping to see his face light up in the morning, now we have to take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"I originally had the FP Laugh and Learn Birdbath for my 8 mo old. She loved it. She loved the songs, the shapes and the birds. It broke after about 2 weeks though. So I exchanged it for this, because the price was equal in value, it was also a \\"laugh and learn\\" toy, and they didn't have the birdbath anymore.But....The songs on this are horrible. She isn't interested in it at all. The songs don't get her attention, the only thing that does get her attention is when it lights up. But, that's to be expected. She used to sit and play with the birdbath for about 5-10 minutes. This won't hold her attention for one minute.I'm taking this one back too."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Son Does Not Like It At All :-(","review":"I thought this would be a great toy for my 17 month old when we were in the store he cried to have it when we got home he cried when I sat down with him to play with it I was upset when I found out it only says A-L it could have at least said the whole ABC's and to me that is a heavy toy to carry around and the age on it is 6-36 months the hammer is heavy my son hit his hand and was in tears to me it should have been around $7.99 and maybe even cheaper I am very upset I spent $19.99 for it I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think I would like it...","review":"Another noisy toy, but this one is working out...We got it for my son's first birthday and he LOVED it instantly! This and the Sesame Street door-popping-open thing are his favorite of the noisy toys.At 15 months, Ryan can do it all on this toy including adjust the volume, but I've never heard it say the names of letters! The tape measure sings the alphabet song all the way through, and I've heard shape names, colors and counting... Guess I'll have to go take another look :-)It's cute and worth the money... He dances to the music and has just learned to pound with the hammer. Like always, sit them down in the toy store to play before you buy :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is fun but entire toy is not that interesting to child","review":"I got this for our daughter when she was six months old. I gave her a few toys and she seemed more interested in this one at the store so I bought this one. She is now one year and this toy has gotten little play. She had chewed on the hammer but never played with the toy by herself. The only time it is used is when I or her dad are playing with it while she watches. The upside is that the sounds and songs it plays are fun and bright. I would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken After Seven Days....","review":"My son, now thirteen months, loves this toy. He carries it around and brings it to us to play with him. It seems that banging on the shapes with the hammer helps his motor skills and hand eye coordination. Unfortunately, after only SEVEN days it was already broken. Nothing extrordinary happened to it, he didn't stand on it or drop it on a hard surface - just from normal play, one of the pop-up people just came out. There appears to be no way to put it back in and have it function like it originally did as pieces came off inside as well. We own a lot of Fisher Price toys and this was really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does the alphabet end with P???","review":"HAHAHA okay- I originally wrote a long time ago that I couldnt figure out why this toy stopped singing at the letter P. So I would never buy it. Well someone bought this toy for my child and low and behold, when you take the thing off DEMO mode it works just fine.So although it wont let me change my star rating- I am able to change my written review.Here goes- its cute and somewhat entertaining but doesnt hold my childs interest any more than anything else. Even singing the entire alphabet song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loved it","review":"This was pretty well made and one of my sons favorite toys to play with. After a few months one of the shapes quit making sounds but everything else worked on it. It did go through a lot of abuse though so we're pretty happy with how it held up overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toolbench","review":"The toolbench works very well, and is one of my favorite toys. The only reason it received four stars instead of five is because one of the buttons no longer works on it. I'm assuming it is because we have used it too often, but still feel that it should be able to take rough play. I love the toy though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We are pleased with our toolbench","review":"We got this for my son for Christmas. He is 6 months old and just loves to see all the colors flash around. He is starting to be able to push the buttons him self. He can't pull on the tape measure part yet though. I like it. I think the songs are catchy. There are several different songs. I like that is counts and does the abc's. It talks about colors too but there are only 3 different colors on it. I think it was a good buy and I would reccommend it. My friends 3 year old came over and it kept her attention for about 5 or 10 minutes then she would come back to it later. Like some one said even the best toy can't keep a child's attention for long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun enough for a toy.","review":"My son has had this since his first birthday (now 19 months old). We actually received two so I left one at his grandma's and took one home. It isn't really a toy for a curious child. He only likes it for short amounts of time, but then again, most of his toys only occupy him for short amounts of time. I don't think it does much and it is very repetative, but it is for a child. Overall it is a good toy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont even bother","review":"i got this toy for my daughters first birthday, and i took it back before i gave it too her!! When i got home and tried it out i discovered that when you pull the tape measure and its supposed to sing the ABCs it only goes to P and then stops!it might be different when you take it out of the box, but i didnt want to take any chances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great priced toy that brings hours of entertainment","review":"My son loves this toy. Very sturdy construction takes a beating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near as exciting...","review":"This toy isn't really a good toy for trully inquisitive kids.

Something with more parts is better unless your child just likes to sit and bonk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"In one word BORING. My son is 16 months old and shows not the least bit of interest in this toy and I can see why. When I clean out his toy chest this one will be the first to go. My son played with it a handful of times and he was not at all entertained by it. Skip this one there is better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in the box","review":"I've read a lot of reviews on this item. Still in the box it is in Demo mode, therefore doesn't play the entire alphabet, like many toys when you take it out you pull a little tab, and it plays in full mode. I just bought this for my daughter tonight and am going to give it to her for Christmas. She's 22 months old and I was about to wrap it when I decided to let her play with it for a few minutes. She went crazy trying to pull the hammer out of the box to hit the buttons. She was so excited to see the lights and get it to make noise. Even in demo mode she was thrilled with it! Usually she gets bored more quickly than she did with this toy, and it's still in the box! I'm so excited to take it out for her Christmas morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas story since the original","review":"_Roads_ is the best Christmas story since the original one. Had I been the first reviewer, I would have only given clues toward the ending, where Klaus the Barbarian becomes Claus the good, because it is meant as a surprise ending. But this is a book I wish I could read in a church Christmas festival to show doubters how \\"Santa\\" - St Nicholas, who even if he wasn't real, should have been - is a symbol of Christ, and good; loving, giving and caring, not an anagram of \\"Satan\\".Even if you cannot afford the Arkham edition, it was republished in a paperback collection of the _Best of Weird Tales_, and may be again someday. This story deserves the same kind of wide renown and affection as Richard Paul Evans' _The Christmas Box_ and O. Henry's \\"The Gift of the Magi\\". Rankin-Bass's animation is cute, but this is the kind of fiction that ought to be true.... Santa SHOULD be real, and this SHOULD be his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A facsimile reproduction of the 1948 first edition","review":"Roads is a facsimile reproduction of the 1948 first edition, Roads is a fantasy novel by pulp fiction pioneer Seabury Quinn.

Renowned fantasy artist Virgil Finlay illustrated the 1948 edition, in this gorgeous reproduction that is the next best thing to owning the original. \\"Roads\\" comes packaged in a stiff cardboard box, and retains its classic and timeless charm, as well as a sense of wonder and imagination to look beyond boundaries.

It's good to hear how she found comfort in faith, but I am very uncomfortable with how she seems to think that her version of faith is appropriate to everyone. Bear in mind, this author is the same person who describes evolution as a fairy tale, and is using her position on the Kansas State school board to push her version of faith onto the people of her state.

She has her beliefs and has a right to them as the evolutionists have theirs. It is amazing how everyone wants to knock Christianity because it does not meet their ideals or way of thinking. On the other hand the basic concept of common sense tells all that you cannot get something from nothing and this alone backs the idea of a supreme being or God.

That is just me, but I bet if someone would look at it they would not even notice the missing logos and the lettering that looks like it was stamped in the wrong place.2.

There are so many good spots on this album that it's hard to place your finger on one single track and say \\"that's the climax\\". Even at only 10 tracks, the CD has a real powerful movement to it.

The author writes well and, in some moments, seems to be describing a real experience. However, the facts just don't add up. It is simply too convenient for the author that: 1) he never told anyone about the bigfoot he lived with, 2) he never photographed it, 3) it died, 4) he had to chop the body to pieces, and 5) he doesn't remember where he buried it. All together, these excuses provide too convenient a way for him to not provide any real evidence that any of this ever happened. A silly book, all told."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's phoney - don't bother.","review":"I believe in bigfoot but if the author of this book really had a relationship with bigfoot he lied about it extensively.

The writing is bad too."},{"rating":"1","title":"bigfoot is real but this story isn't","review":"this is the most stupid thing. why would he drive bigfoot 200 miles then chop him up? there's lots of other crazy things in here too. it is unrealistic. while bigfoot is fact, this book is fiction. it's not even good fiction. don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This book is awful. it is the craziest thing ever. it says its true but its fictional junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"He almost had me believing this story","review":"until the part where he got the bigfoot in his car and drove it two hundred miles away and a day and a half later it was back~! He really blew the tale when he claimed to have somehow loaded the dead bigfoot up (hoisting it alone would be difficult enough) into a car, and drove it to where he cut the body into pieces before burying. I mean if you like I almost did, believed the story up to that point how could he just so callously dismember this creature that he apparently loved? I personally couldn't even do that to a dog I loved! It would be too disturbing and also unnecessary. Especially, the part where he whacked off its head with an ax no less? Why?? Had he an ounce of sense he would have photographed the body and then arranged anonomously through the Smithsonian or some reputable scientifc organization to donate the body for every one to share. This story is just that. An entertaining yarn but with parts that are disturbing as if a Stephan King novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the money for a better item.","review":"This item waited until 3 days post warranty for the LCD screen to drop out.

This is definitely a good collection of songs to play whenever you are in the mood, or to even put you in that special mood. \\"The Erotic Sessions\\" is a great companion to Sinners Lounge (The Latin Sessions), as well as the numerous Erotic Lounge compilations, but my only gripe is that some of the songs are recycled throughout these same compilations (i.e. Slow Down by Morcheeba which is also featured on the Erotic Lounge: Deluxe Edition). All things considered, this is a good compilation to have laying around to enhance those special moments, be it day or night.If you are a fan of the \\"Erotic Lounge\\" and the \\"Sinners Lounge series, make sure to keep an eye out for the latest installment of \\"Sinners Lounge\\", \\"Sinners Lounge: Pure Pleasure\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fianlly!","review":"For enthusiasts of the early quintet years, it is great to finally get a video like this released.

Though the video quality could be better, the performances are intense and well recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike two","review":"This is the second copy of this DVD I've order.

Well finally they've managed to give us something. Cool Jazz Sound presents the first Miles Davis quintet plus the Gill Evans orchestra. Given that the source of this release is dated I am more than pleased by the quality of the black and white video and also of the sound. What is somewhat disappointing is that it is only 23 minutes long. I am almost certain that enough material exists to issue a DVD twice as long instead of one with only four songs. Still, Blues for Pablo is as beautiful as ever, and I take back one star only for the brevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO DEFECTIVE DVDS","review":"Ordered this once. It was defective.

It's an old classic that's finally available again at a reasonable price. Marshall writes for children, and my K- and 2nd grader have loved these stories, but I've been equally enthralled. She begins with legends of the earliest Scots, and becomes more authoritative as she gains the ground of documented events. Read about Macbeth and Macduff, Malcolm Canmore, the beloved William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, all the Jameses, Mary-Queen of Scots, and on up through their Union to England, the last of the Stewarts (a line birthed with a wonderful tale in the early part of the book), and into the 19th century a bit.

It is, however, more of an academic work than a practical one. Statements like \\"is said to have been used for...\\" and \\"may have been used...\\" dot the text, which are not useful statements for a reader who wants to put the information into practice. Also the medical uses listed for plants are very vague and so generalized that they have no practical usefulness unless the reader is willing to experiment and see what happens (a risky proposition, especially if you're ill!) All of that said, it is enjoyable for historical/cultural information and region-specific information (living in New Mexico I instantly recognize most of the plants talked about and enjoy hearing about them, even if the information isn't of much practical use)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native Uses for southwest plants","review":"This book is a good balance between a plant guide (most of the book) and a description of past and present uses and contexts (the first chapters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing but dragging plot and unlikable characters","review":"This is a well written book, and I think Ms. Troy is very talented, but, GAWD!

Very gentle but strong work-outs that you really feel the benefits of the following day. There are a couple of editing issues that were puzzling, but fortunately I was looking down before the first time I realized that the action on the DVD was behind the vocal instruction in a couple of section in the Yoga Burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"I have been doing beginners yoga for quite some time. I had recently decided to kick it up a notch. The yoga burn is just that.. specific focus by holding different poses. It's a great workout. The power yoga, which I just tried last night is wonderful. I watched it and didn't think I could do it. Granted, there were a few i had to modify, and a few I could not do but I enjoyed it tremendously. I enjoy Rodney Yee's tapes as he has a very calming voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for beginners","review":"I appreciate the repetition and clear instruction in this video. I saw Rodney in an ad in my Pilates DVD and got interested. I was a bit skeptical because I don't want the \\"religion\\" or the spiritual side of Yoga.

The exercise is challenging and effective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks your butt!","review":"I have to say I got exactly what I was looking for in the yoga DVD. I am new to yoga practice and wanted to go from relaxing yoga to butt kicking yoga. Weight loss is important to me, but the stretching is essential as well due to injuries I am dealing with. In the first 5 minutes of the first workout I was sweating and amazed at how challenging it is. I love Rodney Yee and would much rather get my butt kicked with his routine than some of the others out there. this is a good add on to the cardio workouts I am doing. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid yoga practice at home","review":"I like this Power Yoga DVD. Rodney Yee is a great instructor. You can pick and choose shorter yoga workouts. I'm a longtime beginner, so I can't do all the moves. Sometimes he goes a little too fast. But most of the time I can keep up. I think yoga is an excellent way to build strength and maintain flexibility and mobility. Yee's DVDs also tend to be very relaxing and meditative. I own several of his workouts and will continue to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, yet easy to follow","review":"I am a new mom, having trouble losing the baby weight. I am also a yoga novice. This video collection is perfect for my needs--it is challenging physically, even giving me some cardio, yet the moves are easy to understand and the motion is slow and fluid, so that I do not feel overextended. It also works in segments, so that I still feel like I've gotten a work out even if babe wakes up after only twenty minutes.Highly recommended for most fitness levels, though I don't think someone who is totally new to exercise could handle it; you do need some experience with yoga and have good flexibility and core strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 for 1","review":"Can't go wrong with this. You get 3 long workouts for about the price of 1. The 3 workouts provide something for everyone. Yoga for Athletes is easy gentle stretching. It offers alternatives for you depending on your level of flexibility. Yoga Burn is a really nice workout and includes more isometric exercise and slower movements. It's very enjoyable. Power Yoga requires a bit more flexibility--perhaps it's a bit more advanced in some way-- so I don't use that workout. All in all, I'm very satisfied to have found 2 nice new yoga workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout !!","review":"I actually thought I would be a beginner level yogi but found that I am a bit more advanced than i thought.

I feel as if I ran a marathon after. Am now seeking a few 30 minute sessions providing what I get from these (2) 60 minute programs.Have yet to try the Athlete portion but will soon.

I'm always fascinated with discovering artists that are familiar overseas. This soundtrack has an abundance of them including Serge Gainsbourg, Patrick Bruel/Johnny Halliday,Pamela Peacemaker, Jane Birkin and Carla Bruni.The songs set a mood which, regardless of the language barrier, transport you to another place. The music by academy award nominee Richard Robbins (he also contributes to the liner notes as does the film's director James Ivory)stands out on its own.

The writer's talent as a historian is strong, and his research into the university's history is excellent. But what's lacking is a sense of cohesiveness and character. What makes Columbia unique? Where do all these facts and details lead us? \\"Stand, Columbia\\" ultimately appears as if it were commissioned by Columbia University Press to be little more than a sugar-coated celebration of the institution's 250th birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boynton is the Queen for Kids","review":"Sandra Boynton knows how to grab attention for young and old. She forces the old to read her stories in rhyme and jest. Because they are the toddler hard page editions you already know that you are going on stage with each of these. But, you are the prop, she is the story. Opposites is just as cute as it can be. I ordered it for a Tanzanian toddler whose dad wants her to learn English. This will be a great start-- High, low, day and night, all with animals that she has seen before. What can be more fun except for the whole Hippo series. Boynton is a MUST for children. Her whimsey is filled with joy and we all need that. Price is right, books are tight. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it almost every night","review":"I love all of the Sandra Boynton books.

It's just ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps okay for older kids, NOT for those just learning opposites.","review":"This book is a pretty standard book of opposites, the illustrations are just okay, not the adorable wonder that some reviewers would have you believe they are.The only thing that makes this book truly awful, in my opinion, is that the words are not laid out from left to right. For example, the word small, is written around the small bird, and the word tall is written up and down, both on the same page, with other words that go from left to right. This is confusing for small children who are learning to read and need the stability of being able to read always from left to right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over the Heads of Babies and Toddlers","review":"This book is really cute and silly...for adults or older children. I found this book to be one of the most confusing and complex series of illustrations for opposites--to date. I've got a very sharp little 16 mo. old and he was completely lost, which is not typical for him. Opposites by Sandra Boynton is more suited for the developmental level of preschoolers in the 3-5 yrs. old range and up. However, by this age, a lot of them already understand the concept of opposites so this book may be totally unnecessary for them, too. This is the last Boynton book we'll buy. For books that more clearly demonstrate opposites, see these 2 books by Chuck Murphy: \\"Opposites\\" (in the Razzle Dazzle series)and especially \\"Opposites\\" (in the Slide 'n Seek series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and to the point.","review":"I find myself changing up my voice (high and low) as I read to my son so he can get the idea of opposites. The pictures are cute, bright and to the point. I didn't give it 5 stars, because there's not a story line. From one page to the next is another set of opposites. If that's what you want, then this book is for you. If you want more of a story to connect from page to page, then you might not like it as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"nasro is the the master of lover's rai","review":"i am originally from casablanca .morocco.first time a friend gave me a cassette of cheb nasro about 6 years ago .let me tell ya.the guy can really sing .i bought most of his cd's and i listen to him almost everyday.if i was a singer i would have his style .his music is very romantic.and i love the way he croons.the guy is a master .by the way ,he played in new york about 2 years ago and i rally hate myself for not seeing him live .all my moroccan and algerian friends were there.i hope he will perform again soon in new york ASTORIAAAA.VERY GOOD ALBUM.MOROCCO.NEW JERSEY.HEY NASRO YOU ARE THE MAN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for number nerds like me!","review":"I have very positive things to say about this Whitburn collection.

Mr. Dietrich's book rather comes off as sour grapes, but whether or not those really were his feelings is also hard to tell. His book covers the many gaffs and unfinished projects indicative of a person with OCD and the selfishness of a trustfund baby -- all of which, the problems resulting from such conditions, were mopped up or smoothed over by Mr. Dietrich. I don't doubt that the things the author mentioned happened, but I wonder where are the stories of the moments of Hughes' genius that one can read about in other publications, or even a hint of humanity as a person and an employer. After reading this book, I still feel the need to read another to get the entire story and not just a piece of the tapestry, as given here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY FASCINATING STORY","review":"This book is far more entertaining and enlightening than the overly long and sometimes downright boring film \\"The Aviator.\\" I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for any IG fan","review":"This was a great DVD with a lot of special features, including bios, discography, and lyrics. I've seen them in concert many times, and this DVD is not as good as the real thing, but its still great. I think the best song on the DVD is Least Complicated, beause of the great audience participation. The only disappointment is that, for some reason, \\"Closer to Fine\\" was not from the concert. I don't know why, I am guessing the footage somehow couldn't be used. In its place they have Amy and Emily in a studio with their guitars singing it.

Cija is taken hostage by the half-reptilian general Zerd, of the Kingdom of the North, as he travels across the continent to invade the kingdom of the South. She has a series of adventures with her faithful terror bird mount.The Serpent starts off very interesting but turns into a series of episodes that don't really lead into anything. The story ends rather abruptly with no real resolution- but not a cliff hanger either. I'm not really compelled to find the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time","review":"I found this book on my mom's bookshelf when I was 12. I loved it then and loved it 13 times more. Then I wanted to name my daughter \\"Cija.\\" Instead I named a dog that. Twenty years later, I was reading Ms. magazine (remember that?) and discovered The Serpent was the first in a series of 5 books. I ran to my university bookstore to order the next one. I discovered that my copy was the first two books. I ordered the rest...they got pretty wierd and I didn't like Cija as much as time went on. She was my hero in adolescense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The picture shows a set of brake pads, but...","review":"The picture shows a set of disc brake pads by Wagner, but the item is definitely NOT a set of brake pads.

I couldn't believe it had component! There is one small flaw, it seems the picture doesn't quite fit the screen. Sometimes one or two letters gets cut off on the left side of the screen. Kinda weird. I notice it when I play my PS2. Sometimes when watching TV. It's not enough of a reason not to buy this TV. For $125, great deal. When you start to spend $160, try a better name brand, but stay away from RCA (horrible).Also, after 6 months of using this TV, I noticed the audio cuts off after about an hour. This only happens if you don't press any buttons. It's kind of like a screensaver, but for audio. I imagine it protects the speakers so they will last longer, but kinda annoying if you plan on watching a great deal of TV. I tried adjusting the set-up controld, but to no avail. I hope this review was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"I purchased this book and it is very easy to understand and has demos in it on how to do the workouts and possible injury precautions if any.

In fact, they are not as important as references to other media and other forms, to the landscapes of science fiction, and to the horror film.\\" Huh? I'm guessing that \\"they\\" means \\"real place\\" and therefore should been \\"it is not as important...\\" But I am not sure that is what he meant.

If it didn't cost so much to return the item, I would...."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does the Trick","review":"As have other reviewers, I received my initial bottle from the granite supplier who recommended that I use this for maintenance and do a sealing once a year or when water gets absorbed by the counter rather than sit atop of it in beads. His claim: Using the product extends the life of the existing sealer.It works fine. Dull spots, outlines of dishes, and other signs of counter use disappear when the product is used. I don't notice a citrus scent or much of any scent at all -- which, to me, is preferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe cleaner. Nothing spectacular","review":"I was looking for a cleaner that could clean hard water deposits and soap scum without damaging granite. It cleaned the granite safely and gave it some shine.

It is something that I can trust on a variety of stone surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renews the granite seal while you mop up spills.","review":"If your granite countertop was originally sealed with DuPont sealer, then this supposedly renews the granite seal every time you sponge off the counter top, thus postponing the recommended yearly resealing.

Its a bit more expensive than other cleaners, but it may pay for itself if it lessens the number of resealings."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than glass cleaner","review":"This stuff was a huge disappointment. My granite felt and looked no different or better after using than prior. I just don't understand the great reviews on here. You want an awesome granite polish?

The \`Tones just keep getting better and better! This album, \\"HiFi Revival\\", is kind of a break from the last album of theirs that I had and had listened to, that being \\"Chase the Sun\\". While I thought \\"Chase the Sun\\" was more mellow, this one TOTALLY ROCKS!!! I especially loved the song \\"Radio Plays\\" which slams secular music in a GREAT WAY! This song is so true about modern secular, radio music! I absolutely love the Supertones, and this album is worth the five stars given it (in fact, on a scale of 0-5 stars, I'd give \\"HiFi Revival\\" SIX!)!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn up the volume- and enjoy!","review":"While not exactly what the Supertones have done in the past, but it still fits typical Tones profile: Loud, obnoxious and more addictive than any illegal substance. While no longer just ska, the rowdy boys from the west coast put out another great album. Matt \\"Mojo\\" Morginsky again puts powerful lyrics in a casual package, all with a bit of humor. Don't believe me? Check this out: \\"I don't wanna be known as the handsome guy with the attitude.\\" it runs so fast you almost don't notice it. Emphasizing self-renewal and God's grace, as well as taking bites at pop culture and radio, disguised in punk/ska/rap/whatever, every song gets to you. It isn't a five because the Tones have done much better before, but this album is definately worth it.Jesus-driven punk. Who would've thought?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Whatever!\\"","review":"I decided to give this movie a try despite the many negative reviews. Boy was I sorry! This film is a travesty so save your time (and your money if you're thinking of buying). Milla Jovovich simply doesn't have the acting ability to pull this role off, plain and simple. She portrays Joan as a wild-eyed nut case and somehow it's hard to generate much sympathy for her in the end. Add to that the ridiculous dialogue (somehow I can't see 13th century people using the 21st century expression \\"whatever!\\") and you have a mess of a movie. The sets and costumes are fairly good and the battle scenes reasonably realistic but that's about all I can say for it.Go elseware for the story of St. Joan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"true fans beware!","review":"If you truly love Joan of Arc and admire who she was and what she did beware of this film, it will leave you in tears (and NOT because it was so good it made you cry). If you don't know much about her and want to learn more I recommend the 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc or read Recollections of Joan of Arc by Mark Twain (both are actually based on FACTS that were recorded during her life). However if you aren't and fan, and you don't want to learn more about this brave young woman, go ahead and watch the movie.

No way.It is true that this book is a tour de force of the performance analysis of CDMA. However, I would not describe it as readable.

Be prepared to spend a little time fanning out the branches, but that's the only way to make it look full and lifelike. The 4.5-foot size is a little odd -- slightly larger than a table top but still small enough to need to be placed on a riser of some kind.

Any sports fan who ever wondered what professional football/sports was really like behind the TV cameras, should read this novel. Memorable characters that parallel real-life football stars, and a great pace make this book one of my favorites. To quote one critic of the book, \\"...Gent isn't a great football player who just happened to be a talented writer, but he's a great writer who just happened to play football. North Dallas Forty is a must-read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"North Dallas Forty","review":"The book was a Christmas gift and arrived in a very timely manner. The recipient has already read the book. It was in excellent shape. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"North Dallas Forty","review":"The book is great....the condition of the book was horrible! Will make sure in future not to buy from this seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but worth it","review":"These are a little expensive for somthing you just put your clothes on in the closet. I could only purchase one of them, and so I use it only for my nicest suit. The subtle cedar smell is wonderful and the curve of this solid hanger preserves the shape of my suit. If I could afford lots more like this, I'd get 'em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better price than other vendors for flawed product","review":"Though the price was better at Amazon than on any other on-line site, this hanger is quite disappointing. The pants bar is rough to the point of needing to be covered to prevent damaging contact with jackets or pants and the item does not have any scent of cedar to it. Overall, the hanger is too rough to the touch and sloppily assembled (splinters and imprecise joining)for the purpose intended or price paid. Sorry, but cannot recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recomended","review":"I love this hanger it is a well thought out design and fits my suits perfectly, i picked it as it is made of Ceder for natural insect repelling abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and disturbing","review":"Another disturbing, fascinating novel by Kohler. This one is set in apartheid South Africa with themes of loyalty, obsession, predatory sexuality and abuse as well as sister kinship. This is my second Kohler (the first one being Children of Pithiviers which also kept me in my reading chair) so it begins to emerge that the sister theme is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"A really good book, exciting, suspenseful and also thoughtful. The characters are extremely well-drawn. I recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"This was overall a very good read.

I think you can learn a lot from a book likethis because some people think coming here is easy but you findout it's not.Grab Hands and Run is good because it gives lots ofdetails so it's easy to picture the story in your mind. I think the authordid a good job by writting this story because it teaches about the lessons in life and how families have to stick together no matter how hard or difficult the problem is."},{"rating":"1","title":"grab hands and run-not too great","review":"This book is boring, and I have to trace where they go on a map! It's very hard to do this since it says,\\"We must cross the bridge\\". I don't really like it, and I don't know why some people say it's good cause I almost feel asleep reading it. It's just not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"GRAB HANDS AND RUN!","review":"Jeez! I hated this book! I could not stay focussed or even remember what happened because it was soooo boring! It's the worst book I ever read! I had to read it for school, that's the only reason I did read it. Now, I have a test on the book, and I'm probably going to do bad, because I don't know what happened! It was just way to boring for me and I hated it so much that i couldn't remember anything that happened. NOW IM GONNA FAIL CUZ THIS STUPID BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"My son used it for a very short time and it broke. It looks better than it plays. This is truly just a toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"most excellent","review":"we had problems locating this item in town and so I went online and, here it was, for a reasonable price too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dry for a cream!","review":"I just bought this at Target assuming it would be light, moist and creamy like a facial moisturizer, but it is hard and dry--so much so that to rub it in under your eyes, you have to pull on your skin a little (the opposite of what an eye cream should be like!) The color and brightening elements are nice, but the texture is much too firm--is this what it's supposed to be like, or did I just get an old dried-up one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Steinbeck","review":"A light political satire, written within a few years of (and so sounding at times very much like) \\"The Mouse That Roared.\\" The government of France collapses yet again; this time somehow it's the Monarchists that come into power. They find the rightful heir of the Carolingian line and crown him Pippin IV. His teenage daughter dates the son of the Egg King of Petaluma, California. Political philosophy is discussed. The ending is a bit less upbeat than \\"Mouse\\" (this *is* John Steinbeck, after all), but nobody dies or anything.Not at all typical Steinbeck: that may or may not be a Good Thing, depending on your tastes. I found it amusing to read once (and short!), but zero replay value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably his most disappointing work","review":"I have read all but two of the books by Steinbeck that were published. The Short Reign of Pippin IV is by far my least favorite. There is, in my opinion, a decided stylistic shift in Steinbeck's writing following the war, and his books became increasingly bourgeois. This book is the pinnacle of this shift. I had a very difficult time reading this book, and actually had to put it aside at one point out of disappointment and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute ... yup very cute ...","review":"I was concerned when I read that 30'ish something Ellen moved out of her little Northern town to the Big Apple after winning the lottery! The thought that it will take nothing less than a nuclear explosion for this girl to make her next move scared me, but, now, after finishing the book my worst fears were realized.I guess if you like books about common people continuing to do somewhat common things, even after they win the lottery, then you'd probably like this book. The absolutely tantalizing thing about erotic stories is the illicitness of sex, the sin of it, and the delicious chase, seduction and final submission. This book skips those things, and dumps any real spontinaity as we are continuoulsy reminded that Ellen practices ONLY safe sex as we are treated to very vanilla like couplings.Cute"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I had been looking forward to its release. I have read all of Joan Elizabeth Lloyd's books and have always enjoyed them. The sex was cold and rehearsed. There was no variety at all. I felt I had read the story line before in one of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Maybe I'm lacking in imagination but the premise of a ghostly prostitute teaching Ellen the art of sensuality and showing her how to become a wine connoisseur hard to take. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. There were a few episodes that were good but overall I thought this book was boring and I had no trouble putting it down. I bought this book because I enjoyed Black Satin also written by this author. Read Black Satin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells heavenly, but left me dry and itchy","review":"This soap gets one star for the awesome herbal smell. Another star is for the amount of suds the bar produces, with just a couple of swipes. However, after one use my skin was left so itchy that I finally had to get undressed and smother my skin with lotion from head to toe! My facial skin was so tight that I could see every wrinkle! Even when applying the soap in the shower it burned my facial skin (but not body) and my face was left reddened for hours after application. I do have acne-prone sensitive skin, and think this bar would be more beneficial to normal or oily skin types. I wish the soap would have worked for me, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Will definitely be ordering this again. Shipped and delivered fast and the soap is lovely. It smells fresh and clean and lingers long after my shower or bath. A bar should last quite a while as it lathers easily and cleans without having to use a whole bar. I would recommend using along with a moisturized or bath oil as it can be slightly drying, atleast for me (i have dry type skin though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells terrible and burns","review":"First off I have very sensitive skin. When a friend recommended this soap to me I thought it would be worth a try. I give it 2 stars because while it definitely cleaned my skin it left it dry, red, and very irritated. It took almost an hour and a lot of moisturizer to get rid of the burning. Aside from that the soap smells absolutely terrible. The best description I can give it is patchouli mixed with every god awful incense you can think of. I'm just glad I didn't try this stuff after shaving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kindergarten!","review":"These stamps are great compared to the stamps that are not clear! It is very difficult for my kindergarteners to stamp where they are trying to when they can't see the letters. This makes it much easier for them. The box is not very strong though and was broken after only a few uses. Of course there are other storage solutions for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable letter stamps","review":"These stamps work great and are easy for kindergarten students to use and keep organized. I have used them for a few weeks and they are still in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great letter stamps","review":"I bought these stamps to use for memory keeping/scrapbooking. For whatever reason, it is hard to find reasonably priced simple alphabet stamps in the scrapbooking category. These stamps are great and easy to use. The surface of the stamps (the part that gets inked and touches the paper) isn't consistently smooth. There are a few stamps that have indents in the surface which are then transferred to the inked image. This 'issue' doesn't bother me, because I think it adds a little character to my stamped images. If you are looking for 'perfect' stamps, this might not be the set for you. Otherwise they are great and easy to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stamps for Classroom","review":"I bought this for my grandson's kindergarten classroom. The teacher and the children use it daily. They are easy to use and help the children spell the new words they learn. Very durable. Bought upper and lower case versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I really enjoyed this even though I don't usually read Harlequin Novels. This book's plot is is very refreshing. The heroine is very likable as is the hero. The only thing I really didn't like was that for most of the novel she thought she was in love with her childhood sweetheart and it never said that she stopped loving him. Besides that it was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"I was quite surprised at the plot for this book. Sarah was such a good heroine. Nicholas was a little weaker. I was truly surprised with Sarah's ex - it's not usual for a woman who was self described as not pretty having three men pursue her. It was a good story and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good story. I did cry in some parts because I got involved with Sarah's feelings, but it was a very emotional time for her. It drew me in and kept me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth the money","review":"This book shows many cases, gives rarity & tell who madethe cases. There is almost no text at all in this book, it isbasically a picture book. The book is lacking in information on the different companies that made cases & on when the cases were made. For those who do not know about the cases a company name is not helpful without the company background. Without the time they were made they are not helpful in dating the images they hold. The book is lacking in that it does not show a single top folding case from the early years of photography c1839 to 1842/43. You would be better off getting the books 'Union Cases' by Krainik & Walvoord & 'American Minature Case Art' by Rinhart. The two books I recommend give more information on the cases & are not just a bunch of pretty pictures. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Non-Original Recordings","review":"Tracks \\"Feels so Good\\" and \\"Give It All You Got\\" are not the original recordings, they are inferior (of course) re-workings. Stick with previous CD releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The tunes I heard on the radio from this performer were so good that I had to get the CD. Well, the rest of the songs on this CD are not worth listening to. At least that is my opinion. I am sure some listeners out there might like the CD, but I was underwhelmed and expected so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Compilation!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Don't get me wrong, there isn't a bigger Chuck Mangione fan than me, but all the songs here have been used in other compilations. As a true Mangione fan, there's no reason to buy this album. I have them all on cd and they're all on the same best of, like Best Of Chuck Mangione. This album was just a way for this music company to make money. If you're new to CHuck Mangione, than go ahead, this is a great album to buy, but the order and the material has already been released on previously released best of's and CHuck Mangione albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth-As always","review":"Great CD. There are 2 songs on there I had always heard Mangione play on the fluglehorn but on this compilation, they are vocals. Those songs are, the land of make believe and the children of sanchez. That was a disappointment. But all in all, great cd. I love Chuck Mangione."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were so close to changing my opinion of them.......","review":"This song was so catchy, this song had meaningful, pure lyrics I could relate to....I was SO close to liking them.....but the [...]cover of this single proved to me they're still the same immature retards I've hated all along.

This one sucks, I have nothing good to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype","review":"The scenery was okay (the version with Elizabeth Taylor looked a lot less like computers and a lot more real) but Billy Zane's presence was the best part. Cleopatra was acted out less like the great queen Cleopatra and more like..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Cleopatra Movie","review":"The acting was terrible and beside good looking actors/actresses, there was nothing to hope for this movie. Do not buy the movie, just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid","review":"Boring, plastic acting. Considering some of the actors involved, I really would have expected better. It must have been an easy pay day.. It's fairly obvious reading the other reviews that the Billy Zane/Timothy Dalton fanclubs have been on the prowl as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment of the Nile","review":"Because the magnificent Billy Zane was in this movie, I didn't think I would have to expect too much from this crock--now I do. What's sad about this film is that (a horribly untalented) Leonor Varela makes the great and beautiful Cleopatra look like a street whore, and when the scene for the overthrow of Egypt occurs, it seems over inadequate to see her begin to say something intelligent (also, the script is terrible and unrealistic). Timothy Dalton was good, but not for this role: I couldn't see him as Caesar. Billy Zane, although his acting was lovely, it was overdone and hammy. The sets and musical score are beautiful, but it just goes downhill from there-you'd wish it was a silent film! I wouldn't purchase this movie if it were FREE! Don't waste your money (Go see the Elizabeth Taylor version--she can actually act!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"two thumbs up, informative and entertaining!!!","review":"This movie was so interesting and much better since i saw the movie before reading the book. The movies are always disappointing compared to the book. Since they only had a few hours they did a really good job and Timothy Dalton and Billy Zane are fine! They make it worth it. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes an interesting story with good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closer to the facts than any other","review":"I loved this movie. It was far closer to the truth than any other Cleopatra movie, with just enough of the legend thrown in to make it glamourous. Only one I have seen that makes reference to to the religious signifigance to their people of Antony as Dionysis, among other things. As T.V. movies go, it was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one!","review":"I have to say that I enjoyed this version much more than I did the Liz Taylor version. I don't say that just because this version was shorter. I thought the acting, costumes and settings were better. To quote from the end of Shakespeare's \\"Antony and Cleopatra,\\" \\"Was this well done?\\" \\"Very well done.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"A good movie filled with love, action, adventure and romance. The story of Cleopatra is well known but this is one of the best film versions ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooooring","review":"I did not see this on tv, but rather on DVD. I found it very difficult to follow, with only Rupert Graves and Billy Zane giving any sort of worthwhile performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even with a Titanic star, doesn't work!","review":"I can't believe this film was made using such a high budget! I bought this thinking it would be on par or better than the mediocre made-for-tv flicks \\"The Odyssey\\" and \\"Merlin\\". \\"Cleopatra\\" isn't as good as either one. With how much money was spent, I thought the sets looked rather fake and unbelievable, including a few scenes where the characters are superimposed into a computer animated background reducing me to laughter and wanting my (money) I spent on this big-budget, bad acted flick. Save the (money) I spent and buy a book on her instead! I thought it would be fun and have great visuals, but it displayed neither and left me bored...a must-NOT see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"i love the movie. i've got the video and watch it every chance i get. most of all i love it because i am a history buff, especially ancient roman history. but i hate it when movie producers alter what happened in real history in their movies... set the story straight for those unread people. the costumes and sets were some of the most enjoyables parts of the movie, aside from billy zane and timothy dalton (from 'Scarlett' !!). Leonor is very pretty but there is a bit to be said about her acting, though i havent seen her in much, though i could be wrong, so in time she'll definitely get better. but all in all it isnt a movie to miss. if you appreciate history and classicism this definitely is a movie to watch at least once, and even if u dont know what classicism is, still watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok, but some things were left out","review":"The movie is very good. Wonderful acting, good story, esc.. But they left out some things that happened and changed some. Antony wasn't wounded in battle before he died, he killed himsef. And Cleopatra had two children with Antony. Also, her first child was killed by Octavius shortly before she killed herself. But dispite those flaws, it was still a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad movie for a really boring sunday afternoon","review":"The sights of Egypt were people. The costumes were believeable and nicely done. The music was touching. However, the story itself was really botched. I am a fan of Cleopatra's. I generally can not even compare it to former movies done about this group of historical figures. To the director, please stop trying to change history. It's really sucks when you try to improve on the orginial. The acting wasn't two bad by the men but as for the lead female. She lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not historical, seems like lots of scenes are missing","review":"I saw this movie on TV. I thought the costumes and scenerey were great but chunks of history were cut out when they made the movie. I recommend that you read the book it was based on, The Memoirs of Cleopatra by Margret George. It is much better, and captures the truth of Cleopatra as closely as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!","review":"In a made-for-Tv miniseries, you sort of expect shabby special-effects, and less than stellar acting, but this one sinks to new lows. Even with credible actors such as Dalton and Zane, ALL the performances here ranged from wooden (Dalton and Zane) to plain awful (Valera). A lot of this I suspect was due to lousy directing coupled with a cartoon of a script. The costumes look like something from a high-school production, and the sets are possibly the worst ever assembled for a period piece. Everything looks like cardboard cut-outs. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK","review":"It was ok except some parts were cut out of the movie from the end. I saw the whole movie, but parts were missing from the video. If you want swiss cheese, look here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful Film poorly acted","review":"I loved this movie. The costumes were beautiful and the acting was excellent. Maybe not always 100% accurate but that's Hollywood. Unless its a documentary, there's no real need to be nitpicky about historical inaccuracies. Movies are made for entertainment. And this one definitely does that. My only criticism is the acting is really second-rate. Cleopatra comes across as a whiny spoiled brat who would cause a scene if things weren't done according to her wishes. If the real Cleopatra was truly this childish I'm not surprised Octavius defeated her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"This truly is an excellent film. Great acting, battle scenes and quality of filming. It is well-written and depicts a good version of Cleopatra's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Scenery, Too Bad About The Cast","review":"The lush scenery and costuming used in this production makes it worthwhile to rent. The choice of Lenora Valera as Cleopatra, however, I had a real problem with. It was widely known that Cleopatra was not only Greek, but not particularly beautiful. It was her voice which mesmerized. I think HBO's Rome Series did a fantastic job in casting for Cleopatra. By casting Lenora Valera for the part, the directors chose to make an unrealistic \\"sexy\\" portrayal of an ancient story which doesn't need any \\"Sexing\\" up from Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!","review":"the movie was awful. it was really inappropriate it did not have a good plot and does not historically show cleopatra's life and i did the movie as part of a book report and the book was very different"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Insomniacs, A Rainy Day Off From Work or Timothy Dalton Fans","review":"The 2 stars are for Timothy Dalton. Honestly, he was the only reason I was able to watch this film. Pure eye candy. As a chick flick, the film failed even in terms of wardrobe. What was with the ugly serpent headpiece Cleo wore through the film? The actress playing Cleopatra portrayed her not as a queen of a nation, but a rich girl with nothing to do but make trouble for family members and sleep around with important men. The worst scene is when Cleo actually asks Ceasar \\"Do you love me?\\" I expected her to start doing his laundry or making meals for him in the next scene. The other members of the royal family were equally laughable, especially the rotund general/advisor of brother Ptolomey. Please do not spend any money on this film. The writers are truly the culprits of this film. Wait until a baseball game gets rained out and the film gets scheduled as a filler. Unless, of course, you simply can not get enough of Timothy Dalton."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame that Margaret George's name is associated with it..","review":"After reading the spectacular novel upon which this movie is based I of course couldn't wait to see the movie. It was so unfortunate to find the storyline completely deviated and the acting atrocious. Many of the other reviews of this movie say exactly what i want to say so i will leave it at that. Beautiful people, scenery, etc...but absolutley no substance or integrity to all of the research Margaret George did for her novel. I hope seeing this movie doesn't lead anyone to beleive that the novel is even closely related."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break","review":"I made it through about half of this movie before I ejected it and went to the video store to rent the Elizabeth Taylor version.

It seems to me that the AI could not keep up with the other advances. Consequently, the campaigns were much easier than they were in Heroes II Gold. The concept of carrying some of your best heroes from one level to the next in the campaigns makes the game too easy. In particular, I finished the last level of one of the campaigns within a ridiculously short period of time because I had too many powerful spells, such as the \\"fly\\" spell. The game is still tons of fun, but Heroes II Gold is much more difficult, so I actually gave my copy of Heroes III to somebody else when I finished it.

This software takes a long time, and requires multiple steps (first about an hour to pre-process a file, then select output format then another hour or so to convert) instead of one click - so no overnight copy/convert process. It did create output files - one in DVD copy format, and another in MPEG format (I had to try different methods since the first one did not work) - neither worked. My PC was unable to play neither file - about 3 hours I will never get back.

After doing a fix, I vowed never to download this stuff again and go ahead and pay the 50 bucks for the real stuff, and boy, did I pick a loser. Nothing worked. 123 DVD Copy Gold not only doesn't copy and burn DVDs, it doesn't even burn DVD files stored on my external hard drive. I emailed the company, describing the problems I was having, and never received a reply. I tried everything, disabling my firewall, uninstalling/reinstalling, etc, to no avail.

No matter how hard you try, with any DVD, copied from any other source, you will constantly hit a wall that says there is an error and you will not be able to duplicate a DVD. This is an absolute nightmare of incompetence and an out and out con.

It simply does not work well, period. Very hard to use, very slow. Do yourself a favor, get the free download of DVD Fab Decrypter, it will copy DVDs many times faster.I could not copy DVDs I'd made from television shows. And the software claims to have the ability to make vidcaps or wall paper from a scene from a movie. I tried it --- very, very difficult to navigate your way to the scene you want unless you pretty much want to watch the whole movie and do a video capture when you get to the scene of interest.Very disappointed with this product, a true waste of money. I will continue to use the free Fab Decrypter download (it is a stripped-down version of their full product), and I will not bother with this piece of junk anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SOFTWARE","review":"I learned my lesson the hard way with this software. From now on I will read the reviews before I purchase any software of this nature. I spent $50 on 123 Copy DVD old 2010 to create backup for my DVD's and then spent all day trying to figure the software out. No directions, nothing to help out whatsoever. Tried going to 123 website and that didn't work either. The tutorial wouldn't work, the online tech support would not submit, there is no number to call..... nothing. Save yourself the headache and find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great marketing and clever packeging","review":"I was impress by the number of devices it supported however little did I know that it only creates like three different formats AVI, MPG4 and something else. On top of that the software takes the illusion father by allowing you to select the device you will be using instead of the format desired, what a joke. Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Will Robinson, Stay Away from 123","review":"I just purchased 123 Gold and I still have yet to get this P.O.S. (Piece of Software to be nice) to work. It appears it is a hit and miss on which computers it will work on. Even with all the suggested work arounds from the delayed emails you get from 123 prove to be ineffective. I give it two thumbs down with a shovel to start digging with.I am tired of 123's run arounds and consider my investment a loss. Save your money and go buy some cotton candy at the fair. At least you will have a little enjoyment and forgo all the frustration.

I was foolish enought to buy it twice. The first time I did it worked great for about two weeks and then it went on the blink. I tried to uninstall and re-install but with no luck. A year or so later I bough it again and this time it would not work out of the book. Want to try customer support help, you can forget it. This is a awful product and the company needs to stop putting it on the market. Everone who has ever used this product need to let folks know not to buy it.

Apparently, Acorn media stuff will not work. I have tried downloading the entire disk then converting also, but still no luck. I have found some work arounds in a few cases, but never with Acorn media items. Despite the problems, I have been able to create several video files and put them on the Zune as long as they were not Acorn. Still, it is very time consuming for someone no too technically oriented (like me). I have several series of new videos I would like to store as Mpeg4 files for travel use, but several of them will not work. By coincidence, they are all Acorn media related items. I never thought to consider who is behind the recorded product before, but now I will avoid anything from Acorn.

She used it 2-3 times and since could care less about it. I think she may be too young for it. She tries to put the balls into the bottom even though I keep showing her how to use it. As far as educational.... Cause and effect is where I would say the education comes in, then there is colors but that's about it. As far as durable..its burable but I truly wish it didn't tip so easily. Cute toy over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll-a-rounds toy","review":"My kids loved this toy so much that I bought it for my niece. It's great for all ages. I even caught my 5 and 7 year old playing with it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a winner!","review":"I bought this for my daughter a couple of weeks before she turned 6 months and she immediately fell in love with it! In about an hour she figured out how to press the blue lever to hear the sound - it took a couple of weeks for her to connect the ball coming out with her pressing the lever but she still loved playing with the balls even independent of the gumball machine.Set comes with 4 balls - machine holds 5. Included balls are candy themed - ring pop, lolly pop, wrapped candy and a teddy bearOk so 4 stars for 2 reasons. First, the balls that come with the toy are cute but not very exciting. I bought a second set of 6 balls that make sounds - they are much more fun when they roll out of the machine! Second my little one is starting to crawl and when she tries to pull herself up using the toy it falls on her and sometimes it hurts. Not the toy's fault but just FYI.Bottom line is this, one month later and she still loves the toy and I haven't taken it away yet to renew it's novelty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, but pulling up danger","review":"I bought this toy for my infant a couple of months ago, and she loved it. It is really a cute toy. I think I like playing with it as much as she does. However, when she learned how to pull up on it the whole thing tipped over away from her. She fell over the top of it, and she hit her mouth. She has not been quite as interested in it since this happened. It is a great toy, but extra care should be taken once your baby can pull up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves this!!","review":"My husband bought this for our 8 month old son. I love that it's easy for my son to push the lever down and he gets rewarded for doing so. The roll a round are easy for him to grasp and each one is interesting in it's own way. My baby loves it and best of all it entertains him for more than just 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but. . .","review":"My daughter loves this toy. She figured out how to use it in a couple days. However, it's top heavy, so it falls over very easily and has squashed my babys hands on more than one occasion. It should of had a stronger or wider base."},{"rating":"2","title":"confidence builder!","review":"My son recieved this when he was 5 months old. The balls are wonderful - just the right size! The Gumball lights and sounds are soft and appealing to both of us. The knob also turns to reveal little gumball pictures. Right away, he was able to put the balls in the container. It seemed to be one of the few toys at the time he could master at his skill level. When he turned a year old, he was putting the balls up top, pressing on the lever, and smiling when the balls come twirling down. He was so thrilled to be doing it all by himself! Now at 17 months, there are a little more challenging activites to choose from but it was defentily a hit in his earlier months! Excellent Cause N' Effect toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best baby toys out there!!","review":"My older daughter had this toy and absolutely loved it as a baby, so I just HAD to buy it again for our 5-month-old! She loves pressing the lever and watching the ball come out of the bottom! She does knock it over occasionally when she's sitting up next to it, but it's not a bother to pick the gumball machine back up each time because I'm usually sitting on the floor with her. She enjoys the music and pressing the lever over and over, the toy is fun and educational. When she's trying to flip over during a diaper change, I set this next to her and she'll reach up to pull the lever, so it makes diaper changes easier, too!If you're reading the reviews and debating on whether to buy it or not, definitely buy it! This is a MUST HAVE toy for all babies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it by neither of my daughters did...","review":"I thought this looked like such a fun toy, but neither one of my daughters ever played with it! I would show them that it lit up and the noises, etc - but nothing. They did like the peek-a-boo balls, but they never got into the machine itself. The Big Cube is a much better purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, and silly","review":"I bought this for my son for his first birthday. He likes it alot and it's not to annoying. The music gets a little redundant but what kid toys don't. The only problem we have is more because of his age and not the toy. He likes to put things other than balls in it, which can be rather annoying when they get stuck. but most of the time you can just turn it over and shake it and the stuck toy comes loose. Overall, it's a simple fun toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"My daughter recieved this for her first Birthday. She loved it and still does. It's one of the few toys that will actually hold her interest for more than a few seconds. Its great! The best part of the whole toy is that she can actually push the lever herself. I've found that a lot of toys are too hard for her to push or pull or whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"funballs","review":"I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. At first he didn't play with it, but a few days later he really started to understand how it worked. Now, he plays with it or the balls atleast once a day. I even bought more of the balls to add some more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finger injury risk!","review":"I bought this toy because it looked like a lot of fun and it had won a few baby awards. I gave it to my 7 month old and she was very happy playing with it until her little finger became trapped in the yellow twisting piece on the front. She was not seriously injured but she was still hurt and very upset. I would not recommend this product unless Fisher Price closes the opens behind the yellow twisting piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but no storage for balls","review":"The idea is great, the toy is sturdy and the balls are very durable. However, there is no place to store the balls when play time is over. Now I have these balls all over the place. I find one in every room. And when my daughter wants to play, I have to go hunting for the balls. Definately needs to be re-designed to allow for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I got this for my seven-month old and he immediately loved it. It took him no time to learn how to press the blue handle down and get one of the peek-a-rounds gumballs to come out. The top only has room for four or five of the peek-a-rounds (it comes with four: teddy bear, candy, lollipop and ring), so I had to stand by and continuously put more on the top as he pressed the handle. Whenever the handle is pressed, the gumball machine plays a short tune. It also has a switch to turn the songs off or control the volume. There is a yellow turn handle at the front that makes a clicking noise when turned. My son really likes that too. One reviewer said this handle was hollow and dangerous. Mine is not hollow, so perhaps it was changed (for the better!). One thing I don't like about this toy is that it doesn't have a very solid base; my son easily, and frequently tips it over. That doesn't seem to detract from his fun though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"My 7 month old son got this as a Christmas present and I was worried he wouldn't catch on to the release lever. He learned very quickly how to put the balls in and then press the lever to release them all on his own. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"We just got this toy for my son for his first birthday and everyone loves it! The balls themselves are way cute, and the gumball machine is adorable as well. My 4 year old dauhgter calls it a toilet though, because its round with a hole and can be \\"flushed\\" lol. This toy also stores easily and the music it plays doesnt sound like nails on a blackboard like some toys we have had. Definatly a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $4.50","review":"I paid $4.50 + $2.95 shipping for this collection and i would say this collection is probably worth no more than $1.00 total with shipping.
