It was the cheesiest piece of fluff I've seen in a very long time. All the characters were so stereotypical, the jokes were trite and predictable and Liv Tyler CAN'T ACT HER WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG. If the fate of the world rested on her acting abilities we'd all be dead. It was all predictable and utter nonsense.

Even if you could ignore all the scientific inaccurasies and go along with the 'filmmakers' own laws of physics, you are still left with a dismal cast of characters.

Within 30 minutes we walked out of the thing with my husband uttering more apologies than I believe he would give me if he cheated on me! This is the only movie I have ever walked out on! Liv Tyler is no more than eye candy, completely void of any real talent other than looking pouty and vulnerable.This is an overly dramatic, poorly acted and all around terrible movie.

This is mindless entertainment! Go get the movie Blue with Juliette Binoche and make yourself do a little thinking. Or better yet pick up a book! This trash is an embarrassment to modern society!

Buscemi, why would you endanger your fabulous career while doing a typical, boring action film like this one. Armageddon had to be the most boring movie I have ever seen.

Was the acting so lacking that they had to fill in time with things blowing up.Steve, all I ask you is to stay doing film greats like Fargo, Raising Arizona, Trees Lounge and Living in Oblivion. These are the films that will send you in the ranks of the greatest actor of all time. I know you just sold out to do this lousy excuse for a movie. Armageddon was JUNK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a No-Brainer","review":"Armageddon is not a film for moviegoers who like to think while in the theater. This is a film for people who like to just sit there while the film's visuals attack every nerve in their bodies with relentless determination. This movie is just too loud in every way to be enjoyable. Also, I found many parts of the movie highly implausible. For example, why is it possible at one time for the asteroid heading toward earth, on which Willis and his oil crew are drilling, to have similar gravity to earth, while at another time, a vehicle is able to float across a canyon as if the vehicle were weightless? Maybe that was explained, and I just couldn't hear it over all the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armageddon is right!","review":"Why, God, Why! This all I have to say for this sorry excuse for a movie. They blow up Paris and Shanghai and New York! All of the world's culture is gone. The science is pathetic. For example, why does NASA allow the astronauts to walk off the shuttle and into their girl-friends arms after they've been in space. They should be feeling severe problems with moving. The flag-waving reaches unbearable proportions. After the first two hours we wonder if they save the world yet. Everybody is just stupid. The best actor is probably Dotty, the woman who has the asteroid named after her. Why is there a Maxim machine gun if the general said he didn't trust those retards with a potato gun? And he let them jack around with a nuclear bomb. Don't be surprised if Las Vegas is nuked for July Fourth fireworks. I won't continue on the lack of plot, lame and impossible science, and other fallacies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Movie","review":"I saw Deep Impact before I saw this movie, and expected Armmageddon to be the better film.

A huge waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armageddon really tired of this movie","review":"Firstly, (I honestly do not know where to begin) even Ed Wood could imagine a more cogent film than this cerebral fodder.I must admit, I am more upset that the film was even made, simply having Hollywood cash in on people's fears of the supposed 'end times' is bad enough, but if this is how you profit from it, at least make it entertaining and thoughtful enough to not feel like a lobotomy. Enough, Bruce, enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bogus Hollywood blockbuster","review":"This is one of those big budget Hollywood movies that tries to substitute special effects for the smallest amount of script writing.

There are great special f/x and the movie is well cast. The characters all seem to be lifelike individuals with their own thoughts and motivations. The cinematography was wonderful. Buckheimer knows how to film a movie (check Enemy of the State). The scenes seem sincere and keep moving. Unlike many other movies where the plot takes two hours to build up to a 5 minute ending with lots of talking (Deep Impact, Contact, etc...), Armageddon brought the action to you and kept you entertained. It reminded me of the great 80's movies where the action kept coming (Die Hard, Raiders, etc...) even if some of the plot was a little hard to believe.

Ben Affleck looks great, but he is almost one dimensional, as is Bruce Willis, and Liv Tyler. Tearjerker ending better than anything else in the movie, but so contrived, I felt stupid for crying. I knew I was supposed to be sobbing, so I wasn't really moved. Save this movie for nights when you need a damn good laugh, or when you're teaching a screenwriting class, and need to show what an awful, wretched, cheap, terrible, cliched script looks like.

It is one of those rare movies where not even one redeeming quality can be found. The story is simplistic, stupid and worst of all is about as believable as your average national enquire story. The special effects are big, loud but they move from scene to scene so quickly that you end up seing next to nothing of what they are trying to show you. I fully understand that the movie was intended for a younger audience but it is insulting even to them. It is as if hollywood was saying that the newest generation of kids is brain dead and is unable to distinguish a good movie from a loud one. Hollywood should know by now that a good movie always starts with a good story. If a story is good, the special effects are not even necessary. Personally I consider that 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life have been wasted and I hope that it will be a long time before such garbage spills out of hollywood's bin again."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST OF THE WORSTS!!!","review":"Dull, this is the comment that I found in this ridiculous movie about an asteroid who menace the earth and toughs dumbs guys who save the world from the apocalypse.

Well, Willis is good with the right director (Tarantino PULP FICTION), but here I just got bored watching his slowmotion dramatic eye glances, Buscemi's snaggletoothed gring, Tyler's doe-eyed pouting, folks, do yourselves a favor and stick a fork in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen.

There is comaraderie and infighting, yet, they get more serious as they get closer to take off and the rendezvous with meteor.The special effects are a little more spectacular than those on Deep Impact, yet the scenes on the meteor itself are a little bit unreal.The cast is an interesting broad spectrum of characters, many whom have come into their own since Armageddon. I think for special effects and action Armageddon is much better than Deep Impact, yet the plot and story of the latter is much better.Armageddon though does show a group of very tough men with a challenging job ahead of them, taking things both in stride and with a sense of confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hollywood to be good","review":"Did somebody say suck?

If it were not for a dumb, cliched plot, this movie is very well-made (in fact, it could have been a lot better movie if they had simply stick to the pure action formula and none of those weak emoting attempts.) In order to enjoy this one, you have to check out your brain before reclining into your couch with your remote control in hand (you may need it because there are scenes too atrocious to accept viewing at normal pace - I like Liv Tyler, but I could not stand her in this movie.) Do not think of what you have learned in high school physics class. Do not try to make the connection between one scene with another.

But that's all about, for $150 million dollars. Maybe that was the only reason I bought it on DVD even though I saw it in the theartre. It was just another \\"corny\\" movie in 1998, after \\"Godzilla\\" (*1/2) and \\"Deep Impact\\" (**1/2). Hollywood studios have spent a lot of money on visual effect these years, however, the stories are getting worse.

Director Michael Bay's lightning-fast editing style is NOT \\"cool\\". It's annoying, tiresome and, above all, bad storytelling. The only good thing about this movie is Billy Bob Thornton, who spends most of his time down in the control room.

Many people refute my condemnation of this movie by saying that they go to the movies to enjoy themselves not to see important or artistic works. First of all, seeing intellegent, inspired and creative works pleases me more than anything else, the feeling I get when I leave the theatre is like nothing else. I didn't enjoy this movie for a second. It sickened me. If people truly enjoy movies like this (it made $200 mil domestically) I don't understand how this does so well, when intellegent, well-crafted and yes, highly entertaining movies like the insider make $30 mil.

The way he always keeps the camera in motion to make aveything more dinamic is pathetic and he has now proven that he is even mor worse with actors than George Lucas. The script is nothing more than pityfull and a story that otherwise could have been very exiting and entertaining, becomes nothing more than a big bunch of FX with no meaning to it.

There was not one point where I actually feared that a meteor was coming to earth.

I feel this kind of fimmaking is ahead of its time, but I have doubts about its potential. Thumbs up to Billy Bob Thorton for playing a new-age John Wayne.

Sure, the science might be bad, but it's probably just a lot of rollicking good fun.\\" How WRONG I was!

There a few rare scenes with the minor characters that are kind of funny, but other than that this film has nothing. The stupid girl is the most annoying person I can imagine. Her ego was big enough to stop the stupid asteroid. Why were the asteroid landers equipped with chain guns? Why were ROCKS exploding in HUGE FIREBALLS over 400 miles out of the Earth's atmosphere?

It also helps if you're a very emotional person that can get lost in feelings quite easily. Unless you're wrapped up with the whole end of the world thing and not thinking rationally, you're going to find many holes in the plot, actors (some of them good) struggling with bad material and special effects done to the point where it just makes you sick. What I really enjoyed about this film was how clever Jerry Bruckheimer was to keep the \\"action\\" and \\"plot\\" (terms used very loosely) so fast paced and hard to follow that you didn't even notice that he totally avoided even trying to realistically simulate the conditions of space (or anything else for that matter).A worthy film for masochists."},{"rating":"1","title":"why criterion?","review":"Of all the great films that Criterion has put out, I was wondering why on earth they did Armaggedon.

Not to mention the action was superb, the comedy was there, and there was tons of suspense. This is one movie that will make you laugh, cry, and keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's excellent!","review":"It's a great movie, the only thing is that it doesn't really describe armageddon, but other than that it rocks!!!! Willis, Tyler, and Affleck do an excellent job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Have To Ask What My Comment Is???","review":"I totally wish I'd of seen it in the theatres!! This going to be the best movie EVER!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It could happen","review":"To start off with, Can it Happen ? probably. Alot of people I spoke with said \\"The movie is far-fetched\\" I reply, \\"we never had it happen so who really knows how the world would react to solve it or stop it\\" My personal thoughts about the movie is INCREDIBLE. The special effects, the acting, and two people ( Willis & Afflect ) putting their diffrences both proffesionaly & personal aside. The script was well written Though I do imagine that if it were to happen for real, I think the men would be more assertive and less screwing around. No one can dispute the special effects, They alone were outstanding. The Acting, You have such diverse group of people all with diffrent personalities and yet they all work as a team. I enjoyed the movie very much and purchased it for my collection. As a big fan of Sci-Fi, Armageddon fits right in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Scientific fiction movie that I have ever seen","review":"This is a fast-pace movie and the producer did not waste a single minute in the entire movie. Great action and great emotion design. My son and I love this movie very much. But my geologist husband refused to see the movie, it is because just like the opening of the movie: \\"It happened before, it will happen again\\". The potential termination of the mankind does make us feel bad. Hey, but what can you say, this is natural. Nature created mankind, nature may create something else that might better fit the new environment other than mankind... ok, I don't want to start a flame here. Overall, this is an excellen movie if you love action, if you are not afraid to the reality - we may get \\"totaled\\" any time! My attidute is enjoy every single minute that you have! Enjoy the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why...Michael Bay...Why?","review":"It was everything that I would expect from director Michael Bay - a summer blockbuster filled with every action/thiller/sci-fi cliché known to man that completely undermines science, logic and reason. Obviously, these kinds of movies are not made for cognitive minds. They are made for people who like watching American Idol and Dancing with the Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me wretch","review":"I just have to do my small part to counteract reviews below on what a great movie this is. This movie did not make me cry, or laugh, or inspire me - it did give me a violent urge to wretch and then to hurl my remote at the TV.I would give the movie 2 stars if they came up with a version with all of the idiotic Liv Tyler scenes cut out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye-candy for easy-to-please movie-goers","review":"This movie is perhaps one of the purest examples of producers knowing exactly what formula will draw in huge box-office activity from mainstream movie-goers.... A big budget, big names, and big explosions. The fact that the creators of Amageddon weren't \\"big\\" on the actual story or the characters doesn't seem to matter.And why should they care? It's obviously much easier to make a bad movie than it is to make a good one. Why subject themselves to the extra stress? Just throw in some popular good-looking actors, and make sure the camera captures sweat running down the sides of their faces while the American flag is blowing in slow-motion behind them. Mix in a lot of pyro and loud music and you have yourselves a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Anybody who admits to enjoying it should be regarded with deep suspicion.I'm used to having to \\"Suspend my Disbelief\\" when watching a movie, but this is ridiculous. It is totally implausible, has no plot to speak of, incredibly inept direction (what's with the zooming so close to someone's face that it cuts the top of their head off IN EVERY SCENE), wooden acting, forgettable throwaway lines, not to mention the fact that a comet or asteroid would be mostly eroded flat and not look like some piece of abstract Waterford crystal.Please stop Michael Bay before he directs again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan 9 is actually kinda cool...","review":"This movie is probably the dividing line between the sheep and everone else. People with flock mentalities like \\"Armageddon\\" because Liv is sooo cute, things go boom and make big yellow explosions, and every character has some sort of vocal handicap that limits their speech to cheesy one-liners. To say this film is bad is to insult truly bad films, which are campy because the filmmakers were trying to make something good and just didn't know what they were doing or have the money to put it on the screen. But this IS exactly the movie Michael Bay set out to make--The Gone With The Wind for stupid people. And stupid people love it! I know, I work in a video store. It's scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies of 1998","review":"Terrible acting, directing, and script. Everybody in this \\"movie\\" overacts terribly.The \\"emotional\\" scenes are so terribly overdone (with terrible dialogue) that it's hard to watch - just like the rest of the movie. This movie will give you a headache, not just because of the terrible performances and script but the camerawork - it's constantly moving! Almost all the cuts last only a few seconds at best! This movie is more stupid and meaningless than most action movies, mostly because it tries to fool the audience into thinking there is more there than there actually is - absolutely nothing! \\"Armageddon\\" is a movie to be hated with immense passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the movie but they changed the soundtrack on the DVD version","review":"I also own the original VCR version of this movie so I know what the original soundtrack sounded like. I've seen this done to other movies that have gone to DVD---often the soundtrack makes the movie and is very disappointing when it is changed upon being released under a new format."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PITIFUL ATTEMPT FOR A GOOD ACTION/CHIC FLICK","review":"I am tired of all the crap that has riddled this movie industry.

I about threw my T.V. on to the streets below my Jackson Hole cabin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borderline outrageous, but entertaining nonetheless","review":"If it's believability you're looking for, you'd best keep searching. But if you want an enjoyable flick to pass the evening, Armageddon is just the ticket.The storyline is a bit thin, and there some obvious blunders in regards to the details. (e.g. Space Command is in Houston not the Pentagon) But if you can get past such garnish, there's a juicy main course. Brain food it's not.And just as a final note, it's the only movie I've seen my fiance cry at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst action-movie of all time","review":"Idiotic story.

It's the most boring action movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate DVD, a must have for all fans","review":"This new Criterion version of Armageddon is just about as good as a moovei can get. With almost 9 minutes of new footage, bloopers, deleted scenes, and hundreds of other cool effects, this DVD blows all previous attempts out of the water. If you own a DVD player and you want one movie that is guaranteed to rock every nerve in your body, this is the one. I just bought it today, and after watching it for the first time, I am ready to see it again adn again. There are so many new things here that it is hard to keep up with them all. A great movie like Armageddon deserves exactly this- a place in the Criterion collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is SUPPOSED to be entertainment, not science.","review":"To start with, the science in the movie was really bad. There is no way you would send up oil drillers to an asteroid regardless of what has to be done. The whole idea of a dune buggy with guns is ridiculous. And why exactly would you send up an armed vehicle to a deserted asteroid.But back to the point... It is supposed to be entertainment, not a science lesson, not great art, not even great acting. Just entertainment.The action was great, the ending you could see coming from a mile away and still it did not take away from the effect. When we first say it in the theater the standing room only crowd cheered throughout the movie. It was ENTERTAINMENT.The DVD does the film justice and the directors cut adds in those bits and pieces removed to make it commercial (short enough to turn the theater over for the next showing - remember Meet Joe Black - 3 hours and not drink delivery in the theater).This is a keeper..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is that?","review":"I've never seen a mess like that, poor acting, unrealistic but fortunatelly, good specials effects.

Then you will see that this movie is very, very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense entertainment, humor, and just great fun.","review":"This film is just good fun. not really any acting, and funny as well. But this film needs no acting, its just a really fun summer time movie about the apocalypse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disengage brain, then sit back & enjoy","review":"Hey, I can't give this more than three stars. The plot is predictable, laughable, and implausible. Except for Billy Bob Thornton, the acting is negligible. It's about 30 minutes too long, for a piece of fluff.But I found it rather fun to watch. There was some way out humor. I enjoyed the repetition of the main song, Diane Warren's \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\". And I like the \\"Leaving On A Jet Plane\\" sequence.I guess that what it is, well you can watch it with absolute no mental effort at all. It's rather loud, but you can adjust to that.What can I say. It's not really a good picture. You're liable to think you wasted a good 150 minutes of your life on this. But it does move, and it did have some sort of a hypnotic effect. So if you don't expect anything deep or even sensible, and enjoy just drifting along with this, you just might like it. But don't say that I recommended it, because I might get sued!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see movie...Action packed,funny,romance,surprise end!","review":"Casting was perfect for this movie.

Non anamorphic DVD 0 stars.","review":"Sure wish the studio would make an anamorphic version so that people like me with a widescreen TV wouldn't have to zoom the picture to fill the screen and lose the clarity of the movie. All those people giving this product a great review must be watching on an antique square screen TV. Come on studio anamorphic, anamorphic, anamorphic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Bruce Willis","review":"Action, saving the world from destruction, and setting off a big bomb, what else would you expect from Willis. Okay, brain cells are not in demand here. It is entertainment on the lighter side but the characters and special effects are enough to keep the viewer entertained when you just want to sit back and see the good guys save the world. I can suspend realism now and again. I enjoyed this movies, several times now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and overrated","review":"Bored with this movie and I expected way better from Affleck and Willis.

For the English majors in the house, Bruce Willis is a Beowulfian booze guzzling character who leads his merry band of booze guzzling warriors against the demon from hell (a planet destroying asteroid. The sets on the asteroid are top notch and convey a sense of evil. The acting is better than average for this kind of genre, the editing crisp and well-paced, and the production is on the whole very slick. If you love Hollywood, and all that that implies, you will love this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Bad].","review":"[Bad] movie, dumb plot, lousy acting, boring, not entertaining at all.Just glad the americans could be there to save us all again. Pffft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk-Food Cinema From Michael Bay","review":"Filmmaking for incredibly short attention spans. Director Michael Bay's Veg-O-Matic style guarantees that no shot lasts longer than 10 seconds. This editing technique may work on a three-minute music video, but it's excruciating for a theatrical feature. Meanwhile, a decent cast fights for breathing room. \\"Armageddon\\" gives new meaning to the term \\"headache inducing\\" - even worse than 1998's other science-fiction disaster, \\"Deep Impact.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Willis-movie... oh yeah.","review":"What have Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, Charles Bronson and dearest Bruce Willis in common? Only on expression on their rich and talented actor-faces - and you just have to envy Bruce: how many times did he save the world now? Was it 50? I liked Bruce in just one, ONE, of his many films - Sixth Sence, he actually did a good \\"face\\" there - and up to recently, for some reason I just can't find, he has been offered many great film-deals - and I'm sure he was paid \\"ok\\" for Armageddon too, no doubt - Willis is a man I find hard to see as the big actor-star that he actually is, compare him to Sean Penn, Robert De Niro... Well, this is my opinion on him as one of the highest paid actors today anyway, I'm sure he's a nice guy - but I found both he and this movie a total waste of screen+seats in the cinemas around the world - will not ever watch it again - and Ben Affleck doesn't exactly tempt me there either..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I really did not like this film. Something supernatural like this happening is not totally un-likely, but the chances are quite slim. Most of this movie was situated tightly on the romance Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck had. The two \\"love-birds\\" turned this movie into a semi-chick flick movement, when in reality an enormous comet was supposed to wipe out the earth. Michael Bay truly disappoints with this film. His directing style is poor, as he literally believes that an edit every second is the best way to make a film. I don't think it's possible to physically count the number of cuts and explosions in his films within one human lifetime. The guy can't even make a decent movie with the insane budget he gets to work with. Honestly guys, stick to what's worth seeing, which isn't this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big, fat, horrendous, but very profitable mess.","review":"If it weren't for the big budget and A-list stars, this would be a prime candidate for \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\\" The special effects may be great, but the editing is horrible; there are long stretches of this movie where I defy you to tell exactly what is happening to whom. The characters are pure, 100-percent cardboard, and their basic character traits change at the whim of the screenwriters and the necessity of the dull, by-the-numbers plot. I would really love to have recorded the private discussions between Ben Affleck and Billy Bob Thornton (both Oscar-winning screenwriters) regarding the script for \\"Armageddon\\"; I'm certain their comments would require a very strong Parental Advisory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The space operette","review":"Another stupid movie like Independance Day where the gratuitous action seems to attract a lot of people. What can be said about this Hollywood product ? First, you see that movie like you eat a hamburger at Mac-Donald : another Bruce Willis movie, oh excuse-me i mean Big mac. Seriously, the movie is very weak, when i see it i didn't understand anything. Bruce Willis acts like he does in a lot of movie, that is to say like a true American hero who wants to save the world. The \\"plot\\" itself is a nonsense : a group of true stupid heroes want to save the world and destroy a big rock coming to earth. Don't expect to see any scientific data in the movie, there is only horrible acting, story, bad special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotsa fun!","review":"This movie was AWESOME!

That way I am surprised if it is actually good. As an audiophile DVDs offer a higher level of quality. This DVD has perhaps the worst sound I have ever heard. The tracks are unbalanced and the explosions are normalized to match the voices. When I buy a DVD like this I expect a higher standard. I didn't recieve one. -5 out of 5!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Bad!","review":"I watched this movie, and it was the worst way to spend 2 hours!!! It was so fake how they would send oil drillers instead of astronauts, required only 2 weeks of training, and how they could only find it 18 days in advance. I reccomend you don't buy this movie, because it stinks! The movie just keeps going on and on and on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"I must say that this movie had one of the worst scripts I have ever taken part of. Crash i 32.000km/h, and oups, three just happen to survive. For their father is normally called Superman! And what is it with the american directors? I am just sick and tired of every little explosion that takes place in any movie. They have totally ruined the chances of seeing an explosion on the screen with any kind of reaction from myself or anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATCH THIS MOVIE AND THE WORLD WILL END!","review":"Not because of an asteroid collision, but rather it will prove that intelligent life does not exist or is not worth existing on Earth. This film is SO LOUD! It's bad enough that the plot and characters are annoying, but it destroys all other senses as well. The director should try to make at least one film without enormous destruction. He should consult with other directors or film schools or at least try some Haldol (I hear that helps.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!!!","review":"This movie has got to be the stupidest movie I've seen since Con Air!! Bad acting, stupid plot, and cheesy love scenes. The one good thing this movie had going for it was the Aerosmith song, but then the radio started playing it over and over and over!!!!!! Now I'm sick of the song and I can barely watch the movie all the way through. Save yourself some time!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything about this movie is bad!!!!","review":"I rented this movie last weekend and boy was I disappointed. The plot is terribly unbelievable, acting is lame, and the script is juvenile. I think someone has to remind the makers of this film that they need something other than special effects to make a good movie. Also, why do we constantly have to listen to boring Aerosmith songs throughout this film????"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hideous FLOP!","review":"It's like some American action-movie producers only rely on marketing and advertising nowadays. This film was well advertised, the trailer looked ok and the casting seemed to be very good.

Rent Deep Impact it gets 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just burn the six bucks instead?","review":"Well, here is an example of the shrewd Hollywood moneymaker at its best. They threw in a little bit of everything for everyone, to ensure that you told your friends it was GREAT! Big names so you can associate their past works and feel good about going to see him/her in this new film. Bruce Willis as the lead for the dominant-minded white individual. A big fat black guy who strips down to leopard bikini underwear for the people who always laugh at people getting kicked in the nuts. Ben Affleck for the moronic pre-teen. Liv Tyler for God knows what reason. Anyway, we got the explosions for the men, check...ok love story for the women, check...tragedy, worthless humor, strip bar seen for the pervert voyeur male audience...I THINK WE GOT IT ALL, REEL EM IN AND GRAB THE CASH!

I've watched some pretty bad ones, but it's hard to distinguish one movie with a ludicrous plot, bad acting, bad editing, etc., from another. But all those bad films had two things in common: they had no talent and no budget. There is no excuse for garbage like Armageddon to ever exist. But it does, and the magnitude of it qualifies it as the worst movie ever made.Shallow, idiotically patriotic, insulting, and irritating are a few of its characterizations. That so many people like this movie frightens me.Watch \\"Deep Impact\\".

An asteroid the size of Texas threatens Earth. Oil driller Bruce Willis and his trusty team of misfits (including Steve Buscemi, Ben Affleck, and Will Patton) are sent up to land on the rock, drill a hole, drop a nuke into it, and blow it up from within. The movie is a trashy combo of \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" and \\"The Right Stuff\\" - I would say \\"cheerfully trashy,\\" but there's nothing especially cheerful about Bay's hyperactive, insecure style that treats the audience like morons, and the script makes almost no sense despite the work of many uncredited hands. Still, it was Touchstone's biggest hit to date, outearning their previous record-holder \\"Pretty Woman.\\" Aerosmith's awful ballad \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" was actually nominated for an Oscar.

No logic was used. People talk about the great sound-track in the movie, and I think it is nothing special. In fact, I can't take anyone of that darn Aerosmith song they play on the radio all the time from the movie!! I like those old James Bond movies better than this!

One thing I can say is that Alfred Hitchcock's, Orson Welle's, and Stanley Kubrick's worst movie is better than this; as is the same for most directors. Not even worth the special effects. How much special effects do you think Hitchcock used in Psycho, or Welles in Citizen Kane. They are great movies because of scripts, acting, directing, and the lack of shots and scenes that don't mean squat(alot of them in Armegeddon). THis movie relies on the conjuring up of fake emotions. It's blooody funny to watch. The only movie in recent memory that's make me cry is 'Shadow Of a Doubt' By Hitchcock( Charlie cries on the porch while watchcing her family ignorantly play with eachother) If you don't understand what I'm talking about I suggest you whtch the movie. I had to watch it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen","review":"Why can't I give it negative stars? Whew!

I actually got a headache after the 57th cliche, and we weren't even half done. Not one original line, shot, idea, characterization in the entire film. I was waiting for Willis' head to appear over the wedding scene nodding in approval. I literally felt queasy after this bomb. The sad thing? Some people actually liked it!!!

Just recently saw it and it reconfirmed my belief in how many really bad Hollywood movieshave been produced in the 'computer-generated' years (of course, with several notable exceptions). Mr. Bay many thanks for driving me to watch more foreign andindependent movies -- i have seen many, many wonderful movies and haven't looked back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very stupid movie.","review":"This movie was a total waste of my time and energy watching it, not to mention the fact that I shelled out twenty bucks for it. The only thing good about this is that Ben Affleck is in it, but even he doesn't make this video worth buying. Save your money; go buy Deep Impact, much better special effects, very interesting. This movie has no plot, nothing interesting worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money on this!","review":"I watched \\"Deep Impact\\" before seeing this movie and was very disappointed by \\"Armageddon\\". The makers of this film seemed to think all they had to do was have everyone in the cast continually shout at each other and show us lots bright flashes accompanied by loud bangs. I promise you this actually makes for a very boring and frustrating experience considering the potential for such a brilliant subject. Not only is the movie difficult to accept as pure entertainment, but anyone with a scientific interest will find many of the special effects unacceptable- For Example the Space Shuttle manouvering in space as if it were an aircraft within the Earths Atmosphere; and the Asteriod on which for part of the time gravity was very low being followed by a scene where it was apparently close to Earth Normal. Sorry, but even one star is being generous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame movie. Great special effects.","review":"This is one of the lamest movies I have seen. Lame story. Lame acting. Lame actors. Willis at his worse. Tyler should stay being famous because of her father and give up her acting career before we all see how lame she can really be. The only saving quality of this movie is the special effects and they are great. I give it 2 stars based on this fact and only this fact. If you are like me and enjoy watching movies for the sfx then you will like this. If you are deeper and need a good story, pass this one--with a wide gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bad","review":"This movie amounted to a lot of flash and bang, but it didn't signify anything. A cheesy Bruce Willis action movie that aspires to greater things is still a cheesy Bruce Willis action movie. Even the romantic aspect of the movie was poorly done. This movie was a pretty poor overall effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Movie Ever!","review":"This movie is the greatest movie i've ever seen!

Although it is better than Godzilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum for the Simple Minded","review":"Suspend belief?

Steve Buscemi was terrible especially when he snapped on that huge rock. All the scenes on that big meteor were terrible. But the end was the worst and the most \\"american\\" end in the history of films. Perfect Hollywood ending. TWO stars because I like Willis and Liv Tyler was hot as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buschemi's worst","review":"Forget that this movie had a plot a simpleton could write on the back of a matchbook, what it's real claim to fame should be is making Steve Buschemi a cliche. It will be quite a long time for me to once again think him funny after his pathtically over the top performance in which every line he uttered appeared to be with a wink. Like he was saying \\"Here you go idiots, here's another \\"Funny\\" one liner.\\" It got to the point where I was literally embarrased for him. I will have to watch Fargo 10 times to cleanse the bad taste from the left side of my brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature. A pure money maker out to capture the box office.","review":"This movie sets out to do what so many other filmmakers are doing these days: make money, and lots of it. It tries its best to add to an already stale storyline by including a short and precocious love story, but alas, it fails. The special effects are good, which is expected from a potential blockbuster.This movie successfully shoved a sad and weak Deep Impact out of the way to prove to be 1998's best apocalypse/action/fantasy/romance/comedy/wannabee-a-blockbuster-shelfstacker movie of the year. If it weren't for Steve Buscemi's hilarious performance, this video would have garnered only 1/2 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not that great.","review":"Story is too contrived, too predictable, and two dimensional.

Bad acting, worse scripting, and logic flaws you could drop an asteroid through, this movie WILL disipoint. Mr. Bay sould really go back to directing school. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time because the camera moved every two seconds. And why the hell does everything blow up in this movie? I don't know. Maybe one of the ten screenwriters does. Overall this movie is booring and pointless crap. If Amazon.com let me give it 0 stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew Chunks","review":"Quite possibly the worst movie ever!!! Horrible special effects, bad dialog, and a terrible score. Don't buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and akward","review":"This movie was sooooo bad. The plot was stupid. Sure, a large asteroid with all of its debris heading towards earth and we can't pick it up on radar or telescopes until the last moment? Come on, who are they kidding? We all know that the solar system is pretty darn stable and we would know way in advance, more like a few years. But all said and done I guess watching this movie would be better than washing the dog or painting the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!","review":"This movie just shows what's wrong with motion pictures nowadays: All special effects, and no attention whatsoever whether the story is good... Don't get me wrong, I love SFX movies, but I only love those with at least a decent storyline, like T2, or Aliens. Geez... Even the director, Michael Bay, doesn't seem to know what he's doing with this one. Watching this movie, you get the distinct feeling that the guy can't assemble what is usually known as a COHERENT SCENE. This movie blows. I'm sorry I wasted my money to buy a ticket for this piece of crapola..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable and Bad!","review":"First, the plot was pretty unconvincing. I've taken some astronomy courses, and although a meteor could hit earth, I highly doubt that people could land on the meteor, blow it up, and save the world. And if someone were going to save the planet, it would not be people outside the U.S. government who have no experience in space!Second, the love story was pathetic. The movie was so focused on special effects that it never developed the relationships bewteen its characters. The scene where Ben returns and hugged Liv made me cringe. Both were smiling, and I wondered if both the characters had already forgotten the loss of Liv's father and all the trauma they had just been through.And all those set backs out in space? After the twentieth one, you know they're going to live and just want the movie to be over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give it -5 stars","review":"Nut much to say about this mess of a movie (can this be called a movie?).

UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT.It's really only worth a rental.Now on to the detail.The audio track is AMAZING. Very great sounds. The video aged pretty well for a movie that's more than a decade old. Colors are vivid.Now if you wanted this to see Aerosmith in HD, please skip on this. It's in 480i (or P if your blu-ray rolls that way). And aside from the music video, all you get is 2 trailers. THATS IT.If you wanted something that packs a punch in special features, skip this release of Armageddon. If you want an amazing quality of an actually decent Bay film, look no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Criticism speaks more of the soul of the critic...","review":"ARMAGEDDON, critics notwithstanding, is an intense and entertaining film dealing with human character in the face of overwhelming challenge. The very idea that humanity--or at least some of it--could be able to rise above the everyday, pull together, and defy mindless destruction is the concept which must frighten the timid souls who \\"didn't get it\\" or didn't like it. As for the physics? Remember that Bradbury wrote many superb tales without an entirely firm grasp of physics. The idea of heroism and of our potential in space is the idea here, folks, and perhaps that's such a stinging rebuke to those feeble and fearful who make cuts to the space program and disparage films such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Scenes","review":"I have mixed feelings about the movie on blue-ray.On one hand I was really dissapointed that the blu-ray version of the film had cut the extra scenes from the Criterion DVD version of the movie. The scene where Willis visits his father explains the \\"God gave us children so we would have roses in winter.\\" With the storage capacity of blu-ray the only reason I can think of for them leaving out the extra footage is they want to package another blu-ray verison later and get us for another $20-$30.On the other hand the sound and picture were great, but not enough (IMHO) to warrant purchasing it in blue-ray if you already own the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of 1998 - Bar None","review":"Cheesy, uninspired disaster flick starring actors who, frankly, should know better: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Billy Bob Thornton. It should come as no shock that this film is a bust; it's brought to us by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, the boys who gave us \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" which may be the worst movie of 2001. I mean, it makes \\"Independence Day\\" look like \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Should you feel the need to watch a disater flick, please by all means avoid \\"Armageddon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't get much worse than this.","review":"I can't remember a movie that I have disliked more than this. I know it's Science Fiction, but come on. You don't have to abandon all logic when making a film from this genre. Anything in this movie resembling reality is purely coincidental. It's predictable, corny, boring, stupid and just plain silly. This movie would have you believe that oil workers can become astronauts in two weeks, NASA builds space drilling vehicles with machine guns on them, and Ben Affleck can pass as an oil worker. Need I say more? The only highlight of the film, for me, was when Bruce Willis blew himself up. If only it had been Michael Bay(director). Then I would have given it another star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arma-Geddon-Outta Here!","review":"Now, I normally like big, fun action movies. I thought I would like this one. No way. This is a very overbloated film with little to no fun at all. The movie is bogged down by unappealing characters and boring scenes that you really can't hold much interest in the film at all. Bruce Willis is fine and all, but Ben Affleck seems to just be there to look pretty. Why would he do this after coming off \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and winning an Oscar?!. The special effects are, of course, great and very impressive. That's about it. Director Michael Bay tried to go a little more serious and to get more respect with \\"Pear Harbor\\", but he screwed that one up too and it was a huge stinker. This is a bad movie that can only be described in one word: awful!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armageddon - bad!","review":"Truly one of the worst films ever made! Michael Bay has no clue how to direct a motion picture. He should stick to 3 minute music videos. Why you would want this film is beyond me. Even the effects weren't that great. I think the only movie with more cliches is his upcoming \\"Pearl Harbor\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"armageddon","review":"the pic is absolutely awesome when watched on a full fledged surround sound home teatre system...as for the movie itself, well Bruce boy was his usual macho man and all in all it was a entertaining hour and a half. I ve read a few comments from other reviewers and i think they have been unfair to critise Bruce's acting. The script calls for a type a character and I think Bruce carried it off pretty well! Regards George Menon, Goa India"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real enough","review":"I will consider this movie to be too black and white and assume that people are like sheep or cattle. The movie had people behave in predictable ways like line up perfectly on a road when the impact took place in the ocean - in real life the small number of explorer type people will take advantage and then people some more people would take advantage of the opportunities - cars will take advantage of ditches, shoulders, even the opposite lanes. There would be walkers, bicycle, pretty much anything that can move and garbage and stuff would be everywhere. Even the police or the military would have a hard time trying to keep the line neat. Then there's the corny patriotism line of farmers - actually the farms often showed in the media is a rarity - there are not much profit or motivation for younger generations to stay on the farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"These people just don't get it - It's a great movie","review":"The other reviewers just don't get it. Armageddon is a hilarious and completely epic movie if you look at it in the right light. Scientifically ridiculous? Of course it is - so what. This is an ACTION movie with an excellent cast of quality action movie actors and a variety of interesting and fun characters. It's totally classic. The visuals and soundtrack are very well crafted. The first 30 minutes is like one long music video. Turn off your brain and just enjoy it - or turn on your brain and enjoy the excellent cinematography, editing, visual effects, sound effects, sound editing, etc. I liked this movie OK when I saw it in the theatre but with repeat viewings, I like it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Independence Day - it's more believable","review":"Hey, I like a blow-\`em up blockbuster as much as the next person, but please, at least have a story to go with it.

The writing was, well, I can't call that writing. It was typing. But what really got me mad was that Bruckheimer and Co. went way out of their way to make the science absurd. It would have been more interesting if they had stuck to some basis of reality. I have never come to the end of the movie feeling more disgusted in my life and I've seen some pretty bad sci-fi! \\"Star Trek V\\" was genius compared to this!

The leads are played well by Willis & Liv Tyler, and the ever reliable Steve Buscemi and Ben Affleck provide great support as a technician and Tyler's love interest respectively. Billy Bob Thornton is also worth mentioning as he adds a touch of class to the star-studded cast.The large scale effects on the oil rigs are handled exceptionally well, possibly better than the space scenes, although these too are better than average. The story is OK, but a bit sinilar to Deep Impact and the real point of the story is the interpersonal relationships.Great fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Impact is WAYYYY Better!","review":"Armageddon is a... sci-fi thriller (with big stars), which actually came after the way better and more emotional Deep Impact. Armageddon is basically about the special effects (which are pretty good anyway), and the ending is kind of sad, but it's not as emotional as Deep Impact. The acting is OK, but the plot is stupid! Why would be get drillers and send them to an asteroid to blow it up?! I mean, take some of the most inexperienced astronauts and depend on them to save the world. OK, maybe I'm being a little too much, but if you want a better movie and a better DVD, then I'd recommend Deep Impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..................","review":"that's about all i did during this disastre.your typical americans try to save the world movie.doesn't any other country try to help save the world?i gave it 2 stars because of steve buscemi and for aerosmith's song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, brother...","review":"Amageddon stands as a towering example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days.

Maybe this wasn't the actors fault. Casting couldn't have been any worse. I had never seen such a bunch of miscasts in all my life. That young woman (whose name escapes me like the purpose of this movie does) was not credible at all as the kiss-ass, wise-talking dame she was supposed to be.

The characters and dialogue were so stupid and the whole story was pointless, and it was completely unrealistic. Besides if those people were really hurling through space after crashing they would have exploded and no one can handle that many G's.

A huge ball of Sticky Rice is hurling towards the earth and a bunch of misfit hawker food operators are forced in the task of saving earth from this impending disaster.

As everyone knows, the way to stop a ball of Sticky Rice from smashing earth to bits is to actually dress up the earth as a big trolley tray fill with all sorts of yum cha snacks. Then the ball will just scurry away in fright. But the americans do it in their typical way, blow the thing up and ask questions later.

I agree that Pearl Harbor looks a little TOO similar to Armageddon, especially the end. The girls are practically wearing the same dresses!Yes, I'm sure there are a lot of bloopers, mistakes and aspects that are totally unbelievable, if not disbelievable, but I don't care. I didn't first watch the movie to look for mistakes, or look into my NASA handbook to make sure that everything was to code.

Aswell as the number of nukes it took to blow up the asteroid. 1 nuke do destroy a rock the size of Texas!? It would take a lot more than that. In Deep Impact 4 or 5 did not do the job for a six mile long comet. Also when the two shuttles are flying so close, the egsaust would probly tear parts of the other's hull apart.

Unlike the similarly-plotted \\"Deep Impact\\", \\"Armageddon\\" is a shallow, explosives-laden snoozer, featuring too many stars speaking too much cheesey dialogue through too many painfully-scored and acted scenes. I'm not sure what I disliked more, the music video pacing or the ludicrously rubber \\"science\\" behind this piece of science fiction. Really, don't bother with this one, unless you plan to turn the sound off and enjoy the movie purely on its visual merits. In that department it is a home run. Otherwise, skip it, and go get a copy of \\"Deep Impact\\".

I enjoy action movies (even bad James Bond films) as much as the next person but I was cringing at the dialogue, the acting, the cardboard, macho posturing, the cheesy music score, the one-dimensional characters (does Liv Tyler do anything but look vague and pouty?).

I was just about to abandon my hope, as Bruce Willis' character fashions a makeshift time-machine (Back to the Future eat your heart out!) to return to a time when the Armageddon could be stopped......... my heart raced! He's going to go back to the 80s, and THEN we'll hear Def Leppard! Not so. The time machine only brought him.... well, i won't ruin it for you. I'll just say there's no Def Leppard... and that Bruce Willis' subtle nod to another famous Bruce in the climactic closing battle (let's just say it's a vicious spinning side-kick) was a brilliant and emotional tribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Special effects aside, this is an example of Hollywood at its worst.

I had no curiosity to see how this movie ended and I walked out, although I wasn't alone. This is mindless bravura at its worst. If you can buy the most ridiculous plot since Waterworld, tolerate a one-liner every 5 minutes, and put up with the childish acting and over-acting, then give this movie a try.

Well, I'm a quick-witted teenager with a 3.85 GPA, and I loved it. So did my friends, and they're not drooling morons either.

This 'movie', as some are keen to call it, still ranks as one of the best examples of how bad hollywood has gotten over the past 2 decades, and how trully imbred the American public has become, at the hands of the hacks that have permiated the movie industry.

Im sure that they couldnt whip up a team of oil drillers but what do you expect? Astronauts cant learn to drill and Oil Drillers cant learn to fly a shuttle, so they work together to have both groups on two shuttles.

He's a great action hero. He was great in the Die Hard movies, but this was better. Also, he sported enough rapid-fire wisecracks to help keep his character interesting. It makes you wonder what would happen if those events were real -- an asteroid could hit Earth at any time, and events in science fiction movies tend to become real 20-30 years down the road, so you never know. This movie is definitely worth getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, yet unrealistic","review":"Hey how would you feel if a meteor the size of Texas was heading for Earth?

It was a story about heroes. I find it odd that so many say that the characters are poorly done; I found all but one of the characters to be vivid and interesting. I did have a small complaint with the chain gun on the Armadillo (I mean, why?), but otherwise, I think that for science fiction this movie is well done. There is no doubt that the special effects are a masterpiece, and though the plot is simple, the character development makes the whole movie. If you like stories about heroes, check this one out. If you're looking for a deep and meaningful tearjerking drama, check out Deep Impact. For what it is, an action sci-fi flick, Armageddon did left me very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one awful film","review":"I do not understand why so many people love this film. I know of no other movie in which absolutely no one acts or speaks like actual human beings. If you are forced to suffer through it, notice how everyone speaks in sound bites followed by an edit. I also really wonder how it took Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler so long to get to Washington in order to be briefed on the asteroid, but in the same amount of time, all of the riggers were able to travel the globe. I could go on and on about the implausibility of the film's \\"plot,\\" but why bother.

The film tells the story of an oil drilling crew, led by Bruce Willis, which is recruited to blast off into space in order to help stop a killer asteroid from destroying the earth.The story is both stupid and unbelievable. The script is full of cheesy, embarrassingly unfunny attempts at humor. The obligatory romance between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler is a waste. The action sequences are far too loud and chaotic; they seem like something conceived by hyperactive 4-year olds. And ultimately, the film goes for cheap, manipulative sentimentality, rather than believable emotion.\\"Armageddon\\" is not a total waste. The hard-to-swallow story at least held my attention.

Second they pull to never before seen redesigned space shuttles, and are able to put special rovers that were going to Mars. Three, able to launch dock with a space station refuel and land on the object in space.The fact is if the government saw this coming with less thanthree week before it hit, the only thing they would be thinkingabout is tiring to save as many people in the US as possible.Great story if you have a gullible imagination, other wise it is a insult to anybody that thinks.

(Nor does it cite any documents that critisize him.) It accuses another pope of \\"extensive\\" nepotism, without mentioning which members of his family he gave jobs to or even how many people the author means by \\"extensive\\" and again no references are given.

For those who would like their papal history without the rose-colored glasses, I would recommend McBrien's, \\"Lives of the Popes\\", De Rosa's, \\"Vicars of Christ\\", and J.N.D.

I couldn't read the little booklet that comes with the CD before purchasing, but it states \\"Mozart's keyboard sonatas, now staples of the recital repertory, were not origainally intended for the concert platform. Unlike his piano concertos, whose grand formal designs and viruosic style show clearly that they were destined for public performance, the sonatas reflect a more personal context.\\" These sonatas are some of Mozarts earliest surviving work of this kind. Perhaps a true student of the piano would enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"too simple and too expensive","review":"The idea presented is ok, but too simple, it does not have any references, and book itself is too expensive, not worth the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding review of Hodgkin's work","review":"This book is different from most catalogues raisonnees that I've seen, which often provide small, black and white reproductions.

But even if Professional Widow were your absolute favorite Tori song, I wouldn't recommend buying this single. I like remixes and reworkings and all that but I still think this is pretty awful stuff. Another reviewer said they \\"zoned out after the fiftieth repetition of 'It's gotta be big...'\\" and that's pretty accurate. If you have Tales from a Librarian I'm fairly certain that the remix on there is from this CD. If it's not the same exact one, it's close enough to not matter. Forty minutes of that is more than even the biggest Tori lover can handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just...blah","review":"I don't usually take the time to write a review for something I don't like, but I think I should add to the list of them on here so far. It is true...this single is boring and repetitive. A song that could have been made so interesting as a remix turned out as bad as these remixes are. It's basically listening to the line in the song \\"It's gotta be big\\" a million times backed with a house beat. I don't know about you, but that's annoying to me. It's a wonder to me this single was so big in the UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good representative of Tori's capabilities with techno","review":"Although these remixes lack bite, which is my main criticism of them, her efforts at techno such as Blue Skies with BT, Talula, also with BT, and her techno-y songs on From the Choirgirl Hotel are really good. If I hadn't heard any of that stuff, I would probably have given this CD a much higher rating. My standards for Tori are very high, and her not fulfilling them on this CD is an exception to the rule, the rule being that TORI IS AMAZING, and so it follows that she is usually amazing with her techno stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multidimensional Tori Amos struts and vamps as dance diva.","review":"Tori Amos tests the danceclub waters with the help from megastar producer/remixer Armand Van Helden. The result is an anthem that should be a main-stay in danceclubs for years. The revamped tune is a creative departure from the original song, and is both fierce and provocative. For Tori Amos, \\"it's gotta be big!\\"...and this is be a BIG club hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired, devastatingly dull club \\"music\\"","review":"Tori Amos is a good singer, not that you'd know it from these remixes, which really take about one line from the song (\\"It's got to be big\\") and repeat it over and over. It's not that the original \\"Widow\\" was bad, but this makes you wonder why Tori would approve of these mixes enough to allow them to go commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the usual Tori","review":"I am an avid Tori fan. I have been collecting her work for years and as of now have 20 of her CDs, many of them imports and singles. Tori's style lies in her great voice and her piano skills, and this single doesn't focus on either one of those things. She's not a dance club mix artist and I was disappointed that this album came across as such. Thankfully, the work she released after this single has been more of the Tori I love, with her voice and her piano/harpsicord capturing the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull. Very, very dull.","review":"When I first heard the song \\"Professional Widow\\", I was blown away. Yes, it was great. But then I decided, hey, what can a few remixes do to such a great song?A lot. And none of it good.The dance mixes do nothing but repeat. if you like unbelieveably tacky dance beats banging from all sides as you just barely make out Tori's occasional voice, be my guest. The album version is the only good song on the album, and I really did TRY to like these remixes.Great CD cover, though. A pity about the remixes. Try \\"In the springtime of his voodoo\\" instead. You'll find little substance in the \\"Jackie's strength\\" remixes, but they're also better then these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Song, Bad Remixes","review":"Professional Widow is one of my favorites from her 1996 album Boys For Pele, but these remixes dont do justice to the original. Repetitive meaningless remixes that seem to go nowhere. In my opinion, this is just a song that isnt meant to be remixed. The one good track though is the LP Edit.

Tried burping the unit by powering off, still lots of airpocket was unable to be eliminated. Also, the unit was prone to leaking. It didn't leak a lot but the bottom of the unit was always wet. Any movement would cause it to leak more. Some of it was coming from the intake barb and a tiny drip bubble formed around the rubber impeller drip O-ring seal. I tried calling Eheim but no support numbers on user manual. Googled Eheim but only found it when I browsed forum. I then called number and was told they would have to call me back but never did.

She seems to have more comaraderie with the Wiccans and the liberal feminists than the Christians. Sure, when Jesus is referred to as a \\"door\\" that is a metaphor; God as a \\"hen\\" with feathers is a metaphor. But the author crosses the line when she claims that the gender of the holiness of the Father/God of the Jews and Gentiles is a metaphor. I have no use for this book. Satan can take on both masculine and feminine--as the \\"unknown god\\".

The vertical sections and horizontal sections can hold up to 1.5 inch binders. The metal organizer is very heavy and sturdy. It is quite large, but since it holds everything, it doesn't bother me and keeps my desk clean.

The Whitmor shelf fits *perfectly* over the Safco organizer. Between these two products, I have organized my workspace tremendously.As far as the Safco itself, I find the build quality to be above average, definitely exceeding expectations.

Most of the tempos are too slow, which makes the songs drag, and there's some seriously odd choices made in casting people who can't sing very well (I'm looking at you, Narrator).The British accents are fine, (aside from Rapunzel's prince, who seems to be Italian) I don't think they really make the show work \\"better\\", though. The cast seems to be taking it all much too seriously- there are dark moments, yes, but it is a comedy.Certainly it's instructive to listen to it back-to-back with the OBC, if only to see how different 2 recordings of the same show can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison to Broadway cast cd","review":"The voices are so much better on the OBC.

The British Accents just dont work for these characters, and how heavy they are throughout the songs is distracting at the least. Definately buy the Original Broadway Cast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um...no","review":"Please! This is one of the worst theatrical investments of my life.

I enjoyed the pacing of the songs more than the original broadway recording, but the broadway recording has stronger vocal performances all the way around.

Although this single has the edited version of it, it is an amazing song that always pleases. The three B-Side songs are incredible as well. \\"Sister Janet\\" is hauntingly beautiful - I've learned to play it on the piano myself and it has an extremely wonderful harmony to it. \\"Daisy Dead Petals\\" is beautiful in a quirky sort of way. But \\"Honey\\" takes the cake. This is one of my favorite Tori pieces to play on the piano, because it's composition at its best - it's gorgeous. Her vocals soar throughout the piece. Not to mention the lyrics, \\"and cowboys know, cowgirls ride, on the Indians' side.\\" Tori never fails to amaze me with the beauty and depth of her musical abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cornflake Girl\\" a worth-it single","review":"Of course \\"Cornflake Girl\\" is a great song, but the reason I like this single so much is because of the other songs. \\"Sister Janet\\" is sweet and soft. \\"Daisy Dead Petals\\" has that one awesome bridge, \\"Got a crack in, got a crack in some strange places...\\" and \\"Honey\\" is just a great song that could have easily gone on an album. I recommend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure","review":"Tori Amos wows again with this stunning 4-track collection. There's the superb \\"Cornflake Girl\\" (albeit an edited version; no harm done really), as well as \\"Honey\\" (amazing!), \\"Sister Janet\\" (beyond sweetness!), and \\"Daisy Dead Petals\\" (really a lovely song).It is a shame (in theory) the three b-sides were left off the album, but there's something to admire about Tori's attention-grabbing knack of placing highly inventive (and otherwise unattainable) songs to guarantee purchase. You'll never regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design. BUT NO FREAKING HEAT","review":"I just bought this at CVS for $42.00. It has been on my back for an hour at the highest setting. If I rub my hands together for 1 minute they would be hotter than this heating pad or should I write cooling pad. Lucky for Me I just found my heating pad that I had bought at CVS 6 years ago. I just plugged that in on the highest setting. In only 5 minutes the heat was cranking. I will be returning this new heating pad back to CVS tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very handy, till it quits working.","review":"I got this as a gift, then returned it to Amazon a few months later after it broke.

It worked great at first and then started up with the \\"F1\\" & \\"F2\\" fault codes. Bought another one about 3 weeks ago and it worked for perhaps 15 total hours before it shut down with an \\"F2\\" code. Could not find the receipt to return it so I went back to Sunbeam. The Sunbeam local service center never picked-up their extension after I navigated through the menu. Their national number from on line was polite and helpful and are sending a replacement mod 902-505 to replace the mod 902-5 I recently got. Amazon lists both those model numbers on this product page??? Don't know what that is all about. Good luck to anyone buying this.Great if it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunbeam builds perfect...lemons","review":"This heating pad is a total failure. Don't waste your time or money with it. It may actually work for a couple of times and then it will show the all too familiar F1 or F2 on the screenpad. Too bad the people at Sunbeam forgot to write in the manual what that means...or why it ceases to work when this happen. They must never use their products since this thing won't work. They should probably start selling this as a nice puzzle. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work from the get go","review":"I took a chance on this expensive heating pad and lost.

It would not reset itself until I unplugged it for a few minutes. In July, I called the warranty department and was shipped a new one. This one worked for about a month before the pad started shutting itself off and showing a code of F2. At this point, I have asked for a different model as a replacement. Sunbeam has been very cooperative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty loves it","review":"This was my heating pad, but my hairless cat took it over. He has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one. The first day I couldn't pry him off.I love that it's washable. In fact, I'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash. Of course, I keep it pretty low for him. Being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that's not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"Returned right after I tried it... does not get hot AT ALL.Very disappointed since it is so expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best heating pad ever","review":"This is a great heating pad. It's lightweight, flexible, easy to strap to the area of the body that needs heat treatment, has nice long cord to make moving it around easier, versatile heat and timer settings, and is cleanable if necessary. I would recommend it to anyone needing a heating pad for muscle injuries, fibromyalgia, in fact just a good all around heating pad for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and lacks quality","review":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could, but that wasn't an option! You figure you would get your money's worth, right? Wrong! Mine is also stuck at the F2 error code and despite the fact that I have attempted to disconnect/reconnect the plug, and tried several different outlets, no luck. I have chronic back pain and rely on this pad to function without pain. This is just unacceptable and should be recalled with all of these complaints. Problem now is I threw away the box and receipt, so can't take it back and not sure Sunbeam would honor a warranty without proof of purchase. Sunbeam, you suck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective? Or just craptastic?","review":"I thought this would be a great pad. Good shape, straps to hold it in place, nice long cord. First time I plugged it in and turned it on, the display switched to \\"F1\\" and the pad did not heat up. Nothing about an \\"F1\\" anywhere in the manual that came with it nor does Sunbeam's website have any useful information. Back to the store with this lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is Defective","review":"This is the second one we bought - stupid us. The first one has a little screen on the controller. After a few uses it shows F1 on the screen. Sometimes it works for 2 minutes, sometimes for half an hour. I contacted Sunbeam, and they told me to plug it into a different outlet. Tried this, same result. Bought second one because it has different controller. Worked 10 minutes on low, then just showed blinking red light at high setting. Replugging does not help. These really are pieces of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Design looks good, but heat is inconsistent. After a dozen uses the digital readout showed the F2 code (mentioned by many other reviewers), & continues to be stuck in that mode-- with no heat. It's goin' back to the store!

Good thing you're checking out these reviews... choose carefully-- and stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same F2 readout as other reviewers","review":"Other reviewers have mentioned a problem with an F2 readout on the digital screen of the remote. I had exactly the same issue. However, unlike most people who were able to gain some relief and a little use out of this product. Mine NEVER worked. Not once. This is a MAJOR issue and the company needs to recall this item. Also, there are stores that are having this item returned by customers and they are putting the product RIGHT back on the shelf. This needs to stop. This is a very expensive product and there are certain expectations when buying it. How complicated could heating pad technology possible be? This is pure laziness from Sunbeam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot on lowest setting !!!","review":"I purchased this at CVS before I read the reviews- dumb move on my part. It works right now (one week old)BUT I already have a problem. In trying to treat my torn rotator cuff, I find that the LOWEST setting is so hot that I can't stand to have it on me for more than 2-3 minutes. This requires that I constantly turn it on / off to manage the heat. I have read MANY reviews that complain about not having enough heat making this pad virtually useless but I am finding the opposite problem.Bottomline, I have other SUNBEAM products (different heating pad and an electric blanket) and I am not satisfied with ANY OF THEM. If it is SUNBEAM anything, forget about it. Just keep going straight past SUNBEAM to the their competitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was happy with this item for 2 months and then it just stopped working.

It never stayed on 8 hours, maybe 30-60 minutes. When I awake in pain, I have to turn it on again. Biggiest problem is the recurrent F2 error code. First time I unplugged the unit and let it reset. Now it happened again and nothing will fix the problem. The unit is dead. Also, one of the prongs that attaches the electric cord to the unit has snapped off. Besides all of that, the electric cord connector is right next to the heating pad, very bulky and hard, and always digs into some body part. I would NEVER purchase this unit again and will probably avoid Sunbeam altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"PO crap!","review":"I bought this thing at 8 am when the store opened, my backs killing me, and i get it home, plug it in and the error code f1 appears, wtf is that? no where in the manual does it say what that is or why it appears and not even on sunbeams website. What a waste of $40!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice feel, good control, does everything well but provide heat.","review":"It has a good solid well-built feel, and with eight heat settings and controllable auto-off times, what more could you want?

It has a digital switch which allows you to set it to several heat levels as well control the length of time it's on before it shuts off. The unique shape allows you to wrap it around your shoulder, torso or a limb and it stays in place with the velcro straps. No more fighting with a square pad to try to hold it in place. Best of all, the wires inside this pad don't kink up like they do on other pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I bought it and took it right back. If it only had more Heat.

For less than a month.","review":"Now, it's stuck on F2. I tried everything. Nothing! I tried pushing the plug (heating pad) and the cord tightly together. One of the gray prongs broke! I have had this less than a month and now it's in my closet. I have no idea what I am going to do without a heating pad. I have chronic back problems. I pretty much have to have a heating pad all the times. Or I will be in major pain. So far the cheaper ones worked better, even though they fell apart over time. I figured with this one one it would pay for itself in a couple of years or so. ( I go through the cheap ones every couple of years) So, I was willing to fork out $40 for this. I loved it while it worked. Hopefully Sunbeam will correct this problem. Would I recommend this to anyone? No. It's not worth the headache and the waste of money.

Donna Anders writes like she is a child. She has the child in the book speaking like an adult and the adults all speak as though it is a b movie and they have nothing to work with.

Just the cover of this book tells you it's for women who see pursuit as a control game, and the prize is a diamond ring! My opinion is that being a \\"Rules Girl\\" is a primer on becoming a \\"Trophy Wife\\". There are indeed men out there who want \\"A Woman Like No Other\\", so if that's the kind of guy you want, read this book and more power to ya that his image of you doesn't tarnish.I'd recommend reading this book so you can form your own opinion, but if you're just looking for laughs, an even more concise, funnier book on having the upperhand in a relationship is by Karen Salmansohn: How to Make Your Man Behave in 21 Days or Less Using the Secrets of Professional Dog Trainers"},{"rating":"1","title":"great book for MEN","review":"I picked up this book so I'd have something to read while my car was being detailed.

And what man would want a woman who resorts to these kind of headgames? After reading the book, I realized I would die if anyone ever noticed it on my shelves.

If you're interested in someone, the natural thing to do is to let him know. If a man loves you, he will love you for your great points and forgive your not-so-great points.

I felt manipulative, childish and dishonest. Worst of all, I felt fake. I quickly realized that pretending to be someone I'm not was not the way for me. I wasn't satisfied with a man loving me for an image I created for him. I wanted him to love me for me.So, I read a better book and it's called \\"Women who love too much\\" and it changed my life.\\"The Rules\\" is a saucy book to take with a grain of salt.

I read the first 3 chapters with an open mind and was astonished that there are women who do this and even worse.. do it intentionally. Basically, the rules are: Treat the man you want the way you would treat a man you don't want and he'll be all yours. While I don't doubt that this tactic would work (because in my experience the one's I don't want never go away) why would I want to marry someone that I have to disregard and play games with just to keep his attention? If that is the case, I'd just assume stay single. So for those of you who want a real companion that you are connected to, don't buy this book. But, if you are looking to land a man to take care of you and put a big rock on your finger, this book would be great.

Degrading to women, as if we are unable to think, feel, speak, or support ourselves, but we are slaves to the male ego, never revealing anything about ourselves. This book creates manipulating wallflowers, destroys the positive self esteem of women and enforces weakness. Young girls could be ruined for life by this book. I am not a feminist, and loved to be treated by a lady, but I will not play such foolish mind games, no one should. Respect is what all women should demand.If you want to read a positive, intriguing book that captures the TRUE essence of what and how women should find a mate, read The REAL Rules by Barbara De Angelis.

Because I got to see Scotland, Poland, Germany, London, and Amsterdam, not to mention parts of Canada (and of course my own hometown of Seattle). If I had obeyed that stupid rule, I would not be able to say I've been around the world!Because I disobeyed that rule, I have met so many nice people who I am still in touch with, I have taken amazing photographs, and I have grown up tremendously.So girls, Make that visit and get some culture in your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rules will get you divorced.

Anytime you play hard to get, and are still pursued, upon \\"cashing in\\" you'll get the same prize- a VERY insecure person. The person pursuing you is not interested necessarily in YOU, they are interested in trying to crack this \\"mystery\\" who is hurting their fragile egos. It's just a game which preys on insecurities. The authors even admit that rules girls aren't smarter (for sure!) or prettier than the average. So that person pursuing isn't ending up with much of a prize in the end either. They've only got a person on their hands that happens to have read a lame, wanna-be \\"wife\\" book.

Men like to be thought of as aggressors and want a challenge, its the male ego which I think is only right. Feminism has its place but I'm not interested in being able to do everything that he can do or being thought of in that way. Phoning a man constantly after one date would suggest insecurity, and disclosing the details of a not so hot relationship with the last guy could have this one treat you exactly as the last one did.

Those guys just end up making women feel bad (ever wait by the phone? wait at the door when he is late, again!? get ready just to be stood up?)

But I later gave up on her because she was always too busy.This book tells women to not return phone calls and to always claim to be busy and play hard to get.

Not everyone waits for the phone to ring. Not everyone should follow these rules.The truth is, if every woman followed these rules, no one would ever date again. My advice: Just Be Yourself. You can't act like a 'Rules' woman forever. Sooner or later, your mate will see you without makeup, so let him know who you really are. In the meantime, BURN this book if you happen to own a copy.

In order to capture a husband, women resorted to such cunning and manipulative behaviors as proposed in \\"The Rules\\" which is not only dishonest but a severe disservice to men who would then be as shallow, wooden puppets led around by the nose by women who can't be who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibberish","review":"Another piece of garbage doing a good job of brainwashing women, with \\"sound\\" advice.

Calculation and head game don't work the same for me.I recommend to bypass this 0-star book in spite of its colorful reviews. Instead, learn more about communication skills and patterns of human behavior. Get an education and a life FIRST before jumping into bed with any men. Modern women deserve men of their own choice.

Advice such as \\"don't talk too much,\\" I thought this CANNOT be serious. The manipulations that this book advices is seriously dangerous for any and all womens self-esteem and self respect if taken seriously.

This is a rancid mix of understatement and revealing untruth. The \\"unselfishness\\" of The Rules translates into the total erasal of individuality and obliteration of the self in order to achieve an arbitrary goal through a misguided, manipulative, and cultish method. That same \\"unselfishness\\" also represents the insane fixation upon a goal exterior to oneself, where a woman takes that goal and shoves an unsuspecting man into it, thus using a human being as a means to an ultimately selfish end. The Rules is a great book for wiping out all that matters in human interaction.Fein and Schneider take a few basic psychological principles, misinterpret them, and derive from them a system of self-repression and a totally untenable attitude toward life and love, damaging to everyone but to no one more than the \\"Rules girl\\" herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Mr. Fein and Mr. Schneider come out of hiding?","review":"I find the excessive focus on marriage to be simple-minded and naive, if not downright deluded.

Good enough.Yet, at times the advice is counterproductive and even dangerous. For instance, men are at times supposed to go to extremes just to get a first date (not to talk about the following ones). One can get some fun out of the Dating Masquerade and subsequent role-playing of Good-Noble-Patient Provider and Swept Away, but can you build a true and lasting marriage on that? What if in the course of the Dating Masquerade, or even after the Altar Convention, either Swept Away finds a Better Provider or Good-Noble-Patient Provider finds a More Easily Sweepable?

But the question you have to ask yourself is: is there such a thing as a partner who will have your best interests at heart, and do you have theirs in your heart? Can that kind of relationship exist? Or do you have a more pessimistic view of the world where you think you need this book to help you manipulate others and use it to protect against mens manipulation?

She has to rely on subterfuge. If a woman doesn't have a lot going for her, then I suppose The Rules can only improve her chances! But for most women that do have something to offer as a potential girlfriend and/or wife, using The Rules could make guys (who, btw, are privvy to this stuff by now) wonder if the woman they're interested in is really \\"all that\\" if she has to rely on The Rules instead of on her own fine qualities!

If only females would follow it. The old fashioned premise upon which the book is based is that there is no sense wasting time on men who are after your body but otherwise don't really care much for you. Get rid of them! Yes,it takes quite a bit of mental discipline to sacrifice sex for self respect. But it is well worth it. I recommend this book for young teenage girls. Get it in their hands before they are even dating in cars.There is a quick checklist of the rules at the end of the book. I gave my mature 12 year old granddaughter a quick primer when she was starting up a relationship with her first boyfriend. She followed the rules and got results!

Sorry, but I solve enough puzzles at work as a software developer. Dating is already enough of a puzzle, thank you. It doesn't need to be harder. Not all the advice is bad, but the overall idea is. If you don't act interested, most men (including myself) will assume you're not interested and move on.

In reality, quality men aren't like that. Successful men and women are too busy and occupied to deal with the immaturity in these rules. Playing hard to get is an art of seduction.

Clearly, there are women in the world who needed to have it literally spelled out that acting like a twelve-year-old will not usually result in a successful relationship with an adult male.I guess for those women, this book is good.

Put it this way, if the man who wants to date you is confident, competent, loving, romantic, other women would like him, too. He might not get to the 4th phonecall before moving on towards someone who does show interest and return calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"This book is great for women who believe that the men in cheesy romance novels actually exist. In the real world, people (not just men) don't appreciate being manipulated in the way that this book suggests that we should. I feel that this book is very out-of-touch for today's young women, when men ARE NOT playing by the rules the authors say they are. Furthermore, it perpetuates the old stereotype of women being pretty (p. 16, \\"Diet and exercise and The Rules have a lot in common. P. 17, \\"Men like women who wear fashionable, sexy clothes in bright colors. Why not please them?\\") and quiet (Don't talk to men first, don't return his calls, and my personal favorite quote on page 61, \\"Smile a lot, and don't feel obligated to fill up the lulls in the conversation.\\"). If you're a feminist, like I am, or just a woman with a firm grip on REALITY, for the love of God, don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it and weep","review":"Just one question: What kind of man could you possibly \\"catch\\" by behaving in such a phony and manipulative way? The authors seem to forget that after you reel in this big fish you have to actually live with the guy.

We must be a desperate gender to push this drivel to the top of the charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"You mean it's not a joke?","review":"If I didn't already know how serious the authors of this book really were, I'd swear it had been written for laughs. It works much better if you read it as a satire on the ways people decieve and control each other to wring the most they possibly can out of their relationships. As a real-life guide to meeting and marrying somebody you'll be happy with and share an honest, loving relationship with, it blows. In fact, it's hard to say who will be worse off, the man or the woman, after this kind of courtship."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rules","review":"I don't care what this book says.

While the authors correctly grasp some elements of a guy's nature (his need to feel he is \\"providing\\" even if it only means picking up the dinner bill, or that men fall in and out of love more quickly than women), they go too far in advising girls to be incommunicative (don't call back, etc.) and coy.

Finding someone who's your best friend, who you can learn from and he learns from you--that's a good start. All relationships take work and each one we learn something new about ourselves of what works and what does not.

This is a romantic and very sexy novel with a wonderful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"As I have expressed already to you Alvin, Your words captivated me. the day the book came is the day I finished it. It was emotional and real, sensual in all the right places. The art, the expression of words and character. It had my stomach excited to know what each new page would bring.

It's a definite keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainy Day Reading","review":"\\"Brushstrokes\\" is truly a romantic, adventurous blend of erotic passion told by a man's journey from heartbreak and diappointment to finally having the one love he longed for. As I was reading \\"Brustrokes\\", I found Tylowe's motorcycle was the instrument that takes you from his pass to his present and ultimately his future.In comparison to other novels I read, \\"Brushstrokes\\" reminded me of the novel \\"Men Cry in the Dark\\" by Michael Baisden one of the characters Derrick was on a journey just like Tylowe in finding that someone to make his life complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion","review":"The way the writer uses everyday language to describes things was a plus for me. I like reading books where the people talk like real people. The movement regarding the story lines was good as well, especially the last few chapters.

A very slick presentation and fast-paced writing style presents you with most of the material you need in one works cited entry, saving you from having to look at or cite encyclopedias for the same basic history lesson. Did you know the bible was used to justify slavery? Or the Inquisition? You did? Most of the historical information in the book will be common knowledge to anyone who has studied religions or history in any depth. The book explores each area not *much* more deeply than your average encyclopedia entry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick and Dirty","review":"This book is a quick, shallow look at how the Bible has been used (actually misused) across the centuries. Ought to be required reading for every fundamentalist. Regrettably, it does not introduce ideas for how academics have studied and understood the Bible. In that sense the book doesn't really provide a completely accurate picture. A good, quick reminder of how positive things get twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible logic..","review":"This book is chalked full of horrible logic. He intends to discredit the entire Judeo-Christian scriptures because of those in the past who have abused them out of context to justify whatever they desire to justify. Any document can be taken out its own sitz im leben (social context) and used improperly to justify one's own ills. He further tries to show contradictions by taking specific passages outside of their context... any by choosing translations that seem to fit his end. A basic understanding of the original languages is enough to refute the majority of his arguments.

A great indie that shows the darker side of L.A. life in the Valley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie","review":"I saw this movie at the Valley Film Festival in November, and Few Options is an outstanding movie! The acting is fantastic, as Kenny Johnson is one of the best actors you will see anywhere. His performance takes an outstanding script and lifts it to an even higher level. Kenny delivers a riveting performance as Frank Connor, and the supporting cast is outstanding as well, with believable characters who quickly draw you into the movie. In short this movie is everything you want from a film: compelling and gripping story; deep characters, excellent production, and an outstanding musical score. It's a shame Few Options will not be released in theaters because this is one of the best movies you will see all year.

Particularly when the title character finally works her way into the plot(virtually comes dragging in from out of nowhere, seemingly from the swamp in all black with bugs all over her,etc) and the way she went out(buck naked, pregnant, broad daylight, with a bunch of classical Pentecostal sisters praying her back to from whence she came...eerie). Like the Color Purple and even Roots, there was some history in the mix, however, the mysticism threw me off a little. A comparison/contrast of Beloved & Color Purple would look alot like the comparison/contrast of The Last Temptation of Christ and the Passion of the Christ.

Morrison's novel is deep and moving, qualities for which the movie attempts to emulate. The story is slow, but it is told well. Also, Oprah delivers an outstanding performance. However, the story stuggles to project the imagery which is depicted eloquently throughout the novel. I felt like I was watching a Stephen King made-for-tv adaptation instead. The movie is still very compelling and possibly even enthralling, but there is little to praise regarding its adaptation from paper. It does not do Morrison justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"More insight on Beloved and less confusion of it all.","review":"The director ( Johnathon Demme)should of gave more history on Beloved...Her whereabouts before coming back from the dead. Also if she was returning as an young adult, she should'nt talked and acted as an three year-old.The director should've also made her and her daughters past more clearer. The movie had so much going at once, you couldn't tell the past from the present. Other than that Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover played their parts really well. Johnathon Demme should've took notes from the director who made \\"Roots''(Alexander Hayley) and Beloved probably would've been better.

But no one should be subjected to this unless they find enjoyment in seeing people being tortured. Why Oprah would choose a director whose claim to fame is \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" to direct this flick is a mystery to me. He misses the mark by a mile, fails to make the narrative happen in this movie. And don't get me started on drooling, retarded-acting Thandie Newtown, she was downright embarrassing to watch. She sounded like Darth Vader when she said her opening line. Kimberly Elise is the only one who knows and becomes her character. Note to Oprah, if you want to make a film on a Toni Morrison book next time try \\"Tar Baby\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment","review":"I bought this DVD based on a handful of good reviews and the 2 great actors playing in it.

I had read the book, so the film was not confusing. The setting was lovely and at times the acting was brilliant, but as a whole, it was a complete failure. I suggest making the effort to read the book rather than waste three hours on a film that is at best mediocre. Those who are too lazy to discover Morrison's poetic language and beautiful characters between the covers of a book might find this film satisfactory, however, for those who have experienced Morrison's incredible voice, it only taints her novel's brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a try","review":"Yes, it is confusing. Yes, it is quite long. But if you pay attention, you will be challenged, moved, and captivated by this haunting film. The acting is superb and so is the music. The story encompasses not just the physical, but the psychological horrors and impact of slavery; the currents of love that run between mothers and children (especially daughters); and what it might be like to live through some absolutely horrible and terrriftying experiences. It was thought-provoking and wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazy people wouldn't like this story","review":"I've read many of the reviews, and it seems that those who didn't like the movie or the book are those viewers and/or readers who are simply too lazy too delve deep into a book or a plot line to get something out of it. Sadly, Americans are becoming a culture of \\"give it to me straight\\" folks who want the plot line presented to them on a silver platter, right out in the open so they don't have to think. these same folks probably never picked up a novel over 500 pages and attempted to get through it. SAD! Do I sound snobby? No, I'm only 21 and yes, at first read I thought Beloved was confusing.. but then I read it again. And thought about it. What a concept, eh? If you are a lazy viewer, who doesn't like to have to think about something disturbing, then go back to your Disney video collection. If you have the guts to delve into Beloved, then this movie is for you. The message in this story is too important not to give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone please tell me what this movie was about?","review":"Because even after watching it I dont have a clue.

The terrible secrets which lie within the story are slowley revealed as we learn the disturbing past of this former slave womens life and her incredible struggle for her very survival and freedom. Beloved is an intense supernatural drama which gives us a small taste of the horrors of slavery as well as the physical and psychological terrors that went with it. Beloved is a work of art.The photography, screen play, music, and performances are first rate. I have not seen the DVD version of the film yet, so I cannot speak to the quality of the DVD transfer.

It's not Oprah's fault that The Beloved flopped in the theaters. Even as I write (2004), men are still busy masturbating to porn featuring \\"exploited black hos,\\" \\"border bangers\\" or \\"raped asians.\\" I wonder who is making and consuming the porn?

Every scene in the movie actually happened in the book and every event in the book was document in this story. Beloved is a story by Pulitzer Prize winner, Toni Morrison. If follows Sethe, a former slave that had to run away from her past. Sethe and her daughter Denver live in a house that is haunted by a ghost. The ghost of Sethe dead baby. Things turn around for Sethe when a mysterious girl appears from the swamp and her name is Beloved. Beloved seems to know an little too much about Sethe, and only time will let how and why. I would recommend this movie if you are into the supernatural and stories that really make you think about the deeper meaning behind a story. The only flaw that I have with it is that is is 2 hours and 50 min long. It sort of drags on at the end, but nevertheless, its still a great movie. It even starts Oprah Winfrey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Movie","review":"This is a movie that u need in ur collection that involves passion of love though diffcult times and trying to make the best out of everything that is given to you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beloved","review":"Sethe is a woman of elemental grace and unspoken mystery. A figure of fierce determination, Sethe is a runaway slave struggling to carve out her own simple existence with her children in rural Ohio, 1873. Preventing her from achieving that, however, is the painful legacy of her former life, and the desperate measures to which she is driven to keep herself and her family from returning to it. Paul D is an old friend who comes to visit Sethe and whose understanding is tested by her household's shattering secrets. Brilliantly acted and directed with powerful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable, Unforgetable, Uncompromising, Indellible","review":"There is no category in which to place this powerful and captivating Epic. There is no similar film or story. This is the only one of its kind. Those of us who have experienced it's emotional chokehold have come away gasping. Beloved is a parable. On one level it tells a direct compelling and unusual story. But the beneath the the surface lies the true essence and the nervous system of the film. It's there for all, but some will refuse to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah lays an egg","review":"The acting in this was incredible, and there were a lot of great scenes, but the movie is just horrendous to have to sit through, rarely makes any sense, and ultimately is completely unsatisfying. Toward the end, it became comedic for me (perhaps I had been sitting in the theatre too long), I found myself rooting AGAINST Oprah's character, and I thought the Beah Richards cameo was over-hyped.

I thought it would sound like the great \\"Crucify\\" and \\"Hey Jupiter\\" remixes from previous singles. Well, I was wrong. The final track, \\"Talula (BT's Synethasia Mix)\\" is abhorrent. Clocked at a vile 11:27, it utterly destroys Tori's talent with dance beats and pure trash. It is a disgrace to humanity. Aside from that remix, the rest of the single is wonderful. \\"Talula\\" is considered one of Tori's best songs, and the b-sides are great. \\"Samurai\\" has a beat that will get your foot tapping and Tori's sugary vocals and piano will relax you. \\"Frog On My Toe\\" is slower and you can hear much of Tori's classical influence in the song as she serenades us with typical Tori lyrics. Her cover of \\"London Girls\\" is outstanding. I would've given this single the top rating, but that misanthropic remix kept me from it. I give this single 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"More little Tori gems","review":"My copy of \\"Boys For Pele\\" has the original version of \\"Talula\\", but \\"the tornado mix\\" crushes it like a grape! I'm not one for most of the dance mixes, but the B-sides on this one are worth buying, particularly \\"Samurai\\" and the essential \\"Frog on My Toe\\". \\"Samurai\\" has a jazzy, improv feel to it due to the hazy spontaneity of the lyrics and the bass accompaniment, while \\"Frog on My Toe\\" is a sweet ode to grandparents and the South. \\"London Girls\\" - a cover - is perhaps a caliber below the other B-sides, but sung with seduction and fun, and the sound of a whizzing subway or metro in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it ...","review":"There's a reason, I think, why tracks are \\"previously unreleased\\"--they weren't worth releasing in the first place!

But now, after having it 2 1/2 years, it turned itself off and the red LED flashes in bursts of 7 times. I found out that is a malfunctioning D board and is a common problem. Scheduling the service with Sony has not been fun and they say the product is on backorder and don't know when it will be in. I've found it on a website and am going to order it and hope I can get technician out. But seriously, when you spend $2300 on a TV you should not have problems with it this soon.

But they said it's caused by dust on my optical block so they cannot replace it under warranty because its not scribble lines or roadmapping and it would run 1200.00 to replace. Thank God I bought the extended warranty.

About 3 months ago, blue dots began to appear, followed by blue haze areas on the right hand side of the television. I almost bought a replacement bulb (thinking that was the problem), but evidently the problem is caused by an optical device that costs as \\"little\\" as $700 and as much as $1,200. The repair bill would another $300. If a recall was ever needed, it's on this TV and the other model that has the same problems. It really pains me, that Sony is taking their unhelpful approach, because this TV was incredible for the price for almost three years! Even though tube-tv's are bulky, they did last for twenty years.

I asked if the problem had been addressed with the replacement parts, or if they were identical to the original equipment, meaning this would likely happen again in 2 to 3 years, they said they were the same.Needless to say, that piece of garbage is now sitting in the corner of my garage collecting dust.

As I was about to replace the lamp I noticed that the lamp was covered by molten plastic from the TV.

However, the replacement optical assembly is not color balanced. It produces a distinct redish tone on the left side and a bluish tone on the right. This was confirmed with using a Minolta CS100 Colorimeter The repair shop said that was the best they could do. Bottom line: this is a great TV when it works properly, but get an extended warranty as LCD rear projection technology does not have the reliability of a CRT. Finally consider other manufactures. Whenever we shopped for a TV, video camera, etc. we only bought Sony.

He gets \\"motorama\\" and tries to claim his prise, but there is none; and after being thrown out of a sckyscraper what does our protaginst do? He hitchhikes back to the first gas station and takes the attendent job, fills up the car of a man who won 1 million dollars..the man is hit by a truck.. Credits roll after he has a meaningless 3(short)sentence conversation with the owner......and that's all. I feel the need to repeate, What in God's name were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grandeur of Middle earth","review":"Ted Nasmith can be very proud of his Tolkien Calendar for 2003. His paintings are a magnificent portrait of the world of The Two Towers. I was especially impressed by the majestic mountain scenery and the enchanting moonlight in several of the paintings. I also liked his vision of the Ents, which I've never been able to successfully picture in my own mind. They are satisfactorially \\"treeish\\" and sentient at the same time. This calendar will be a delight all year long. I can hardly wait for 2004 and The Return of the King calendar."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent calendar but odd-looking hobbits","review":"This is a nice-sized calendar, approximately 12 inches square, with a large picture on each of the top panels. The images are wonderful (particularly the Ents and Minas Morgul), but the hobbits look too devilish.Each lower panel has the month grid, with smallish squares, a text excerpt to accompany the picture, with the chapter from The Two Towers identified, and a small, incomplete version of the main picture. US and Canadian holidays are shown, as are phases of the moon, Daylight Savings Time and dates associated with Tolkien -- his birth and death, and publication dates of his works.There is also a two-page centerfold painting of the Ents attacking Isengard which is very nice indeed.I'd give this calendar five stars but IMHO the test of any Tolkien calendar (and I've been getting them for over two decades) is the depiction of the hobbits, and these, unfortunately, are not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"good gift","review":"I gave this to my fiance and he really liked it - he began reading some of the passages out loud as soon as he opened it.

A great item for any Zelda or Videogame soundtrack fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book BUT very repetitive","review":"The focus of this book is to go into ever more detail about how to read tomb inscriptions. It is a nice way to learn hieroglyphics if you are really, really keen on doing this for its own sake. I would add, though, the caveats that:* the book assumes that you are familiar with grammar (participles etc.) - unfortunately I am not;* going around and around the same the tomb inscriptions in increasing detail became boring and overly repetitive for my taste; I expected to start with short sentences and go on to read full paragraphs from Egyptian literature (as does \\"Athenaze\\" for Greek) rather than solely tomb inscriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth to read","review":"This is a real good book to introduce you in the reading and understanding of old Egyptian writing. I found it clear and very well structured. The exercises included do help you in the learning. It can be recommended without doubt if you are actually interested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I have five more stars to give for this book?","review":"Excellent beginner's text! I can hardly add an additional superlative to the list of accolades above. There are not many scholarly texts which are accessible to the layman Egyptophile. Manley and Collier have provided a clearly laid out path to understanding the intriguing symbols of the ancient Egyptians. This book is invaluable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to read hieroglyphs, buy this book.","review":"You won't become an expert on ancient Egypt's writing, but you'll be able to read and decypher common writings from popular museum exhibits, and tourist destinations. This book has been used as a textbook for a college egyptology class, that ought to tell you something!The exercises are easy to do, and the entire text is well written. I'd like to see an advanced hieroglyphs book put out by the authors of this one, as I'm very interested in the writing style after going through this book.As I said, if you want to be able to read and decypher hieroglyphs, this is the best book I've found for the layperson."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book.","review":"This book was absolutely worth it. I've studied Ogham as well as Mayan Hieroglyphs, and as an archaeologist I can say this this book is great for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious but accessible introduction","review":"This is a nice book, from which the average person can learn the basics of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and language.Most books are either very superficial, with virtually no discussion of the grammar of Egyptian and only a basic outline ofthe writing system, or they are one of the small number of textbooks aimed at the serious student of Egyptian, notably SirAlan Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar. Books such as Gardiner are heavy going and far too much work for most people. This book occupies the middle ground.It provides a fairly detailed discussion of the writing system plus enough of the language for the student to acquire a real insightinto Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and to be able to read portions of inscriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks and No Egyptologist Would Dare Be Seen Using It","review":"I'm no Egyptologist, but I've lived in Egypt and studied many languages, including Egyptian. This book sucks on so many levels. The author himself admits that it's not really for people who are that serious about learning to read Egyptian. It's got that orientalist zeitgeist feel to it. Gardiner's Middle Egyptian is a much better book to buy. This one is just a bunch of commentary and squiggles. I hate the fact that most libraries would buy it before buying Gardiner's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a view into the capitol","review":"This collection of short stories brings to life the residents of inner city Washington, D.C., their strengths and foibles, hopes and dreams, passions and errors. Jones creates a compelling cast of characters, from old women in Bible studies, to shopkeepers, criminals, and parents.The first few stories lacked the depth to allow the reader to care for or feel deeply for the character. But by the fourth story in the book, Young Lions, this changes. The reader sees and experiences the world through the perspective of a criminal. Subsequent stories take the reader into various households and families, showing the inner workings of kin, neighbors, and enemies in the city.Some stories are sad, others heartwarming, but all are real. The heroes are important people, who make up the heart of Washington, but who find themselves represented in literature all too rarely. An important book, especially for those who live in or have a connection with the capitol city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"Quite honestly, I'm not really one to enjoy compilations of short stories--I tend to avoid them in the classroom and I rarely read them for fun because I don't care for them. Needless to say, I really didn't care for this book. The short stories weren't interesting to me, and I personally found a majority of them inappropriate. Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I don't think that every story needs references to sex or cussing to validate it, and I find myself becoming uncomfortable when I read stories like these.These stories were frustrating to me in that many of them just seem to end with no conclusion. They read in the same fashion as Flannery O'Conner, and as I wasn't a fan of her writing either, it makes sense that these short stories also wouldn't be for me. I do understand the premise for these short stories as Jones is writing what he knows, but I personally need something much more upbeat. One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doo not buy - please read","review":"Have had this for over a year. Have used it only 10-15 times - spent most of the time debugging / getting thinge to work.

I first heard \\"Georges V' on a Rough Trade compilation CD, and I'm very glad to have sought them out. This CD and \\"Sangue Puro\\" are quite entertaining.

The saying, \\"some things are better left unsaid,\\" is true with this sequel. I think by creating this sequel, it ruined the magic of the first movie. I felt I was better off not knowing what happened after the first movie. This movie was just a waste of the $2 I spent renting it. I love Disney movies but I don't think they should keep coming out with sequels if they are going to be this bad. I don't understand what happened to John Smith!!!! They forced a new romance with the other John that just made the movie uncomfortable. I also felt like the entire movie made Pocahontas look bad.

The video is very powerful and emotional to watch, but I do love the concept behind the song; learning from our parents' mistakes and not carrying that on to other generations.Even if you are not a fan of Kelly Clarkson, I definitely recommend Because of You.

The audio version is superior to the written format primarily due to the superior performances by the authors.You do miss out in seeing photos of Stephen Colbert in drag, however, so you may want to skim through the hardcover version the next time you're at the book store.If you're a fan of Tom Bodet or Garrison Keillor, you'll enjoy this spoof on their type of storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kiss-Up Review that Just May Not","review":"I'm told that the humorist stylings of Steven Colbert, Amy Sedaris, et al are an acquired taste. I'm unable to judge, seeing as how I acquired the taste long ago, thanks to the brilliant \\"Daily Show\\" and \\"Strangers With Candy\\" shows these folks put together.\\"Wigfield\\" concerns a broken-down town on the way to being an underwater park, thanks to the impending destruction of a nearby dam. This is simply the framework on which the authors hang their over-the-top caricatures, however.If you enjoy deadpan delivery of the outrageous (think \\"Spinal Tap\\" or \\"Best In Show\\"), you'll dig \\"Wigfield.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the strangers connection rules","review":"I got the tape and loved it.

I like Stephen Colbert. But I don't really like this book. For such a short book, it is very repetitive. There are some laugh-out-loud sections, but the book is mostly tired jokes about strippers and rednecks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong medium for a funny idea","review":"I am a huge fan of Stephen Colbert, but I feel that the authors should have turned this into a movie or a miniseries rather than a book. The jokes that are funny are great, but as a novel, it is very repetitive and downright tiring to read. It has very few cohesive moments, and most of the novel is a string of interviews with people whom the reader cares very little about. They are just vessels for more jokes, which are sometimes funny, but usually not.If you're looking for a funny NOVEL, don't read this book. If you are looking for a book that reads like a TV show, this might be the yarn for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"What a disappointment. I struggled to the halfway point and finally gave up on it. Strangers With Candy may be one of the best shows in TV history but this book is a snore. The story suffers from tedious, uninteresting characters, I found myself zoning out every other page. The overuse of contradictory humor in lines like \\"I\\"ve spent every one of my forty-eight years right here in Wigfield, except for the times I've been incarcerated or living elsewhere.\\" quickly becomes tiresome.Don't waste your money.Hopefully Amy, Paul and Stephen will put more effort into the Strangers With Candy film script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke runs too long","review":"I love Stephen Colbert and Amy Sedaris, but the joke runs too long. Not enough for a full book, so it grows tiring, fast.

I bought this book solely because he had a hand in it. As expected, it is full of intelligent humor. Here's the premise: Russell Hokes decides to become a writer, exploring the dying small-town America. He is a terrible writer. You have to know great writing in order to recognize deliberate bad writing. Between his terrible writing, and his ignorance of what is happening in front of his face, this book is laugh-out-loud funny! The only drawback I found was that the joke runs a little long. But please, BUY THIS BOOK! You'll be letting Stephen eat for another day. And I care about the welfare of Stephen. I really do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny","review":"This book is definitely very \\"Strangers with Candy\\"-ish. Yes, the joke runs a little long at the end, but it's still a funny read.

It's a novel called The Locklear Letters that I picked up the same day. I expected Wigfield to be brilliantly funny based upon what I knew about its authors; it wasn't funny at all and, frankly, bored me to tears. I expected nothing of The Locklear Letters, a book that's gotten no publicity at all other than Amazon's \\"breakout books\\" designation, and I was treated to a laugh-out-loud comic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I (heart) Wigfield!!!","review":"I guess I'm in the minority of Talent Family/Strangers with Candy fans who LOVED this book. It was so over-the-top and ridiculous, but that's what makes it great. Like another reviewer said, the pictures alone make it worth the price of admission.

You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong.

This book is about nothing more than a bunch of low-life degenerates who gathered together and call themselves a town. Their only purpose in this book is to try to cheat the government.Russell Hokes was extremely annoying, and his lame 'jokes' got real old real fast. Not to mention that they wern't funny, not even a little bit. It's not that I took offense to anything he wrote, it's just that everything he wrote was unbelivably stupid.I think you have to have a really bizarre sense of humor to find this book entertaining.

However, the zero setting, too often required, is painfully methodical, the mode change easily switches as the protruding bezel often touches my wrist and, as a result, the perpetual calendar, alarm, and chronograph are accidentally altered! After having reset the perpetual calendar for the fifth time for some reason, the date is perpetually crooked! I would not recommend this watch and am surprised by the great reviews. My assumption is that many of these reviews were written during the first week or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised...","review":"Really took a chance purchasing this watch - first Citizen watch I ever owned and Eco-Drive at that! But, I have been very happy with this purchase. Very good value for the functions you get. Titanium is the way to go with large watches (noticeably lighter). Only gripe I have is the manual is pretty sparse. But, the controls are logical enough to figure out on your own. My favorite feature is the perpetual calander - no more adjusting for day of month manually!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY nice watch","review":"Beautiful watch. Keeps very good time. Wish it had some sort of back lighting. It's still a little big for my wrist, but smaller (and a heck af a lot cheaper) than the Rolex and Breitling I was looking at. Nice and light too due to titanium. Couldn't ask for more for an under $300 watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"The watch was delivered the 18th so only had it a few days. If you want to put on this watch and wear it look for another time piece. you must read the directions to set all the functions.

Overall for $200 very satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS IF YOU LOOK FOR TITANIUM WATCH","review":"Many people already wrote nice reviews and included a lot of information. I will only add few words.I am really very dissapointed with this 'Titanium' watch.The biggest issue is that it's not at all 'ALL TITANIUM'.Back of the case is made of steel. Beware.So if you look for some anti-allergic or real 'All Titanium' watch, don't go for this item.Unfortunately I only found this out when I looked at the back of the watch.The other thing that is annoying and you would not expect this from the watch with the list price $450 is that Seconds hand does not align with the markers at all.Also, althought smaller, this watch seems to be heavier then Skyhawk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cirtizen's Eco-Drive BL5250-53L","review":"I recently purchased this watch. It keeps excellent time, and is easy to see in low light. The dual time zone feature is very neat to have for me as I travel back and forth between two time zones.The alarm is worthless, you can barely hear it if you place right next to your ear. I wrote the Company to inquire about a potential volume increase, and in three weeks they have not even seen fit to reply to me. So much for their customer service.Lastly the rotating bezel won't budge until you lube it with silicone.

I missplaced the CD and the instructions do not say much- After three weeks the thing just died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the watch so far.","review":"I had done a fair amount of research into watches when I lost my old watch :( and decided on this one. I liked the perpetual calendar function and the eco-drive technology. I dont really need many other functions, but also liked the look of the watch. Even though I knew the thickness of the watch from the specs, I was still a little suprised to see how thick it really was - once I got some links taken out so it fit my wrist better, the thickness hasnt been a problem and doesnt seem so big. I like the look, havent had it switch modes on me, but have to admit I havent spent a lot of time with the instruction manual yet to try out some of the other features. For what it is, I have been pretty satisfied thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Naked City","review":"Take one honest but world wise urban cop played by Glenn Ford. Take a gangster ridden town run by the mob. Take a genuine \`bad guy' enforcer played by a young Lee Marvin and his wrong side of the tracks but heart of gold girlfriend played by the legendary B actress Gloria Grahame and you have a fair B side noir film. The dialogue is a little thin and the melodrama gets laid on a little thick but it will not be the worst time you have every spent. If nothing else look at it to see the Grahame performance. It is a classic portrayal of the type."},{"rating":"2","title":"sets the awesome tone","review":"This film set the tone for dozens who tried to imitate; be it Clint Eastwood, Steven Segal, et al.

Alexander Scourby plays the big Lagana..This film includes another fine performance by that mystical Gloria Grahame..She is the ringer and plays her part superbly..I think Annette Benning is a modern day actress with these qualities..?Lee Marvin plays the sadistic Vince..and has reprised such characters in later films. Ford, like Dana Andrews , acts with his face also..making it all very real..CP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Ford at his BEST!","review":"Although Glenn Ford is best known for his westerns, he shines in this dramatic film noir directed by Fritz Lang. What impressed me about this film is the strong performance by film veteran, Glenn Ford as the cop and Glenn Ford as the father and husband -- purely touching. What a great actor he was and unfortunately underrated. One of Fritz Lang's best. P.S. Amazon should make this great film affordable so fans can enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite film noir movies","review":"To me this is one of my top film noir movies.

Cliched.","review":"I can't believe anyone would rate this movie highly. The plot is predictable from the start. The writing is cliched to the max. At times I found myself saying, \\"they'd never do that, or say that.\\" Fritz Lang's overuse of melodrama was irritating. The performances by the actors were uneven.In my mind, the Maltese Falcon, The Third Man, and Touch of Evil are the standards against which any other noir film should be measured. More recently Memento and Croupier are symbols of great film making in this genre. The story here falls way short of those benchmarks. (I'll spare you a rehash. Read the other reviews.) Glen Ford and Lee Marvin offer some good moments, but when they are bad, they stink the joint out. Same with the rest of the cast.Unless you enjoy bad films because they are really bad, don't waste your money. Go buy the Touch of Evil, or the others I mentioned, if you want noir that grabs you and pulls you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best film noirs ever!","review":"The Big Heat is a brilliant film noir crime drama that I hold in very high esteem. The film is charged with electricity in this story of a honest cop trying to discover the answer to a murder, whyile being mired down by his higherups take orders from the cityy's gangboss, Lagana. Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin and Gloria Grahame (the latter being the victim of one of cinema's most memorable sadistic scenes) all give extraordinary performances. One of director Fritz Lang's best.I watched the Blu-ray tonight. The print is excellent, except I detected a few cases of haloing. Grain is defnitely present.Audio could use a boost. At times, it was very good, but at others I had to crank up the receiver.Extras included a trailer and an isolated music score. There is also a booklet that spends too many of its 8 pages doing a scene-by-scene story synopsis.A recommended, high quality film noir on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was a gift, so I personally did not watch it, however the gentleman that I bought it for love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for your collection","review":"I really enjoyed this book .

Rather, it exposes her as unable to maximize the opportunities she has been given to grow intellectually and spiritually as she continues to attempt to maintain control over the development of her siblings and her own children.

As usual the Federation is still portrayed as a utopian organization, and the first episode to hint at a dystopian future fizzles because the humans are essentially blameless, so once again the Federation is uncompromised by human fear or greed.Contrast this episode with \\"Ensign Ro\\" where Picard will match wits with a rogue Admiral who is acting against Federation policy.

All the five singles have its own distinct style of composition. The pool has this eerie kind of taste to it while Take to the sky is an uptempo song that make you want to dance. And there is something beautiful about Sweet Dreams, that I just couldn't explain. But the standout song turns out to be Upside down.

Amos herself has said that one of her biggest regrets is not including \\"Upside Down\\" on \\"Earthquakes,\\" and it is easy to see why. The song has become one of Amos's fans' favorite tracks, along with \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (recently re-recorded for her greatest hits collection \\"Tales of a Librarian\\") and a show standard on her 2003 concert tour, \\"Take to the Sky.\\" \\"The Pool\\" is also quite interesting in its own right, but this single is a must-have for the aforementioned songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It got two of the best songs from Little Earthquakes time","review":"If you like Tori Amos you just must have this CD that have the songs \\"Upside Down\\" and \\"Take to the Sky\\" that are just GREAT...

The 4 B-sides are wat make this a true find. \\"The Pool\\" is an eerie song, just Tori's mesmorising vocals, no instruments. \\"Take to the Sky\\" is a jazzy type song, one that Tori has performed on occasion on her current \\"Scarlet's Walk\\" tour. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is an uptempo \\"intermezzo\\", quite nice. \\"Upside Down\\" is another beautiful ballad, not unlike \\"Winter\\".In all, a great addition to any Tori fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A snowy evening","review":"This release helps to round out the voice of Little Earthquakes. It's not that I think the record is any more (or less) incomplete than her others, but rather that her style was so chaotic and formative then that it's impossible to fairly taste her younger singing and playing with just that album (the same goes for Under the Pink, less so with Boys for Pele).

Rather than deal with the hassle of uninstalling and returning the unit, I was able to remove the LEAK SENTRY device (which would have otherwise caused it not to work properly) and just use it as a regular fill valve with the addition of the roller clamp, which does works. However, I question the water savings claims.The box says \\"ENGINEERED TO LAST\\" but it must be just more marketing because it seems like it's just cheap plastic, especially the piece that broke off the LEAK SENTRY device... so, when installing the chain for the LEAK SENTRY device, be very careful not to pull it too hard or the little plastic piece that holds the chain will break off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I bought one in 2008, and did not use it until today June 2011.Have a leaking toilet.

The water runs when it shouldn't be, according to the instructions. I remember getting this to work in another toilet back in 2002. So, something changed. I noticed the original valve in the toilet was \\"American Standard\\" brand, and everything looks very similar. Even the holes where the leak protection part can be installed. Installed the leak protection onto the \\"American Standard\\", changed the washer/seal into the new one.And the leak protection worked.If you can get this \\"American Standard\\", go for it.

I am sure I understood how to connect the \\"extra\\" chain for the leak-preventing valve (I carefully, carefully reviewed and reviewed again the instructions which intially are somewhat daunting since they insist on using non-laymen terms to describe objects). But valve would not function properly (would not fill). So I tied the chain up so that the valve is deactivated. Toilet worked fine for 2 days, then, stopped filling back up. So i let chain loose, thinking that would deactivate valve. Nothing I could do would get it to consistantly fill up the toilet. Nice idea but putting in practice seems to be overly complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spotty coverage, some regions covered great some sorely lacking","review":"This is a good book, but note that it is a advanced wine buyers guide, do not really expect this guide to be of much help at your local grocery store wine section.If you are just starting out there are better books to start with, get this book when you have caught the wine bug and are ready to invest more in your wines.If you are serious about your wines and willing to spend $25 and up wards for your wine then this is a must have.

Those who have experience in wine will realize early on that Mr. Parker likes a particular, if not homogenous variety of wine. He focuses too much on bigger, international oakier wines in my opinion. The information on wine web sites is also suspect in that it fails to disclose a relationship Mr. Parker has with one of the recommended web sites.You should sit in a library or bookstore and browse this book in a short time rather than purchasing it.While Mr. Parker has had his time in the wine world, I for one believe there are other, better places to read and discover wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money","review":"This wine book is not worth your money or attention. It isn't a \\"Buyer's Guide,\\" as most of the wines are long gone from the market. It is majorly incomplete, missing hundreds of estates, including several important ones.

There's a bit of banjo in there, too. The songs are a gas, especially the title track - also: Do You Really Love Me Baby?, I'm Lonely, Dig!, Thing Called Woman and Ask Him (with a choir).The compilation releases are often rich - Jay has a great repertoire - but this one deserves a reissue all its own.

However, for those who prefer not to spend hard earned money on curiousities that you'll probably only listen to once before you retire the disc to your CD case, then you will have no difficulty finding other worthy Tori single purchases (The \\"Spark\\" imports are not to be missed).The B-sides of this album are short and charming. However, the derivative tracks \\"This Old Man\\" and \\"That's What I Like\\" are too long, and the original tracks \\"Graveyard\\" and \\"Toodles Mr. Jim\\" are too short. \\"Graveyard,\\" in particular, could have been a beautiful album track which makes it all the sadder.

I'm glad she released it as a single. But what's this? Mixing this with \\"silly songs\\"? Somehow it works! \\"This Old Man\\" is done really well, considering it's a nursery rhyme. \\"That What I Like Mick\\" is really very nice, too. \\"Graveyard\\" is really short, but it captures more intensity in 54 seconds than several songs by other artists that are over five minutes. To top it off, we get transported back in time with \\"Toodles Mr. Jim\\", a sweet farewell to a childhood friend and neighbor. Tori strikes again. Yay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught a Nice Laugh","review":"'Caught A Lite Sneeze', one of Tori's many singles, is very different from anything else. In addition to the exquisite title track, the single has 4 b-sides listed under the heading 'Silly Songs'. The reason I say it is different is because many of Tori's songs have a serious sound to them. The b-sides, a nice contrast to the title track, are all sing-songy little tunes. How could someone not let out a chuckle at Tori singing \\"This Old Man\\"? Tori's cover of \\"That's What I Like Mick (The Sandwich Song)\\" is a list of things that she likes, played and sung in a unique jazzy style. The majestically haunting 54 second-long \\"Graveyard\\" is exclusive to this CD single (the UK versions do not have it), and \\"Toodles Mr. Jim\\", a bouncy funny tribute to a neighbor who passed away, is by far one of her best b-sides. I give this single 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opera Magic","review":"The only way to discribe this cd is to call it \\"opera magic\\"!!! I often listen to opera while I do little things around the house, but when this album came on, it commanded me to stop and listen.

Girl Power!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great footage of Che's final journey","review":"Following the Bolivian trails where Che fought his last battles is quite moving. This documentary wore me out both emotionally, and in some strange way, physically.Included in this film are photos of Che's original diary. Also included were interviews with people who met him during the Bolivian struggle. The most impressive interview was with a village schoolteacher who had a conversation with him moments before his execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story of a Glorified Terrorist","review":"The American public is a sucker for an underdog story. Truth be told, Che was not much more than a literate, terrorist thug. Much like Osama bin Laden, except not as charismatic. He's no different than the insurgents we see in videos coming out of Iraq. Che executed a great number of prisoners, with no trial and no mercy.It makes me sick to see American teens wearing Che t-shirts. Don't they know? Che was a murderer that hated everything about America. And now little Billy wants to buy a Che t-shirt at the mall. Gimme a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not fit","review":"i thought the description said it would fit all gallon and quart sizes. sta-lube must use an oddball size for its containers. this pump did not fit the standard quart size opening on my bottles of synchromax. i wound up using the tube that came with it and squeezing the fluid into the transmission. this product was a waste of my money. if sta-lube bottles are non standard, then the product description should say so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Product Page","review":"Although the description says it fits a STA-LUBE quart container, this pump does not fit a standard quart bottle. Additionally, the product I received did not come on a card like the photo shows; it came in a bag with a cardboard top stapled closed. The cardboard top said it fits a half-gallon and gallon container; it did not mention a quart at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Although this book has a lot of information, it has one really major flaw...the way in which it is organized. Many of the items are listed in the index and in the chapters under their English name, not their Indian name. Because of this, you cannot just look up an unfamiliar word, and find it's meaning. For example... if you wanted to look up the word \\"jeera\\", which means, cumin seed, you would not find it in the index as \\"jeera\\",you would have to look under the english term, \\"cumin seed\\". To me it seems that it is the Indian terms you would want to be looking up in most cases. The index should have included both the Indian and English term, so that you can look it up EITHER WAY. Although this book has lots of information, you would honestly be better of buying a cookbook that includes a glossary of ingredients that are listed as their INDIAN name, and you would save yourself a lot of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but horrible mistakes in the \\"Hindi\\" titles.","review":"I had an extremely dim first impression of the book from the chapter titles. The book attempts to transliterate an english word into a Devnagari (Hindi) script, and fails spectacularly. Transliterating back, the word \\"spices\\" reads as \\"syasis\\", \\"Canned goods\\" reads as \\"can thruds\\" and so on. It clearly has been added as a touch of exotica, which annoys me more.This rant is only applicable to the Hindi reading section of the Indian populace, who in any case won't need this book to enter an Indian grocery store.Thank you for letting me get that off my chest. Now I can be kind to the book.I am an Indian; it seems relevant in this context since none of the other reviewers so far are. The information in this book is actually quite good, and pretty comprehensive, and for that I'd recommend the book. The indexing needs to be fixed; at the very least all the non-English words in the text should be present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for \\"special kids\\"","review":"Some very smart kids just don't fit in the classroom. They learn differently. This book assures those kids that they are not \\"weird\\", but just might need to learn lessons differently. Unfortunately, most state educational programs do NOT address these needs.Hopefully, these different-learning kids will learn to accept themselves rather than to succumb to any titles that may be assigned to them, ie, slow learner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Pointless","review":"I had fun playing this game, even though the cut scenes were way too long (20 minutes, at one point!). The nice thing is you can pause the cut scenes if you need to. My complaint is the lazy lack of an ending. NOTHING is tied up at the end, except one important task is completed. Then the game basically tells you to stay tuned for the next game. That's lazy and greedy, in my opinion. If they wanted to do another Runaway game, it could have had a different plot, or they could have made this relatively short game longer. By the way, this game was published in 2006, and I just checked the Pendulo website, and no new Runaway release is on the horizon for 2008, so I wouldn't hold my breath waiting to find out how Brian's wacky adventure ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love part 1 and part 2 delivers","review":"the game is colorful and the puzzles are cool and fun...only knock is more dialoge than i liked but everything else made up for it.a must play for adventure gamers.hope they make part 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be fun, but stopped working on my PC","review":"I got a couple of chapters into this game and then disaster struck. Every time I try to start the game, it either prompts me to insert the DVD (which is there) or my PC locks up and I have to power it off and reboot. I have given up on it at this point.This is definitely a story and dialog game. If you like lots of dialog, i.e. going back and forth to different locations talking to people about a billion things, then you would like this game. It is also an \\"inventory\\" game, i.e. you collect things in your inventory and then have to figure out how they expect you to combine them or use them on things in your environment (like putting butter on a cable so you can unfasten it).I prefer games with more puzzles and less talking (like the Myst series), so perhaps I'm not missing much with it not working for me anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to teach phonics to students of all ages.","review":"A very clear, easy to follow text with coloful pictures. Goes over each phonetic sound in a sequential order that makes reading easy to understand.Accompanied by several workbooks that are okay, but not as good as the text.Certainly wish this book were again available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading Subtitle-Great Work!","review":"Although the book is titled an itroductory study, I would not reccomend to anyone start a journey into the Ancient Rome with McDonald's work, unless you are one of those persons who have deep fascination for Classical studies and ancient architecture. This book rewards an attentive reader and in the course of reading I was reffering constantly to Roman historians such as Seutonius and Tacitus. Through the careful analysis of the four great monuments of antiquity (the Domus Aurea, Domus Augustana, Trajan's Markets and the Pantheon), all centered in Rome, an author clearly shows a connections between symbolic meaning of the space, its forms, and construction techniques. This analysis is supplied with very descriptive illustrations, plans, and major dimensions of the explored monuments. In my opinion, this is one of the very few fundamental works on the Architecture of the Roman Empire that is available in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bible Study!","review":"I am a First Place leader who completed this study in April 2002. My group of 20+ men and women really enjoyed it. Our group lost a total of 200 pounds this session, but many members have said that the thing they enjoy the most about the program is the Bible study. I've completed this one before, but this edition has been re-vamped recently with new content. I think the changes are great! The music CD included with the book is very helpful in memorizing the 10 Bible verses. The music isn't the best in the world, but it can still be a helpful tool. The book comes with the wonderful study, tear-out commitment records, wellness worksheets and more. The first Bible study \\"Giving Christ First Place\\" is still my all-time favorite, but this one definitely runs a close 2nd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday Victory for Everyday people with cd","review":"I ordered this book twice, but don't remember which is which. the first came and it was excellent.

I am tired of sending it in for repair and consider this planned obsolescence from Solano. I will never buy another prooduct from them again, quality has gone downhill since Newell took over. There is ZERO excuse that a person (not a hair dresser drying several heads a day) should have issues with this expensive dryer every year.Went with a Sedu 6000i and it has lasted with no issues over the same period of time. There are better options in the high end hair dryer market look elsewhere because this product doesnt' last.PS- notice another review here (Fifey) in this chain of reviews, is on their second one! Anyone who spends $120 on a hair dryer and uses it lightly shouldn't have to buy another one, and most CERTAINLY shouldn't have to repair it annually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solano Hair Dryer","review":"My wife loves the dryer. She typically gets up in the AM before I do. This hair dryer has a lower register for the motor rather than the normal high pitched whine.

He picked nearly the perfect compromise of explaining naval jargon without dumbing down the material. His use of illustrations and visual representations (from maps to the beautiful cover painting by Geoff Hunt) are wonderful, and his appendix on the sailing qualities of Agamemnon based on her trials is absolutely fascinating.His history is very inclusive and well documented (easy and accessible footnotes). I was most impressed with his history of HMS Agamemnon (my name sake, in case you haven't smoked it yet) as a paradigm for the naval wars of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period. His bio of Nelson is also well done and congruous with the rest of the book.All in all a very solid buy that will fit nicely on your naval history shelf.

Young Jim was played by a very young Christain Bale. Why this movie has never been released on DVD is beyond me, because the Disney version is awful. It's corny, stupid and dated.Honestly, the nostalgia people have for this film is the only reason it's ranked as high as it is. Do yourself a favor and hunt down TNT's Treasure Island on VHS. It's not the best format, but it is a far superior film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real classic version","review":"I've been playing this version of Treasure Island to my class for years on VHS and needed to get it in DVD form. Knew Amazon would carry it. Even better quality and kids loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best version of Treasure Island","review":"This is the best version of Treasure Island. It doesn't exactly follow the book. In this version Long John Silver is more charismatic and lovable than in the book. The Jim Hawkins character has a sweeter, more lovable disposition. The extras of of Long John holding a knife to Jim Hawkins, Jim having to kill one of the pirates to save his life, and Long John doing what he can to save Jim gave it the extras the book didn't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great one","review":"I bought this for my son because I wanted him to see the old classics instead of all that Nickeloden crap.

The dvd does not even have a trailer. Nothing. It is in full screen (which is not a problem as it is its OAR) but let alone no second disc, how about putting something on the one being released? It's a shame Disney is not giving their own movies the respect they gave the Miyazaki trilogy (WOW what a set). All 3 double disc. This is a 5 star movie with a 1 star dvd presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can I be the first reviewer for this?","review":"Long John Silver has to be the greatest pirate ever to come across the screen-- this technicolor extravaganza is one of Disney's greatest live-action films and just shows how family entertainment has fallen so low in the last fifty years. Strange though that the film centers around the relationship of a foul-mothed rum drunk dirty swab and and his courting of an impressionable little boy-- oh yeah and there is not a woman to be seen in the entire film- -we hear about Jim Hawkin's mom but never see her!

The audio needs some work. Otherwise great story. Good for families and young children to see this classic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quintessential Pirate Movie","review":"I have read Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island several times both as a child and an adult. Along with Robinson Crusoe, it is one of my all-time favorite stories. Treasure Island has been put to film many times, and in my opinion, this Disney version is by far and away the best. I loved it when I was young and I still love the film to this day. Robert Newton, as Long John Silver is the quintessential pirate. Bobby Driscoll does an excellent job as young Jim also. The film stays pretty much true to the text with a few exceptions. This is a film that, while made over 50 years ago, still holds up today. None of the modern special effects of modern movies, just a classic tale told masterfully. This is a film that a grandfather, like me, can enjoy with his grandchildren over and over. This is a fine example of a classic Disney family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!","review":"If you read the book as a kid and enjoyed it you will like this movie.Great for the whole family.Mild violence compared to most films out today that deal with action adventure.Robert Newton as Long John Silver gives a great performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic pirate story, says I","review":"The Robert Louis Stevenson characters will live forever;Long John SilverBlack DogBlind PughBilly BonesJim HawkinsBen GunnA wonderful story to find Captain Flynt's lost treasure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, inconsistent and misleading version!","review":"One day a mysterious person comes to stay at an inn ran by a boy and his mother.

For comparison, I tried some quick and easy Rustoleum 'Primer and Pain' all in one and it went on and stayed perfectly.So, I don't know if it was the primer process that was missing with the Duplicolor, or if it was because I failed to purchase their adhesion promoter, the paint I used did not stick to the prepared aluminum.That being said, the paint did go on fairly well, but dried unevenly..even if it did not chip off.I was unsuccessful in obtaining the results I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good background","review":"An important and good read for those interested in environmental education.

This is awesome, because you can entertain your baby while you get some things done! This mobile gets my baby's attention from the get go, and holds him captivated for the entire 15 minutes! Another plus, the arm of the mobile moves from side to side, so you can sweep it out of the way when it is time to sleep.

The mobile no longer turns and i wrote to the manufacturer for help. we were completely ignored. for two hundred dollars... you would think they would make good on their product. i bought tiny love products for my now eight year old (back when he was a baby) and had good experiences, so i thought it was a safe bet although it was expensive. But after some research, i find that apparently the quality of not just this product, but other Tiny Love products has gone way down-hill in the last few years. i guess this is why the manufacturer/seller of this product did not respond or try to help in any way. sad... i really thought it would be a great mobile. Highly suggest you pick another mobile and brand for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS THING","review":"I was so excited to see this toy on line. What a huge waste of time and money. It doesnt work, AT ALL. It looks like it has been used, there are cuts and scrapes on the product. It looks nice from the looks on the box. But it does not play the music longer than 2 seconds, and the mobile doesnt move. I think if the product worked I guess it would be great.

I would suggest this mobile to anyone who asked but the price being asked is beyond outragous i suggest hunt around or find a different mobile. i would be willing to pay 40 dollars for this but that also includes the shipping and handling.

I really don't want to nit-pick, but we have three (or four depending on how you count) seperate interstellar races spread out over God knows how many light years, yet they are able to eat the same food and (in some cases) eat each other. I know that the author did not have time to develop food sources in the middle of inter-stellar warfare and I can accept that, but it does make leave a big hole in the narrative for a hard core Sci-Fi Buff like meThat being said, the action was constant and well thought out all the way through the series. Some of the plot leaps were a little difficult. But hey, it is fiction and real history does not always seem to make sense sometimes.Overall, I liked this series a lot better than I liked Turttledove's The War That Came Too Early series.

I had a good pillow top spring mattress for 15 years and I have back and shoulder problems. The spring mattress cut off circulation to my arm whenever I slept on my side. I thought we would give the foam mattress a try but I really did not want to pay for the Tempur name. This mattress does not cause shoulder pain or cut off circulation. Also the kids can't bounce on it, they just sink into it! The one complaint that I have seen is odor. We have an enclosed porch and we left it out for 2 days before setting it up and the odor is insignificant. Also, it is supposed to be on a solid base not a spring base.

Now, I can't wait to have an opprotunity to sleep in... very comfortable!!Yeah it retains heat too, but we think adjusting the sheets/comforter set-up will take care of this come summer.

I recommend it so much that I'm looking to upgrade to a King version of the same mattress. It came sealed in a double layer plastic bag that I could put my arms around, we put it on the bed and followed the directions carefully on how to remove the plastic and within 4 hours it was ready to sleep on. Neither of us noticed any kind of smell like others have mentioned must just be a person's level of smell.Update March 2012- it's now been over a year since we upgraded to the King size version and just like the queen is an awesome mattress - highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!","review":"We have had this mattress just under two months now and wanted to wait to review it until we'd had a chance to REALLY see how it worked for us.

This mattress has helped him immensely - the first night we had it, he slept through the night for the first time in years. This mattress sleeps \\"bigger\\" than the average queen sized bed.

What they don't tell you is the foam bottoms out not too long after the 90 days. Also fat chance of ever returning as the foam appears level but within a minute or two of laying on it (after 3-6 months of use) it bottoms out. We had to get a 2 inch memory foam topper from sams and even that is not enough. I have damaged my hip bones from this - they are slowly recovering now that we have gotten rid of that giant rip off. Now you are warned - good for 90 days but not for much longer.

That said, the mattress is very comfortable and not overly stiff or soft. I didn't notice much of an odor after a day and was able to sleep on it the same day it was delivered (which took just two days with free shipping!).

It's admittedly not as \\"soft\\" as the swedes make their mattress, but it's comfortable and it alleviates back pain all the same.Yes, it smells to start out but it doesn't reek.

If you do a search on \\"mattress outgassing\\" you'll find many reports of people who started experiencing all kinds of health problems that went away as soon as they removed their mattress. Other articles associate the outgassing to severe diseases like cancer. No level of comfort is worth these reported health risks, especially for my three little kids, so this mattress is going back.

We tried bringing it into the house about 3 times, by the next day the room is filled with odor that gives everyone an instant headache. We will start trying once a month in September. This bed is made/manufactured in China. It is not from the US. That said...the quality of memory foam from China is not reliable and maybe we got a bad batch. Maybe we got something typical. If there were no smell I could probably sleep forever on this mattress, it is great.

There is simply no support, particularly in the center of the bed where both our weights overlap more. Neither of us are particularly big people - together we are 300 lbs. I would not recommend.We also assumed we would have a typical 60-90 return policy but in this case the manufacturer won't return the item after 7 business days.

This album is a ragbag of nearly everything from jazzy tunes to sorrowful saloon songs to swinging, upbeat songs.This is a great time capsule of Sinatra's early Reprise years and a touching tribute to Dorsey as all the songs are renditions of songs Sinatra once recorded with Mr. Dorsey himself. The real highlights of the album are \\"East of the Sun (And West of the Moon),\\" \\"Without a Song,\\" and \\"I'll Be Seeing You.\\" Sy Oliver arranged and conducted this album but also lent his voiced to the duet \\"The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else).\\" Mr Oliver sounds very much like Dean Martin and provides great vocal contrast to Sinatra.

If Canon specifies a 1120mAh battery, they do so because it will work reliably in the camera over its entire temperature range (and over the life of the camera) to give you predictable and reliable performance.

Then go over to the router screen and enable WEP security with a suitable pass key. Then do the same to the WRE54G. But here is the secret that I found. To the right of the pass key is a drop-down with OPEN showing. This can be dropped down to SHARED. Make sure SHARED is showing. Then save the changes. The expander should then work as expected. I believe the problem is that the router and expander cannot use the same pass key unless provisions are made for them to share the pass key.My WRE54G works fine with my Linksys WRT320N.

The CD setup program worked well enough, echoing lots of information which is good. It ended obscurely with \\"WRE54G cannot associate with this AP in replication mode\\". I imagine this means, in English, that it won't work with my access point (which is not a Linksys brand one). But it would have been better (1) to say so before I bought it; (2) to say so in plain English; (3) to at least occasionally anwer the support line (there is one especially for Amazon customers, which is nice at least in theory).

Yes, it delivers as but it need to be relatively close to your router (at least this was the case with my setup).I think the managers at Linksys should be given this product and asked to install it within 45 minutes on a secure network ...I'm betting 90% them would not make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well then Died","review":"This device worked well for about 8 months boosting an open signal from a WRT54G router.

Turns out that the range expander has \\"stability problems\\" (to quote Linksys tech support) with all but one version of firmware for the WRT54G. I had to install an old version of the WRT54G firmware that could only be accessed through Linksys' ftp web site. This is bad enough. However, what really has me steamed is the three hours I spent on the phone with Linksys tech support before I was referred to a tech specialist who finally came clean about the firmware problems with their products.

It only supports 64-bit or 128-bit WEP as of yet. Even worse, the Auto configure one touch button only works if you have encryption turned off (no WEP at all).

I noticed the \\"used and returned\\" bin of my local computer store full of these things the other day.... Now I know why. I was so disgusted I returned mine.

The auto set up does not work, apparently, because the network is WEP protected. So after some searching on the internet, I find a manual work around. Which I did 3 times. None were successful. I went so far as to call Linksys support, where I was connected to a tech, but he then proceeded to ask me to hang on while he did something (unintelligible). 20 minutes later, I was not on hold, but the tech was not responding when I asked questions and tried to get his attention.

Calling Linksys involves an interminable phone tree that ends in India but once you get thru the tech's were incredibly helpful and patient in walking me through a complex process. If you have a high-speed connection, Linksys' Internet Chat option is also quite good, and very quick. So, if you need to streghten your signal, and are patient about setting this unit up, it works VERY VERY well, taking my previous 30% signal strength at 75' (between two bldgs) and amping it up to a full 100% signal with no drops.

The router does exactly what it advertises, with the exception of setup. If you buy this router, be prepared to spend multiple hours on the phone with technical support giving you a 50-step process of upgrading firmware, manually setting IP addresses, and doing many resets of every piece of networking hardware you can think of. I got the idea that my case was not unusual, and this is just how it is designed.

It has to be the most frustrating piece of computer equipment I have ever come across, and that's putting it mildly. In order to get the unit up and running you *must* configure your access point to factory defaults settings (disable WEP, etc). The WRE54G only supports WEP, not WPA. Broadcast SSID must be enabled before you can configure the unit (it can be disabled after initial configuration). I was unable to change the default IP address range of my WRT54G, otherwise the WRE54G would stop working.

Before installing this, I had about a 10% signal at any given time, and it would take about 2 minutes to download 10 megs or so, which is REALLY slow given my cable connection.After the incredibly difficult (I have set up quite a few wireless networks before, and I do IT consulting for a living, so I can only imagine how difficult this must be for someone without networking knowledge to install) setup process, my signal downstairs did improve dramatically, to 95%, but the speed seemed to be reduced even further, to the point where it was near unusable.Overall - If you can get it working, it WILL expand the range of your network.

Once I slid the cord power adapter in my unit, it is stuck permanently. The machining on this product was so pathetic that there was no tolerance and once it went in it's not coming out.Conclusion: If you have no security on your wireless network, this is a great buy as long as you dont change AC adapters.

The tech said that v.1 is at least two years old, and not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended my range","review":"Used with a WPS54GU2 router.

My laptop PC already received the signal when I added a more powerful antenna to the router, but the MAC mini could not. The Linksys range expander was relatively easy to set up and worked immediately to correct the weak signal problem, though it does not seem to boost the speed of the connection at this distance from the router.I recommend paying extra if necessary for the version 3 of the expander that says \\"works with most wireless networks\\" on the box. I saw other boxes on a nearby shelf at the store w/the same model number, but without the verbage quoted above that sold for $30 less. I guess it had older firmware or something and saving $30 wouldn't be worth the trial & error process to me...but who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"High failure rate","review":"I have other Linksys products.

We would have nothing to fear from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"As other reviews discuss in-depth, this product was difficult to setup. Once it was setup, I found that wireless devices like laptops and iPhone 3G had difficulties picking this device over the weaker Linksys WRT54G wireless router. I think the problem is that this device uses the same SSID as your wireless router. It appears that the algorithm that laptops and other devices like the iPhone 3G use randomly pick either one. So the only time this device will be really useful is if you are completely outside the range of your wireless router but within range of the range expander. It does not perform anywhere near as well as the access points that you see in large corporations. I would suggestion moving to a new wireless N wireless router. Most models also have improved wireless G range over older wireless routers like the Linksys WRT54G."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Performance","review":"I purchased two of these via another source for my work. The connectivity with my other wireless routers was horrible. The device would connect fine but would act rather weirdly. They would not pass-through dhcp half of the time.

Check out the Linksys Forums for this device if you do no believe me. Anyway, they were both RMA'd this week. Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away - Don't just walk","review":"I'm sure that the people at Linksys are really nice but this thing is a nightmare.

Then take three days to read through the results.The only people who like this product are the newbies (who don't understand the need for network security) and the pros (who love a technical challenge). For the rest of us, this product is an extraordinary headache.Flee, flee for your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big time Headache","review":"This is the most frustrating product I have ever purchased. I have worked over 5 hours to make this thing work. It continually says congratulations you have successfully installed the expander. I have reset and start over numerous times with no success.

After 5 hours of attempting to get the extender to recognize the router I came across a wiki that said that this is extender does not work with every brand of modem. It's not a universal extender, and therefore you can only be sure it will work with a Linksys modem. Buy a universal extender if you want to be sure it will work with your non-Linksys modem.After making a stop at our local big box appliance/computer store, we decided to just upgrade our modem to aNETGEAR WNDR3300 RangeMax Dual Band Wireless-N Router. It was one $169 item as opposed to a $99 router plus a $77 extender.

Being over 50 the day of rest between exercises I find works best for me becaue on the days I do the exercises I put a lot of tension into them. Even after this short of time the results have been very gratifying with increased muscularity everywhere. I can hardly wait to see the changes after another 6 mos. or so.

To make the book more user friendly, I took it to a print shop, had them cut the binding off and spiral bind it.

Admittedly, my criticism of this DVD is probably one only hard-core animation fans will be able to relate to, but I find this DVD to be unacceptable.Maybe in some alternate universe Disney is releasing a 'Tall Tales' DVD, not in some feeble attempt to make money off of patriotism, but because they want to present their classic shorts the way they deserve to be presented. A world where Disney would even include 'Pecos Bill' and not think they'll offend people because he smokes cigarettes(like anyone cares).If you just like to watch cartoons, rent it.

I was forced to make a list of my top ten songs of all time, and 'Don't Change' is up there. Why? Hard to say, suffice to say it carried the emotions I had then. Saw INXS in Omaha in 1997 - One of the best I seen ever. miss michael. love INXS. enjoy this album, truly a straight listen to CD from song one to song end.

Shabooh Shoobah would fit into the new wave genre but not all of the songs sound like each other. the highlights include the infectious opener \\"the one thing\\", \\"to look at you\\" and closer \\"dont change.\\" the first and last songs ended up being two of the bands best songs. this a must have for any real inxs fan. i can listen to it all of the time and never grow tired of it. and isnt that effect of a great album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated album","review":"Whenever people get talking about INXS they only seem to mention Listen Like Theives and Kick, and then forget about everything else. However, this relatively early album is extremely underrated.Whenever this album is mentioned, The One Thing and Don't Change are usually mentioned (and rightly so). However, To Look At You, Here Comes, and Black and White help make this one of the best whole albums INXS ever made.

With decades of data on the stocks comprising the Dow Jones Industrial average, the authors recommended Total Return Portfolio Strategy is based on only 11 years of data (1987-1997).

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why to Buy This Book","review":"There is only one good reason to buy this book: it is required for your degree plan. It tries to cover instructional design and web based training, but does neither well. For example, Driscoll spends a lot of text explaining the difference between a Virtual Synchronous Classroom and a Virtual Asynchronous Classroom. She describes each in great detail. The difference: in the first, all students participate simultaneously; in the second, they participate at their own convenience. For instructors, the difference lies in the amount of time spent monitoring the class. Other topics are chunked to the point of becoming meaningless.After six years of higher education and 10 years training adults, this is only the second book I have ever wanted to sell at the end of a semester....END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

I think that the Colonel Bogey march was the number one march of any major Marine base that I was stationed at, and that many a Marine has marched to it.

He has polished this role into one of his signature characters. He will hold your interest. But the rest of the movie cannot keep up. You get lost in the movie's inability to smoothly span it's large scope. A young Russell Wong (Prophecy II) gives it his best shot as an up-and-coming Triad boss.

The later tracks, like in all FF games, suffer from being mainly remixed versions of the first songs, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.

The sharpening steel that comes with the set works magnificently, when they do need a touch-up. Why did I buy this additional knife to add to my set? The most obivious reason of all--my wife likes it! Do get a bamboo cutting-board, it won't mar the knives and is hard enough to resist scratches. I got mine at Big Lots.

They are excellent cutting tools, but the overall quality is truly NO BETTER than any other knife of the same cost.

I had trouble deciding between this and the slightly-longer \\"sandwich knife.\\"It turns out that we use this knife more than the other three combined. It's a very useful size with good balance and feel.

The bar code on the back of the boxed knife I received lists it as a Utility Knife. I am sure it is a nice knife, but it isn't what I wanted or ordered.

I acquired them one or two at a time, always on sale, because this cutlery has been an expensive investment. When Wüsthof added a tomato knife to this line, I bought it even though I wasn't sure if I would like it or use it a lot. Now I recommend this 5-inch tomato knife to everyone. Its serrated edge hasn't needed sharpening ever, and it cuts, slices, dices, and chops fresh tomatoes so quickly. The forked tip is great for taking out the stem ends of tomatoes. I've never used my tomato knife on anything other than tomatoes, which is why I think it has stayed so sharp. I use my 8-inch serrated bread knife for slicing bagels and breads, and my 5-inch serrated utility knife for cutting citrus and other fruit. Also, I hand-wash and dry this knife and keep it stored in a wooden block."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp","review":"This knife is incredibly sharp.

All the same, the book leaves me puzzled, perhaps he means the reader to unravel everything himself or am I reading too much into it. For example, the description of skin colours of Jasper, Johnny, Snow, Kunichika, Peter just seems a little too much, therefore I'm wondering if he's hinting about Jasper's identity in all this. And I still don't know how and why Peter betrayed Johnny when they were such good friends before the war. What was the secret that he told Kunichika about Johnny that he didn't already know (that Johnny was a communist). Peter's betrayal so consumed him that he never met with Johnny again.

Like a well woven tapestry you must stand back to see the big picture, but it is when you get up close and see the fine details that you begin to appreciate its intricacies. There are some loose threads, just as in life. I loved the realities in this book.I found the beginning a bit slow moving, but it quickly picks up with Snow's diary entries. The story, characters and locales keep you interested. The final segment, told by Peter, brings it all together.I think Aw's use of a garden metaphor in the end is brilliant - the transplanting of \\"non-native\\" species, because in one way or another that's exactly what each character was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Overall","review":"Well, this has to be the best of the first season of Sailor Moon.

The voice acting is so bad that I nearly burst out laughing at the climax! Watching this violated anime, my advice to you is BUY ONLY UNEDITED, UNCUT, SUBTITLED VERSIONS! As far as I know, the only thing in english that fits that description are the soon-to-be released Sailormoon R, S, and SS video versions, or (semi-legal) fansubs.

It isn't a cartoon, it's ANIME. ANIME! To fully appreciate the series, you really need to see it in the original Japanese with English subtitles.

These fixtures are super heavy, nicely finished castings with a full glass inner globe that will not deteriorate like plastic over several years. The box of 6 weighed over 21 lbs so that puts each fixture at about 3 lbs each. These are all 110v lamps, so these have to be wired using household voltage and either conduit in the ground or underground feeder wire, but if you use either CFL or LED bulbs off a cheap photocell switch, you can have a dusk to dawn system that will use less current than the typical wired low voltage setup.

While the effort of the author has to be honoured to cover such a wide range of topics, practically all topics are treated in a rather shallow way, and some information, for instance on UML notation, is wrong.

It is one of the shortest of all the courses in the Colloquial series. Given the fact that English is more closely related to almost any European languages that to Estonian, this book never stands a chance of teaching you Estonian. Parts of the pronunciation. especially concerning the difference between -b, d, g- , -p, t, k- and -pp, tt, kk, is never explained despite being crucial to the grammar of Estonian. Get this one wrong and you won't be understod. Due to the shortness of the book, the vocabulary you'll learn is not that extensive and the grammar explanations are too short for you to get a real understanding of Estonian grammar. As one of the best language courses in any language, the Estonian Textbook by Juhan Tuldava, is also available from Amazon, I would definiely recommend you to consider buying that course instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I am very upset with this book and especially with the cassettes, these are not even native estonian speakers!!!

The reader is immediately introduced to useful phrases and along the way some interesting aspects of Estonian that an intermediate or advanced student would appreciate. Not a bad book considering several other attempts which plunge the reader into advanced material. The speakers on the cassette sounded like real Estonians and not \\"foreign Estonians\\" i.e. \\"välis eestlased\\" with western accents so common in books/cassettes of this type. One might consider 'Estonian for beginners\\" put out by Estonian Learning Materials Council of Estonian Societies in Australia in 1984.

Another excellent approach is \\"Estonian Textbook\\" by Juhan Tuldava."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating - and not just because it's a tough language","review":"A very frustrating book. No, there's not much in the way of English language Estonian textbooks to compare to, but as compared to textbooks for other languages, this doesn't stack up. The explanations are inadequate, and most passages are only partially translated. The tapes are very nice to have - similar resources on the internet are spoken much more quickly.

I wouldn't recommend this CD unless if you want the 3 new Foreigner songs like Soul Doctor, Prisoner of Love and With Heaven on our Side, fortunately the songs are unedited unlike the other compilations which is the reason why this CD gets 4 stars, where else would you find unedited versions of Double Vision, Waiting For a Girl Like You, Feels Like the First Time, Urgent and I Don't Want to Live Without You?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection!!!","review":"Actually very good! all greatest songs are in.

The principal character, a 'twenty-something Belfast wine merchant' (presumably a reference to his ability to shift vast quantities of booze) displays the kind of personal qualities under duress one might normally associate with a Tom Sharpe antihero (with perhaps a touch of Lucky Jim).

Always funny--the Christians are always good natured and great, but the sinners are judgemental. Of course the kid wins a great victory and dies; the rancher will come to Christ after he struggles with his own nature (he doesn't want to help that kid because he is not a Christian and the kid is bald). There is the moment of course where everyone will shave their heads to make the cancer kid feel good. A heart-warming moment every 5 minutes or so, and it make me sick.

Enemy AI is moronic - on one level a terrorist did not notice a grenade exploding a few feet away. What really makes this game stink is the sound; it's just awful.

I would say that Bucaille has tried to lead many closed minds to become more shut. Whereas, Dr.Campbell has opened many of those closed minds with the clear light of truth again. Furthermore I also agree with the previous reviewer that theres a lot errors and mistakes in The Koran scientifically, historically and factually!

If you can't figure out why this is about the only book ever recommended dealing with Science in relation to Islam and Christianity, then you might care to think for a moment whether it's because there is little or no evidence for the assertations that the author makes. It is merely an ad hominem argument which makes use of the Muslim dogma that the Qu'ran is a miracle. If the Qur'an contained such marvelous nuggets of scientific knowledge, then I would expect a lot more nobel prizes coming out of Saudi Arabia.

A great fit for cutting small fruits and veggies on a small cutting board. You know what it's like when you pull out your second cutting board and it's small, and and your only other serrated knife is the big bread one.2. Love to cook and also party and this knife makes prep work for any party a breeze - cutting roma and cherry tomato's, lemon's and limes, onions, grapes, olives and also any other items that can be small but slippery.3. Also works great on chopping veggies in which the skin has started to get soft.

Here they have escaped to a wooded area that surrounds London and are gulping down campers and hikers as well as rural townfolk. Herbert's vignette laced narrative is a deceptive breeze to read, for it makes the blood curdling attacks, of which there are quite a few, all the more effective. Animal attack fans should need no encouraging to hunt this down, but others will find something to enjoy as well. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry textbook + cartoons","review":"Whenever I try reading this book my eyes just gloss over. It's extremely dry material with cartoons added to every page to make it seem as if it'll be entertaining and easy to learn from but IMO it's neither. On the contrary, it would probably be best as a reference book. Almost every page has a new equation or symbol on it and I rarely felt that they were adequately discussed. \\"What does it do? When is it useful? What does it mean if the value is high/low?\\" are questions I constantly asked myself and the book doesn't take the time to answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated for the average person to understand!","review":"After reading the reviews on this book, I purchased it, thinking it would be helpful in clarifying research and basic statistical concepts for me (it's been years since my college statistics courses). Most reviewers seemed to imply that the book presented statistical concepts in ways that would be easy for the average person to understand. However, I found it to be complicated and difficult! I was disappointed in this book, because I struggled to get through it and still don't know any more about general statistical principles than I did before I read it. The book uses numerous mathematical equations without clear enough explanations, which left me totally perplexed. Perhaps the contents and explanations are clear to mathematicians and statisticians, but I think the average person will have a difficult time understanding the content of this book and deriving any benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Stupid but IS Complicated","review":"If you're looking for \\"Statistics for Dummies\\" style simplicity, don't think you'll find it here! Although it looks as though it will be a more accessible introduction to statistics, it's not. The cartoons are OK, and some are informative; but most of the explanations are no simpler than you would find in a good introductory stats text, and are often more complex and less accessible or informative. As someone who regularly teaches statistical concepts to adults (many of whom are certifiably mathophobic), I have to say that I would NOT recommend this to any of my students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the feint of heart","review":"Some people will complain that the book is difficult and/ or uninteresting.

It was intended as a supplementary text to help out with the class. It starts out with some basic concepts and explains them enough to understand. The cartoons are cute, and there is not so much info on each page that it takes intensive reading. However, there is not much explanation or background material either, so I can't imagine a statistics newbie getting much after the first few chapters. I am grasping all the concepts in class very well, but when I read the Cartoon Guide to Statistics I am lost! As someone with a pretty good mind for math and logic, I don't understand how others get much out of this book unless they are already familiar with the concepts.The book itself is nicely done - good illustrations, easy to handle size.

I wish I'd discovered this book after I'd been through the first formal class--except it wasn't written then. :) Well anyway, the CGtS is a useful book and I've recommended it to many people, all of whom got a fair amount of mileage from it. You certainly need further references, but the examples are lucid and the silly cartoons help keep people from getting too overwhelmed by seriousness. I also like the fact that the authors go through some of the history of statistics, as the subject is much more comprehensible if you know why people did what they did.Someone mentioned getting SPSS--this is, IMO, a terrible way to learn the topic. Packages should come AFTER understanding, not the other way around. If you want a computer program to help out, use a spreadsheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"Even though the cartoons made it a little more interesting than a regular text book, the text itself was about the same. I had hoped for different terms and better visual explanations. It also uses some terms I had not hear before. It also seems to be an old edition, hence the few terms I hadn't heard before. I would not recommend this book for purchase to anyone but if borrowing from a friend or teacher it would be worth the time to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-study? Try looking elsewhere","review":"Cartoons definitely make the subject of statistics seem less-intimidating. I bought this book for self-study and found it difficult to follow. Though the cartoons made me smile at times, I was unhappy with the lack of material substance. For instance, equations and topics are thrown out there with little explanation on how they were derived. On multiple occasions, I looked for supporting information that wasn't there.

The cartoons in \\"The Cartoon Guide to Statistics\\" are very well drawn and are humorous and witty. But, since so much page space must be given to the cartoons, there is insufficient text to explain the concepts. Very frequently, you will read \\"It's not hard to see that...\\" right before a formula with no other help as to how we arrived at this. For those hoping for a good review of statistics and probability to brush up or learn for the first time, \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Statistics\\" is far superior. It fully explains all of the concepts and how various formulas are derived with easy to follow examples. The content is almost identical and you will end up with a much better grasp of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for the math phobic student","review":"I have found this book to be a helpful supplement for the math phobic student who must take a course in statistics or use statistics.

It's almost not theoretical at all, but it gives an overall glimpse of what one could study in an introductory undergraduate course on statistics and probability theory. I highly recommend this book for people considering that kind of courses or people who want to review the material in a \\"new\\" and funny way! If you're going to learn more statistics later I'd recommend other more theoretical books to read on the side, it also work fine to check online for other sources. There is only one thing this book needs(beside not being theoretical enough), and that is exercises for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cartoon Guide to Statistics","review":"I really am enjoying this book and it puts the humor factor into struggling through a Statistics class at a local university.

The original is stunningly spare and simple in its prose, like Beckett or Pinter but without even their levels of affectation. Yet each sentence glistens. Passing moments, events, sounds, emotions are caught with precision and soul. The microtomed slices of life thus presented accumulate somehow into a profound, deeply moving, yet unsentimental esthetic whole. With this work, Reza reveals yet another dimension to her very considerable Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth finding even though out of print","review":"This novel is one of the most harrowing, troubling,yet fascinating reads I've yet to encounter. William Katz proves that he is a fine author. A brilliant artist teams up with a troubled plastic surgery med student and bring new technology and stunning perfection to the faces of world superstars - with a catch. Not to be missed. The ending will startle you. Not for the squeamish but only because the attention to detail about surgical procedures is extreme. Beautifully written, you won't forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usual High Quality from Wusthof","review":"You can only slice crunchy crusts with a serrated blade.

It failed to mention some excellent restaurants in Albuquerque including The Dog House, Las Mananitas, Il Vicino, etc. In Santa Fe I attended a class at the Santa Fe School of Cooking which was a five star class - not mentioned in the guidebook. In Taos I visited a community of alternative homes constructed of tires and cement (earthships.com will explain more) - again not mentioned in the book. I did go to look at a ruin near Espanola that was recommended, but the reservation does not allow admittance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise yet informative.","review":"The Lonely Planet Guides are simply the best travel books available.

Unfortunately I can't wipe it off because it's a raw wood the substance was soaked into the grain. I don't even want to play the instrument it smells so bad. I don't know how they can get away with saying this is lemon oil. I see no ingredients listing on the bottle so who knows what it's actual made of.If you're looking for lemon oil, buy lemon oil.

Talisa Soto, while nice to look at \\"runs the gamut of emotions from A to B\\" (thank you Dorothy Parker).

He is one of the funniest authors I have read. I read this book many years ago and when I saw it was an e-book, I had to have it. Thanks, Amazon. Van is both witty and clever in his telling of this hilarious tale about these men and the effusive, amazing Evelyn who turns out to be Eve and Lynn, the one woman both men, Simon and Stuart are dating but don't know it. Their antics are crazy and humorous and you don't know who you want to root for. And still, although she's playing both men, you can't be mad at Eve or Lynn or whoever you want to call her. She could teach us all a few things about how the game is played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enjoyable book of his ;-)","review":"I've read most of Van Whitfields books and I've loved each one I've read. He's funny, honest and has a really good writing style that makes it easy to read and makes it flow well.This book is hilarious. Simon is ready to settle down after getting sick of dating when he runs into one of his ex-girlfriends and decides to try and win her back again. His best friend Stuart is trying anything but to get married but he also finds an ex and starts up an old relationship again.I can't give away anything else because it's something you've got to read for yourself (you'll love it), but it's well written and really enjoyable. I love the 60-Day Relationship Rule For Guys in the front of the book. Very funny.This is a great book and you'll see how addictive his stories are.

It was often hard to distinguish which of the two characters were narrarating because their voices at times could be very similar.

The ending was cute but the point of the story did not seem strong enough to me to base a book around it. The two main characters in the book are extremely immature. Example when Stuart (the suave guy) has to follow a list of things to say to a girl on a date. What type of suave guy can't even hold a conversation without a list to accompany them. They don't know how to act around woman and I hate reading books where the main characters are weak. Most of the stunts pulled in the book are very unbelievable and I didn't find the book very funny.

John Cullum who took over having played a supporting role in \\"Camelot\\" for Alan Jay Lerner, and was a durable replacement, who went on to many leading roles in musicals including the current \\"Urinetown\\" in NYC. Secondly \\"On a Clear Day\\" was produced by Robert Goulet and his partner Norman Rosemont, who had the ROGO Productions partnership. Mr. Goulet of course rose to stardom while performing in \\"Camelot\\",and for years did road show versions of \\"On A Clear Day\\".

I love ballads, I think most shows have too few ballads, but this show makes me wish for more group songs. It's no wonder this show gets so little attention, it just isn't worth it. I think this show might be a good show for community theaters, and high schools, although there are some questionable themes for younger audiences. I don't think this is a CD anyone would listen all the way through. In today's world a listener would only want one or two songs from this CD. I am suggesting that you buy \\"Wait Till We're 65\\" and \\"Come Back to Me\\" other than that, not worth it.

As the story ends peace is NOT breaking out -- the heroes have become players in an enemy plot to kill high-ranking Earth military figures,but have rescued a number of Earthers who had been held captive for some time. Some of our heroes have died, but a couple remain. There's enough left so that someone could blow on the embers and relight this one!

Fairly typeset characters at the beginning grow and become engaging. The plots are goods. The effects well done, and the physics far more reasonable than most except for the wormholes. When this show and the X-Files premiered together it was one of the few times I would go out of my way to spend an evening in front of the TV. I really would have liked a couple of more seasons of this one.The quality of the DVDs is excellent with the exception of the use of two sided DVDs. I fail to understand the motivation of the studios to still use this.

It had a great cast and characters that were honest and believable. It's a shame that the network had to pull the plug on such a promising program.

For example in one episode they have a progressive politician advocating civil rights for all vs. a right wing strong man. In the end the progressive is found to be leading a conspiracy to commit murder. This didn't fit the character's values except, perhaps, in some right wing fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than half worth your time","review":"The good episodes were a 4 star; however, the rest were a 1 star.

The second episode is downright unplayable for a good 5 minutes unless you're watching on a progressive scan dvd player. The first disk even has 4.5 hours of video on it (compared to the industry standard 3), which noticeably reduces image/sound quality on my tv/ss system.

It's neither good enough to make you care nor bad enough to make you laugh; it's down in the unenjoyable valley with Robot Jox.One would expect people writing a military sci-fi show to, for example, understand the use of the word \\"niner\\", or know that a light year is not a unit of time.I'm a sucker for science fiction, and I have a completion hangup, but I still couldn't finish watching this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it","review":"I am a huge fan of sci-fi, love Firefly and was hoping to find something interesting like it. I was hugely dissapointed. I tried to overlook the wooden acting because some of the characters had potential, but the writing got worse and worse each episode. The dialog was unbelievably banal and predictable. And so were the storylines. After getting painfully through the \\"River of Stars\\" episode (on disk 3), I finally gave up. That one was the last straw for me. I really cannot recommend this series to anyone except perhaps to the fans of the movie Starship Troopers 3. I know they are out there....somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series was great - DVD disks are crap","review":"I loved this series. Boy, I wish I could see it again. The disks sent to me are crap: the pilot episode was fine until the end credits, when it froze; the next episode won't play at all. Crap!Update: Amazon replaced the set and it plays well. I read elsewhere on the Web that the DVD manufacturer for this set is not the best. Love the series. The pilot is hard to take, then the series just gets better and better. \\"Who Monitors the Birds?\\" and \\"River of Stars\\" are B+ movie quality, the first may even be an A. I too am a Firefly fan. Check out this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gift for a friend","review":"I purchased this set as a gift for a friend. I knew that he was a big fan of the show when it originally aired, and thought that this would be a nice gift for him as he doesn't often indulge himself with DVDs and such.I had watched this show when it first aired, but remembered little of it. I wound up watching the first few episodes with him.Overall, it is alright. Nothing really stands out in this show, and all of the performances are b-rate at their best. I only suggest getting this if you already are a fan and want it all. Look to something else if you want to try something new"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Finally on DVD, had originally had them on video tape so was delighted when brought out on DVD, great show, plenty of action"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Above and Beyond","review":"One of the best no punches pulled ,, a almost real look at what war and life could be like in a 150 years or so..

Innovative shows that aren't about sex or sophomoric humor have little chance of making another season.That being said, this is a superb and engaging series where one becomes truly involved with the characters and is worth watching over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Above and Beyond","review":"I always wondered what happened to this series. It is one of the best made for TV sci-fi series ever. The social issues they dealt with were reminiscient of Star Trek of the sixties.

But, FOX time slotted it wrong and like all networks that screw that up point at interest in the show. If you don't like SCI/FI this will probably change that. If you like SCI/FI this will probably make you love it and run down to join the USMC. Okay, I'm exaggerating a little...It truly was a work of SCI/FI art. And please don't compare it to those horrible Starship Trooper movies. I would love to bitch slap the people who made those. Buy this you won't regret it! I honestly think, put in the right time slot and the severe beating of the Starship Troopers movie makers, this show could have seriously hurt the Star Trek series of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Series!","review":"This was one of Fox's first good series that they canceled (Married with Children would probably be the first). This series was very well done and had a great, gritty feel to it. I loved space marines. It was like a TV series with Quake/Doom/Halo characters in it. It had a good concept and great story. The actors weren't that bad either.One gripe I had about the set as a whole is the lackluster packaging job that Fox did on the DVDs. Fox didn't even spare the extra few cents to print extra DVDs, and instead printed DVDs double-sided. The inserts are lame too. The show had a huge cliff-hanger of an end to the first and only season. I guess we'll never know what happened with all those stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Above and Beyond - The Complete Series","review":"Great show that never got the attention is deserved. From the best writers and producers of the X files and Millenium, came Space: Above and Beyond.The show had a great sotryline, and thankfully was finished off becasue they knew there show was being cancelled.Only problem with the dvd is the mistake they made in producing it. The title screen has a picture of Babalyon 5 space station! Why? I do not know, but its pretty funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful show, call Fox for replacement on bad disc","review":"The show is as excellent as I remember. It's like Aliens: the TV series done right and I highly recommend it. The performances are great, the leads likable, and the effects stack up even now.If you purchase this title and the first disc is bad, Fox is going to send us replacement discs when they can press them.

First the product: no extras and my last disc was a bad disc, and you only have a limited time for returns so I lose. Examine your discs upon arrival. Second, this show is juvenile at best. The physics are bad, the visual effects are dated (bad even by those standards), the plots are trite, and the acting is okay with exceptions both ways. Of course everyone reviewing it complains about the lack of an ending, and though I agree it would be nice to know, it was cancelled because it was bad.

Quality songs throughout; very electic selections. Covers of Moody Blues \\"Nights in White Satin\\" and Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" layered around original renderings. When is the last time you heard a band with an autoharp as a central instrument? Early Lovin' Spoonful? But, in terms of style here, think \\"It's a Beautiful Day,\\" with the nice trade-off of vocals between male and female leads. Oh, surely, nothing here is quite as good as \\"White Bird\\" but then again IABD never quite did anything else that superb either. Good stuff!! (PS the following information is courtesy of my friend Vic Ferri: Bermuda Triangle was formed by Roger Penney and Wendy Penney, who previous to Bermuda Triangle, had the band Euphoria, who had a hit called \\"You Must Forget\\".

Even with a set of Wusthof Classic Knives I found myself using my cheap serrated steak knifes for many cooking tasks because they're serrated for veggies and a good size for small work, but they are not good steel so I have to sharpen them often. I finally decided to get a good knife in that size and should have done it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"just right for many uses","review":"We've had this knife for a couple years and have now bought another one to give as a gift. It's wonderful and is used all the time, more than any other of our wusthof knives. With it's serrated edge it's great to grab and use because the blade doesn't need to be honed constantly and it stays super sharp. It's great for fruit, softer vegetables, small loaves of bread, slicing raw or cooked meat, and most anything else. It's just not the best choice for very large things or for hard vegetables. I also like the size, I have smaller hands and it's a very comfortable size to hold. The blade is just the right length for slicing through a whole apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"it broke after one year","review":"I really enjoyed using this knife. Until the blade broke in half while I was slicing some (boneless) roasted meat. I did not use any excessive pressure. All in all, the knife lasted a bit longer than a year. I think a knife at this price range should be more durable than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts well but rusted","review":"After entirely TOO much time spent researching which knives to go with (Wustof or Henckels), I went with Wustof on recommendation from a Williams-Sonoma staff person. While the blade cuts nicely and does its job, the construction left a lot to be desired. I had the knife thru two washings and saw rust building up between the handle and full tang of the blade. Now, it's possible I have a lemon, but when I'm spending $50 per knife, I don't want to see anything really wrong with it. I don't want to be responsible for poisoning any dinner guests with rust! I bought the single knife to test whether I'd want the whole set, and well, it doesn't look like I'll be splurging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for sausages!","review":"Funny that this is a \\"sausage\\" knife, but having traveled to Germany, I guess I understand....This is a fantastic multi-purpose knife well-suited for cutting tomatoes & other fruits, sandwiches, bread & rolls.

Good product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as pictured","review":"The product I received was not as well made as the picture. It was simply only one piece elastic with a closure sewed into two loops. This new change to the product causes it to ride up the back all the way to the neck and since there isn't the diagonal give as in the photo, the hook and eye also wants to undo itself. It does keep the shoulders back for a while, but needs to be repositioned after about an hour, it is not something that is easily worn all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This product is more of a \\"reminder\\" than a posture corrector. First, you need to wear a shirt of some kind WITH SLEEVES under it or it will chafe. If it isn't tight enough, it's worthless. If it is tight enough, sometimes it rides up in the back, and it's visible from behind.

It has give, which is fine, and it did remind me to push my shoulders back. It was uncomfortable, so I wore it over my shirt around the house, or in between shirts if I was going out. I expected a brace of this nature to be somewhat uncomfortable. The reason I don't like it is because if I forgot and slouched again, the brace rode up to my neck, and I'd have to reach up and pull it back down. I was always adjusting it. I experimented with wearing it upside down also, thinking I wasn't wearing it right. It's a great idea, and I'll keep looking for a brace, but this one is not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"support for shoulders","review":"This is not a good product.

It was just what I was looking for, it's easy to use; I had surgery which left my right side... let's just say I can't flex my right arm as it normaly would. So, when I first got it I told my husband he would have to help me put it on. One day when he wasn't home I tried it, it works increadable well, I wash dishes in it.. it's very flexable. But, I just started wareing it so I only use it in the house. After I take it off, I'm more aware of my posture, it does get a little uncomfortable after a while, in my arm pit area. But, I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone out there, looking for support, at a decent price. By the way, I weight over 200lbs & it fits me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too helpful.","review":"These are not too helpful and kind of painful. They come in one size fits all, so you many have to cut part of it or else you have 6 loops hanging from the back.

Baekkelund and Gruner-Hegge simply let the concerto\`s poetry flow by itself, without any obvious, pretentious mannerisms by the players and Baekkelund himself. The adagio is a careful study of hushed beauty and delicacy. I dare not even breathe when I listen to the whole movement. The final movement\`s last dozen or so notes wrest your soul into the heavens, which no other recording of this concerto has ever done.Of the very many piano concerto performances I own, this one is unequivocably the BEST ONE.

And it is true that constance is needed. But it is impossible to read japanese without knowing kanji, and it is very difficult to learn kanji with a normal textbook. I kept forgetting strokes and stroke orders, and the reason for it was that I didn't see kanji like a logic system, but more like a more or less difficult drawing. There are many kanji that look nearly the same, but once you study this book, these small differences become impossible to mistake.I am studying this book in spanish, but I've seen in english it's just the same, that's why I am reviewing this kanji study book. :) it has helped me so much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Approach","review":"The only thing this book is good for is identifying the roots of little kanji that fit into big kanji. btw, this is not educational, it's just interesting. There are WAY too many kanji of esoteric words. this would move the 2000 kanji down to about 500 or so.Also, the definitions are in english. This is completely the wrong way to learn, you should learn the japanese word for it and then learn what that japanese word means, it's much more useful to relate it to japanese, then you would think in japanese, and not in english. the whole point of learning a new language is to think in a new way, not to fall back on english every step of the way.Finally, most of the stories are ridiculously stupid. and I find it offensive how a good number of them refer to the bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks an important element in studying kanji....","review":"This book has some good examples to help you remember Kanji. HOWEVER what good is trying to learn kanji when the book doesn't even tell you how the word is actually pronounced. In this book you get the Kanji character and what the character means in English, but it fails to tell you how the word is pronounced in Japanese. It doesnt even have to be written in Hiragana or Katakana, Romaji would do. But there is nothing to show you how the word is read. I find this to be a -huge- flaw in a book that is supposed to help you learn Kanji.Instead look into purchasing Kanji Pict-O-Graphix, a much better choice in Kanji learning and comprehension.

I remember some of the first kanji introduced were conclave and convex. Why? A total waste of time. Get Henshall's book Remembering the Kanji - it is far superior!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You learn to read Kanji but not Japanese","review":"Compounds! That's Japanese. Learning individual Kanji is effectively a waste of time because the most important stuff is the compounds of two Kanji. Think if you know 2000 words then you have the vocab of your average 2 year old. It's through combining Kanji that you become proficient and for that you need about 1000-1200 to cover 80-90% of Japanese.My recommendation is to get very good at the first 600 and their compounds. You'll either have given up by this point or you'll have found many other superior books :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"Yes, the simple meaning of each kanji is presented (in unbearably saccharine prose), but there is absolutely no indication of the Japanese pronunciation. Perhaps useful if you never intend to speak the language, but useless if you are trying to learn the actual words associated with each character.

Scott Ciencin knows how to write the characters and has a good grasp of the show's vernacular, but he is less successful at crafting a compelling story. Most annoying, he gives Arianna an ability that would allow her to easily resolve the tension and uncertainty that torments her, yet provides an excuse for not exercising it that is very flimsy and contrived.

First, the dimples do not prevent vegetables from sticking to the blade as promised. I found that potatoes and other vegetables were just as likely to adhere to the blade as they would with a traditional chef's knife. Second, this knife lacks what Wusthof calls a finger guard. On a traditional chef's knife this is the piece of steel that bulges out at the end of the blade near the handle. The finger guard serves two purposes, it protects the index finger and it adds heft and stability to the blade. Because this knife doesn't have a finger guard, the blade seems somewhat flimsy and unstable. I much prefer a chef's knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely top quality","review":"I doubt if anyone ever regretted buying Wusthof. Beautiful knives of the best quality.

Also, at first I was concerned this knife wouldn't be satisfactory because it's really really light. But, it's as stiff as can be and super sharp. The blade does go right up to the corner near your hand--many blades are purposely dulled in that area (maybe that's the way this sort of knife is supposed to be). Other than those minor concerns, the knife is really great. Definitely worthy of 5 stars.

She has appreciated it, but I am surprised to discover that it is increasingly the knife I reach for most for slicing and dicing.

My previous fav 6 inch Chef knife feels a bit neglected.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but be careful.","review":"Without question this is one of the best kitchen products I own. I've had it for several years and use it mostly for thin slicing soft roasted meats and raw veggies on a wood cutting board.. It is wonderfully weighted and balanced, and has held a razor edge. If you're new to cooking, or good knives just remember to pay close attention to what you're doing. This knife is crazy sharp. I wasn't paying very close attention to what I was doing and this knife reminded me by slicing about half way through my finger with hardly any force behind it.

Of my entire knife set, my Wusthof Santoku is by far my favorite. The balance and how light it is as well as how well it fits into my hand makes it the perfect knife for cleaning the rhines of fruits, creating finely diced vegetables, or anything else that requires a lot of control. You can chop, rock, or use any type of cutting technique with this knife well, and I have absolutly no complaints about it.Obviously, for some things a heavier knife is required, and for that I have a Wusthof classic chef's knife, but I still use this more than any other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Japanese","review":"There is no substitute for Japanese steel.

Sharp, well balanced, light but not flimsy, it is probably the most versatile knife in the collection. The Santoku is able to chiffonade herbs and then carve up a tough skinned pineapple with ease. Although in constant use in our house, it holds its edge and only needs a little dressing with the steel from time-to-time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great knife","review":"This is the second knife that I have purchased and I have actually purchased a third as a gift. The first knife I damaged cutting through some frozen meat and though with some gentle hitting on the top of the blade that it would go through that bone. I did but bent the blade slightly and my wife always points it out to me. So this year I bought her a new knife with the scolloped sides. This is turning out to be the best knife ever and she is very happy with it and uses it for everything. Now the other knife is going in our camping gear because we need a really good knife out there too. I am seriously thinking about replacing all of our steak knife with the too. I could be more satisfied, and do highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost everything it says...","review":"This is an excellent kitchen knife; it does indeed cut thin slices beautifully and is a good substitute for a small chef's knife. It takes and holds a good edge, and it does a great job of preparing ingredients for stir-fry.However, let it be said that if you are buying this knife mostly because of the promise that food won't cling to it, you will be somewhat disappointed. Food does not cling to it quite as much as it does to other knives, but you will still be clearing the blade while slicing and chopping anything but the driest of foods. And take care; I am an experienced cook with many sharp knives I handle safely, but I've cut myself slightly on this one a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Watch","review":"I bought this watch as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.

I realize that many things work better in print than they would in film and that sacrifices have to be made in any screenplay adaptation, but the majority of the novel is told from Thor's point of view and is about his reaction to this bizarre situation that only he is aware of but cannot understand.

Michael Pare stars as Ted, an out of work photographer who becomes a werewolf when he is infected with lycanthropy in South America. After the attack, he moves back to Oregon and his sister invites him to stay with her.While I liked the idea of Bad Moon, it suffered from some of the worse acting I've ever seen in a horror film. Ted and his sister's lines were abominable and were delivered with the emotional quality of vulcans. Plus, I thought the lengthy and involved sex scene in the movies opener rather unnecessary.I'm giving this movie 1 star. And that's being kind.

The film itself is pretty decent, with some unknowns and a fairly engaging plot, but the real treat is the big bad wolf. Although its lower torso is unconvincing in several scenes, its face is the most terrifying werewolf face i've ever seen. Its fangs are bared just like a rabid wolf's, and it always seems to have saliva frothing around its teeth. I would honestly s**t my pants if I ever saw this thing face-to-face, and I never grow tired of seeing it on screen.

Upon his return to Oregon, a forrest worker is attacked, and the photographer begins to suspect what he's become. When his sister invites him to stay with her, a battle begins...between the werewolf and the family guard dog. The werewolf suit is one of the best yet, and the acting is not bad at all.

His newest book is deceptively well-written. It makes you feel guilty about why you are not doing more to help your organization be successful and gives you the confidence to believe change is possible.He doesn't sugar coat the fact that building a strong corporate culture is tough. I especially liked his discussion on valuing candor and how seventy-nine cent of problems grow into big problems, wasting valuable time and energy. A few of his illustrations even made me laugh out loud. This isn't a long book, but it is one that you should re-read often, reflecting on insights. Have a pen handy. You will be jotting notes in the margin.\\"Janine McBee, Texas Credit Union League - Southwest CUNA Management School"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating a culture that generates results","review":"Length:: 1:49 MinsThis is a book that has some timeless principles, but also some counter-intuitive advice on how to turn those principles into results. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ways to outperform the competition","review":"How do companies such as Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines and General Electric (GE) repeatedly outperform the competition year after year? They have that corporate je ne sais quoi - that intangible organizational something - that allows them to raise the bar consistently and attain the exceptional status of being, in Randy Pennington's term, \\"Results Rule!\\" companies. These companies succeed because they never lose sight of their goals. They develop a corporate culture that becomes deeply embedded in their organizations and that influences decisions at every level. A company's corporate culture is the spring that nourishes it. Pennington fully describes corporate culture, but does not always convey how to breed it. This makes his practical, competitive advice a bit more challenging to apply. However, getAbstract considers his book very encouraging for those who want to use corporate culture and goal orientation to motivate achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left wanting more...","review":"Overall, I did enjoy reading this book. I'm not sure though that I would recommend it to a friend. I didn't feel a deep connection with any of the characters for the most part. I was intrigued to see what would end up happening, so I found it to be a page-turner. There was a lot of botany involved in which plants were referred to by their genus-species name. I don't feel that was a necessity to the main plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-D characters","review":"A few parts were interesting, but not enough to hold the story together. I strongly agree with the reviewer who said she didn't feel a deep connection to the characters. The character development was lacking. I won't be passing this on to anyone. A botanist might find it worth the price. I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a drummers video","review":"This is a video shot for drummers. In most cases the clips cut in directly as the drum solo starts and cut off when the solo ends. There are some great examples of solos by Rufus \\"Speedy\\" Jones, Joe Morello, Sonny Payne and others that don't get much attention anymore. Since this focuses on drummers from years gone by the video is a bit rough in places but that is only caused by age and the technology that was available when these clips were shot. The trade off is that you see film of people and drum solos that you would otherwise only hear on record. The Louie Bellson clip is really something. One clip will appeal to some non-drummers. The appearance of Buddy Rich on a 1955 Jerry Lewis show. A little corny but that was the style of the day. I would recommend this to drummers, especially ones who have or want to gain an appreciation of early jazz drummers and their syles."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be better footage than this?!","review":"I'm pretty disappointed with this video. For starters, I wish that Hudson Music could've provided better audio/video examples of Rufus \\"Speedy\\" Jones (poor audio), Elvin Jones (not enough), Sonny Payne (poor video) and Chico Hamilton (not enough). Maybe it wasn't possible to get better examples, but i don't see the point watching a video where it's next to impossible to make out Sonny Payne's stick-twirling display while he solos. I also wished that Hudson Music played a few bars of music from each act leading into the drum solo, rather than have the drum solo already underway as the video appears. The drum battles were very short and for the most part a waste (they almost always are). Highlights for me included the Buddy Rich (not the bit with Jerry Lewis), Louie Bellson, Joe Morello and Sam Woodyard solos. I'm glad i didn't pay the retail price for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's the difference Between this set and ASIN: B000026OW3","review":"I find that the item ASIN: B000026OW3 is cheaper than this set.

And the ramifications still reverberate today in the society.The book brilliantly uses text and drawings to vividly bring the facts surrounding slavery to life.

The book is mainly about either the plots to Angelina Jolie's movies, which aren't even accurate (looks like someone should have watched her movies before writing about her), directors and writers of the movies, or other people who have been in her life. I found myself skipping over pages due to the fact that it had nothing to do with Angelina at all. There would be entire portions that would be a few pages long and she would be mentioned maybe in a paragraph. It seems all the author did was take quotations from other magazines that have interviewed Angelina rather than interviewing Angelina herself.

Ellen's various guardians in the film deserve Nobel Peace Prizes in comparison to their characters in the book. Jena Malone as Ellen Foster did well for a TV-film actress, otherwise the acting was mediocre. The only people I would recommend this film to are those with kids (8-12) who can't bear the thought of reading and aren't likely to change their minds once they reach ages 13 and up; the book is a bit explicit for children under 13. Basically, you're comparing the book Oliver Twist to your typical small-screen/straight-to-video cheesy drama.

Also, the Wusthof emblem on the handles is just a cheap paper sticker that will fall off after a few passes through the dishwasher.Other than the handles breaking, I like the selection of tools for a casual cook like myself. The chef knife is a good size and shape, the bread knife works well, and the scissors are sharp, tough, and easy to clean. They could all probably hold a better edge, but I have found them easy to sharpen.Also, the knife block itself has three extra slots for other knives to be added, which is nice especially when the handles break on the originals.Conclusion: if not for the broken handles, I would be very satisfied and the value of this knife set.

The handles are okay & the blade goes through the grip as one piece. That and the block are the only quality features.

I was lucky enough to find this set on a Lightning Deal and only paid $89, but it's easily worth full price if you cook a lot. I just wish I hadn't waited so long to buy them!

The entire book takes place in the space of one of Nick's flashbacks, but the history feels well researched and the story is perhaps of even better quality than many on the tv show. The author does an excellent job with Elizabethian dialogue without making it too obscure for the modern reader; the characterization is also very accurate and the characters feel like they belong to the time in which the book is set, which can be a tricky thing to pull off when writing for characters whom the reader is accustomed to seeing in the modern world. For readers who are not familliar with the show, it is just a good book and does contain enough backstory to keep one from getting lost. This has been one of my favorite finds on Amazon this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it.","review":"This book is very hard to read. The whole book is old english and the plot is kinda boring. I couldnt get into it.

Some things never change as far as personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Unreadable","review":"I thought Susan Garrett's FK \\"fan novel\\" was so poorly plotted and written that I wondered how it ever got published and gave it a \\"2\\". But this novel-by-teamwork effort, \\"These Our Revels\\", was an unmitigated disaster and despite a serious go at getting through this monotonous, lifeless mess that had so little to do with the FK universe I inhabit daily, in the end I tossed it in the trash (around page 84, I believe). Won't someone--PLEASE!--write another good FK novel as that done by Susan Sizemore in \\"A Stirring of Dust\\"? I also highly recommend Nigel Bennett's delightful, engrossing novel,\\"Keeper of the King.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"One fun thing about Forever Knight is the way that Nick always weaves the past into the present. The whole \\"those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it\\". This book spent the entire time in the past so several characters were not able to appear. I also thought the book was way too carried away on putting \\"Thees and Thous\\" in and neglecting minor things like plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it...","review":"I hate to say this, but I really couldn't finish this book. I tried and tried, but it was just so uninteresting to me, I couldn't. Don't get me wrong - I'm a HUGE fan of Forever Knight and watch the series faithfully(okay, obsessively ;)), but this book just didn't appeal to me. I commend the authors for all of their incredible flashback research and all of the hard work they put into it, but in the end, the novel really had no plot. There wasn't as much Vachon/Nick interaction as I wanted, and I felt like it was just night after night after night in London, and no real point to the book than to show Nick was friends with William Shakespeare and he visited the Globe Theatre. That's all great, but.... where's the plot?I am in no way insulting the authors' writing ability, but I think there could have been more of a story within _These Our Revels_ and maybe some suspense and mystery. There was none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is a good especially for anyone linked with education, and wanting to know about the Ismailis.The book begins with a short history.

I thought the Reebok brand name would mean higher quality slippers than your typical cheap, licensed product. However, they developed a tear on the outer edge of the right slipper after only a few hours of wear around the house and in the garage.

My favorite's include Burgess Meredith and Kevin Conneff in \\"Don Oiche Ud im Beithel\\" and \\"Wren in the Furze\\".

The Bells of Dublin will sit in a place of honor in your own music collection if you decide to add this CD to your favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KW NH","review":"This CD is a strictly observed family tradition. I am very particular about my holiday listening and this is the first one played on Thanksgiving night and the last one back in the box when I take down the tree. In a world of done-to-death carols and relentless Xmas pop-schlock, this is so refreshing. Everything from Elvis Costello's hilarious \\"St. Stephen's Day Murders\\" to Jackson Browne's \\"The Rebel Jesus\\" is good-hearted, sincere and original after all these years. Some of us cry at \\"O Holy Night\\". I am deeply moved and inspired by \\"Once in Royal David's City\\" which was unknown to me before this. Also included is the best \\"Deck the Halls\\" ever. We always turn the volume way up at the mad clanging of the bells that begin and end the album and celebrate the Chieftans on such a fine outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chieftains Celebrate Christmas","review":"If you like Irish music and you like Christmas music, this CD is definitely for you.

True it's a holiday cd and it's all you expect: inspiring, comforting, humourous and familiar. It's also breath taking beautiful. Light the candles and cozy up; I've never found a better cd for the season BUT! I don't know how some people keep this for holidays only -- I play the Macgarriles and The Wren medley frequently just for a pick me up.I'm eternally grateful to the Chieftans for the musical education they've provided me throughout the years - amazing artists and this cd is a must if it's not in your holiday collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set of knives","review":"Good value for money, the handles are a little small but other that that they are a good set of knives, they seem to stay sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"If you are looking at steak knives, you are not happy with what you have now. These are the best, if it fits you budget. Good old fashion German made and technology. These are dish washer safe, not all Wusthof knives are dish washer safe. I wash them by hand anyway.

Did I mention she was the evil queen's sister?).I was reading some of the reviews on goodreads and saw that not many people liked this book, chiefly because they were bothered by the main character, the mirror. I was too. But only because I want people to be good. Always and from the begining. And the mirror wasn't. She had to manipulate people to get around (and who could blame her?). But she developed into a very love-able character.I don't know what it is about twisted fairy tales, but I love \`em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mira, Mirror","review":"This book was amazing!

There is little mystery, and Koch is constantly beating the reader over the head with the facts over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Teens Review","review":"I got this book because I was looking for a well writen yaoi manga not a novel with badly developed characters and almost no plot. The two main characters are constantly having sex and dont really have any other relationship between them. the few parts in the book without sex are just leading up to more of it and are badly written and short (not to mention shallow).There was one part that was almost well writen and ,yes, the sex is erotic if crude. However some of the phrases are used over more than once and it gets motonous. When l got \\"Torrid\\" l got it partially for the erotica but mostly because the reviews said it was well written but the plot lacked depth and so did the people in it and their relationship. The only reason l gave it two stars rather than one is because at least it was erotic if not well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torrid Illusion!","review":"I had very high hopes for this story, but I was greatly dissapointed. First of all the book is the size of your palm you can fit in your back pocket. The story was pretty fresh, but had many gaps. It felt not like an actual book, but something I'd find in fictionpress six chapters of flat storyline and one dimensional characters. There was no growth within the plot. I was dissapointed and felt as though I'd been ripped off. No one should buy this book for less than five dollars any higher and you're getting ripped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torrid Left Me Tepid","review":"I'm all for M/M romances, but perhaps this book's description was misleading. This is a tiny (literally) fictionalized manga novel with one main character (the dance guy) mostly clueless about everything, and the other character (the overbearing guy) totally on fast forward, need-to-mate mode for the main guy. Ms. Hawke has the ability to tell a story, but this was just too absurd for me.

It's fun and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Just hot men, spicy sex, a budding relationship, and a whole lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thoughtful, many ideas shared by a great author","review":"Actually I bought this book for strictly \\"scholar\\" reasons.

It is very comforting for almost any ache or pain from sore muscles to a stomach ache. I like being able to go to sleep using it without worrying about safety as I would with an electric heating pad.

My main reason for shelving Eaton's book is her reliance on schematics. Schematic drawings illustrate pattern instructions with symbols (not symbolcraft), arrows, lines, and numbers. Eaton does not provide a key of any kind to these drawings, which amazes me given that she assumes her readers need far more basic instruction in things like casting on. Neither Vogue Knitting nor any of my other comprehensive reference books was any help; a search of the Web turned up no instructions. I suppose it would be possible to puzzle the schematics out by carefully comparing the text instructions to the drawings and creating your own key. But I think that was Eaton's job. Frankly, I am now far too irritated by her oversight to reopen the book any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, wearable knits","review":"I've looked far and wide for good knits for kids and this book has them.

The grill is beautiful and just large enough to grill 4 average size steaks on it. Easy to clean and does not take up any room on the deck.

Those who have used both usually have a preference. My preference (and therefore bias you should know about) is for the Wusthofs.The Wusthof Culinar line is an all stainless steel look, rather than a black handle. Although the picture and some descriptions want you to think this is a single piece knife, be advised that the hand is a separate piece of stainless steel molded onto the tang. I personally prefer the handle of the Grand Prix and Classic, because the grip is surer for me, but this is, to some extent, a matter of personal preference. This series \\"looks\\" more professional to some (like a Viking stove).The Wusthof 4 inch utility knife is a great all-around knife. This is the knife I use for the majority of my small chopping work (when I don't use a Chef's knife)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful knife, long story","review":"Apologies to Amazon, but I got this knife new from an on-line auction (for 30 bucks) and here's the story. When I received it it had a noticeable wire edge on one side of the blade. (if you don't know the term, this results from the knife being over sharpened on one side) I spent a good 15 minutes with my Smiths sharpening system (check that out too) and achieved a superb edge.Now, the knife feels great in my hand and is outrageously useful. Good as a paring knife, I use it to make salads. It slices tomatoes, onions, carrots and peppers flawlessly. Works fine as a boning knife, makes a great steak knife, It's beautifully balanced, nice to look at, and my experience with Wusthof leads me to believe that it will hold its edge and last a long long time.If you have several knives, you'll still reach for this one often.

As someone else pointed out the best cut on the album is \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" BUT THE VERSION IN AMAZON'S SAMPLE IS NOT THE VERSION THAT WAS ON THE ORIGINAL RELEASE! This is important because that version is musical dynamite and because it had Sam & Dave coming on stage to join Otis in closing the song, bringing the house down (you can hear an already near-hysterical crowd go crazy when they come out to join him).

Maybe they could have tried just a bit harder, or perhaps cared about the actual show than the 'TV Y' rating. Ugh. If anyone actually wishes to see Sailormoon as it is, avoid DIC's pile of garbage. Go find some fansubs of the real, uncut show as it appeared in Japan. You'll enjoy it a lot more.I believe it's terrible that companies rush to buy the rights to an anime and then try to be unnecessarily politically correct by completely chopping up what once might have been a very entertaining show. It's happened with Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon (DIC's looking to slice and dice the S season), it's happened with Card Captor Sakura, and it's likely to happen with Escaflowne and anything else that comes over here. I really wish someone would look to the quality of the show which they are translating instead of looking for maximum profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zocite gets the red crystal","review":"Listen,this Sailor Moon tape was graet,although you ever thought of making tapes with the other rainbow crystals,and if you do,Send me a copy of A Artful Attack,and Too Many Girlfriends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they have to change a character's gender?","review":"I gave this video 2 stars because they changed a character's gender(Zoisite was a male in the original).

Or even newer bands like Iced Earth or Blind Guardian... I'm sure you're aware that the sound Dream Theater makes is VERY different.While I personally prefer bands like Iron Maiden (their riffs are more crunching, their vocals are much better and their songs are altogether more energetic and fun), I still liked 'Awake' by Dream Theater quite a bit. The first instrumental track is VERY impressive. So is 'Innocence Faded', which is my second favorite track.I think this heavier style of Dream Theater's is a much better starting point than 'Scene from a Memory' or anything by Opeth for Meal fans such as myself.So if you're new to Progressive Metal, I recomend trying this first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of progressive metal","review":"A great album that is consistently excellent through virtually every song.

Of special note are the heavy, intense \\"Mirror\\" and the very moving closer \\"Space-Dye Vest.\\" Absolutely essential metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing too much and making music suffer","review":"Dream theater is a band of amazing musicians, but music suffers when they try show off their every little skill all at the same time. That's the problem with Awake: too much playing compromising the natural flow of the melodical lines, excessively intrincate harmonies deviating attention from their wonderful basic music ideas and lyrics. If only they had step back their playing just a bit, this would have been a serious candidate to top any rock album of the decade review list."},{"rating":"2","title":"How dense are you people?...","review":"I know this is the internet and emotions don't convey very well but you have to be a freaking moron not to be able to pick up the sarcasm in MTV Rocks reviews (go read his other reviews, he's obviously a fan that knows what he's talking about)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Significant","review":"First of all, i cant understand why most... bash Dream Theater for they're attempts to showcase talent and musicanship.

Now, when... musicians decide to pick at every aspect of dream theater's compositions, then judging them ultimately for a demeanor that was bias from the very beginning...As for Awake, and all the rest of dream Theaters albums...I really cant put it more plainly as to say this IS REAL music. Dream Theater envokes mood swings, joyfulness, and adrenelene throught every cd they produce. Listening to the cd, i derive these emotions simply by LISTENING to the cd as a person...and not as an analytical and miserable little musican. Also, I suppose Bach didnt have the SOUL to play like steve ray, or eric clapton, so he must be masterbatory.(maybe its that pentatonic scale...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, don't do it!","review":"This album is horrible. Just horrible.I suppose it depends on what kind of 'Metal' you're looking for. If you want a return of Queensryche in some form then this album will suit you. But, if you are out for something really heavy and powerful go find something else. Like Opeth's Blackwater Park.Don't buy this album. It is not a masterpiece like others have stated. It is a dreadfully bad compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHUT UP JAMES!","review":"Someone burned this disk for me along with Rush's VAPOR TRAILS, and I thought VAPOR TRAILS was descent but this album is a piece of genuine CRAP! Jame LaBrie is a horrid singer that just screams his damn head off, and all the songs are quite lengthly and (yawn) boring. The only thing that gets this album even 1 star is Mike Portnoy's awsome drumming (I'm a drummer, you see)! If you want good drumming AND good music, here are the groups I'd recommend:Rush (Neil Peart)The Mars Volta (Jon Theodore)AND OF COURSE...Led Zepplin (John Bonham)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, very heavy","review":"This was my first Dream Theater, which I got around last year. It is a great album with some awesome songs and always outstanding John Petrucci solos. The highlights on this album are definitely \\"Erotomania\\", \\"Voices\\", \\"Lie\\", and \\"Space-Dye Vest\\". There are other great songs like \\"6:00\\" and \\"The Mirror\\" which are all great. Jame's voice sounds good on this album, but maybe not quite as good as \\"Images and Words\\". The songs on this album lack the magic of the songs on albums like \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" or \\"Images and Words\\", but it still a must have for any progressive metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical master piece","review":"Dream Theater is definatly my favorite band so this review might be a little bias. If you never listened to them before give them a chance, even if you don't like the music you can appreciate the talent in the band. I have talked to a lot of people and most say it is too hard to listen too because too many things are going on at once, but they still respect their talent. Everyone says the singer sucks and that is the only thing they don't like about the band but I really like the singer. His vocals are over the top just like everyone else in the band so he fits in perfectly. Give them a try because I am glad I gave them a chance and now they havea special place in my heart.

Whether it is brutally aggressive tunes like \\"The Mirror\\" and \\"Lie\\" or soaring beauty like \\"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream\\" or \\"Space Die Vest\\", this album succeeds on every level. Dream Theater even shows us that they can be technical and write a great song all at the same time as is the case with \\"Erotomania\\".Unfortunately, Dream Theater has forgotten the lessons they learned on Awake and has now almost completely left their progressive side in favor of a more technical direction.But this album remains a progressive metal masterpiece.If you like prog rock bands such as Kansas, Rush and early Genesis and you don't mind that type of music mixed with, say, the heaviness of a Metallica or Queensryche, pick up this gem of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide awake indeed","review":"Possibly their second-best album, after the \\"Scenes from a memory\\" tour de force. Musically both kaleidoscopic (from frenetic odd-meter beats to the almost meditative \\"Space dye vest\\") and adventurous. Favorite songs: 6:00 (whew!), Erotomania (a virtuosic instrumental which quotes rhapsodically from much of their work), and -- at the other extreme musically --- the haunting \\"Space-Dye vest\\". The lyrics are perhaps the band's weakest point --- but there's so much delicious instrumental stuff going on that you hardly notice the lyrics, and relate to the singer as the fifth instrumentalist. Unapologetically theatrical, but with the musical chops to back it up. These guys are not just very much masters of their respective instruments, but also mesh into each other like gears. Wide awake indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocence Faded","review":"This song and this band to me realy is one of the best all around music groups that have ever come around ever! They have new and old the best keyboardists that I have personaly ever heard and a man that I believe would give Neil a run for his money and walk away with everything, one heck of truly excellent Bass players I have ever heard and truly a vocalist that to me in my mind is truly the best in the buisness and last but not least the master of disaster on the Guitar and one heck of a lyric writer himself and that is John Petrrucci.

I remember going to the States for the day in the fall of 1994 and the first store I went to in the Walden Galeria was The Wall It is one awsome music store. I was looking for the new release and there it was...Awake. When I got home I was hoping this one was going to be as good as Images& Words. After a few listenings to this even more unique release, I fell in love! I think Awake is increadible. The depth of music and Darkness of this C.D. make it interesting to listen to all the way through. I recommend this release to all metal and rock listeners. So far I not yet been dissapointed In any releases by D.T. yet. These guys are musical artists and they will never die! from your undying fan Steve Bradley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius","review":"The creativity of Dream Theater's arrangement on the album was nothing less than genius.

Second, I am not reviewing this Dream Theater album as much as I am commenting on the SHM import version from Japan. I have this fetish for remasterings and figure 'people will do better than the original' - so I coughed up the money for this Japanese SHM-CD (and others as to save on shipping). It appears that all they did was to increase the levels on the whole album! Also, this has created a terrible boomy lower midrange while the originals have a tight and punchy sound.I have an audiophile system and can tell you that there is no improvement on the originals. In fact, the originals are textured and nuanced compared to these terrible SHM monstrosities. Save your money and get the domestic releases - they are perfect!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dream Theater masterpiece","review":"Dream Theater isn't your average metal band, they're something above and beyond the rest, and this album is no exception.A little weird lyric-wise, but in terms of its musicality, it is an excellent album. Starts off with a weird but involving track, 6:00, and progresses to Erotomania, an instrumental that is easily one of the best tracks on the album. Space-Dye Vest is the final track and is one of their slower songs but is very moving musically.A must-have for any Dream Theater fan, and if you're not a fan yet, this is a good place to start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DT's best!","review":"This album took a while to grow on me. The first time I heard I nodded and thought it was good, not as good as Scenes From a Memory but good none the less. Well after having it for a while I changed my mind. This was sadly the last album Kevin Moore made while a member of Dream Theater, therefore this is the last album with truly great key's (ya Scenes was good but not up to this) and I think Moore was their best lyricist. This is a great mood album; it ranges to heavy and angry to soft and beautiful, A great range of sound with DT's amazing speed and technical ability souring with emotion. LaBrie's vox are some of his best putting everything he has into each song. Plus it's a long over 70 min so you get your moneys worth. Over all a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD album, not a great album.","review":"This is a very good album but it still seems a little overratedto me, or at least some tracks are over rated. 6:00 is an ok song but I think it is the most overrated song on this album by far, it does sort of set the mood for the rest of the disc nicely but that is about it. But for every \\"average\\" song there is a good one, like caught in a web, voices, erotomania, space-dye vest, and more. Overall I liked about half of the songs on this album and the rest are still decent songs so this a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED ?","review":"As a relative newcomer to D.T. (having only heard SFAM and IMAGES AND WORDS), my expectations were high prior to purchasing this one. I have to say what A DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Where are the catchy hooks and good songs that filled \\"Images\\" .It sounds like they were just putting this out to satisfy a contract. These guys are great musicians (especially Portnoy and Petrucci),but this disc lacks good songs and good production. It just sounds like a typical 90's band trying to be heavy, but with no substance.In fact they never really got it back together until SFAM. Buy \\"Images\\" and \\"SFAM\\" , avoid everything else (except maybe \\"Six Degrees\\"). If you really want to hear these guys (most of them)play with substance and style get either of the \\"Liquid Tension Experiment\\" discs.

I have been a fan of rush for over 15 years, and you have to understand that their music is more of a life philosophy, than just straight forward playing. You actually have to hear the lyrics.Now, I have listened to both albums that everyone has said are the best, \\"Awake\\" and \\"Images\\". And although the music aspect of it was pretty good, I found the lyrics to be lacking. Also, another reviewer compared the lead vocal to Geddy Lee, and even Freddie Mercury.

Those who have used both usually have a preference. My preference (and therefore bias you should know about) is for the Wusthofs.The Wusthof Grand Prix line is a more modern design than the Classic series, with a simple black handle. The balance and grip of these knives are as close to perfect as I have found. For those wondering what benefits a higher priced knife provides, one benefit is that the blade (or tang) is one piece all the way through the handle. This makes the blade much stronger, and less likely to snap.This particular model, the 6 inch cleaver, is a good cleaver. Most people really don't use a cleaver anymore, as they buy either pre-cut/pre-packaged meats, or they have the butcher cut the meat into loins or steaks for them. If you really are going to use a cleaver, this one is my favorite.

I was a die hard Nip/Tuck fan until I watched Season 4. I kept watching hoping it would get better, but it seems the writers were really digging for material to keep us interested, and ended up with a bunch of ridiculous happenings that bounced from place to place. Nip/Tuck 'jumped the shark' this year with their look into the future, turning a present day suave and debonair Christian into a Liberace look alike. We could feel nothing but pity for Sean acting like a 90lb weakling throughout the season. The only thing that kept the interest was Joely Richardson's outstanding acting ability and the host of guest stars - Rosie O'Donnell was fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aburridísima","review":"There was a very entertaining campy insanity that made the first two seasons a delight to watch (the end of the second season, with that lovable ham Alec Baldwin, was very very clever and fun). The quality, however, began to go down in the third season, with the whole \\"castrado\\" thing, but the fourth season is just awful. Very very boring, or as we say in spanish, aburridísima: no ideas, no narrative logic, no risks, no fun. Even the sex in this one looks pretty tame. I mean, when I was a kid, I remember that I knew when a comic book was running out of ideas when Batman went to the future to meet with the martians or something.

But the text is loaded with partially informed speculation about the relationship between Parrish and Sue Lewin, his favorite model. The author is an art dealer, not a historian, and her lack of analytical training is a serious problem. Maybe Lewin was Parrish's lover. But where's the concrete evidence? Everything that the author presents to support her contentions is either hearsay or capable of more than one interpretion. The fact that they shared a house for several decades is a VERY persuasive fact, but Gilbert damages her credibility -- and her case -- by tossing in too much pointless guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a fun, light, easy read.","review":"This book is full of conjecture about Maxfield Parrish's private life and his relationship with his model, Sue Lewin.

From the package I had bought, I ended up throwing away 15% of the CDs after burning and finding out they didn't work.

You get what you pay for. My Toshiba and Plextor burners can handle 16x and 40x burn speeds but anything over 2x with these discs will fail at about the 20% mark. When attempting to burn at speeds over 4x, these discs cause both my burners to vibrate loudly before failing. Maybe I just got a bad batch but the discs are very flimsy and the wavy imperfections in the dye is very obvious to the naked eye. When pulling the discs off the center holder of a cd jewel case, the discs will bend a lot more than any other disc I've used. You can tell these are low quality without even burning on them.

These CD-Rs do well in my newer CD players, but not in my older 1994 deck. The tracks eventually play, but the player often hunts for several seconds first.

Sadly my experience with the second lot was very poor. I estimate that about 15% failed to burn. The failures normally occurred near the end of the burn, which corresponds to the outer edge of the disk. As a result I will not purchase this brand again, since it appears that they do not have good process control from one lot to another.

I don't consider this music rock or punk though. I would say more pop rock. But it's a good sound.The fact is that Fefe Dobson isn't labeling herself to be \\"punk\\" or a \\"rocker\\" like Avril does.

You may have heard a person say that about some music artist(s) a million times, but I truly think she's amazing. I buy other albums only to find that the singles are the only good songs on the album, but in this one, every single song is breath-taking.I first saw Fefe's music video \\"Bye Bye Boyfriend\\" on TV, and honestly - I didn't like it that much. My friend wanted the CD for Christmas, so I got it for him. He didn't say much about it, so I didn't think much of it afterwards.Until just recently. While surfing on the net, I stumbled onto her new video, \\"Everything\\" and when I heard it, I was obsessed with the song. Catchy tune, and lyrics I could relate to, something I really look for in a solid song.Her voice is, admittedly, slightly annoying at first. However, if you spend a little bit of your time to actually listen to the music, you'll see that she has a lot of potential. She is definitely going to be big one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fefe is great!!","review":"Ok... This album is fantastic!

However, I must say that her credibility is questionable and causes a certain discomfort when the viewer watches them. She might be too young to emerge on the scene. One thing is for sure, she has vocal ability and an apparent drive to succeed. In my opinion of amateur music listener, I think she needs to be backed up my solid videos. The ones that are out now, eventhough the pop songs are catchy and distributable, makes the viewer unhook right away and ask one question: Why is this young girl not improving her game before coming out full of pretentions. 1 star for the current, 5 for the potential.

Oooo she's so hardcore! She's rock/punk/grunge! Oh, her and Avril are pop music's answer to Nirvana! Hahahhaha. Excuse me while I puke. FeFe Dobson, or as I prefer FuFu Dogson is about as predictable as a Jessica Simpson. These many pop-punk acts that tear away at our music industry are just as manufactured as the blonde belly-baring pop-tarts that came out in the late '90s. You want a real female rock antidote to Britney Spears? Go out and immearse yourself in early Liz Phair, Hole, Veruca Salt, L7, Alanis Morisette, Bikini Kill, PJ Harvey, Babes In Toyland or Garbage. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There were so many great female rock bands out in the early to mid '90s that faded away after bubblegum pop came out. I truly wonder what would happen if one of these FeFe fans actually listened to any of the artists' music I mentioned above.

FeFe's voice: does screeching cat on heat come to mind? Why yes it does.Her first single recieved very little airplay on MTV and radio which served it justice. Whomever tries to market this girl as a rockandroll wildchild is mentally disturbed. THIS girl, not Avril, is desecrating the name of rock and punk. \\"Take Me Away\\" is pop, no way around it, and you people need to understand these things.After hearing the $7 CD (which is actually worth like $.05... well, that might be too generous) I have come to the conclusion that the music reps. are trying to make everyone kill themselves.Do not buy this piece of crap even if its your last chance to survive on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"FEFE?

Every song on her album displays a different form of rock, from the punk driven \\"stupid little love song\\" to mellow/acoustic \\"revolution song\\" to the lyrically deep, nu-metal/heavy driven \\"unforgiven\\".

Everything - Slow to the start but surprises are coming it really picks up and the song is amazing! Unforgiven - is about an absent father and the chorus sounds a little like a KORN song very good.

I like the sound, it sounds like rock, but the lyrics are a bit lame. I can't really say anything bad about \\"Everything\\", but it sounds a bit like Avril. There are no words left to describe the rest of the CD because I couldn't fully listen to any tracks past 4. \\"Rock It Till You Drop It\\" is bad.

I'm not against pop/punk stuff, I do find some of it entertaining, but these songs are really the worst. \\"Stupid\\" truly characterizes this album, I view this as a real setback for new artists.

We've been struggling enough as it is. But for this black chick to start making grunge albums is too much for me to bare. When I first heard fefe Dobson, I thought just another grunge person on the scene. But when I saw her, I damn near fainted. FeFe, we sing R&B, Rap, and Jazz, and the blues not grunge or punk my dear. So, I gave this album one star because she's a black artist. Other than that, even though I don't have this album, it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"not a hard rocker here... but like all types of music. this album is awesome. not too hard and not too soft. I had the pleasure of meeting fefe at a show in sacramento a week before her album dropped and she is the nicest person. her album is great, and there isnt one song that i didnt like on it. favorites being 3/4/8 ... you have to get this cd. you won't be disappointed. fefe rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I actually got this album as a gift. Thank god I didn't spend money on it! I think that Fefe is a mediocre artist and will probably be her last album . This is certified teenie bopper music, made not to last. I hope I saved any potential buyers some cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"another cookie cutter","review":"so i heard this terrible artist singing live at the nba all star game and i literally wanted to never hear music again. she sings completely through her nose, there is no reason for her to even have her mouth open at all. she's not \\"punk\\", she's not \\"grunge\\" or \\"rock\\". she's just plain awful. please don't waste your money and don't support a music industry that thinks this is entertainment, or even good. if you want good music don't go here. and thanks go out to fefe, for inspiring me to make good music and to not EVER sound like her. i'd rather give this no stars but in order to review i will give it one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"i cant believe i wasted my money on this garbage.. only 'stupid little love song' and 'bye bye boyfriend' are OK. just OK. everything else sucks. if you like poppy punk poser music, (avril, good charlotte, simple plan, lilix and all of those so called artists/bands) this is for you. fefe sounds like a dead cow gargling on oatmeal. take me away and everything are horrible. what also annoys me is that my name is the title of one of the tracks. grrr.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I bought this CD for the one radio hit, and that is exactly what I got out of it. I don't really like any of the other songs and definitely wasted my money on the rest of the tracks...just buy the single."},{"rating":"2","title":"FE FE","review":"Hey, I was a little hesitant to get this cd I heard her singles and I liked em but how many times do you like few songs so you get the cd and ur skipping everyother song? So the ultimate decision for me was to get it and hope for the best. I deffinantly love this cd it's great you can hear alot of passion and emotion in her voice. Lately these people who have been coming out with a very simular sound.....Not Fefe she has a very unique sound pop like but still with a nice balance of rock...So if your looking for it to just be somthing with more of a pop sound you probably won't like it. If you appreciate a little more edge mixed in with the pop you probably will. Alot of people are comparing her to Averil and I have to say that she seems to rock a bit harder than Averil...I think she stands alone as a wonderful newcoming artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fefe rocks it!!","review":"Refreshing blast of incredible energy and passionate lyrics completly infused with amazing music lead by strong guitar. I absolutely love the cd!! There's a little something for everyone and if you really truly enjoy great music I know you'll seriously dig this amazing artist and her first cd. This is one of those cd's where you don't need to skip a certain song or two, you'll love each one even more than the next!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was not expecting this album to be as good as it is. Every song on it is good. There is absolutely no filler. Shes compared a lot with Avril and Michelle Branch. Fefe though, is better. Her voice is better, her songs are better crafted, and the musicianship is MUCH better. All the songs are very catchy. My favs are 8/10, bye bye boyfriend, and Stupid little love song. You cannot go wrong with buying this CD. So do it, BUY IT TODAY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"I couldn't wait for the release of this album, and it is everything I expected and more. This CD is now one of my favorites, along with my Prozzak CDs. I get into every one of these songs. They all just touch me (corny as it is.) I can understand the subjects of the songs and relate. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have this CD. You must go out and buy it now. Now, quickly, go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone give this 5 stars??!","review":"If you give this cd 5 stars you must have no taste of music or just be plainly retarded. This isnt punk, hardcore or anythin its just friggin garbage.I would rather listen to tunes coming out of a nintendo. How hardcore can anyone be with the name fefe anyways. If i had a cat i would name it Fefe..actually i wouldnt because it would remind me how terrible this music is. My rating -5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh look! It's Avril Lavigne all over again!","review":"Okay before I start bashing FeFe I want to say one thing in response to the review written by Tanika. Tanika dear, it doesn't matter what color skin you have you can do whatever kind of music you like. And this isn't 'grunge' my dear. Do you even know what grunge is? It's a combination of punk and metal. Something that died in the mid '90s. Oh yeah, and this isn't punk like everything thinks it is. It's POP!! So if you like poppy poser-punk bands like Lillix, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan then this is for you. Me on the other hand, I'll stick listening to my Hole CDs. I wish Courtney Love and her crew would come back and wipe out all of these fluff 'rockers' like Avril Lavigne and Michelle Branch. The music industry would be a much better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This is some of the WORST music I've ever heard","review":"Alright, I'll give you the scoop on this album. I thought I would give Fefe a listen on AOL Radio/Sessions @ AOL. I heard a song, the first on the track called \\"Stupid Little Love Song\\"As an avid and truly unbiased reviewer, I became sick listening to this song. The title really does convey it- it's stupid, it's little, and it is the worst I've ever heard. Fefe isn't terrible vocally, but even if I was into mod/punk rock music (used to be a casual fan of Green Day when I was younger)the utter DISGUST I got from this song is not comprehensable. The main guitar riff is terrible, Fefe's imitation Long Island Accent is horrendous, and its really just a terrible song. The other songs I listened to were not as hideous, but they were not \\"good\\" in my opinion, and this displays to me how the talent in modern rock has really plumented. My review truly can be summarized in three words. As a rock fan, AVOID THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry But This is Awful","review":"Isn't that song \\"Everything\\" a combination of Red Hot Chili Peppers \\"Under the Bridge\\" and Alanis Morissette's \\"Head Over Feet\\"? Probably just different enough not to require a law suit. This girl needs to find a sound that's not so lame and over done. Much respect for getting a record deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA","review":"HELL YEAH! just what the music industry needs...another avril lavign BUT WAIT, this one is different because she's black...it's been done...the whole \\"trying to be punk/rock\\" but ITS NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you like crap, i highly recommend this cd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has to be the saddest crap ive ever heard......","review":"okay where do i begin, i mean if your gonna have little avrils running around trying to get the youths money for the big time music companies at least make sure they can sing in the first place. I thought Avril was bad enough and it just couldnt get any worse but alas again I was worng. Fefe 's first song she came out with Bye bye boyfriend was the most pathectic song ever written her voice is whiny and obnoxius and she makes a sad attempt of trying to fit into fast growing trends in the media. I mean shes quite the rebel with her hardcore exterior and pop princess voice to add on to it . To sum it all up I suggest you spend your money on something more interesting and unique like collecting stamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fefe, who are you again?","review":"Fefe Dobson is known to few, she known to me as a talent-less \\"wanna be\\" rock star. Whats happening? How can \\"Bye Bye Boyfirend\\" get air play. If I WERE HER RECORD LABEL, I would say \\"BYE BYE FEFE\\" becasue this is a waste of money. Its a waste of plastic, microphones, and our ears to hear this bull sh*t. Theres only one catchy single and thats \\"TAKE ME AWAY\\" but fefe is right, we need to \\"take her away\\" from this music business because she belongs in the back of a club sining for her rent. NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR FEFE. NO,NO,NO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fefe's Awesome Single","review":"Fefe is an incredible artist. I love her music and she is awesome live. She is such a friendly person.

In my opinion, only Fritz Wunderlich was his equal. If you are a fan of Domingo or Pavorotti -- both of whom are fine tenors -- listen to Mario Lanza and hear how a truly great tenor sounds. Unfortunately, many people -- including critics -- don't take Lanza seriously because they believe MGM's publicity from his movie making days that he was a talented but untrained amateur. While Lanza was indeed extremely talented, he also had extensive formal training. But all this becomes immaterial when you hear this man's glorious voice. If you love great singing please treat yourself to this excellent set which covers a wide range of music from classical through popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"saw them live","review":"I do not own this album. Yeah yeah, I know how anoying it is when people give reviews of items they have not yet experienced. That being said... I have seen this band perform live and MAN! did they rock! If the album is anything like their live performance, I highly recomend it. The only reason I don't own it yet is because I spent the last of my money on the cover charge getting into the bar and was out of cash when they started selling CD's. Don't make the same mistake! The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I can't garuntee that the album is as great at their show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good romance","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Most Christian novels you read have no descriptive sex scenes but this one does. I know I will get flack from other readers for writing this review but I am just telling it like it is. There are a couple of mild sex scenes in this book between husband and wife and when Sam tells about his past life. There is also an attempted rape scene.

The company leads you to believe that the Culinar knives are made from a single piece construction, but they are actually *two pieces* and there is a joint. Mine all rusted right at that joint, just from normal kitchen use. Needless to say I was very disappointed...I have switched to the Wusthof Classic line instead.

But I (for one) found the young leading man in this film one of the dullest young actors I've ever seen. Perhaps he's deliberately so, since the character he plays is baleful, moody, and spiteful: altogether a real pill. But (the movie suggests) even a \\"pill\\" can find love in Belgium. The British film BEAUTIFUL THING covers the same topography with a much more sympathetic protagonist and an ebulliant score featuring Mama Cass recordsings.

If you are trying to avoid BPA in food storage items, I would avoid this item. Some states already have laws requiring baby food products be BPA-free and the FDA has medical concerns about it, including potential links to breast and prostate cancer and early onset puberty. Why add more to my home? I would hope Amazon would add the plastic type to this item's product description to inform customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Separate Purchase","review":"I don't understand one thing ... why can I not purchase the lid and the container from the same seller? They are from the same manufacturer, but not sold anywhere as a set, and not available from the same place, so I have to pay separate shipping on each part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storage Container","review":"This storage container was purchased by me because I like to bake bread and it is perfect to place the dough in for rising purposes. I like to bake Artesian bread and the dough is stored in it in the refirgerator for several days allowing you to make small loaves for several days and it keeps it fresh. One batch doubled can turn into 12 little loaves.It does come with a lid also but the lid is sold separately and should be stated clearly in your advertisment. This did cause me some confusion when I made my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exemplary","review":"It really is difficult to find ANY fault with this production AND - let us remember that we are watching something other than the production as seen by people in the opera house - with this television/DVD version.

Bravi to all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gluck - Orphee et Eurydice","review":"The performers are Australian, and David Hobson is a favourite, which makes this DVD special for me.

The unique voice of the 15 year old narrator is completely captivating and utterly superb. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prolonged meanderings","review":"It took me forever to finish this book. The \\"observations\\" were repetitive and the plot meandered aimlessly. It was not a \\"page turner\\" by any stretch of the imagination. Bessy Buckley was a plucky lass, but a little pluck goes a long way and cannot in and of itself sustain interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good and somewhat unpredictable yarn","review":"I rather liked this period piece, which teasingly veers around, threatening to set it's hat down in several different genres before springing some surprises.The narrator's voice is quite believable and always entertaining. I usually criticize books for being over-long, but this one could have continued further on some of its diversions as far as I'm concerned, and I would have liked to have seen more of some of the minor characters. Bessie stayed with me for a while.I guess that all means that Ms. Harris did a good job.Good luck with the dreaded second book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Wrong in the Mind","review":"If you are looking for a well written quirky book this is it. Daisy O'Toole, young ex-prostitute is the narrator and boy howdy does she speak the vernacular. A lot is packed in this book: mystery, bawd, a bit of Victorian gothic. However the narrator is the only personnage we get to truly know. That's the main weakness of the book. A short toss off of why in the devil Arabella married the dour and much older James. And who or what made either of them the bent folks they turned out to be? What about the most odd assemblage of creature people in Snatter? (Gob what a great name for the place.)There are parts of the story that the author repeats- not just once. That objectionable device always looks like book stretching. We got it, already! Still, Daisy's voice is magnificent in its Dublin and Glasgow slang and its image. She, it turns out, is the true observer. A very good first book by Ms. Harris. I'll be waiting for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good It Shocked Me","review":"I LOVED Bessy, the narrator of this novel. What a character! Very gutsy, very outspoken, honest, and to top it all off, she has a sense of humor. The novel itself had an entertaining, mysterious plot. What seems to be irrelevant and unrelated happenings actually ends up being tied together in a bow by the end of the book. It did, however, have a rough beginning. The narration is shoddy and difficult to read at first. The reason is explained at the end and the reader actually realizes how very appropriate it is. In order for the novel to read more like this girl's journal, the writing is much as people spoke back then. But as the girl matures and improves writing wise, the novel blossoms, the texts changes, and becomes easier to read. So those that are put off by the beginning language, do keep going! Bessy's thoughts and observations as she plods thru a difficult life of a maid in the Victorian times will have you laughing out loud as well as shaking your head in sympathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM Diana Cooper","review":"Diana Cooper's \\"Angel inspiration\\" is not my kind of spirituality. However, the book is probably a very mixed bag even for those who do believe in angels. The first part of Cooper's book contains the usual, uplifting anecdotes and miracle stories about angelic inspiration. Later, the work gets progressively more cultic.Cooper claims to have information about a long list of Ascended Masters identical to those revered by Guy Ballard or Elizabeth Clare Prophet: St. Germain, Kuthumi, Mother Mary, the Goddess of Liberty, etc. Even the terminology is similar: Violet Flame, transmutation, I AM, decree, etc. Apparently, there is also a Silver Violet Flame. Various meditation exercises are included.I don't know who Diana Cooper might be, but she has clearly been studying the material of the I AM Activity and the Church Universal and Triumphant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music! Not so great vocals.","review":"This CD contains some wonderful work. The music itself is very atmospheric and is comprised of flowing melodic goodness. The well composed. The one thing I dislike about the album is the vocals. They are DRENTCHEDDD in reverb and the singers dynamic NEVER changes. I really feel that the vocals pull down hard on the other instruments. All in all, it's a good listen. Still worth the purchance. I just wish they would have listened back after recording :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is their vocalist screaming all the time?","review":"Seriously, this band is amazing! But why does their singer suck so much? We already have a mess of screamers and growlers and such, why can't he just sing? Sure, he may be angry or sad or whatever, but there are plenty of other ways to express that emotion instead of repeated and boring screams. They just plain suck. Rosetta doesn't even need a singer, they would sound a whole lot better without one.The instrumentation on this album is sick! Drumming is stunning, the guitar and bass lines are epic and creative, but their vocalist is horrible. Another screamer screaming to be \\"heavy\\", I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Going....but worth it","review":"This handbook is a good reference to keep on one's desk about ancient Egypt. Good overview of hieroglyphics, funeral practices and the fundamental tenets of Egyptian religion. Be warned that is not a \\"popular\\" history; it's clearly aimed at the graduate student/professional level. That being said, the book could definitely use a new edition-the one I have says first edition 1893 second edition 1925. The prose reflects this as well: long passages in Greek and French, indicative of British scholastic writing at this time. I'm thinking there's an excellent project here for a doctoral candidate- a new edition reflecting scholarship from the last 75 years, along with appropriate translations (original texts could be appendices so the pedantic can perform their own translations). All in all, the results are worth the reader's effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urrghh","review":"First of all, this is in reference to the MADACY collection of Chaplin shorts, volume 2. This has nothing to do with any Kino or Image DVD that this review will be cross-referenced to. The Kino and Image DVDs are the way to go.Even worse than volume 1, this collection presents a lot of material available in much better quality from other companies. Madacy once again takes lousy copies of old films, transfers them poorly, often without the title cards included, and adds on a slapdash soundtrack of some old, scratchy jazz records from the 40's, often repeating the same record. The final indignity comes with the tape duplication itself - at the lowest speed possible for even lousier quality.The only reason to get this set is that a few of these films are available almost nowhere else. This is like buying moldy fruits and vegetables, because your only alternative is starving. Just because it's all you got doesn't mean it's any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid for building muscle","review":"I purchased this system over 2 years ago and am very impressed for the price.

With the attachments, this is almost a complete gym right in your home! You get all the advantages of a smith machine for heavy solo lifting, or a power cage/rack for free weight work. this system is worth every penny. The reason I didn't give it a 5?

I have no child and I am never around children, therefore it is useless. This is something I have done hundreds of times with other knives. It took a very small amount of force to break the tip off. This knife is cheap and has a nice design. I can only recommend this knife if you plan on never using it for anything. Also, after flicking it out a few times the blade started to get loose.

Great value for tne price....","review":"I ordered the S&W Hawkbill Camo Karambit knife, a while back. The knife arrived very sharp and was an attractive Camo coating. I thought that the knife was well balanced and I spent some time twirling it, using the Karambit hole & underhand grip. I placed some zip ties in the opening hole,which helped greatly in opening the knife quickly. I have owned several Karambit style knives, some expensive and some very inexpensive, this Hawkbill Karambit from S&W is an excellent value for the cost of the knife (I paid around $25 plus shipping) and it is a solid, well built knife. What I really like about this knife, is that the Karambit loop fits my fingers better than my other knives, so it provides a comfortable, solid grip. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase & would recommend it to someone wanting a great knife without spending a fortune on it. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an actual S&W knife","review":"This is an okay knife. The blade is a cheap quality steel and rusts quickly.

Once you pick it up, you'll find it difficult to put down. This book is helpful and humorous at the same time. It raises the awareness of the dilemas that gifted children (and their parents) often face in school and at home, in an engaging way. Ms. Isaacson has the uncanny ability to make any parent reflect on the uniqueness of their own children. Reading this book gave me a greater appreciation for my own children.

The latest addition is the steak knife set.The knives themselves have an inherent beauty and are visually deceptive in that they appear at first glance to be a single piece of steel from handle to blade, though in fact blade and handle are individual pieces with the illusion of being seamless.The balance of these knives is perfect, and if you are adding to a growing Culinar collection as I was, I would highly recommend these knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this brand","review":"i have this product, and it broke twice in 3 yearsfirst time it was in the first 3 months and wouldnt turn on so i sent it back to company under warranty, thier customer service was horrible. now 3 years later to the day, the picture has gone purple and green and no more warranty. it was cheap but i guess you get what you pay for. when investing in a hdtv my advice is dont go cheap or with some brand you never heard of. live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good inexpensive HDTV","review":"I bought this to save space in the bedroom.

Wodehouse. In the ensuing responses, this thin little volume by Durrell was mentioned. I recognized Durrell's name from my research into travel literature, and thought I'd give his humor a try. These are short stories, told to an unseen chronicler (and fellow diplomat) by an older collegue named Antrobus. The service is foreign, in a generic country name Vulgaria (a cute little dig at snobbish English diplomats). While the language is quite pleasant, and some of the situations quite amusing, what Durrell is missing is that sense of plot known as the conclusion (or, as a character says here, \\"the pay off\\"). Durrell tries, but never seems to get it right.

But the cover caught me, then I recognized the Author, so I though what the heck. I couldn't put this one down, but while reading it, I felt the plot was slow, then rushed than slow, as if the turning points were placed too far apart and then too close.

In the movie, he came across as more ambivalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Representation","review":"I have seen a lot of movies based on books and many are bad; this one has got to be the worst. I can't believe Jon Katz allowed this to be released. It doesn't tell 1/10 of the story, throws a lot of fake info in there (all the family drama that was never mentioned in his book) and doesn't really even tell a story. The only scene that is the least bit interesting is the beginning, and that also follows the book. Do not waste your money on this boring non-tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really love dogs you won't love this movie","review":"First off the movie itself was just bad...slow moving, no real plot, and felt like it ended in the middle of the story. But on top of it I watched it with a pit in my stomach because anyone who knows anything about dogs could see that Jeff Bridges' character, Jon Katz, didn't know anything about owning a high-energy dog. It was the typical story of an owner getting a dog for selfish reasons and the dog suffering as a result. Plus knowing that this is based on a true story and that in real life Mr. Katz eventually couldn't handle the dog and put him down made it even harder to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably bad dog movie.","review":"I usually love dog movies mainly because I love dogs. I couldn't believe that anyone could produce such a poor quality movie as this one. When you get a dog and expect to have the dog trained for all the usual reasons; stay, sit, come down. What do you do to achieve this goal? TRAIN THE DOG! There is no end to the helpful books and videos available. there is no way you let a dog use the house like a toilet - TRAIN IT! Letting a dog put it's head, or even worse whole body, out a car window is dangerous and foolish. Don't yell and scream at the dog, teach it with patience and love. Dogs are eager to respond and offer you their love. This movie was an insult to dogs, especially the amazingly beautiful, intelligent Border Collies. BTW - after he put down the Yellow Lab, what happened to the other Yellow Lab? Did he just disappear? I gave it 1 star just because seeing the dogs was a treat, in spite of the bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter [...]","review":"What utter [...] this book is, obviously written simply to cash in on Fuhrman's name recognition.

By contrast, Fuhrman gets right to the point and holds the readers interest.The \\"magic bullet\\" has never been better explained, in book or TV.In some of the other reviews, I think the reviewers are biased either by their insistance on a conspiracy and/or Mr. Fuhrman's involvement in the OJ Simpson case.

On The Wild Heart, she continues her winning ways with an album full of her trademark romantic mysticism. Bella Donna had an underlying country feel, but on The Wild Heart she employs a heavy synthesizer sound. In fact the big hit from the album, \\"Stand Back\\", was inspired by Prince. The song has a rolling synth sound and one of the strongest vocals of her career. She does another duet with Tom Petty on \\"I Will Run To You\\". The song isn't as good as their first effort, \\"Stop Dragging My Heart Around\\", but that song is an all time classic. \\"If Anyone Falls\\" is a brilliant track and the best song from the album. There are the requisite mystical work including \\"Nightbird\\", \\"Sable On Blond\\", \\"Gate & Garden\\" and the heavily orchestrated \\"Beauty & The Beast\\". The Wild Heart shows that Bella Donna was no fluke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd but","review":"Just waiting for the record company to re-issue the first three albums of Stevie's albums and digitally remaster them, so come on EMI please do this and soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Wild","review":"Stevie's second solo work, The Wild Heart, is one my absolute favorites (along with Other Side of the Mirror).

Solo, she's an arena-rock diva immersed in self-regard. This one proves it.

And, like all her albums, the poetry makes it listenable over and over again, never tiring because the lyrics are just as beautiful as the music.

While not as classy as \\"Bella Donna\\", The Wild Heart is still a good album with lots of radio friendly tracks including the two standouts on the album \\"Stand Back\\" and \\"If Anyone Falls\\". Tom Petty records his second duet with Stevie on the haunting \\"I Will Run To You\\". There are other good offerings too from \\"Night Bird\\" to one of her best ballads \\"Sable on Blond\\".

Also, it's nice to have a real 25-piece orchestra on \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and all 25 musicians get their names listed in the credits.

I am very disappointed that it didn't work, as I'm studying this medicine, get regular acupuncture and herbal treatments. Nothing has helped me lose weight...I don't know what the answer is, but this isn't it for weight loss for me.

OK, but then why the author puts only 8 pages of exercise? The rest of the 328 pages is all about food and a lot of bla- bla - bla.

It's a boring book (coming from a Dr. Quinn fan) but seeing it did stimulate my desire to grab on to more Dr. Quinn literature. This, I satisfied by reading the scripts I found at the Official DQMW Site and some episode synopses.

I don't know if it's worth the extra price but our main two knives are both Culinar while the rest are Classic. I guess my point is, if you want just 1 goto knife that looks and works the part, get this one.I cannot recommend another knife over this one based on my wife's and my own experiences.

I've heard several versions of Peter and The Wolf. This being the best rendition I've heard, by far. I gave one to some friends of mine, a few years ago, who have an autistic daughter...

Combine that with the Red Label that Columbia used and it is quite the colorful Album... I remember that I bought the album for the Britten, big Britten fan here, and partially the novelty of Bowie narrating Peter.

I thought this would be the best version I heard since I also like David Bowie, but it was a real disappointment. Bowie apparently decided that it would be more humane for the Wolf if he put it in the zoo! That wasn't very good for the Duck, either. It's funny but the composer, Prokofiev, was once criticized for changing the end of Romeo and Juliet in his ballet- allowing them to live after taking the poison.

Mr. Cowell takes us on what is essentially a humorless journey through the creation of his hit television talent show and offers very little insight into what drives him to create the next pop music star. After enjoying Mr. Cowell's barage of snarky comments on the show, I was surprised at how drab his \\"behind-the-scenes\\" tale reads. Clearly, this book was rushed to publish in order to capitalize on the transitory success of American Idol. At least we can read about his predictions for the winners (and losers) from the first two seasons of the show and see how many of those predictions are accurate, and how many, like this book, fall disappointingly flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, bloody horrible..","review":"First of all, Simon probably didn't write the book, it was most likely ghost written.Secondly, it was a short read, not worth the price. He makes himself out to be the best thing living on this planet which I suppose is part of his public \\"persona\\", but it gets tiresome after reading it, ego on every page.Thirdly, He would have been better sticking to gossip from the American Idols. I would think that would have done much better. The fact that he wrote about it candidly and without as much ego as the rest of the book earns it that extra star.Do yourself a favor, and just watch American Idol.

Simon's book offers great advice for aspiring singers, as well as an in-depth look into American Idol. I was surprised by some of the information that was revealed about the contestants, such as the divas of the show, hook-ups between the contestants, and some other information (read the book to find out).

However, if you have an open mind and want some good backstage AI gossip, this is the book for you.The first half of the book is about Simon's life in England, from a young boy with lots of celebrity contacts, to his life as a runner at a movie studio.It gives you a feel of what Simon really thought about all of the contestants, judges, and hosts. He tells which AI2 contestants were hated, loved, respected, and which one, when booted off, was cheered by the make up and wardrobe people because she was so unliked.

Ricky is revived, and walks around with a salad bowl on his head instead of a skull. Great. Out of nowhere, they dropped the nun theme and went with a blind clairvoyant. Ok....as if that makes sense. It was predictable, and just not fun. If I wasn't insensitive to enjoy making blind person jokes the whole movie, I probably would have gone insane from boredom. (You know us teenagers.

The main female character in this novel was very well done. I hope we see her again in other books in the series, but I have no way of knowing that because I review as I finish reading. I recommend this to anyone who has read and liked the previously written books in the series. I read this series in its published order, which is out of order in the timeline of the world of the series just a bit, so that I probably have a slightly different take on the series. They've all been good so far, so I say people should give them a shot if the genre is appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I read the other books in the Flinx series years ago and enjoyed them. This one was only fair-to-middlin'.The characters seems wooden and two-dimensional. The plot line was predictable and didn't seem to have much content. The emotional communication portion was overdone and a fairly tedious. There just wasn't a lot there.Perhaps it's just my tastes have changed...I'll have to go re-read Tar-Aiym and Mother Not to see...but this one just seemed a bit pro forma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeanette MacDonald - San Francisco","review":"As usual, I love it! She was one of a kind, and I always enjoy listening to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"San Francisco","review":"Poor quality sound which was to be expected considering the dates of recording. Poor selection of songs. One of which was a \\"jazzed up\\" rendition of a standard. MacDonald should stick to light opera and semi-classical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better but falls flat, very flat","review":"This movie suffers from creativity. It does try to by incorporating some Chinese superstitions but it never really materializes and falls back to the typical, overused \\"murderer\\" plots without much to it. If only the scriptwriters developed the screenplay around the Chinese superstition, it would have been better.For a movie that is based LOSELY on Chinese superstitions, try Feng Shui (Philippine horror) though I must warn that the execution and acting is quite bad but the concept behind it is quite unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont want to be a maid","review":"saw the movie over the weekend and it was a pretty good movie.

A few minutes after application, I was surprised to find that the product began to roll off like dead skin. Now, if I'm feeling patient enough to use it, I mix it with my oil controller (which for non-oily people would be moisturizer) and that seems to keep it from rolling away. A fantastic product, however, should not need to be mixed with anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for what it is supposed to do","review":"In case anybody was wondering what this item is really used for: when sprinkler systems pipes break off underground, it is difficult to remove them without a lot of digging. This extractor pushes into the broken section and has enough rough surface contact with the soft plastic pipe to allow the broken pipe to be twisted free from the rest of the system. Have used the item once to remove a pipe part broken by a tree root and it worked perfectly. For the price, it is a handy little gadget to keep with the sprinkler system repair items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This tool did not work for me at all.

Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 5 seconds","review":"My husband has a landscaping business, though he already has multiple pipe extractors of other brands from irrigation supply stores, he bought this pipe extractor because of the 3/4\\" feature which is a great idea when you're dealing with limited headroom.

Classics like the title song,'Blackbird','Why Do Fools Fall in Love','In the Name of Love' - all unforgetable make this a 'must have'cd! I was privileged to see and meet Kenny at a couple of concerts. I have worn this out twice on vinyl and looked forward to the cd remix several years ago. I had heard that Kenny was not pleased with the original remix on cd and it was taken off the market, so very pleased that Sly Dog records released this finally.

Still one of my all time favorite albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem from a gem who left us too soon.","review":"I've waited years for Kenny Rankin's early work to be released to the public on CD. This is one of his best. The title track, which opens the disc, sets a serene mood for the rest of the disc. There are many fine songs here. Paul McCartney himself lauded Rankin for his version of \\"Blackbird\\", which captures the essence of the song. Whatever prompted Rankin to sing \\"Penny Lane\\" in mostly vocalese style, it was a stroke of genius. And \\"Killed a Cat\\" is an unlikely title for a very powerful song, both melody- and lyric-wise. \\"Haven't We Met\\" shows great maturity as a songwriter, considering Rankin was still quite young. These are, in my opinion, the standouts, though I can't name a bad song on the disc.It's just too bad Kenny Rankin didn't live long enough to see these albums re-released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, confusing, not one of her better books","review":"It took me a long time to finish this book. I have zipped through her other books, this one I was tempted to leave unfinished. I kept waiting to find out who? Why? etc. and then when I did, I went, no I don't think so. I am still unclear on a lot of the acts of violence and the motivation of all the characters and how they mesh and synch together. The fact that so many things are left unexplained for me is the reason I only gave 2 stars. I will read the new books in the series and hope for the best!

Things only get stranger from that moment on as Goldy the caterer tries to solve the mystery and keep up with the threats to her and her family.The Cereal Murders was a good read. It is suspenseful and full of mystery right up to the end. The characters of Goldy, Arch, Julian, and Tom are very well developed and connected. They seem like people next door. They are very believable and dimensional. The storyline was good and moved along at a fast pace. It was easy to keep reading because the events and happenings flowed easily from one to another.This was my second Goldy book and I was not disappointed. A good book to read for the mystery lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She lost me with this one....","review":"I'm reading Mott-Davidson's books in the order they were published.I like Goldy and her quirky son Arch -- and I like Schultz and Julian and Marla, but I felt this story line was weak and not too carefully thought out.

They made me nauseous.I've started the next one and hope it will satisfy as much as one of Goldy's fabulous catered affairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter of Keltoum","review":"I am surprised this hasn't won awards- the movie is remarkable in so many ways. I loved the tenderness in the eyes of the grandfather, the determination in the 'aunt'. I felt entirely engrossed and have watched it the same way twice. An entirely different kind of life, detailing with perhaps only a brief glimpse, yet revealing so much of the many boundaries, and ways people treat each other. Everyone I have recommended this movie to has remarked how striking, how hard to forget. There are many movies that are barely memorable. Not this one. I await more from this director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I have sent back two of these fixtures. They arrived in their original packaging, a thin box, not suitable for shipping. Holes were torn in both, and the fixture was battered. I counted at least six dents in the first. The second fixture had the end smashed in, and a small dent in the middle.Bottom line is, they can't get a quality fixture to your door. Perhaps, by the time you read this review, Amazon or Maxim will start double boxing. Until they do, don't waste your time or money.Home Depot isn't close to me, but I ended up going out of my way to find that they have an equivalent Hampton Bay fixture that was cheaper ($30 at HD, vs $45 for this at Amazon), and was made of a heavier gauge metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great computer","review":"Since personal computers first became available and affordable circa 1980, I have owned three different PC-compatible computers (a 286 running MS-DOS, a 486 running Windows 3.1, and a Pentium running Windows 95/98). When it came time to replace this last machine, I decided to take a look at Apple's product line. I liked what I saw. Their new operating system -- OS X -- is based on Unix, which means it can run all the GNU software. A world-class GUI called Aqua runs on top of that. My only question was which machine to buy. I decided that the towers provided more of an upgrade path than the iMac and eMac. So I bought the dual 867 MHz machine, and am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are locals - love this book.","review":"Full of ideas and covers all the good stuff.This is not a city resturant guide, however.

Go anywhere, eat wild salmon and a latte, then go do some more walks or boat trips or something like that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guidebook for an Expansive Trip","review":"I literally just got back from my trip which spanned from Berekely, CA- Vancouver, BC and we used this book throughout the whole trip. The hotel and restaurant recommendations are excellent and for every price range. We did a lot of last minute changes of plans and the book was able to help us with those hotel reservations. It also contains great maps and excellent background history of the area. If you are traveling through the Pacific Northwest I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good guide for sightseeing, but NOT for hotels, restaurants","review":"While this book provides fairly accurate guidance regarding natural features and campgrounds, don't use it a reliable guide to travel necessities that are market driven like hotels, restaurants, admission costs, etc. Each time we used the book to choose a hotel, we were surprised and sadly disappointed in either the quality, the cost, or both. The same for recommended restaurants. Admission costs were generally 20% higher than listed. No big deal, but again, for a current publication it fell short in accuracy. It's as if an earlier printing was simply published as current without checking on the accuracy of the contents.Use it as a guide, but not as a reference. I'm sure there are other sources of more accurate information for travelers."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great","review":"I had De Quervain's tendonitis (mommy's thumb) and this brace was a huge help.

It did not make it on the air of the original Batman animated series and was instead written and illustrated as a one shot by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, producers for the show.When Batman went back into production on the WB as the New Adventures, Mad Love finally got the animated treatment it deserved. Looking back at this now it's clear they used this to storyboard the episode which work perfectly. Of course there were scenes that had to be cut for the show whether it was length or content. Read the novel to find out how Harley really made it through college and got her degree. But all in all, the episode is a pretty solid adaptation of this fantastic story and Harley remains one of the best additions to Batman in the show and in comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Batman Comic","review":"Don't be fooled by it's cartoonish appearance. \\"Mad Love\\" is the best Batman comic I've ever read. Unlike many graphic novels that include great amounts of narration and description, \\"Mad Love\\" focuses more on character developement - and does it absolutely perfectly. Each character is protrayed exactly as they were meant to be. Wonderfully written, funny, emotional, and deranged, this book shows us the mysterious past of the Joker's henchgirl, lover, and victim, Harley Quinn. It will take your breath away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for Bruce Timm's work","review":"Too little is mentioned in this page of the work of Mr. Timm in this book or BTAS. He is, after all, THE creative force behind the series: his bold designs of the Dark Knight were the seed for the show. His artwork in this book brings the feeling from the TV screen to the page.Paul Dini is the best Batman writer from the animated series, and he knows how to best write the Joker, with his madcap sense of humor and violent mood. He is the perfect complement for the vision Timm wanted to bring to Batman.A real must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of the series will enjoy this....","review":"This off-shoot of the sophisticated \\"Animated Series\\" explores the Joker's insanity through his female counterpart Harley Quinn (why didn't anyone think of a character such as her in some 50 years of Bat-history??), written by the quite capable Paul Dini, who is now rumoured to be behind the scenes of the next big-screen Bat-feature.

Whether you have dance experience or not, you are better off watching a bunch of dance videos off of the internet. The video quality is cheap, and the dance moves are very basic.

The \\"box\\" is practically moving your feet in a square-like movement, that's it. You may learn a thing or two from the DVD, but it isn't worth the twenty dollars. And as you can see above me is a review with 5 stars. That review is from the creators of this DVD...which doesn't seem to be an actual costumer.

This is Churchill, at some later time, reading his speeches, in a recording studio, and what is missing is the electricity, the immediacy, the humor, the charisma of the Man in the Moment, not to mention the very real reactions he drew from his audiences.

I probably have 90% of Philip Glass cd output. Of that 90%, about 80% gives me great listening pleasure. Sadly this cd does not fall into the listening pleasure category. Like Mr Funk, the soprano grates and irritates. To be honest I gave up after listening to the first two movements and switched to the bonus cd with Ginsberg reciting his poetry. Oh dear! Sorry, Mr Ginsberg, as you fly around with the angels I have to say that speaking verse was not your strength. So I was going to give the cd to my son to sell on ebay and make some pocket money. Then I read Mr Funk's review and, on his advice, gave the first 8 minutes of third movement a listen. Yes, good Glass music. But the rest is a big disappointment.

The singer's voice is beautiful but an hour of it is too much and destroys whatever is left. I'm already hard of hearing but it's nearly impossible for to appreciate the music while the singer is warbling to her heart's content. Except for the intense first 8 minutes of the third movement where the music has a sense of Glassian urgency that begs your attention, I can't listen to any of it. Again, I'm not a fan of opera. When you're losing your hearing, you want what you do hear to make sense and opera doesn't translate for me. I'll defer to those who review this symphony with 5 stars and who understand and appreciate opera. But, I prefer Glass' instrumental music and this symphony simply doesn't have enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Polish Yet","review":"This funky little film is very likeable. I agree that there is too much cussing (for no apparent reason), but it's a pleasant trip with a couple of deluded dreamers. The tone isn't obviously any one thing - comedy? drama? - but that doesn't hurt it. Garrett Morris is really good, and Jon \\"Uncle Rico\\" Gries gets about his best part yet. Most of the singing competitions are amusing, but there are no giant laughs. The haters might be mad because there is no action, no explosions, no operatic high notes being struck (narratively). Well, too bad. It's the cinematic equivalent of a sad old country song - appropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"Too many cuss words, and an improbable plot made this movie a complete waste of time.

This one follows in the formers' footsteps, though the story has nothing to do with the original. Nobody can remember what the hell the original story is anymore anyway. Down to the nitty gritty: this movie is plain dumb, unentertaining, and not scary in the least. The acting from a bunch of who-knows players is truly Z-movie level material. The writing and effects are not any better. Every horror cliche is ripped off with checkmate proficiency throughout this film. I'm embarrassed that I watched the whole thing, but like a trainwreck just after it occurred, I couldn't look away. I guess my intent here is to steer everyone clear of wasting an hour and a half, or whatever it is. It's hard to believe that 23 years on, the DeFeo murders are still being milked and the product is this claptrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dollhouse one is just plain stupid....watch the 1st one","review":"Dollhouse is not worth watching and i regret watching it. Concept is interesting but the screenplay and acting is bad and because of that, it wasn't scary. Just like alot of bad acted and script movies on a good concept, it can destroy the movie entirely and this one takes the cake. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself. The special affects team should be fired for doing such a terrible job at it, if one can call that special affects. I call it a joke. I recommend watching the first one of the series and stop at that. No. 8 must be the worst along with 'the new generation' amityville episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Me!!!!","review":"I don't blame the movie as much as I blame me for watching this stuff knowing that it isn't going to be any good and then getting mad because it was as bad as I thought it was going to be.

Vendler's clear personal affection for Heaney--revealed by her familiar biographical detail and history teaching alongside the poet at Harvard--doesn't so much bias her critical approach as much as limit the reach of her inquiry.She's made up her mind so neatly, boxed her topoi up so tightly, that these essays feel more like a hermetic prescription than a platform from which to launch interesting criticism and discourse. One gets the feeling that a critic with more distance from her subject might produce fresher, more engaging criticism.Heaney's stunning work and Vendler's accomplished scholarship have both seen better settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toffee Is Special","review":"I received this toffee as a gift.

My main objection is that the characters were so shallow as to be uninteresting. Also, there were so many science lectures inserted that I think the average reader will be lost (I have an undergraduate degree in biology and graduate school in physiology and I found them to be too diadactic). This book follows in the genre of \\"The Population Bomb\\" and \\"Silent Spring\\", in which scientists vastly overstate the case of the horrors of environmental contamination. OK, these books were not written as fiction as was \\"DUST,\\" but the effect is still the same; OVERKILL. In summary, I found the book to be shallow and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

We don't like the pests that sting us in the summer, or invade are kitchens. However without the flies, beetles and ants are position at the top could be reversed!

The way all of nature is related is something I never really thought about before. And the chain of events in this book shows how when one species fails, it affects another and so on and so on..... Could have been edited down some but overall a very good, scary read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and didactic","review":"Yet another end of the millenium apocalyptic novel which is characterized by excessive didactic science explanations and 2-dimensional characters. The book also includes a pompous afterword section - an exercise in over-justification. I have to admit an interesting scientific premise is developed (for a SF novel) but spoilt in the execution by rather clumsy writing. Perhaps the author should stick to the non-fiction science genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might want to skip these Mites","review":"High hopes for this novel, I love an end of the world scenario especially when it has creepy crawlies and natural occuring disasters. It didnt hook me, mostly because of its slow narrative and uninteresting characters.

I don't mind the political bias of the text (as some reviewers apparently did), I just hate being told I'm being told a story. I lost count of the number of times the narrative ground to a halt to say that more plagues were going to strike; it would have been a much better work if the author had merely described the striking of said plagues. If you're set on reading an ecological disaster story, \\"Stand on Zanzibar\\" and \\"The Sheep Look Up\\" by John Brunner are infinitely superior to this, and also out of print. Good luck finding them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"This man cannot write. I only finished the book because I paid good money for it, which I regret having done.

This novel is a real roller coaster of emotions, and yet filled with scientific ideas that are seriously thought provoking -- if not always convincing through the characters in the story.Pellegrino manages to infuse a lot of ironic wit, social satire and droll humor into subject matter that could otherwise be incredibly depressing. And the book is about hope and perseverence, as much as about destruction. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superior Eco-collapse Book.","review":"A classic page turner, where the plot races towards a climax that you can foresee but not predict. If you like Michael Crichton's books, then you will like this book. Be warned that what starts as mankind surviving an fascinating eco-collapse midway through the book turns into a plot about the heroes surviving against the actions of their fellow men. The more interesting eco-collapse theme takes a backseat to the sometimes contrived and highly coincidental interactions between heroes, villains and victims. Still, Dust is worth reading for the scientific \\"what-if\\" alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is Less","review":"\`Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in Ice' Pellegrino says it will end in a plague of mites, no wait, bats, no, fungus, wait, wait, how about, nuclear war? No? A comet?Apocalyptic stories succeed and fail on 2 things. 1. An emotional connection to those in peril. Which Pellegrino FAILS to deliver.And 2. An interesting, frightening, overwhelming \`antagonist'. To say that Pellegrino takes the opposite approach would be doing a disservice to the word \`opposite'. The mites, fungus, bats all are just symptoms.... Of another symptom, of... well we never learn what causes it all. That's right, a end-of-the-world story that doesn't tell you why the world ended.And while were on the subject of the world ending, does it? What happens to Europe, Asia, Africa, the rest of America? Pellegrino doesn't know, and neither will you. So its got that going for it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This would be a fantastic movie!","review":"This is one of the best science fiction books I've read. It's a page turner. I hate bugs but I've known for quite awhile that they have a place on the earth (but I still wonder about mosquitoes). Civilization falls apart pretty quick in this story.There is some offbeat humor I appreciate. Lets just say I'm not a Sinatra fan either but I think the guy in this book takes his dislike too far.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because he tried to hard to explain the science behind it all too much. After all, it's a novel, not a textbook. I understood it but had to re-read it and think about it. Then again, maybe that's a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible writing","review":"The premise of this book is excellent and I started reading it with great anticipation, but I quickly was greatly annoyed by the author's style of telling you events instead of showing them through narrative. Soon I was disgusted by his lack of any exposition of what was supposed to be happening. I gave up after struggling through half of it. It has been several months since I tried to read it and I forget many of the details but the memory of his poor writing remains. I consigned the book to the trash can where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous, preachy, an un-thrilling thriller","review":"A tedious examination of a totally implasible scenario resulting in the end of \\"life as we know it\\". Uninteresting characters spend endless pages discussing the philosophical and metaphysical reasons behind and implications of an occurrance that would certainly destroy the planet's current eco-system, but just could never happen. In addition, in the afterward, Pellegrino reiterates the urban legend regarding the death of Dr. Charles Drew, and claims it true. His poor fact checking further undermines any credibilty the science in this book may have ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting premise; poor writing, weakly-drawn characters","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. While the premise is interesting and plausible, the characters are not. The writing is \\"jumpy\\" and difficult to follow. An important criterion of a good novel is that the characters must become \\"real\\" for the reader; and, for me, there wasn't a single character in this book who did. I am an avid reader who enjoys a variety of fiction and non-fiction, and I appreciate a good book of \\"Dust\\"'s genre. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't make the cut. I almost never give up on a book before finishing it, but I almost did this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this guy to writers' camp!","review":"How did this book get published?

Some of the songs seem dated with the 1980's electric keyboard sound but there are two songs that make it all worth it: \\"Heaven Knows\\" and \\"Ship of Fools\\" possibly some of Robert Plants best solo work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"No one can say that I didn't try. I've attempted to like this album - I've listened to it three times, but I just can't like it. The music is grating; Plant's voice sounds thin; the songs are forgettable. As is often the case, the work of the individual musician hardly ever lives up to the music produced by the parent band. Talent will get you far, but the \\"magic\\" of the lineup will take you to the musical heights that all aspiring rockers seek.

I see that people who bought this album also bought stuff from U2- I should explain that U2 are considered one of the most overrated bands of all time.Now Robert Plant has recorded the occassional good song but I urge you readers not to buy this album.If you're reading this Robert I hope you won't take offense since you seem to be a nice man, but not everyone likes your music.

It is very cleanly recorded with very restrained, almost fragile, instrumentation in parts. The poppier direction of some of the tunes and the increased use of atmospherics via keyboards may not please all the fans of his earlier solo pieces but the quality of the backing musicians means that, for me at least, things still hang together quite well.In terms of actual songs, personal faves would be Heaven Knows, Ship of Fools and the stop/start Helen of Troy. This record is a testament to Plants refusal to stand still and his evolution as an artist with integrity and the ability to come up with consistently good material.A worthy release any Plant fan should get themselves acquanted with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Plant Now & Zen","review":"I happen to be a huge Robert Plant fan so I may be a little biased when I say that I loved this cd.

The albums were very mature, and it seemed as if he were telling people to quit thinking about LZ and \\"listen to THIS\\". This fourth CD, unfortunately, initiates his slide back into his own legend, even using samples of LZ tunes on some tracks and using Jimmy Page on another... just a warm-up for the commercialized releases and reunions that were to follow. The only tracks I can recommend are \\"The Way I Feel\\" and \\"Ship of Fools\\".

My question is why did they have to write pretty much the same story and add Elmo. Must he poke his little red head into every aspect of Seasame Street there is. The story lost some of its suspence when he was added. The children in my class when I read the first book they were the ones pushing Grover through the story. In this one Elmo is pushing Grover along and not the children. If you are looking for a great book for your children pick the first one and leave Elmo out.P.S I have read this with Early Childhood classrooms and Special Education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original!","review":"The thing that made the first Monster at the End of This Book so good was the interaction between Grover and the child.

It seemed like they wanted to shove Elmo into a classic book, rename it, and kind of 'pass the torch' to Elmo, or maybe 'trump' Grover with Elmo. There is no reason to dd anything or any other Muppet. The book was great, and is a Sesame Street classic. Just because Elmo is maybe the favorite Muppet right now, doesn't mean they have to stick him everywhere!Retire this book, and don't have a book that will take away from the great original!As with movies, 'sequels' are not always the best.Put this book to rest, take it out of print, and leave a success where it belongs.I loved the original as a kid, and will not bother buying this for anyone.Let the kids tell Grover to turn the page, not have a lame awkward insertion of Elmo telling Grover to turn it!This is beneath Elmo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get the original \\"Monster at the end of this Book\\"","review":"This book had potential, but has none of the charm of the original. It is poorly written, Elmo is more obnoxious than usual and Grover is useless. I bought it because my 2 year old loves ELMO. She gets bored with the book and doesn't let us read it. We also have \\"the Monster at the End of the This Book\\" starring Grover. She LOVES this book, she sits through the whole book, and wants it read over and over.

Its is just as fun as the first one, especially when Grover & Elmo get to the last page, anticipating a monster and scare each other half to death....kids LOVE how they scream \\"AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHH!\\" at the shock of seeing one another. So yeah, even though I usually don't like remakes & sequels, especially concerning things that were near and dear to me as a child (as the original was), and while I also got tired of the whole Elmo craze and preferred the original Sesame Street characters, I still have a great love for this book & would encourage anyone and everyone to get it.

It's not all sunshine and smiles for these two, and I liked them all the better for that reason.Another great thing is the amazing descriptions of Central Asia and the Middle East. Although sometimes the details were a little tedious, they really helped the pace of the book, it was a little like watching and Indiana Jones movie.All in all, I found this book to be more serious than most romances.

Duffy is a highly complex poet who skillfully creates a palimphset of images and meanings. Those who interpret her poetry as one-dimentional and unvarying in theme simply lack the vision or the energy to look more deeply into the poetry. Duffy's words have the power to reach into your heart and touch you to the point of tears or to make you laugh out loud, those who remain un-moved are sadly numb to the raw emotion of her outpourings. The vibrant humour, vivid descriptions and at times brutal honesty these collected poems has made Duffy one of my favourite poets of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Is this the state of modern poetry? Duffy has been strangley credited for being original but her political and sociological comments are overdone and attempts to be witty are just dull.

There is little hint on this record of just what a first rate songwriter Nicks was during the late 1970s and even through her far superior first solo album, \\"Bella Donna.\\" By this point, stardom had apparently robbed Stevie of her ambitions, and she was content to merely release mediocre albums to fulfill her recording contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitively Not Her Best","review":"This is a very sad album to listen to. True, the music is different and that is ok. Stevie opted to go towards a more pop/dance sound instead of the mystic rock of her previous solo and Fleetwood Mac releases. I could handle the switch in styles and the heavy 80's sound...but the vocals are terrible. It is painfully obvious that her voice had enough abuse at this point and the result is a grating, tired croak throughout the album. Listening to her voice in Bella Donna and Wild Heart in which she weaves her then gorgeous instrument into a spell, is breathtaking. Unfortunately Rock a Little shows what can happen to a gifted voice if it is not taken care of. Her following albums were better but she never completely recuperated (she probably has nodes in her vocal chords). During her tour for Fleetwood Mac's The Dance she hired a vocal teacher and there was some improvement. I hope she is still seeing this voice teacher. I would love to hear her voice improve even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stevie's worst effort","review":"I'm a huge fan of Stevie's, but this is by far her worst album. At this point in her career, Nicks was depending more heavily than ever before or since on outside songwriters and arrangers. The result is an over-synthesized mess, and it's painful to listen to the way she misuses her voice on tracks like \\"Sister Honey\\" and \\"I Can't Wait.\\" \\"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You,\\" though a beautiful song, is marred by a cheesy synth backdrop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, but I doesn't cut my cheese","review":"This album wasn't as good because of drug adiction and substence abuse, (so I've heard).

I believe it was written because of her drug adiction, (I don't know). But I think my answer is right because when I was watching VH1 Behind The Music on her a long time ago, (no I am band) it said that when Stevie had troubled times she would turn to the piano, (or synthisiser) and they played a clip of \\"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?\\" Her voice doesn't sound much different, but ON OTHER SONGS, I would think fans excepted something better."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function C(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",R,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(W,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-917c4b34"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/68.md","filePath":"people/68.md"}'),L={name:"people/68.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
