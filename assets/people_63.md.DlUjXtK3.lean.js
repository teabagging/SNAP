Once I saw the book, I remembered my joke that if you went out to eat at the department store which I thought was a restaurant, everybody would be very hungry(because it's not a restaurant)and started telling the story to my friends with the same material, except in the end of my version, as the family leaves mad at Froggy, they see a billboard for the department store described above, then go to eat there and the consequence is that everybody ends up very hungry(because they try going to eat somewhere that isn't even a restaurant). In other words, my joke about the department storewould be very useful in this story as it would be better than the real ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewards for misbehavior?","review":"I was quite surprised and disappointed to see Froggy being rewarded by a trip to his favorite fast food restaurant after he behaved miserably at the restaurant his parents chose. Reinforcing misbehavior is not appropriate. I expected a book to help my kids understand how to behave in a restaurant setting (which they almost always do).

And many in Harlem thought he didn't manage it. And if you think Gene Krupa is the top drummer of the Thirties, maybe you should think again.These tracks are simpler than Ellington's, but still of considerable interest. Those composed or arranged by the fine alto saxophonist Edgar Sampson are especially worth listening to, for example \\"Stomping at the Savoy\\" and \\"Blue Minor\\".Chronogical [sic] Classics did a good job on this one; all the 78's appear to have been good copies and the transfers and remastering came off well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Chick","review":"Except for the first two songs, this cd's tracks can be found in their entirety on the Chick Webb cd, \\"Rhythm Man,\\" $9 for the mp3 album.

Even for some of the simplest topics in this very challenging course, it bogs everything down with details. For instance, it will explain in one sentence a huge principle that is important, yet the next page is nothing but a table of receptors. No one in the world could memorize this material. Even my professor understands that. Yet the book is so devoted to these details that the reader misses the bigger picture, which is the most important thing of all. Overall, I am very dissapointed. I had to purchased another text to cope with these problems. Doing research on a particular topic in a lab and need a reference? Buy the book. Teaching an undergraduate class in immunology?

Hyperlinks to figures, tables and other sections of the text make it easy to navigate and learn the material on a smaller device such tablet device. That is certainly not true of the Kindle version of Janeway, which is merely a copy of the the paper version with no hyperlinks.

The material covered in here is vast but the authors do not explain all of them clearly enough. I also do not like the figures drawn throughout the book. They are hard to follow and somewhat confusing for me. However, this book is a good reference for a quick review. If you have time and need to study more about immunology, I would suggest you to read the book written by Janeway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Immunology Text to have","review":"This immunology textbook has been what many bioloy students are waiting for. Among other well-known texts, this book is the thinest. However, the materails contained are so comprehensive that it can be used as a regular textbook. There are not many illustrations in this book as you usually see in a typical immunology book but these group of authors have done a nice job describing many difficult topics ( such as immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, B and T cell maturation, complement, Hypersensitivity etc.) easier and clearer by using simple language. Moreover,this new edition has been updated with very recent knowledge of immunology. If you anyhow don't like Kuby or Janeways' books, this book can be another excellent one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro, the way a textbook should be","review":"My only immunology background was in medical school in the early 80s. I bought this book to try to get a basic grasp on what immunology is about now, 20 years later. This book is excellent for that. As other reviewers have commented, the material is well organized and illustrated. The illustrations are numerous enough and detailed enough to almost form an outline in their own right.While there is considerable repetition, I consider that this is one of the best features of the book for a newcomer such as I. The repetition is clearly very intentional, not the result of disorganization or sloppy editing. Rather it is enough to let the reader grasp both the forest and the trees. It also lets you, to some extent, read from any section of the book without being totally lost if you don't remember the previous material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good update of current topics in immunology","review":"The book includes updates of current topics in immunology.

Many of these photos are of Native Americans, both in the Pueblos of New Mexico, and in Navajo and Apache territory in Arizona. The prints, in particular, represent some of the best photo portraits from these cultures in existence.Some of the pictures will just surprise you. My favorite is one of the Wright Brothers' plane, flown at a fair in Colorado in 1914. I really enjoyed this book.

It has many strains of beneficial bacteria, it is shelf-stable (no refrigeration needed) so it is easy to take with me on trips, and it WORKS. My whole digestion has improved, and no more constipation...EVER. I absolutely believe that everyone should take a good probiotic, and I heartily recommend this one. And I add: if this one doesn't make you feel terrific and correct digestive problems, please try another that perhaps has different strains of bacteria. I do think that this is a good place to start, as the price is reasonable and Jarrow is a quality manufacturer.

I'd hoped that it would help with my GERD condition which, after many years, barely responds to prescription medication (I've tried them all). After a month's use the condition is unchanged, the Jarrow has had no affect on my lower GI, as my bowel movements are the same, and I certainly do not feel any more energy. I will continue to finish off the box and, if my conditions change, I will revise my rating.I do not doubt the favorable reviews but, based upon my experience, this product is not a cure-all(or a cure-everyone)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not help my IBS symtoms","review":"My wife purchased this for me to help me with my intestial issues and cramping.Unfortunately for me, it did not help.

I have found only one so far that worked fairly well for about 8 months until 2 sets of anti-biotic pills destroyed my digestion. I am currently trying Florastor.

My constipation is horrible and the only probiotic that has ever worked was the \\"Probiotic Pearls IC\\" (not the regular pearls).

I got home and caught it at the end of the first song and asked him to restart it which he did. Whoa man. Out of the speakers came the music of the gods. It is my opinion that this may be the greatest, soul-filled, rock n roll album ever made. I burned a hole through 2 vinyl copies so it was great to see this CD issue with the extra tracks. The extras are not needed but are a nice plus. I am in heaven with this terrific sounding disc. I keep searching for a new vinyl edition though. Long live vinyl and Leon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top class remix with bonus tracks","review":"I had a tape of the original recording in the 70's that is now long past its use by date. This remix is excellent, each instrument is bright and clear with no loss at the bass end (and no tape hiss). The liner notes list the performers on each track and the recording details. Not important for everyone but necessary for those who are interested in the music makers. This CD is a must for Leon Russell fans and comes with three bonus tracks each performed in Leon Russell's unmistakable style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Russell alternately brings feeling and energy to the tracks on this amazing album. There are tracks you can kick back to and others you will want to turn up. The musicians along for the ride are stellar. This guy should have been a huge star (he was on his way in the early 70's), but as Gatemouth Brown told a friend of mine, Leon \\"spent a little too much time in the 60's.\\" Luckily, albums like Leon Live, and the self titled LP clearly show what he was capable of and why he was so sought after as a musician by the greats of his day (The Stones, Clapton, George Harrison, Cocker, Dylan). If you like any of the names just mentioned there is probably something on this album for you. A lot of the tracks are the kind found on Exile on Main Street (full-sound -- gospel back-up singers, horns). Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Brew, Just Not Everyone's Cup of Tea ....","review":"Leon Russell is not for everyone. Some of the songs on other albums are just plain strange and his off pitch voice can cause some people to involuntarily cringe, but if a person is going to like a Leon Russell album, this is the one it is going to be. The song writing is excellent (How can you go wrong with Russell, Dylan, and Harrison?), his vocals are \\"par Leon\\" and the musical side is superb. In my opinion this is his best album.I would describe this album as gospel rock with an okie blues twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"joke book","review":"I believe this tome was funny in many aspects and some of the jokes were really funny.

It is an all-around wonderful product and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!!","review":"I love this stuff! It's so convenient and it really cleans my face well. The reason why I gave it four stars is because I have to use multiple exfoliating cotton pads to get my make up off even after I use a make up removing wipe. And I don't wear a lot of make up. But eventually it does get it clean. But it really is worth it for me to use it because I rarely wear make up so cleaning my face is a breeze most of the time. I also have very sensitive skin- lately I seem to be allergic to everything. But this does not break me out or irritate my skin AT ALL! It also has lasted me a very long time. I would recommend trying this! It's worked so well for me, and nothing does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It sometimes irritated my eyes but took off makeup really well. Very light product. Doesn't leave any residue behind. Left my skin feeling clean.

The description and science behind Crealine seemed perfect for my sensitive skin. (And the idea of it--washing your face without water?! So bohemian!)Unfortunately, my face was covered with tiny, dry, and itchy bumps the day after the first use. I stuck with the product for about 1 week, only using it in the morning, and the bumps remained. I wanted to blame the hot weather, but the cause was definitely the Crealine! I immediately went to see a dermatologist afterwards because it made me intolerant to all of the products I had previously used (jojoba oil, aloe vera gel, and Cetaphil).If you have normal skin (i.e. not acne-prone, not eczematous), I think you should try this product. It's theoretically a great idea, and a lot of people seem to really love it. But if your skin is extremely sensitive, I would stay away from it despite it's claim of being effective on sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never going without this again","review":"This micelle/cleansing water is the jam. It removes my makeup with out burning or stinging. I can take off my eyeliner and mascara and my eyes are not irritated at all, even if I've still got my contacts in. It isn't oily like many makeup removers can be, its consistency really is like water. This is not a toner, or something you use after you wash your face. This is your facewash. All you need is a cotton pad and you are good to go. No soap, no water, no lather just Bioderma. This is also great if you don't wear makeup but just want to get the daily grime off. I'd recommend it for anybody, men, women, teens, any age really. I bought this one because I'd been having some breakouts from other products and wanted something for sensitive skin. The brand also makes formulas for dry, oily/acne prone, and normal skin as well. I've used the YSL micelle water and prefer this hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this!","review":"It is very gentle and soothing cleanser which I cannot live without. You should try it.

She has not come to our home yet since she is not completely weaned. But this awesome crate is waiting for her when she gets here in about a week.

I was surprised since I have two other new pairs of Timberland shoes that fit perfectly.So, I requested a return. The vendor, Frankels of Brooklyn NY sent me an email with return instructions. I was very surprised to find that they charge $10 for a return. Add the $20 UPS charge to ship it back to them and you are looking at a big penalty for online shopping.But that's not all.

Yes, he does have a knack for finding interesting people to talk to, but once he's done that, he seems content to record what they say and leave it at that. One thing he does try to stress is what a melting pot England has become since WWII and what a diverse array of lifestyles it now hosts. But unless you're completely unaware and still think Britain is nothing more than a country of cozy tea rooms and ye olde tradition, none of this is news.

I'm on the last four pages of the next to last chapter. It's obvious (to me) that the rest of the book exists merely as a contrast and backdrop to... er... well... ME! Some parts of it are wrong. I don't have a pentagram on my wall, I don't look like Yogi Bear... etc. But I suppose Nik Cohn couldn't be seen to be in any way supporting me. It would hardly boost his reputation! If he'd better suggested what the book was really about - I'd have given it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winterberry dinnerware","review":"Soft colors, delicate style, good size mugs, wonderful side pieces such as the Teapot, sugar & creamer, butter dish and salt and pepper shakers.

Not much spellslinging if that is what you are into. All around quality book, a little bit heavy on the self-hate. The hero has no emotions as part of what makes him a weapon and he all of a sudden grows them...then grows them again which bothered me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I love books with magic, martial arts, love and all the sorts. I definitely love human modification. When people get turned into humanoid monsters with no emotion and become free but still retain a bit of humanity, even with people hunting them, more likely than not always going to be a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weapon of Flesh","review":"Weapon of Flesh has a really interesting mesh of elements. It combines a martial arts feel with a touch of organized crime, all mixed with traditional fantasy. Sounds a little strange--you're thinking ninja-Godfather with Elves in tunics aren't you? Well, you'd be right. And believe me, it actually works!The story begins with a boy, stolen from his mother and magically altered into a killing machine. (I found it amazing that the author made me connect with a character who was almost completely emotionless.) His training complete at the age of 16, the boy leaves with the man who has \\"made\\" him--a man he only knows as \\"Master\\"--to be handed over to the tyrant who has commissioned him.But the boy is not delivered as promised, when his Master is killed and he suddenly finds himself alone, no idea where his destiny lies, but consumed with the need to find purpose.Excellent read, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging story worth","review":"Recommended, good story line, suspenseful and great depisctions of superhuman movement.

Chris had recommended Weapon of Flesh and I purchased it from him directly.I must admit it is a compelling read and thoroughly draws the reader into the scenes with extremely good narrative and scene setting which I found very easy to submerse into.

Hey, Leiber and Stoller are one of the top 3 songwriting teams in the HISTORY of rock (McCartney-Lennon and Holland-Dozier-Holland are the only other ones who could hold a candle), and most of their best work is available in THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. So here's a clue: start with a Drifters best-of, then move to the Coasters. Then Elvis and Ben E. King's solo stuff. If you still can't get enough (and you won't), then start looking for 50's and 60's compilations with the missing essential tracks (Kansas City,Love Potion #9, I Who Have Nothing).

I guess you are not talking about a return to \\"Earth Wind and Fire\\" form, because this new CD \\"The Promise\\" is not the EWF I know.This CD is for the most part has (for the most part) bland-generic songwriting, way too many ballads, no energy, and the production is very COLD and computerized. I can honestly say there are two songs that even sound like classic Earth Wind and Fire. Those are \\"All in the Way\\", and \\"Dirty\\" which is an old EWF song. That is why I give this CD 2 stars instead of 1.It saddens me to see one of my favorite bands of all time playing music like this. I know they have the talent to be more creative, because they are still GREAT live. Why they can't use this energy on CD, I have no idea. This CD has NO live energy whatsoever.

These songs make their previous album look like a fast and furious blast of funk from their past. I give it one star because there is one excellent song on the disk. \\"Dirty\\", (1976?) is by far the only song on this CD that makes you realize it really is E-W-F!I can't understand the logic by what others are saying. I think too many people just WANT E-W-F to sound good. Don't worry, there's always \\"Gratitude\\" to listen too and remember when funk music was truly FUNK MUSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have been released","review":"I have been an E,W&F fans since the 70's and was very saddened by their newest released.

Their time had passed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"earth, wind ,and alot of fire!!!!!","review":"Its almost like they never left. Maurice White is back in full action as leader and executive producer. Which brings some of their \\"oldstyle arrangements\\" back in todays mix of neo-soul, and hip-hop.

Thanx for adding another good album to your inventory for us to explore again."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONG AWAITED!","review":"EWF is *BACK*!! I have waited anxiously for this release since I heard over a year ago that they would be making it. EWF is my all-time favorite group, and once I heard this CD I felt so good, like back in the day when they'd release something and I'd just bought and played it. For those persons who say that they were a little disappointed with this one I offer this: what group do you know of who has been making music for over 30 years can consistently come back and give quality music to the fans? The Isley Brothers? Now that's where MY disappointment comes in -- they've abandoned me, the true Old School fan, by trying too hard to \\"rope in\\" today's younger listener -- their later releases seem to have been lost on that generation.

I fell in love with EW&F's music instantly and own everything they've had out.\\"The Promise\\" was so unexpectedly great that I simply can not stop listening to the CD. \\"Betcha\\" and \\"Where do we go from here\\" are my favorites, but the entire CD brings back the spirit of the 70's.\\"The Promise\\" is different compare to \\"All 'N All\\", \\"Spirit\\", \\"I Am\\", \\"Faces\\" and \\"Gratitude\\" but sounds just as magical and great.The bottom line is that this CD basically blows away everything else that is currently going on in the world of R&B.Can not wait for another masterpiece from my favorite EW&F."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth Wind & Fire Fulfills The Promise","review":"This is the release EWF fans have been waiting for.

Then when I heard \\"The World I Know\\" on the radio, WooooWeeee!, I was swinging to those strings and singing along. Then I bought the cd a few weeks ago and now I have a new fave: \\"Smashing Young Man\\". I can barely stay still when I hear that catchy guitar work in that tune. All the songs are lively and driven, though most of their tricks have been done before.

They are one of the best bands out there, and certainly don't get enough recognition. The songs on the album are varied, from the quiet \\"The World I Know\\" to the pounding \\"Where The River Flows.\\" If you were going to buy just one of the band's CDs, this should be it. It's also nice to see a band that isn't buying into all this gloomy angry rock we've been seeing so much of in recent years. On a final note, if you get the chance, see Collective Soul in concert, because they're even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply A Play-Through","review":"Looking over some other reviews, there's one important point missing: Not only does this disc rock, but it's a \\"play-through\\" (no throw-away songs you're forced to skip over). There isn't a song on here I would rate less than 9/10. Even the last track, so often a throw-away on other albums, is incredible (heartbreaking little guitar solo.)I have been listening to this disc for over ten years, and it still sounds fresh.

I was really inspired by The World I Know-my favorite song of all time. Everyone should at least listen to one minute of track#3 and then will more than likely buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jammin'","review":"I judge an album's worth by how much I want to grab my guitar and learn its songs. The first time I heard COLLECTIVE SOUL, with its first cut, \\"Simple,\\" I was dusting off my old Fender, plugging in, and jamming away. \\"Simple\\" is definitive, hard-driving rock 'n roll, the kind of sound that gets the blood pumping as you crank up the volume. The entire CD is full of keepers, especially \\"Where The River Flows\\" and \\"Bleed.\\" And what can one say about the metaphysical ballad \\"The World I Know,\\" other than \\"Play that song again!\\"I agree with the other reviewers that this self-titled album is Collective Soul's best. It's progressive rock with an edge: not too metal, not too alternative. I compare this band's impact with Boston's emergence two decades before. Collective Soul IS Boston, only with a '90's feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"Smashing\\" album!","review":"Collective Soul's self-titled second album is great. Not only do you get the hits \\"Gel,\\" \\"The World I Know\\" and \\"Smashing Young Man,\\" but many of the other songs on this album also deserve to be hits. This is one of the catchiest bands out there, with great writing, singing and playing. If you haven't heard them yet or simply don't have this album yet, do yourself a favor and buy it. It's a guaranteed toe-tapper/ foot-stomper/ head-banger, whatever you do best."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a must have","review":"this is an awesome album... without a doubt. it ranks among dark side of the moon, led zeppelin IV and all other great rock albums.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Pop-Alt-Rock","review":"OK, all right, I wrote off Collective Soul after \\"Shine\\", figuring I'd never hear from them again. The fluke hit \\"Gel\\" (let's face it, any hit song from the Jerky Boys movie is automatically a fluke) was goofy fun, but didn't exactly leave me howling for more. But this album is a very good listen from a band I frankly didn't expect much from. Mixing good hard songs (\\"Smashing Young Man\\", \\"She Gathers Rain\\", \\"Gel\\") with good soft songs (\\"When the Water Falls\\", \\"The World I Know\\", \\"December\\") makes for a pretty good listen from start to finish. A few of the songs don't make much impression on me, and they do seem to have only two modes of play (hard and soft), but they keep things interesting enough through the whole disc. Recommended for pop/rock/alt fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing O_O","review":"I come back to this album year after year and it sounds just as good as it did back in '95 (I was like 7 then). This album has lots of childhood memories for me because my dad would listen to this all the time. The track \\"The world I know\\" can bring me to tears if I listen to this too late in the night... I can't say that about many songs honestly. This is just a timeless release and every track on here is gold.

He is my favorite perfomer of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst cd I have ever heard","review":"I never thought that Michael could put out such a bad cd as this one. Let me try to explain!First off, he used a lot of arrangements with electronic instrumentation. I alwyas felt that Michael was conservative and would stick to acoustic instrumentation. Boy was I wrong!Secondly, I thought Michael did a poor job with his repertoire. The only bright spot for this cd is the fact that his voice sounded great. I hope Michael never tries to do another project with this kind of flavor.Recommendation: I can not honestly recommend this cd to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend the extra money for paul mitchell","review":"fair price but no tingle. the paul mitchell tea tree is worth the extra money and is a far better product. if i had it to over again, i'd pass on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dulling, can't rinse clean","review":"I usually use the L'Oreal EverPure line of sulfate-free shampoos/conditioners, but when this was on sale one day at the grocery store I decided to give it a shot.

Having been mostly educated on slavery in the US South, I was shocked to discover that there were vastly more slaves in Brazil and that the Brazilian slavery system lasted practically until 1890.

The stainless portion of the element (or whatever it's coated with) began to flake off and a ton of buildup would deposit on the rest of the element.

Water gurgles/spits out of the spout while its boiling and I have gotten burned. The spout is also poorly designed, the water doesn't come out in an even stream, it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid. The heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean. The water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it.I just bought the Braun WK200B about a week ago. It is everything this kettle isn't and so much more.

Treble is also clear and accurate. If I had to make a complaint about the speakers, it would be that the lack of a dedicated midrange speaker in the cabinet seems to cause a slight deficiency in that range of the spectrum, mostly at high volumes. But this is only a minor quibble and does not detract from the high overall sound quality, good build quality, and low price of these speakers.

The writers tried, I think, but their writing was very turgid, repetitive and seemed to try too hard to be scholarly or profound.Two parts of the book show the writers interacting with their own mentors in \\"learning to read.\\" Those sections were excellent.I donated my copy to my local Temple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss Heaven!!!","review":"I've been a Bliss fan for awhile now, but this HAS to be by far my favorite product from them. I love the scent of vanilla, but most of the time it smells too sweet and sugary in bath products - like it was made for an 8 year old. By Bliss adding the bergamot to balance it, you get the yumminess of the vanilla with a more mature fragrance. Not to mention it leaves your skin feeling REALLY soft. I am addicted to the scrub and daily lotion in this scent as well. A definite \\"must buy\\" for any vanilla lovers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda's best early album","review":"...and quite possibly in the Top 5 of her best recordings ever.

The dough doesn't rip when the press is used and they are a nice size. They fell out of the metal tray easily with just a shake as long as it was sprayed with Pam. They came out in two separate rows but the individual raviolis didn't separate at first. Once they dried for a bit, they were easy to separate without ripping. I didn't realize I needed to use cornmeal or parchment paper on the baking sheet I shook them out onto. They tend to stick and/or rip otherwise. This was definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a time saver","review":"It does not really save time, so you might as well do everything by hand. The dough sticks to the sides and it is rather hard to get the ravioli out if you miss a tiny spot and not put a lot of flour on every crease of the metal part.

I've learned that the secret to getting the dough the right consistency is starting with the wet ingredients and adding just enough dry ingredients to get it to feel right. Have ordered a food scale to get it down even better. Can't wait to do it again. Another recommendation: Make your own Ricotta-- it's stupid-easy, really.

Also, brush an egg wash around all areas that will be seamed. You have to roll with a bit of pressure, but the ravioli will come right out of the mold when turned over and tapped lightly if you use this method.A Kitchen Aid pasta roller works great when used in conjunction with this.

I rolled out the dough, placed it over the base, made wells in the dough using the plastic form, put the filling in the wells, placed another piece of dough on top, then rolled over it all with a rolling pin. It worked better than I hoped it would. I used Pam cooking spray on the metal base first and the ravioli popped right out, I just banged it lightly on the counter. I was worried about having trapped air pockets in the dough - I did not want the ravioli to open up in the cooking water. Every one of these held together during cooking. I froze the leftovers and they cooked well the second time too. I made a filling with Italian sausage and a couple of kinds of cheese and it was great!

Not two though, cause he's still opposed to the idea of having molds for ravioli. The authentic way is to eat ravioli with sage and butter sauce, but I felt like eating it with homemade ragù, so I did. BLASPHEMY, he says.Just make sure you don't over fill.

The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash","review":"Item simply stopped working on after about six months of use.

I definintely got a bad one, but it's so inexpensive, it's not really worth the expense and inconvenience of returning it to either Linksys or the marketplace seller. This should be a fool-proof device, and probably is if you get a good unit. Mine, on the other hand, thinks there is always something connected to port 4, bringing down the entire network. Actually connecting something to port 4 solved that problem, but I'm still experiencing intermittant periods of packet loss of about 25% that require multiple restarts of the switch to correct. If you're looking for an inexpensive switch, I might suggest buying several of these so you can be sure to get at least one good one, keep another good one as a backup, and return the remainder.

This movie is different; he plays a character so deadpan and lifeless you'd think Keanu himself had forgotten how to act. Yet, even through the quiet dreamless meandering, his character inspires irritation at his lack of desire and even instills a false sense of security that you know the plot and the story-line endgame.

Typically, Reeves is paired with a leading lady with whom he at least seems to share an on-stage chemistry that's remotely believable (e.g., Sandra Bullock in \\"Speed,\\" Aitana Sánchez-Gijón in \\"A Walk In The Clouds,\\" Charlize Theron in \\"Sweet November\\" and \\"The Devil's Advocate,\\" Rachel Weisz in \\"Constantine\\" and \\"Chain Reaction,\\" Brooke Langton in \\"The Replacements\\").This movie, however, seems to have totally missed the mark with Vera Farmiga. Aside from not being very convincing, she just seems like an odd choice for Reeves (and only reminded me why I've never been a fan of hers). Of course, that's probably why such a heavyweight actor like James Caan was thrown in the mix -- to lend credibility, as only he can.

Danny Elfman is gone and it's nothing. What's with this Elliot Goldenthal score making it sound some what like a superhero theme? Danny Elfman's score for the original Batman was awesome and I always read the comics while listening to his music. Batman Returns was even better with the addition of the chorus. You can't read Batman V.S. Predator without listening to Batman Returns.

His one-page introduction is an insult; he doesn't ever explain why he included any of the essays in this collection nor does he contribute any insight regarding Tolkien's work (I suspect he didn't have any).I was amused, then annoyed by what he included: outdated Jungian comparisons to the Hobbit, a poorly-written history of the publication of Lord of the Rings.

Before today's college freshmen were born...!Perhaps this book was a little hastily thrown together, but I can't help feeling that serious students of Tolkien will feel ripped off--and better off going to their college library for current critical studies. I fully expected to see, for example, a selection from Norman Cantor's superb \\"Inventing the Middle Ages\\", whose chapter on Tolkien gives an historian's interesting perspective on why, contra Bloom, the Lord of the Rings will take its place in the pantheon of great works of the 20th century (\\"aesthetic reservations\\" be damned).Anyway, its the lack of recent pieces like Cantor's that makes Prof. Bloom's book such a disappointment...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not like the pan","review":"The bottom of the pan is not flat and only bows more as heat is applied making the pan unsable.

From then on I just poured through the book, entertained and enlightened all the way. Loved chpt 10, \\"The great and terrible breast,\\" which told about how breasts figured in mythology, religious art, and folk tales in different ages & cultures. I think it would be great for religious art in churches to show Mary breast-feeding, or with the infant Jesus at her exposed breast, as was evidently common in early Christian art.

I contacted the manufacturer several times over 3 months and never received a response. The quality of what I did receive is great, after having to run to a local home improvement store to purchase the additional parts.Update 3/28/12: The missing parts were hooks to hang pans, etc. were not included so that makes this useless.

I also use the top for storage of some lightweight muffin tins and the like. If I were doing it over again I might consider buying the slightly-cheaper one from Ikea - which is fully square, instead of having rounded ends - giving you more versatility to put flush against the wall, more space on top, etc. However, the rounded ends do work pretty nicely for nesting pots and pans into one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"dazeyb","review":"LOVE this pot rack - it looks perfect in my kitchen above our island.

It has the perfect spot for a pot rack, and I decided to give this one a try. It looks nice, and it does the job. My only complaint about its functionality is that it's pretty rattly. If the kids are running around upstairs it makes a lot of noise. To reduce this, we took a rubber shelf liner and cut small rectangles out of it, and padded the wire rack in the middle. This greatly cut down on the noise. The other issue is that it did not come with the hardware to install it. It has the hooks, but no anchors of any kind. For something hanging pots from the ceiling, you've got to use anchors."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"this pot rack is awesome for the price. it is the right size.

It comes with 4 screw hooks to be screwed into the ceiling. The instructions state that if you don't miraculously happen to hit joists with all 4 screws you need to 'pick up some toggle bolts at the hardware store'. No size info for the toggles is provided and as the ceiling hooks are pretty beefy it is very hard to find toggle bolts big enough to accommodate them.When you take into account the fact that this thing is 17\\" wide and most american joists are placed 16\\" on center it becomes apparent that really no one is going to be able to hang this thing without additional hardware.Shame on the manufacturer for not taking this into account."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product and price","review":"I bought this about a month ago and it is great, i have all of my pans, pots and bowls on it with no problems.

For the price, I didn't find anything else that was nearly this quality. The only downside, which I imagine is a problem for most potracks, is that the weight needs to be fairly well balenced on each end or the potrack will tilt/swing. I would recommend installing the four chains at a 45-75 degree angle with the ceiling, which will decrease the potrack from swinging when you remove items from it. This is what we did and it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Saw a similar one in Williams-Sonoma for a couple hundred $.

There are other factors working against Orius' success. The Church of Ghyo, who hunts for him, and his real family, the Mendios, who seem to be the definition of dysfunction.Mr. Brommer's multi-layered plot kept the pages turning for me, with his awesome grasp of political intrigue, family strife, and one of the most spectacular battle scenes I have EVER read.

I run graphic intensive, real-time processes in my network (online gaming, dataset transfers, group graphic development over the internet, etc.) and everything works to perfection! I reccommend this switch if you are thinking about building a network, it's fast, reliable, and inexpensive.

It would seem that Linksys 5-port switches are affected, though there may be others. I've personally seen one completely fail and another three with issues. Of the three, the common theme was high packet loss. I finally replaced the two I owned with a Linksys/Cisco SRW244G4 managed switch. My network performance & stability improved significantly. Plus the 4 gigabit port were an added bonus. Personally, I'd avoid buying any of the consumer-grade switches Linksys sells. Go with Netgear, DLink, etc. If you're looking for a business-grade managed switch, the Linksys/Cisco ones seem well built and trouble-free.If you already bought one of Linksys's 5-port switches and it currently works fine, keep it cool!

I settled on the Linksys and am very happy with it.I have only 2 concerns (any why I didn't give it a 5):1. This product is TINY and the attached cables and power cord tend to drag it. A bit of velcro should fix that. ;)2. The manual is a waste of trees.

So when an old hub I was using quit, I bought another one of these to replace it. It's a quality switch that should deliver years of trouble-free operation.

Not only does the V6 drop connection more often but it has other strange behavior as well.

I've never had a router fail like this before (and I have 5 in my current home network in various places all over the house).I was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10.6v under no load and 9.5v when connected to the Linksys.

This book is unhelpful, unfair and rude - L.A. doesn't deserve his snooty criticism. Don't listen to this book and come and see L.A., it's a beautiful and diverse city that is unfairly degraded by the author's unfailing negativity.

She demonstrates a particular gift for sketching characters, from the deeply mysterious driving instructor Attila to her own dichotomous personality- a Park Avenue PhD with equal parts anxiety and sophistication all packaged in a statuesque, couture-clad former model. Fine Collins dispenses with the naval gazing pablum that frequently plagues memoirs and instead offers up a clipped, engaging vignette that encourages and delights. She is an underrated humorist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding the road you didn't travel","review":"Word alchemist Amy Fine Collins weaves a spellbinding tale of self exploration as she takes to the road to conquer her long-standing fear of driving.

Upon initial listens only a few tracks stuck out to me, but something kept me coming back for more. Perhaps it was the production by Peter Katis (whom also works with Interpol); or the very well written lyrics; or just the singer's somber baritone. Whatever it was, Boxer really opened up upon repeated listens. This is the best album I've heard in quite some time. Most of the tunes flow along effortlessly to a mellow vibe. The songs are very well arranged and very well performed. Somewhat dark, somewhat pensive, yet refreshing and comforting in a strange way.

I do suspect there is a fairly beautiful album under them somewhere and I do mean under because for some unfathomable reason the drums are at the front of the mix. On the few tracks where this is not the case the relief is palpable, the music good.

Staring at the Sun, in particular, is sort of an unknown 90s alt-rock classic. Overall this album is fairly weak in the songwriting department with only a few truly great songs, but the performances are energetic and guitar tones are thick and crunchy.

The rather insignificant price difference between Linksys' 5 port hub and 5 port switch demands that EVERYONE buy the switch. The hub is by far a more profitable item for Linksys.

You see the only reason that this game has been held back repeatedly is because the Counter Strike: Condition Zero sales were no where near the amount Gabe and Valve would like them to be.

What a bite! I'm giving it away. Kills my blood pressure. I'm going to play some more Doom 3 to soothe my nerves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PC game ever.","review":"This is by far the best PC game ever created. It is also one of the best First Person Shooters ever made. This game has absolutely gorgeous graphics that will draw you in to the game. It is so much fun that sometimes you will forget that you aren't actually in the game. And if you like horror games, the level \\"We don't go to Ravenholm\\" is scarier than anything in Doom 3. This game is very fun and is definetley worth the $55 it costs. The only problem is your computer must have a VERY good graphics card and must be a fast computer. Overall this is and Halo 2 are the most fun I've had in games for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggiest high-profile game ever released?

Five disks to install. kind of like shades of XIII.Don't get a nice thick jewel case however. Got it all installed and then I had to activate it. I can see their reason why. No problem I thought to myself. I said that and after an hour activating and decrypting files I'm still not ready to play the game.Think I'll just take it out and put a nice easy to install ,no fuss,no mess game in and put my long waited for and beautiful copy of HL2 in a closet where I can't see how much money I wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy CD, must download and internet, Steam has me Steamed","review":"It is ironic that a game of this theme makes you sign up on their internet site and download large amounts of files even if you buy the cd from the store.

If you are successful - then you merely wait forever to have the files decompressed - just so you can play the game.3) Customer Support is being swamped - all circuits are busy.If you are interested in purchasing the ALL-TIME WORST CD GAME INSTALLATION WITH ACCOMPANYING SUPPORT - THIS IS FOR YOU.Otherwise, purchase another game.

There is no booklet included in the box. There is only one cheap card which tells you that you can play offline if you check the \\"remember my password\\" box, except there is no \\"remember my password\\" box to check anywhere during the installation process. So when I tried to play the game I was told that I would have to wait 136 minutes, and I presume that was online. These people are so paranoid that somebody might rip them off that they have devised an installation scheme which is unbelieveable. But if they want to rip me off, well that's another matter altogether. I regard Valve and Sierra as thieves and criminals. I uninstalled their garbage from my PC and will have it in the garbage can tomorrow. I will never buy anything else from these crooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"half-life & half-life 2","review":"The actual game is fairly good. The reason I give it low marks is because I had to download data that should have been provided with the game. I feel I should be able to play a game without having to download updates.

Besides it said \\"Internet needed for installation\\" on the back of the box so I thought twice and decided to check here first.I was very, very surprised. Not only is this game buggy but also needs internet to be able to install? It takes 8 hours to do so? And if it crashes during the process it won't let you try again?And, what's worse, this installs a resident program in your PC that takes 15 minutes to boot up and slows your machine to a crawl? No thanks, I don't want to ruin my computer. I'll buy something else.So thank you negative rewievers. You saved not only my money but also my PC. Thanks!

However, it is a legal way to download new games.The game is the best FPS I have ever played, the constant action is great. The story leaves something to be desired, but the gravity gun is the best gun ever in a game. You need no ammo and still can do some major damage if used right.The other major problems with the game is if you try playing for a few minutes and few hours will go by and HL: Source is the same as the 1998 version except with the awesome water (best water ever in a game)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Bought this game used after playing original.

Steam is probably the most annoying piece of software available on the market today, second only to Windows itself. You need to be online to play the single player game.Next, I ordered Half-Life 2 from Amazon. Disk three had a minute scratch on it that prevented the game from being installed.After my physical pain subsided, I decided, \\"take it to EB and trade it in\\". No dice--This game is not allowed to be traded in because of the coding on it. This game cannot be installed on more than one computer, and if you reformat your hard drive, then you are out of luck and HAVE TO BUY A COMPLETELY NEW COPY OF THE PROGRAM.Bottom line, I would probably do better playing Yahoo! solitaire, and it's FREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"Half Life 2 is possibly the best game ever made. This game is truly a work of art. The graphics are gorgeous, the story is compelling, the environment and physics are superb, but the whole game is RUINED by the steam log-on process.After you install the game you have to log on to a Steam server to unlock it. This takes 30 mins - 1 hour. I don't mind this if it keeps people from illegally copying the game. Here's the bad part, every single time you want to play the game you have to logon to the Steam servers. TO PLAY A SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU HAVE TO LOG ON TO A FREAKING SERVER. This is ridiculous. With millions and millions of people trying to play the game every night it can take forever to log on.....if you ever get on.Don't buy this game.

I DONT agree with that AT ALL. They will still get their money, this is the sort of thing thats driving pc gamers to console, and making these companies spend more on consoles than pc games (much to the chagrin of pc gamers).

The internet authentication hassle and long term concerns were definitely not worth the $$$$ I spent on the retail collectors edition. This edition was extremely disappointing for the extra money required. I will likely purchase HL2 again at a more reasonable price once Valve has had a chance to correct some useability issues. At least they won't be getting as much of my money for this fiasco.I returned HL2 since the game did not work as advertised. There is no mention of a product called STEAM being installed on the box or that an internet connection is required whenever I want to run HL2 (Sorry, OFFLINE mode absolutely does not work when configured as specified).Very disappointing, but I am hoping some corrections will come out soon and then I will try to install and play HL2 again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"The box for Half Life 2 fails to mention that a Steam account is required to play the game. So open the box, install the game. Ok, now you've opened the game and you discover you must have the Steam account. What is the problem with that? Simple: to get the Steam account you have to sign up to their privacy policy. In other words, when you buy the game you are betting that you will be willing to sign up to a contract that you haven't read yet. And, hey, guess what, even if you are willing to throw caution to the wind, you can't play the game if their servers are down or too busy. This isn't a registration glitch.

However, I refuse to use any software that requires an internet connection in order to be used. What if that internet phone line is my personal phone line also? Then every time I play the game that line is tied up and none of the other family members have access to a phone. What a needless hassle.The game instructions refer to a \\"offline mode\\" but it doesn't seem to work. They even have a customer help website that has a \\"How to make the offline mode work\\" thread, (which indicates there is a problem)but it seems to be written for some other game because the instructions didn't work for my game.My conclusion: Save your money. If they spent millions of dollars developing this game then someone somewhere was grossly overpaid! I paid $50 for my game but it's now in the county dump.

It is outrageous that you have to go online to play a single player game off line. But the wait was worth whil. Half Life 2 is awesome!

From the start, Half Life and the following sequels were nothing short of addicting and well worth playing.Half Life 2 is the long awaited sequel to the Half Life series. If you have not played the Half Life series (sold here at amazon in a pack of 5 or 6 games), get it first. You won't regret it. Awesome.I finished Half Life 2 and admit once again, it has me asking for more. The makers of Half Life 2 kept true to the original series and added far more adventure and some good scare into the game. I'd rate this game 9 out of 10. No game can ever be a ten unless it was a virtual reality game then most of us game players would never return from a VR game. wink.Get this game if you have played any or all of the original Half Life series.

Because if u cant play this game well ur out of the loop until u can.

Forcing a person to wait 2 hours to play a game, one that costs a lot of dough, is a sin. I will never own another Valve game ever. I have played hundreds of games and been pleased with most results, I am not hard to please and am very patient, but after almost two hours of trying to play Half-life 2, I gave up, took the game off my computer and sent it back.

You'll enjoy it, and don't get confused from reviews complaining about quirky AI. The AI is not perfect, but good enough to make it a wonderful experience.

For one thing, the tunnel entrance to get the airboat to the final helicopter battle shows itself open to the player on foot, but solidly locked closed to the airboat, and you cannot survive on the other side without the airboat, hence, the game is terminally flawed.

So if you must have this game, buy it brand new in an unopened box !"},{"rating":"1","title":"dude, this sucks","review":"hey all. i just thought i'd add my say, being an amateur computer user, instead of any of these clever computer experts.frankly, i'm annoyed. i think that valve's paranoia about half life 2 being cracked and modded etc is OTT. they have to come to accept that, no matter what they do, someone who is cleverer than them WILL take it to pieces.i also agree with some of the other reviewers; that the enthusiasm for the game is dwindling now. i don't believe that that will mean that when the game is FINALLY released that the sales won't be phenominal, far from it. i just feel that valve have fallen flat on their face while trying to find the opportune moment.hell; i'm still going to buy it. if it ever gets to england. which is.... likely but probably quite a lot later than america.oh yeah, and to the guys that thought it might be fun/useful/profitable to hack valve and steal early source code, bringing the date back further, cheers. not."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i could give it minus a gazillion","review":"this game sucks. i liked the first one a lot. this one has no online. uh oh big mistake. valve has done counterstrike source which is a [...] times better. dont get this game. doom 3 and halo 2 are much better than this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gonna blow your mind","review":"I was never a big fan of the past half-life but played it to pass the time. The new Half-life 2 is amazing. From what I've seen in previews and sneek peeks, it's finally passing up the other games with DOOM III as it's only real competition for now. It's being advertised with a release date of Dec, but I've read it will be released as early as Sept, 03. The scale of this game is amazing too. Huge creatures, excellent 3D environments, etc etc etc. Lets hope it's clipping and gameplay match the visuals and hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam? Don't believe everything you hear.","review":"Seems that most folks are more interested in talking about Steam than HL2, so I might as well add my 2 cents (Everybody knows the game rocks, so I don't need to say anything there). Valve has straightened out Steam since the original release, and I've had absolutely no problems with it in the past 6 months I've been playing this game (No, I didn't get it right after the release). If you have a decent (i.e. broadband) Internet connection, you're not going to have any trouble with Steam. If you don't, well, you're patient with all your other downloads, so quit your complaining.And there are actually some very good things about Steam:1) Automatic updates to the game. No more searching through File Planet and what have you.2) It's the only place to get _Rag Doll Kung Fu_.3) (And this might be the best one of all) You DON'T need to insert your CD to play the game.Got to go--I'm off to play _Lost Coast_. Now if they'd just release _Aftermath_ already . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Life 2","review":"Great game with exceptional graphic's & game play.

Make sure you have a good computer to play games with or you are wasting your time getting the game. The game has one of the best story lines, and really good action. Better than the first one, but the same type of game play. There are really good guns in the game also. I just didnt like the ending much, I wished the game could have longer at least just a bit. But there is nothing wrong with the game, it flows through perfectly. If your a PC gamer, this game is highly recommended.And for all the people saying oh Steam sucks, its such a hassle, thats funny because, I installed this WHOLE entire game ALONG with Counter-Strike Source in a about 10-15 minutes and was playing RIGHT afterwards. So yea. Its easy to install and use. Steam is good.Overall this game is great. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are not a real gamer unless you own this.","review":"HL2 follows up the late 90's smash with a nearly perfect sequel. The new engine is amazing and the single player is truly incredible, if a bit too short for my taste.The real meat of this package is the online mods however. Make sure you get a version that will allow you unfettered access to both the original mods (TFC, CS, Day of Defeat, Natural Selection, etc) as well as the new mods (CS:Source, DOD:Source, etc). Valve pioneered the use of community to build and improve their games after release when they released their level-editing software (worldcraft) as well as the SDK (Software Dev Kit) for complete remakes to the public for free. This is why HL1 (mods) are still some of the most played games on the internet today, and will continue to grow with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best, man!!!","review":"this is the best game i have ever played! superb graphics (facial expressions!!!), ultra realistic AI, stellar voice acting, engrossing story, fantastic gameplay...the list goes on and on.if you dont have it now then go out and buy it..right now! yes, the installation is a pain in the arse, and you might have to update your graphic card but its worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it a Movie or is it a Game?","review":"I must start out by saying wow this game is amazing.

But with every work of art there is Criticism. The game stability is not up to par. It started out bug free and went that way till about level 4. Around there the game started freezing and would even restart my computer. Maybe its my computer I dont know but it really bugs me when im in the middle of making human history and my start up screen pops up. well here are my specs if you want to run the game on high you must need a better computer than this.2.8 Ghz P4 HT1 GB PC3200 DDR180 GB 7200 RPM HD128 MB G Force FX 5950 Ultra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic game, terrible delivery system","review":"Unfortunately I've spent more time waiting for Steam to authorize my CD for an off-line, single-player game than actually playing the game itself. While HL2 does deliver on the hype with a truly immersive experience (I haven't even gotten to the monsters yet, and even City 17 itself is downright creepy), the hair-pulling content protection mechanism that is Steam makes the whole affair frustrating to the point of giving up. Which is a pity, as HL2 is a fantastic follow up to its predecessor.

The online game system, somehow managed to change the settings that I set for it to not automatically update. Each time it tried an automatic update it failed around 88%. This of course caused me to lose my progress in the game each time. It would not have been bad if it happened only once. However, it happened four (4!!) times. This was compounded by the fact that no one ever contacted me to help. I sent messages and problem reports. I asked them for help every way possible. I even scoured message boards and followed their advice. I really liked the game, and it was disappointing to me that I could not get the problems worked out. I am not sure about this method of gaming that forces you to login to the internet each time. It really causes a hassle. Half-Life turned out to be 1 of only a few games, that I have ever returned in my 20+ years of gaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realy frustrating experience","review":"I just can believe that some people can give this Game aFive Stars.C'mon can't belive that your Dream Sequal of HalfLife 1 i'snt that good.STEAM sucks ;and that's a FACT.Ijust can stand to wait and wait when STEAM let me play theGAME.VAlve you just make a mess getting this intrusivesoftware.The mother of all annoyance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What game?","review":"I've been trying for almost a day now to get this thing to work.

As we all did. I found it a big let down. The only thing good about it is the facial detail and after about 15 - 20 min's it doesn't matter anymore. The bigest let down is the story or lack of it. There's nothing to it. No additional information about the train you were on, how you got to wherever you are and why you have to go around shooting everything.The thing that made HL great was it's story. Half Life 2 has no story! You run through burned out country sides and city blocks with no orginal enemies.There are too many shoot'em up games out there now. I'm afaid, Half Life 2 can sit on the shelf with the rest of them.Oh, and I finished the game in about 30 hours of play.

Reboot...Install #3: Got through the CD's, logged in to Steam (I have an old account from 18 months back when Valve released this control freak with CS 1.6). Unfortunately the login stalled and crashed everything and I was forced to reboot again. I then tried to run HL2 using the provided shortcut and I got a dead response. I looked in Task Manager to find Steam running surreptitiously in the background with a 13MB footprint.

That is right! It does not work unless you get an authorization through steam to use it, I can understand wanting to protect the game against piracy, but this is nuts! I sat with this stupid thing for 2 hours and still could not get it to work. I would never buy anything that runs with this steam thing again.

In this game they have introduced come awesome weapons such as the rail gun, which lets out laser beams and many other weapons, which will keep you hooked onto the game 24/7. The reason that I did not give the game 5 stars was because even though it was definitely a massive improvement on the first one but still in my view, it could have been made better if it was a little less futuristic and more realistic, but that is simply a personal view because I prefer realistic games.Conclusion:This game Is one of the best futuristic games I have ever played and should keep the player absorbed and hopefully will improve even more with the updates which will be arriving soon.

Even on a not so good computer, Half-Life 2 runs smoothly on medium graphical settings. The graphics are astonishingly good, better than any game now, and probably better than any other game for the next year. Far Cry doesn't even touch this standerd. Physics: The best. Played Max Payne 2? Imagine how good thoes phsics are. Good, triple that! The facial movements are exellent. You can really see eyebrows, lips, eyes,cheeks moving! Suprisingly, the only let downin the AI. The enemy flush you out well with grenades, but other than that, they basically run at you shooting. Occasionaly they ues cover, but not very often. Note: YOU NEED INTERNET TO PLAY THIS! Not for multiplayer, but to install the game! You only connect once to use Steam, then you can play single player offline anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game can not be played","review":"i recieved this game as expected but the activation code required to play the game had already been used makeing the game useless, now i have to buy a new game for the code makeing me buy the same games twice which is not right the game half is a good game but you get scamed buying a used copy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"should never been released all kinds of problems with there steam thing and game they say they are working on patchs at 54$ you would think you could get a game that would not crash on you can,t beleave they can get away with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this game !!!!","review":"I cannot even install it.

You and 50 million kids all wanna play this game on Saturday morning. What do you think the chances are? Particularly if you have a dial-up.I'm returning the game unplayed.

I am using a new HP 3.2 ghz note book with a meg of memory and a dial up connection. I am resigning myself to the fact I will probably have to wait until I get to a faster internet connection to play the game. This is a poor way to design copyright protection for a game. I suggest that you not purchase this game unless you have a very brisk internet connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a protest I refuse to play this game","review":"You must register online before you can even play offline.This is ludicrous.This is also a very disturbing trend for a game - if you buy this one, you can expect to see more games use a similar scheme.What happens once you uninstall the game and it is no longer even supported years doen the road? You are out of luck. They could just as easily decide to stop supporting it once the next version is out and force you to upgrade.Stop the madness now before it gets out of hand or we will all come to regret it and pc gaming will be choked out of existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is a buggy peice of crap","review":"This game has a serious stuttering issue and Valve has still not resolved it. You can read all about the bug. There is also an ungodly long thread on Valve's website called Audio StutteringYou can read all about the problem. It plagues machines that are fast and slow. There is no ryhme or reason that it happens. It happens to me and makes the game completely unplayable.The game would be near perfect if it was not for this huge technical glitch. It also appears that Valve knew about this problem.I think this is a travesty. I have spent 50 bucks only to not be able to play the game in a satisfactory manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"This game REQUIRES authentication to a Source server to play ON A LOCAL MACHINE. This means that you are slave to Valve and their technical status every time you try to play the game, alone, on your machine. That's bad, because their network SUCKS, and renders this game virtually unplayable. DO NOT BUY IT. Now I see why software pirates do their thing, this is the reason why!

And Again the storyline wasnt very exciting...they tell you bugger all and then the end is treated like a twist?????I can say Halo/Halo2 were good came because they were what they claimed....FPS's....they had good storylines/a cool universe and when I killed the 'bad guys' I enjoyed every moment of it....and that is why I dont like the Half Life franchise....."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun but","review":"valves regisration system is a joke, too bad no1s laughing. i won't give these shisters another penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kik Doom in the rump awesome","review":"Ive seen like every trailer and screenshot and watched this thing as close as a momma raccon to her young since it was announced.

I've always felt overwhelmed, with so much conflicting information as to what's safe and what's not. I found out about this book, from the Weston A. Price website - another awesome resource for finding out the truth. The absolute best part of this book, for me (because, honestly, a lot of the \\"chemical\\" details are over my head) - are the lists, at the back, of specific products (in each category - hair, face, deoderants etc) that have been tested as absolutely safe. This was so helpful, for me... to have all the research and legwork done, and to be able to simply look up each category, and find out where to buy it. It allowed me to slowly and methodically eliminate my family's personal care products that were harmful and, confidently, replace them with safe ones.

It not only says if it's safe, but indicates who says it's safe. Is it safe according to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (which I don't put much stock in), FDA, or if it's considered safe, but it's not really been tested, etc... In the back it lists several companies of where to get great natural products from.

I bought it for my class room. I teach South American Social Studies at roughly the same time our building Science teacher is teaching a unit on biomes. This video connects the two in a very nice way. Not only does the video focus on the life of the anaconda, it focuses on the other animals and the features of the llanos itself. The animal footage can be quite graphic at times, but does a wonderul job displaying the harsh reality of animal life. National Geographic doesn't try to sugar-coat the reality of the animal kingdom, like some videos do. The snake footage is also very good.

While ostensibly imaginative, the plot here is hobbled by Ms. Jacobs prose, which is so overblown that it fails to do what it should: communicate a strong story with a powerful voice. Instead, we're attacked by purple prose. Ms. Jacobs needs to set her thesaurus aside (or more likely, to turn it off on her Word Program) and write in a more direct, clear and sophisticated manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Totally unreadable.

This book is unreadable. I managed 100 pages before I had to put it down. Obviously, I'm not the target audience for this type of story (even though I thought I was), but I can't even assume there was an editor involved here. Someone compared it to Lovecraft, and I'm thinking Britney Spears is the next Aretha Franklin. I don't want to be rude, or entirely negative, so I will say that the writer has a good imagination. The premise of the story is a good one. It's the delivery that falls short. Oh well, I guess you can't please everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"Yes, this writer does have a grasp of the English Language, but it's from the 16th century. The prose is too overblown, too wordy. One of the other reveiwers here had it right, she spent too much time with a thesaurus, and not enough with the plot. I read the book until page 150 then had to put it down, because I had no idea what was going on. I read alot, I'm not dumb, but this is really a waste of money. Stick with King and Koontz for electrifying reads. It seems that every time I try a new writer, I get something totally worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Leisure dud","review":"From where I stand, it seems that Leisure knows which wonderful authors to publish so long as those authors have a long-running career. But if you see a first novel coming out from the Leisure horror line, you can pretty much forget about it.Such is the case with Teri Jacobs' novel The Void. This is a weak effort where the author strives like a swimmer caught in the ocean current to be \\"literary.\\" She flounders and splashes and flails throughout her narrative, but never once achieves a strong, comfortable voice that can draw the reader in. Instead, we get writing that is filled with such purple prose that any editor with an ounce of shame would have struck out.I don't know who does the acquisitions at the Leisure Books horror department but he should fire his first readers or spend more time on his slush pile. Too many awful first novels are finding their way into print there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take her thesaurus away!","review":"Teri Jacobs smashes the reader over the head with her use of an overblown narrative style. Clearly she took every simple sentence, ran to her thesaurus and immediately substituted the longest word she could find. The novel is filled with purple prose that is supposed to sound lyrical but winds up reading like a grade-schooler's first try at poesy. Run-on sentences abound. If there's a plot to this novel I never got in enough to find out. I can tell you that the first half of the book is a mess of sexual images and hackneyed horror without any erotic or frightful content. Perhaps someone should inform the author that sometimes less is more. Good for a laugh and little else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-Void at all costs!","review":"Teri A. Jacobs' prose is so stiflingly purple that I'm shocked she's been published at all. This author makes all the mistakes that a 10th grader might make on a creative writing homework assignment; she actually believes that being purple and flowery are good things in a story. Every time I made a serious effort to delve into the book, the author's hyper-overblown style knocked me right out again. I can't even tell you what the plot is because my head was spinning just trying to make sense of the narrative voice. Forget this one. A-Void!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a dumb \\"See Dick Run\\" book!!!","review":"I found The Void interesting and challenging.

You can painstakingly analyze each cut, as another reviewer has done (far too tedious for this music fan); or you can just let the music play. This is all refreshingly original music; you won't find it anywhere else. That is part of its allure.Jeff may be suffocating his profession, though.

The combination will not fit in the front pouch. You have to use the back pouch that is bigger. The back pouch is supposed to be used for cables and controllers, but if you want to use the LCD with you PS1 you have to put It in the back. Then you have to put your cables in the front pouch.

My favourite is the song \\"disenchanted\\", an unusually jazzier tune that I would recommend for any fan of Miles Davis, Charlie Parker or Nat King Cole. I still like the typical feel-good SM songs like \\"Holiday in my head\\" and the poking fun at eitism in \\"The In-Set\\". I've always liked the Space-age lyrical metaphores and the whole \\"Jetsons\\" feel to what these guys do. There's only one incredibly boring song in the album (track #2). I'm not much of a consumer of pop bands that are pimped by big business, but I still recommend the few and far between that I consider to be islands of talent in a sea of overpromoted crap.

This band is who you listen to when you've had a terrible day (or night) and you need something to get you going. You just can't sit still during their disco renditions or with \\"Sister Psychic\\" (my personal favorite). If you like mellow, slow, depression songs--they've got that too!

You read about how the actors were choosen and about them personally. There is a section about what each actor has done since the show ended.

However he also felt it failed, only peaking at #51, due to there was too much of a variety; making the listener's mode change sparadically.Her version of 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood' yes may be a little over produced, but c'mon folks this was the late 70's.

The concept was good: an investigation sixty-some years after her great-aunt died into whether or not she actually killed her husband, a charge for which she was acquitted. There were letters, interviews, even a diary/journal for clues. But the answer was so obvious and the writing so stilted, I found myself skipping through the pages just to confirm that that my first instincts as to who-dunnit were accurate. (They were.) There's no doubt the author, the wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, is a talented, intelligent woman.

The bandwagon was just an unassembled pile of lumber at this point and all of the members of Les Savy Fav got splinters in their feet. Some guy in a band twenty-five years ago got a splinter stuck in his hand. Lars Sarvy Fav be a bunch of copycat frauds!For real, Les Savy Fav is a very fun band. They write consistently good songs and I encourage you to give them a listen. They are genuine, talented and intelligent men who throw a splendid party at their live shows.

The section on horse breaking was laughable, cowboys usually did not ride broncs to prove anything, they were too busy. They rode bucking horses to train them. Also, most loved the life, it wasn't that they were bored. They were too busy, and today they are still too busy, to get bored. Their horse breeds, ie, appaloosa, (a grey and black spotted horse and an Arabian, (a white or black desert horse,) are insults to every horse owner.What bothers me is that this book actually got PUBLISHED.

This album is a chance to hear young, raw talent from people who would later impress the world with soulful, tight, entertaining pop and rock. \\"Truly Good Song\\" is one of those anthemic songs about American wealth vs. world poverty that could have become a \\"We Are the World\\" or \\"Hands Across America\\"-type ballad to feeding the world.

She infuses her vocals with spirit, pizazz, and drama.But sometimes she delves into pure melodrama. Such is this album. I love melodrama, and this album is good for a listen or two for the absurdity of it, but it's not exactly fun to listen to and sing along with, like \\"Beaches\\" or \\"Bette Midler\\" or \\"The Divine Miss M\\" or \\"For the Boys\\" or \\"The Rosemary Clooney Songbook.\\"I vote this as her second craziest album right after \\"Bathhouse Betty\\" because this album you can get through without skipping any songs because your ears are bleeding (I'm, of course, referring to that shouty/insane \\"I'm Beautiful, Dammit\\" song. Weirdest. Worst.).Overall, not a bad album, but not a great deal of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this pool because of the canopy, I wanted my daughter to be able to play in the pool but have a little shade.

It is a terrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I do not recommend this pool. After inflating the whole thing which took forever to do, the arms stayed up for a while but then eventually fell over. Once they fell, I could never get them to stay up no matter how much air was in them. Attaching the water hose to the arm and canopy for the overhead spray obviously did not work at all either. It kept falling over. It would have been a great product if it actually worked the way it is supposed to. After messing with it on three different occassions I gave up and threw it in the trash. There are other pools out there that are less frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing!","review":"Our little wading pool sprung a leak and since we are experiencing record high temperatures, we headed out to buy a new pool. I like the idea of this one because of the sun canopy and the train effect (my kids love sprinklers!)However, this pool is a total piece of junk. We used an electric infalter and found that it is impossible to inflate the pool to the point that it can support the canopy. I offered to hold it up so that my kids could play, but when we turned on the water feature, the whole thing collapsed because the top does not disperse water properly.Now my small children are afraid to go near it because it collapses on to them. With the high cost of shipping, it isn't worth it to send this thing back. $20 lost, lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"We bought this pool for our one-year old specifically because I liked the canopy and rain effect. Unfortunately, no matter what we did, we couldn't get the canopy to stay on top (the \\"tree trunks\\" simply couldn't hold the weight). We never actually made it to trying to use the rain effect since the canopy ended up laying haphazardly next to the pool itself. Save yourself some money and just buy a plain pool because that is all you will be getting.Also, the pool is not as large as it seems from the photo. It's probably large enough for two small children, but no more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this","review":"I purchased a Banzai Jungle Cruise Canopy Pool, and right out of the box it must have been ripped. It will not hold air in the top ring, and thuswe are not able to use it.

I called the Banzai customer service number regarding this problem. They must have many complaints, since I am perpetually on hold every time I call. I also have emailed them through their website, and also direct emails, but have not heard back. So, it was a $[...] waste of money. I will never buy anything from Banzai again. Oh yes, and the picture on the box was misleading.

If I had seen these reviews I would never had purchased it. The canopy is a neat concept, but it starts leaning over the second you put the \\"leaves\\" on top and forget about attaching the hose once you do that the canopy falls right over. It is actually downright dangerous - when I turned my back on the kids to turn the water on, I then turned back around to find canopy on top of my daughter and son.

Whenever my children ask them to play a game, they politely refuse. This game is an exception! My parents beg to play! The rules are fairly easy to learn, and the concept is appealing to all ages. My 10 year old is usually the winner. I highly recommend this game to any and all families who enjoy intellectually stimulating games for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fun","review":"The object of this very fun game is to bluff other players by writing made-up endings to old sayings from around the world. You probably won't know any of the sayings in the game-they're amazingly, and often hilariously obscure-but that's the whole point. It's more important to fool people with your fake ending than to guess which saying is the genuine one. Once you realize you can fool other people into thinking the saying you made up is the real one, you will be addicted. Anyone with a sense of humor will love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"All family fun!","review":"The rules of the game are described in other reviews, so I don't want to be redundant. You will definitely remember some unusual, strange proverbs and naturally the ones you invented yourselves till the end of your lives. But the most precious value of this Game is not educational, but just having a good time. The rules are extremely simple, so the fun starts almost immediately. This game would make a great gift for people of all ages (12 and up),who even do not usually play any games. I envy those who did not play yet.

Then, when you've become more familiar with the old sayings on the cards, try making up your own sayings. I'd say it's even better that way. You'd think that would defeat the purpose of buying the game, but not really. Using the cards will probably make you much more creative in the long run. It's worth it--many of the sayings on them are ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can attest to the fun of this game","review":"Yes, I agree with Jeahsj!! We had a great time with this game.

We played it in a group of six on Christmas day and were extremely disappointed. The proverbs, assuming they are real, are not only obscure, but often rather meaningless. For example, one was (roughly) \\"Every hill....has a slope.\\" By the time you have gone around a few times you know that no one is likely to know or guess the right answer. Because of this, the part of the game where others guess whether someone else has the right answer doesn't work--you know they are going to be wrong. This was a great idea but very badly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Big Gamers?!? ... Big Disappointment","review":"My family LOVES to play games - all kinds. But this game left much to be desired (especially for it's price). It's similar to our homegrown \\"Dictionary\\" game (where one indiviual finds an obscure word in the dictionary, and everyone tries to write it's definition, making it up if you don't know the real definition, then everyone picking the best one). Or similar to \\"Sniglets\\", a very fun game as well. But this one is so obscure that there's no real point to it. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY HILARIOUS!","review":"Once you play this game you won't want to stop playing! Everyone gets so good at making up their own endings to the sayings that it really is hard to tell which are the real sayings and which are made up by other players. We got really good at fooling each other. The other great thing is that the old sayings in the game are completely obscure ones from all over the world and take you totally by surprise - some sound too strange or too funny or too unbelievable to be real, so we all felt free to make up anything that suddenly sounded possibly real. At times we were laughing so much and things got so out of hand we could hardly continue playing. A brilliant and fantastically fun game!

I plan to use it with my middle school students next. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for a large group","review":"The real fun of this game starts the day AFTER you play it with a good group. The ridiculous made up sayings that the group generates become inside jokes for the members of the group, and we often find very funny opportunities to use \\"our sayings\\". Much more fun than trivial pursuit because you put some personal creativity into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Food","review":"The trick with this game is to make sure you come up with plausible but less than obvious meanings for the many sayings that are contained in the cards. This is a fun challenge for anyone who thinks they're creative or good with words.A lot of the sayings seem like the sort of thing someone somewhere may have said once or twice rather than being a well-known phrase, but that doesn't seem to matter. It means that the sticklers or trivia buffs don't have any advantage over the rest of us!There is no luck involved, which is a refreshing change (no dice conspiracies to spoil people's fun), and the game length is good. An average game takes less than an hour.It works across generations (I've played with my inlaws) as well as amongst peers. On the whole, definitely a good game to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Balderdash, aka the dictionary game","review":"The idea of this game is very similar to the dictionary game: make up an ending to an old saying, hoping people will think it's the real one.We've played a bunch now, and it's always good for a lot of laughs, though I must admit that some of those are just from reading the real sayings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and fantastic game!","review":"Out of town friends own \\"Wise and Otherwise,\\" and we usually play every time we visit. It's easy to explain and learn and best for people who love to be creative and highly interactive during. The game is always a blast, and even better with a group of six to eight people who are funny and clever. We also have a great time even with just four people; the folks creating the \\"endings\\" to the proverb just create TWO answers. This allows for more possibilities, makes the game more challenging, and allows for more hilarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven exposition levels but very good overall","review":"A comprehensive exposition of the title subject.

The company who made it obviously didn't. There's a reason it's marked down astronomically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring Game Play","review":"I picked up this game hoping for a realistic outdoor adventure simulator, but within 15 minutes of playing, it was so boring and slow, I practically gave up. There is no way to save the game unless you get to one of the camps. The characters are incredibly incompetent, and you have to lead them around every corner, and if they conditions are rough (usually because they are cold from stuck in a corner for 10 minutes) all they do is complain. \\"Manage every aspect of your expedition\\" is a joke. You get to pick your team, then decide on very basic supplies, such as character should take carry more oxygen, or more altitude medication. From there, you have to hold their hand every step of the way, and listen to the repetitive sound track of crunching snow, or their constant whining. Avoid this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"Book seems to be missing a critical page or more at back - looking into this with publisher. Without these pages, the book is not very usable because the missing pages are about how to actually use the data obtained in the rating scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but not intended as a quick referrence.","review":"This book apparently was designed for experts to use to evaluate preschoolers' classroom. The rating scale not well-designed, as novice teachers would have to flip pages and double-check everything before being able to take advantage of the rating system. Each category was merely listed in the system, which forces us to turn the pages back to the category's chapter instead of focusing on the process invovled with evaluating one's classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for solid core doors","review":"I purchased this for a 36 inch, solid core bedroom door that might weigh 100 lbs at most. At full tension, the unit just barely closed the door without the latch catching. Maybe it would be fine for a smaller, hollow core interior door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I bought this book looking for a concrete gameplan on increasing brain efficieny for studying, etc. Based on the title and back cover, it appeared to be a good fit. Instead, the book focuses on science and offers very little in the way of practical application. I didn't complete the book - reading 3 chapters and scanning the rest was enough wasted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for ceramic-glass top stoves","review":"This griddle is perfect for any stove, INCLUDING ceramic-glass top stoves. While most griddles say they can be used on all stoves, most do not have a truely flat bottom that is needed for ceramic cooktops. The bottom of this griddle is totally flat, thick and smooth. I do not have joined burners, but the griddle absorbs and radiates heat so well, I can cook on the middle section that is not directly above a burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"false induction advertising","review":"I bought this 6 months ago in preparation for using it on a newly installed induction cooktop. I believed the advertising and did not check magnetic test when it arrived Well got the cooktop, tried the griddle and when it did not work, found out why, it is not made for induction as advertised. Totally rediculious to have it promoted and advertised on outside of box that it is usable for induction, so now have a lovely griddle,totally unusable, wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well when new. POOR reliability...","review":"I've used this for 8 months or so on my glass-top stove. When it was new, and for many months, it was great.Then it started to go bad. The cooking surface has 'bubbled up' (best word I can come up with) in several places, and it is no longer smooth. It is not food collected, it is the coating coming up.I never cook above 2 on my cooktop (out of 10), so it is not due to overheating. All my other cookware is much older and handles those settings without issue.I wish I could still find the \\"Cooks Club\\" brand. It's been the best I've owned so far, but the store that sold it went out of business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phonetics textbook","review":"Great phonetics text to use with my own kids as well with ESL students.

The truth is you can make good money as a tech writer today, as a \\"captive\\" or as a \\"freelancer\\". The one point that Peter does not make strongly enough is that you have to be GOOD at it. You can't just take a few correspondence coarses, suddenly call yourself a tech writer, and expect to make a lot of money. It's so much more than grammer and style--too much to get into here. Skip this book and find yourself a mentor instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in touch with today's job market.","review":"This issue of Kent's book, just like the first edition, is completely out of touch with today's job market. Don't be taken-in by this idealistic tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice . . . for the right type of person","review":"I found this book outstanding and completely to my taste. But I am an aggressive entrepreneur and (in business matters) generally an optimist. That seems to be Peter Kent's personal style, so everything he said made perfect sense to me.The mixed reviews given here may reflect different personalities, differing degrees of luck, or maybe just differing job markets (the two most negative reviews are from the Pacific Northwest--coincidence?).In any case: (a) there are nowhere near enough technical writers; (b) there are a ton of outstanding opportunities for people who are bright and well-organized; and (c) if you want to take up the profession, this book can take you from zero to 60 in a couple of years.But I reiterate: you've got to have the contractor's personality. Kent says that in his book, so (you negative reviewers) don't fault him if you see things differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for technical writers....","review":"I am not a techincal writer, but a techincal translator, yet there are many overlapping characteristics between the two professions. His advice on writing skills is most certainly applicable to us, too. The advice I appreciated most, however, was the practical information on taxes, laws, health benefits, canvassing agencies, and contract-writing. Due to the user-friendly layout, I was able to skip over irrelevant sections and go directly to what I wanted to read. Peter's book is highly readable, thorough, and resourceful, making it an excellent introduction to a freelancing career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice; Optimistic","review":"This book gives solid advice to aspiring freelance technical writers. Whether you're currently working within the technical writing field, coming from a related area such as engineering or a medical profession, or just starting out, Kent gives a series of steps to take you from employee to freelancer. The book may be overly optimistic for writers coming from non-technical writing backgrounds, but if you're willing to put in the time to gaining experience and building your network, this book will help you create your plan. Some of the links and resources are outdated, but the reader can easily figure out how to find the same or similar resources. He gives a complete bibliography - though again, there are probably some good newer books that could be added to the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"No descriptions","review":"i am at a loss to choose a product because there are no descriptions oa explanations about what the product does or how it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Encyclopedia of Uncolved Crimes","review":"This is a great book for any crime buff. Or for any college student that may have to do a report on crime or a criminal. I only read true crime books. I do not read make-believe romance or anything else make-believe. Only true crime. 95% of my TV watching are true crime shows and movies. If a make-believe crime movie is good I'll watch that. This book is all about unsolved crimes and there are alot of people in the book that are not famous. There are a few other \\"The Encyclopedia of....\\" to go along with this one and I recommend them all.

It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"they get the job done","review":"These extensions work reasonably well to hold instrument mics on a mic stand that primarily holds a vocal mic. They are well made, but the attachment can be a little loose unless you really crank the knob, and even then... I would not want to put a heavy mic on this extension. But it works nicely for an sm57 or a small diagphram condenser mic.It might be more convenient if the 5/8\\" threads for the mic mount were positioned vertically with an adjustable threaded knob, rather than horizontally with fixed threads. But it works fine as is and the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great with one important problem","review":"I initially liked this screen very much: it's bright and contrasty and didn't take much time to set up. However, after a few weeks of hanging, it developed very visible wavy creases across the screen. They went diagonally from the pull handle at the bottom to the upper corners. When viewing a uniformly colored image, like the red Netflix loading screen or a blue sky, the creases are strongly visible and distracting. This is not an issue of mis-handling; it's a design flaw. All I did with the screen was hang it on my wall, pull it down, and leave it for three weeks.The other aspects of this screen are fine for the price, but because of this one flaw I don't think it's worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun holiday book","review":"My kids love this book.

Shame on you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult, no modifications for non-experts","review":"The yoga routine in this DVD has a very high level of difficulty. You would already need to be a super-flexible yogini to be able to perform most of the moves. Brenda Strong very rarely suggests modifications, and she sounds critical of those who can't do the poses as perfectly as she can. For example, she will say \\"if your hamstrings are so inflexible that you can't so-and-so.\\" They only show Brenda doing the poses, rather than a range of people. I much prefer the Monica Morrell video, because Monica seems to be more of an expert in this area, the poses are much more doable, and it shows a few different women doing the poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD","review":"Wonderful DVD! Used it for one month..and voila...Pregnant! Great for stress relief and your body feels amazing. Brenda has a great voice for narration and you feel really in tune with your body afterwards.

Even though he would reach greater heights in later recordings, the blueprint was laid down here. The Brecht/Weill drunken carnival music alternating with quiet piano songs creates a fascinating atmosphere of unease, grotesques & quiet reflection. Like some of the Syd Barrett albums where the instruments were added after the singer was finished recording vocals, the notes often chase the rhythym like a flock of birds, not quite arriving at the same time. But, it doesn't seem to matter much. The songs are that good. I think the songs most often cited by critics are the strongest, \\"Down River\\", \\"The Road to Cairo\\" & \\"His Name is Andrew\\". But, I think all the songs are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then ever","review":"I bought this album 1968 for two reasons. Wonderful albumcover and The Road To Cairo (which he wrote). Together with fantastic arrangements it's one of the best albums ever. A forgotten singer-songwriter. If you like dark stricken music this is what you should buy. With the organ carressing the lyrics, this is most beatiful, year after year to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light cuffs","review":"I bought these cuffs to lighten up my belt a little, and they have definitely helped with that.

Unfortunately, the red paint on the old wooden handle flaked off so I got rid of it. Wish I would have sanded down the handle and kept it now!Pampered Chef needs to work on this design. Their products aren't inexpensive so it makes me think twice about buying other products from the company, especially since it seems it would be a hassle to try to return anything.

Yes they sent me another and it is also broke. I don't think I will return it as there are a lot better pastry blenders out there. I will say that I thought it did a decent job when it wasn't broke. The one I buy at garage sales for 25 cents do just as good a job and will last 5 to 10 years.

This is the first time I've been so disappointed by a book that I am writing a review. This book is meant for children but I can't see anything about it that would appeal to children. The illustrations are scary, the story is short and boring.The connection between actual history and this story will certainly be lost on the age range of children targeted by this book.

Only to be taken with a few prior heathly doses of middle class white-man guilt, Marsden and Tan's \\"The Rabbits\\" is about the most direct piece of propaganda that I have ever seen.On the surface the plot reads as a clever metaphor for the consequences and effects of European expansionism, although in reality it is a horridly narrow view of revisionism portrayed for all to see. From 'saving the trees' to 'saving the stolen generation' the author has covered just about all cause célèbres bases in what could only be seen now as a calculated vie for the CBC award.So if you like to receive your history distorted and your allegories as subtle as a sledgehammer, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad book, I literally threw it in the garbage","review":"This book is horrible.

No recording dates are given, but the quality of sound varies as do the instrumental accompaniments. The most satisfying tracks are the duets with Helen O'Connell (\\"Accentuate the Positive\\" & Two of a Kind\\") & oddly enough, Bobby Troup (\\"Jamboree Jones\\") whose presence suggests that perhaps his piano and group are providing at least some, if not all of the backings. Mercer does not sing \\"Moon River\\" or \\"Autumn Leaves\\" leaving these lyrics to O'Connell alone. His solos here often seem tired and lackluster rather than just laid-back. There are much better versions of Mercer's solo tunes available - the originals on Capitol's \\"Collector's Series\\" for example. The Mosaic set referenced by another reviewer appears to be instrumental settings by Al Cohn - at least that's all I heard on Amazon's samples. But then, it's hard to have too much Johnny Mercer in any format!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His legend grows...","review":"Mr.Bill Moyers continues to be the moral and intellectual light of our times in journalism in all its forms.

This is one of those gems you come across that no one's ever heard of, and everyone should have. I bought every copy I could find at the time I discovered it and sent them to friends.

My first love is hard-core honky tonk, but Johnny's smooth '70s country sound is fantastic. My first taste of his music came a couple decades ago with \\"Jo and the Cowboy\\"--a great song. Add \\"Thinkin' 'Bout a Rendesvous (sp)\\" and \\"It Couldn't Have Been Any Better\\" and \\"Come a Little Bit Closer\\" and you've got some amazing country songs. Sure, they're mellow, but sometimes that's just what a country fan needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Doesn't Get Any Better","review":"There are not very many truly 5-star albums out there, but this is one. Johnny has a clean, clear voice and is just so easy to listen to. The pairing with Janie Frike on several duets is one of the best pairings in country music. (I am a bit biased because I love Janie Fricke.) It's surprising that Johnny did not make it much bigger for a longer time, but I think many times it's about having good songs. There are some really good songs here and they were Johnny's biggest hits. Other songs just didn't make it as big and maybe Johnny just wasn't able to churn out as many hits as quickly as other better known singers or maybe his stuff didn't get the airtime that others did. Who knows? In any case, I would grab this album. It's even a good first intro to Johnny Duncan. A wonderful album that you won't regret owning.

In the DVD they spend plenty of tme at equipment labs, fitness facilities, and courses but in almost every instance they never actually cover the science of what they are doing in those locations or the science behind the products they are working on. There are many times in the series where success is determined by \\"imagination\\" and \\"feel\\"....the science is not even covered. Overall I was very frustratd with this purchase. It's a crime that they even used the word science in the title. You can get just as much science listening to comentators covering a Sunday round on tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best, by far","review":"Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best.

So when I saw this book in the library I thought it would be worth reading.Suspenseful? Maybe the last 5 pages or so. I really only finished the book to see how it ended.I found many of the characters actions to be preposterous, even in the setting of the novel. In the end I only really liked Walden. Charlotte turns out to be a ditz.I also didn't enjoy some of the preachiness of the novel, especially the suffragette issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett is better than this.","review":"This could have been a much better book. So much good raw material and fascinating history, as noted by other reviewers. But, also as noted by other reviewers, his plotlines are often too implausible.

The plot ticks along with fantastic pacing and suspense. Secrets come out at incredibly tense moments. With apparent ease, Follet makes the reader care for all the main characters, and two of them want to kill each other. This novel has it ALL: great plot, great characters, great descriptions, great dialogue, great pacing, a great climax. No other novel in the thriller/espionage field comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morally sickening... avoid.","review":"This book IS quite interesting, a captivating plot and lots of historical detail sure to delight most readers. Its the cheap sex, lust and glorification of adultry that damns the whole thing. Not to mention, this book has the trashiest climax I\`ve come across in a long time.Mr. Folletts obsession with adultary is extremely frustrating as he writes what are otherwise excellent historical thrillers. Trust me, if you have an ounce of traditional values in your body you'll want to hurl this book accross the room.Pick up A Dangerous Fortune or Pillars of the Earth first. Lets all hope Mr. Follett wakes up and takes his job a little more seriously soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"die nadal\\"","review":"Powerful characterization, excellent piece of literature.

And all three have been worth the time and worth the money. For sure. The Man from St. Petersburg is set mostly in England in the pre-WWII era. The plot of the story is that Feliks, \\"the man from st. petersburg\\", is planning to kill a Russian prince who is in the middle of treaty talks with England. Feliks beleives that the murder of the prince will bring about a break in a possible alliance to Russia. Throughout the story, many connections between Feliks and the English family housing the prince, are revieled, making the story very ironic, but I think the connections give a certain sense of suspense from wondering what might be revieled next.Overall, it was a very gripping, suspensful, and entertaining book that had a very good bit of storytelling wrapped in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining--you won't be disappointed","review":"This was my first Ken Follet book, and I couldn't have been more pleased! Follet brilliantly takes the reader back to the pre-World War I/Russian Revolution era in a vivid, yet easy-to-read style. The plot is fast moving and keeps the reader engaged throughout. Follet's only shortfall, from my standpoint, came in his effort to make \\"the man from St. Petersburg\\" himself somewhat sympathetic. But overall, this is a good thriller, set in an era which Follet masterfully brings to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please help find a copy","review":"I remember seeing this movie when I was young.

The authors not only provide the obligatory natural history notes and descriptions, they also provide the highest quality colour photographs I've ever seen in a book. It is difficult to describe such photography, but I can say that even such overly-depicted species as anoles and box turtles come alive in a way that makes them seem new and, well, exotic.The authors are primarily photographers and amateur naturalists with a genuine love of their subjects and equipment. The text is accurate, simple, and yet not demeaning for an educated reader. The numerous sidebars provide considerable insight into the biology, distribution, threats, and uses of Florida's native reptiles and amphibians.It's a good read, magnificent eye candy, and affordable.

SLA is an area that has not received as much research as First Language Acquisition. Therefore, this work is important in that it brings to light the importance stimulus appraisal has on a person's ability to have sustained deep learning. Schumann does a work of a linguist, neurobiologist, and researcher in this book and provides a thorough read with scientific fact and a well written thesis. The book should be read by all with an interest in the mind and language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I read this book after reading the other five in the mini series, and I liked it a lot. It keeps you in suspense until the last page, and the plot thickens every chapter.

I'm 14 and I was around 12 when I read it and even then I wasn't too impressed. Although you were in suspense some of the time, for most of it I was just wishing they'd get on with it. I didn't read the previous books in the mini - series because I didn't need to. This book told you all that had happened, so it didn't make me want to go out and buy the prequels. Sweet Valley High just isn't what it used to be. Every book is full of gloom and doom, and you can never believe Jessica when she says she's totally, madly and deeply in love with a guy. Her and Sam Woodruff were perfect, but of course Sam died. Now Jessica has a new love in every new mini - series. And Elizabeth is forever two - timing Todd. I'll give this book two stars for effort and some suspense, but I'm being generous. Come back, old Sweet Valley. The new type isn't half as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"Was this story arc with the evil 'twin' campy? Yes, it was, but that doesn't make it any less fun to read. I read this back when I was in I think middle school. I had been reading other Sweet Valley books, some original series, others high school or SVU, and though I never read all of the books in any one series, I nonetheless enjoyed the adventures of Jessica and Elizabeth, and this one was no different, it was different than previous story arcs and it goes to show you that life may seem perfect to an outsider, but for those who are actually living this \\"perfect\\" life, even happy and ordinary families have their own fights and flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio clips do not match the CD","review":"It seems clear that the associated MP3 clips of Mehta's Carmina Burana do not match with what must be on the CD.

They work good with my Ipod and the sound quality is a bit above average. I didnt really have a problem hearing and enjoying what i was listening. I wish however that the headphones were adjustable to fit at your own comfort level. It fits alright though. I dont run at night or anything so i dont know about the reflective neckband aspect.- Also its really easy for others to hear what your listening to. While not a major deal, but something to keep in mind. After some time of use whatever material the cord is made of starts to fray and come apart (just a tidbit).+ Sound, reasonable price and durable.So if your looking for decent priced headphones then these are good choice.

But i do plan on upgrading in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most comfortable.","review":"I purchased these from another retailer and later returned them. They do look cool. However, the sound quality is only average, and they are uncomfortable if they don't fit your head just right. I'm about average when it comes to head sizes I guess and I found the neckband to be much too large so that it added no support and my ears did most of the work holding the set on my head. This became very uncomfortable after a short time. Also, the ears pieces did not set well over the ear to maximize what I was hearing. All in all, these headphones are only average and I believe MUCH better quality and comfort (and price) can be found with a pair of KOSS KSC75 headphones.

Some how I have missed seeing it and am really glad I finally watched.The story revolves around a group of college friends who reunite for a weekend after one of the peoplein their circle passes away. The themes are timeless, and the acting was authentic. At no point did I feelthat these characters are out of place. Each character deals with the loss in their own way, but they don'thave to do it alone.This film also reflects its time period. If this film were made today, I'm afraid it would be filled with cynical people,bickering amongst each other and passing blame. The Big Chill never devolves to that.

The story follows a would-be director who is confronted with a host of production realities in making a movie; all while dealing with profound fallible hypotheses in his actors and incurring incredible financial burden to his crew and himself. The movie's storyline seems to follow, coincidentally, the director's inner conflict with the outside world through the lens.Prepare to be assaulted with on-screen incompetence and eccentricities, in a revolving stream of quirky scenes since the bizarre Ed Wood.At the very least, Montlack's knack for the extreme and absurd, is an outstanding talent and has proved himself to be a young filmmaker to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Exposure","review":"As I had only the old vinyl copy of this superb album and it was somewhat battered from playing, it was a joy to find that it was available on CD.What can you say about an album featuring two such great artistes as Maynard and Chris.The chemistry is evident from the start.

He has a weak, unfocused, supremely unsupported tone. He doesn't seem to be very musical and the interpretation felt supremely uninspired. Not to mention that he could never be heard in an opera house over a Verdian orchestra without being miked. Opera singing is supposed to unamplified. Not to mention that singing the wrong repertoire incorrectly ruins even the most skilled singers. Eventually he'll kill what little voice he has. Opera has survived for hundreds of years for the most-part unchanged. To have Il trovatore given this popera treatment to make palatable to unaccustomed ears is painful to hear. As for the rest of the cast, it was over all, pretty lackluster. If you want a really good recording of this opera my vote goes for the Price/Corelli recording. That will knock your socks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bocelli--classical crossover, not opera!","review":"Il Trovatore, being one of the three operas in the ever so popular Verdian trilogy, is one of my favorite operas ever. The magnificent orchestration combined with the poetry of the words merits it as one of the composer's most beloved works. However, this recording has bastardized Il Trovatore in every sense possible. Bocelli's light tenor voice butchered this interpretation of Manrico's role in the opera, and his \\"Ah si, ben mio...di quella pira!\\" didn't have the fiery passion exuded by a number of great opera tenors like Franco Corelli, Jose Cura, or Placido Domingo. Come on, Bocelli is a pop-classical tenor! He isn't suited for this kind of stuff! If you want a great Trovatore, buy the one with Karajan and Price or Callas...or even the one with Domingo and Mehta and Price Cossotto."},{"rating":"2","title":"bocelli vocally resplendant","review":"A virtually complete recording of the score. Sound quality is excellent. It is often said all Trovatore needs is 5 great singers. This recorded performance comes very close. I have to single out Andrea Bocelli. In this recording he is vocally resplendant. His recorded performance can be compared to other tenors who have excelled in the role of Manrico. This recording is highly recommended on all levels. At the price offered, a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Simply Bad","review":"One of the most poorly sung Verdi recordings I've heard in a while. Bocelli is not up to the necessary requirements of the role. Listen to Corelli, Domingo, Bergonzi, among others, sing selections from this role and any listener can tell the difference. Bocelli is a pop voice singing opera, at least that is what comes across in this performance. Villarroel, Zamrema and Guelfi are also not up to the calibre of vocal excellence available on other recordings. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we need this new Trovatore?","review":"The performance is conducted on the slow side, probably in order to help Mr Boccelli to do his best.In fact Bocceli's interpretation, with the microphone focused on him to create a jumbo voice which this tenor has not, tries in vain to echo his great teacher - Franco Corelli. It comes to a disaster. Zaremba is a good singer but in the part of Azucena is the wrong choice. Veronica Villarroel exposes the same limits of interpretation as in the DVD from Covent Garden with Curra and Hvorostovsky. The best thing in all this production seems to be Carlo Guelfi, here recorded in a glorious voice. Guelfi should be the only good reason to buy this set - a very good di Luna. Carlo Colombara is impressive as Ferrando. If you are not a Boccelli fun, don't tuch this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars is more like it","review":"Bocelli may sound well in different repertory, but in Il Trovatore his singing is embarrassing. He has neither the voice nor the musicality for the role. Other singers are better, but not enough to save this performance. I don't normally leave bad reviews, but this time the performance was just too awful. Practically any other perfomance available is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fan blows","review":"Well, I got this fan sitting next to one of my other fans.

Otherwise, a very well done film, very well researched, but this one... is not quite just about the secret life of cats and their joyous way of being. It discusses the consequences of pets and their hunting on other species; it discusses pet owner responsibility and its impact on the environment.My main concern and complaint is that there should have been some labeling to warn the viewer about some less than kind/ rather cruel acts against cats. Not everyone, especially cat lovers, would want to see aborigens hunting cats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I caught this 'on demand' tonight and was impressed.

I really related to it, even though I am 8 years older than the narrator. I appreciated that this wasn't an attempt to write about gay sex, like so many GLBT coming-out fictions seem to be. Ryan gave enough information that anyone could fill in the blanks to their own satisfaction, without having to feel like they were reading a romance novel.

Throughout all this, Nicola's trying to determine whether archaeology is her dream career. Nicole grows a lot during the summer, learning about herself and how to relate to others.

I loved 'Annie'. The characters were interesting and it was a real love story.'Empress of the World' centers on dull as dirt Nic and a girl oddly named Battle.

Everything about it works: the characters, the dialogue, and the trappings of the teen romance experience. It will get hyped because it is a story about a bi teen, but the real story here is that Ms Ryan has written a touching, funny, totally heartbreakingly honest book about falling in love, with all the strings which come attached to that particular item.

This documentary contains a great deal of footage I had not seen before, and I have seen most classic and recent documentaries on the Third Reich. The interviews with veterans are moving, and provide a very interesting perspective on the various topics. There are only two drawbacks to this documentary, in my view: (1) there are points where I think a little additional context would really help, and (2) the six hour-long documentaries do not seem to have any coherent overall organization.

It covers many aspects of neuroscience and neural networks. Among a lot of information, there is his theory of consciousness. He bases his view of the mind as action centered, and this is to my mind, a good move. It is no surprising that his model includes sensimotor areas. He also includes the prefrontal, premotor, and the thalamus intralaminar nuclei, forming a loop, in his theory of consciousness. He supports it quite well, and it gives rise to predictions that can be experimentaly tested. The data considered is overwhelming, so even if the consciousness theory end up not being totally right, the book as a whole is still a very important piece of literature in the neurosciences. Qualia as essentialy the effects of muscle-spindles in the loop at first seems confusing, if not implausible, but maybe deserves further consideration.

He stays true to the Gershwins' original intent and at times this can be a deficit. Part of the problem lies in Feinstein's song selection: \\"Anything for You\\" sounds mushy and annoying -- but given the lyrical content that's probably was how the song was intended. Feinstein slips into this trap several times but on the album's better songs, like \\"Someone To Watch Over Me,\\" \\"Who Cares?\\" and \\"A Foggy Day\\" his energetic yet caressing voice enlivens the melody and helps bring a modern perspective to these old show tumes. The album's strong moments definitely outnumber the weak ones, making it a worthwhile listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really enjoyable CD!","review":"If you are new to Michael Feinstein, I would highly recommend this particular CD, as I think it's his very best ever.

Don't worry: This is a very different presentation. Where Pure Gershwin was mostly just Feinstein at the piano, this CD has Feinstein providing the music in a band context. Much of the CD is piano drums bass trombone and voice (the trombone parts throughout the CD, btw are quite luscious). For an added bonus there are more than a few songs which will be unfamiliar to even the most devoted Gershwin fans. My personal favorite among these is the surprisingly cynical \\"Anything for You\\" with lyrics that belie the cheery melody and arrangement."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a cd that I could get excited over","review":"As you might know Michael worked for Ira Gershwin for several years. He really became biased toward both brothers music, which is fine, I like their music, too.What makes this cd so uneventful, is the fact Michael tried to introduce a lot of Gershwin songs that had never been published and released before. I think Michael should try to stick with the songs that made the brothers popular.I really like Michaels' voice and feel like he is a one of a kind crooner. He really has a bright future ahead.

The bad: a real pain in the neck to inflate, many ports to inflate, and the palm trees and basketball hoop don't stay inflated for more than a day or 2. It is almost impossible to clean because there are so many corners and crannies for grass, etc to hide when emptying. Very diffcult to fully empty, so it becomes a big mosquito farm. Impossible to store unless you deflate. We did have several tears in the sides probably from cats or racoons in the yard at night, which is why you may need to store.

The book was written by GM Plaskett of England. He covers most of the important variations of the Taimanov with some games from top level grandmaster play in the 90s. There are 10 chapters followed by a summary of variations. There is a decent amount of verbal commentary in each of the games however one of my pet peeves was the dearth of analysis of any of the games. I think this is a good book if you are at least expert strength and are a regular Taimanov player. However, i think this book must be supplemented by another opening text.

Obviously money is a issue for you or you wouldn't be wasting your time on a 19.99 plastic pool, but rather putting in a nice cement-lined inground swimming hole.If you fill it up once a week and keep it in the sun, your pool will turn into a 100 degree hot tub in the summer heat. Not to mention, the bottom turns all slimy and slippery from the grime created from the heated water.If you fill it up once a week and keep it in the shade, even with the little top, all sorts of junk falls into it, making it a cesspool.Your kids will have more fun and you'll save more water if you buy a sprinkler for them to run through. I also recommend the 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 11 Amp Electric Pressure Washer With Hose Reel that you can spray the little kids with to keep them cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"sun pool","review":"With having very light skinned boys I was thrilled to find this. However if the wind was blowing at all the velcrowed top would fly right off. I wish it attatched a little better. But with perfect weather it was fine. It is very sturdy and holds a lot of water. My 5 year old loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shade - Off after the first day!","review":"One the first day the velcro that holds the shade together had come off. We tried everything to keep it on - nothing worked. After giving up hope on the shade we just delt with the pool. The pool itself was ok. After having the pool outside for one day we found it completely deflated on the grass. My four year old was devastated. To save yourself the hassles with this pool I would suggest purchasing something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun BUT not long lasting","review":"This pool was great I have two toddlers and I wanted something big enough that I could join them and teach them how to swim. I loved the pool until it ripped because my 27lb son jumped in the pool. I told you his weight to demonstrate that he is super small and he was able to rip the plastic. I was very sad when I had to toss it after only 2 weeks of using it:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pool, but does not hold up well","review":"I purchased this pool for my 9 month son. He loves the water so it is a great way for him to splash around while I'm holding him. He loves to kick his feet in the water and the tent is great. However, on the second day the pool had 4 leaks which I closed up with the intex tape but I'm already out of that and the pool's sides (which you fill with water) don't hold up well at all. The tent's 4 sides are connected with a cheap velcro, so after 15 mins in the sun the tent collapsed too. Such a shame because it is a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pool is great, shade is not!","review":"Like any other pool it is great, but the shade part falls off. The shade is the reason I got this pool.

I saw the photo and the reviews and thought I found the perfect pool. When the product arrived I saw the actual unedited photo on the box. The seller decided it would be an easier sell if the girl holding up the pool cover was removed.I blew it up and went to splashing around. The cover swayed all over the place and any hint of wind caused it to fall over. The only way this design could work would be if the pool never lost any air. I have owned many types of floaties over time and each slowly loses air, but unlike those products this rendered the pool cover useless over a short period of time.Everytime I look at the girl inconspicuously holding up the pool from the outside with a smile on her face, it makes my blood boil a little bit. I should return this pool, but the pool part works just fine. I just hate being deceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this pool!","review":"The pool arrived incomplete without the plug! We made do but the top sunshade is a disaster that never holds up. I rarely write reviews but I had to warn other parents: do not buy this. Your kids will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"We received this pool as a gift from a family friend last week. I was eager to get it set up and let my 3 year old and 18 month old start splashing as it is already in the 90s. After spending over an hour trying to get it inflated, however, we realized that the pool would not fill more than 75% of the way full. OK - not optimal, but still usable. Unfortunately, by this point it was raining. So I plugged up the pool and left it overnight for us to use the next day. By morning, the pool was almost completely deflated.The sunshade was not much better. It is flimsy and held on by 4 small circular velcro patches. Obviously the woman in the picture is holding the sunshade down because otherwise it would have easily come off. This thing is going straight into the garbage and we are pulling out our previous blow up pool that has worked for the past two years now. Disappointed that a company can steal people's money on such a faulty item."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I wear these headphones at work for several hours a day, and I don't find them very comfortable for extended use.

Chord is very small."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a big head . . .","review":"These seemed like an awesome solution to my headphone needs, but they fell short. I guess I shouldn't have had high expectations due to the price. I love that they collapse for easy storing. They're very light. And they provide decent sound.Unfortunately, they don't adjust for different head sizes - and it's very irritating because they go around the back of the neck. I can't move my head once I have them in the right spot, because then they get caught on my coat, my seat, my collar . . . you get the point. Also, the cord doesn't stay connected to my iPod very tightly.All in all, I don't recommend . . . unless you have a big head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and great sound","review":"I just got these because my cat destroyed my other Sony headphones. The sony ones I had sounded good, but they were very uncomfortable. These fit perfectly around my head - they are very comfortable. On top of that, they fold almost flat, and are very portable - this is great for me since I regularly kept my headphones in my backpack. They sound just as good as the Sony ones I had...perhaps even a tad better ( I am not an audiophile by any means...however, I do enjoy the Philips' bass more than my other headphone's bass). As an added bonus, the color matches my mp3 player's color. For 20 bucks, you can't beat this set of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless after five months","review":"Headphones worked great for a while. Then, 5 months after purchase, left earphone started going out. That was followed a week later by the right one fading, too. Now I have to press the plug into the iPod socket for headphones to work. For the price, you should expect more than 5 months' use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Philips product","review":"This is my second pair of behind-the-head Philips headphones, and I'm still very pleased with them. These are compact and lightweight, easy to fold and put away (with one hand), and very comfortable. I have never pulled these headphones out of my purse to find the cord tangled, and that is saying something. The sound quality is average for this price range, I'm neither impressed or dismayed with that. I would strongly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for lightweight, compact, portable, comfortable, inexpensive headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite durable enough","review":"The headphones just aren't well made. I've had 2 pairs have the small black wire that is in the headband fail, usually within a year of purchase.

Couldn't be happier!!!!!","review":"There's an avalanche of headphones to choose from. I choose these because I wanted quality sound and foldable convenience. I trusted the other reviewers and was pleased to find such a well priced set of foldable headphones. And they look great too...low profile, stylish look and color, well built and fantastic sound. They fold really flat!!!! I will probably buy another pair as back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for eyeglass wearers","review":"Title says it all--very uncomfortable around the ears. Getting phones or glasses on or off often requires taking both off, then putting it back on, depending which is on top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, Great Sound","review":"I got these headphones because I wanted something more comfortable than bud-style headphones. However, I also wanted something that still wouldn't fall off during a run. I have found these headphones to be very comfortable and they have no problem staying on my head during physical activity. It is also much more convenient to have a single cable from the headphones rather than a y-cable like most have.I found the sound quality of these headphones the most surprising thing about them though. In my opinion they are excellent. I am not an audiophile, but to me the bass, mids, and highs all sound well defined and clear. This set of headphones sounds better than a more expensive set of traditional headphones I have made by Sennheiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Class","review":"These \\"sporty\\" looking headphones earn high marks for comfort and sound quality. For under $25.00 you cannot go wrong and I doubt anyone - even the snobbiest audiophile - would find a darn thing wrong with these.In fact, I had the opportunity to do side-by-side testing between this pair and the twice-as-much Sennheiser PX100 and PMX100. My audio opinion (and I am picky) is that the sound quality difference is quite subtle and not a deal killer if 50 bucks is too much for a pair of phones. (Let's say the Phillips get a 8 out of 10 and the Senn's get a 9.5 out of 10.) Comfort rating, however gives the Phillips the nod.My one criticism is that they should have been a dark grey or near-black instead of off-white & light grey. See? Not much criticism at all, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable headphone... at reasonable price","review":"I ordered the 520 old model but the wrong model was delivered by the nonAmazon merchant and I returned them after I received them(I had to buy 3 packages just to save shipping fee) With this 820 model, it is sold by Amazon directly so it is great as I got it shipped free thanks to Amazon.

Sure, it's one of the great lost singles of the '70's but that doesn't mean it's the best song the disc. That honor goes to \\"Detroit Breakdown\\" which not only opens this CD but also \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" one the band's two five-star live discs. Other highlights include \\"Stoop Down #39\\" and the hilarious of \\"Funky Judge\\" (come on, how many times have you heard a George Jessel appearance on a rock album?).

Geils Band is best known for their 80's classic \\"Centerfold\\", but before that song and the Freeze Frame album they released a series of excellent albums in the 70's steeped in soul & blues. The best of those releases is Nightmares. Perfectly combining the rock, soul & blues sound, the album is a great listen. The best song on the album is the forgotten \\"Must've Got Lost\\". The song has a great sing along chorus and immediately will stick in your head. If all you know about J. Geils is Freeze Frame, then check out their earlier releases and you will not be disappointed. Nightmares is the best place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely slow","review":"This adapter is slower than my Canon Rebel XT.

Software installed, mouse charged, sparce directions followed and the mouse refused to navigate correctly. Navigation was wonky across the screen and jerky bypassing and jumping away from where I wanted it to go. I tried changing settings, but everything I could do and did had no effect on the mouse.

If you listen to a guitar player, why not listen to an album like this, or Robben in the Charles Ford band, where he lets loose? Robben is a blues guitar player. That means he's at the height of his powers playing straight blues like this, *not* cheezy jazz like Tiger Walk.

Our first one was in the shape of a Japanese fan. Both puzzles had 1000 pieces and I must say that this one was easier for us to put together maybe because there were blocks of colors that made it easier to see where things went. Usually we put the frames together first, but this puzzle was easier to put the insides together and finish with the edges last. Both puzzles when finished were actually very beautiful and we will buy more from this company. They are quality puzzles, most all the pieces are cut clean through, and those few that are not are very easy to separate. They even give you contact info. in case you find a problem with the puzzle. We didn't contact them as our puzzles were great with no missing pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whetstone","review":"A quality whetstone with an outstanding nonslip base to hold the stone in place while shapening knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afraid","review":"From the beginning of this book you are swept away...

The details of life both on the front and at home really brings us into the war, allowing us to see how conditions change and how his view on war and the Reich also change. A few extras, like a small glossary and a organizational chart are not really needed. The book is about life in the Reich as much as the battles the Wehrmacht fought. Lots about the daily life of the German soldier, from their food, how they dealt with the weather, how they dealt with the horror of battle.A must for seeing the war from a PERSON's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book was an outstanding first-hand account of a German soldier from WW2. With all of the first hand accounts from American veterans (which absolutely should be read and remembered), it was very interesting to read a view from the other side.

It only took me 4 days to get through the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great read.

Although it held my attention, the author's narrative seemed strangely detached from many of the events he experienced. After reflection, I have come to the conclusion that the sterile way in which he recounts the war--and his less than overwhelming assertion that he did not know about the atrocities committed by Germans--has more to do with the German mentality of the time, than with any deception or arrogance on his part. Reading about his idealistic views and actions, one begins to get a sense of how a nation of individuals with similar views could rationalize or overlook acts that they might have individually rejected.Soldat is an interesting account by a very lucky man, that--when combined with other perspectives of the subject--will give the reader not only a deeper historical understanding of WWII, but a glimpse at the German psyche as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting account","review":"I read this book in the space of eight hours.

Perhaps the most interesting part is the account of his time in a soviet prison camp after the war ended. The author describes how he was asked questions for some five years and learned not to implicate himself in anything which would be seen by the soviets as a war crime. The book gives the impression that it has been written to convey a certain message. The author thus talks of the war and distances himeself from the various war crimes.This is not really believable as the way that the germans killed the jews and the communists on the Russian front was the sort of thing that would be hard to hide.The book contains little insight into the way that the german or the soviet army worked in practice. This is perhaps due to the author being injured for a good proportion of the war and doing training for a good deal of the rest. There are better books around."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all monkey lovers!","review":"Great job! Being a monkey owner myself (6 capuchins from age 3 up to 30) I found this book to be great!

You have done great with the book and Ziggy. The chapter about her attempts to escape from her cage sure did bring back memories! Thanks Andrea, this is a book that will remain in my monkey library.

The author's degree is in criminal justice, and perhaps she should remain in that field. This book has short, choppy paragraphs and a \\"messy\\" chronology, going backward and forward through time in a confusing manner. The book lacks \\"tone\\" as if the author cannot decide whether she wants to be scientific or humorous. Worse, the science is not objective and the humor is not funny. The author describes what is going on in Ziggy's head as if it's factual(for instance, if the monkey hates or harbors resentment). Save your money. This is not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We bought this frame to use on our second child. We used a similar one on our first and liked the results so we decided to get another one. The only issue I had with it was that the impression material stuck to the wooden dowel that they give you to roll it out, so we had to use a non-stick rolling pin. Also they don't tell you that the foam like material expands a lot so you have to press their foot or hand in really deep to make sure you can see it when it is done drying. We didn't do a very deep impression with our first child and his footprint is faint but you can still make it out. Other than those issues, it is very easy to use and if you mess up the print you can just roll it up and try again. If I have another kid I will be buying another one of these for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"The \\"clay\\" is seriously hard to use. The rolling pin to flatten it is useless because the clay just sticks to it. Other tips, if you want to prevent the clay from sticking to your baby's foot, you can put some lotion on his/her foot. The oil will help prevent the clay from sticking. Dont wash your hands before handling the clay, the oil on your hands help with handling the clay. If you do wash your hands, you should again use moisturizer on your hands.Really poorly designed clay. Otherwise the other components such as the frame and matte are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap frame, TERRIBLE putty.","review":"I don't know why nobody else had this problem, but the putty was impossible to work with! I kneaded it for at least ten minutes, and it was still stiff, like the texture of memory foam. We pressed the baby's foot down as hard as we dared, and it left no imprint at all! I kneaded the crap again for another five minutes, and it still wasn't soft enough to take an imprint. I tried pushing my knuckle into it as hard as I could, and it still bounced right back up -- left no print at all! We'll keep the frame (even though it arrived broken, as others have said), but I'll get some clay or plaster for the print. That putty is impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mat is not white, as shown in the picture","review":"The frame is nice, and the impression material works well, but the mat is not white as shown in the picture. It has two sides, one is pink and the other is blue. I think both colors look awful with the frame. The kit comes with a little wooden \\"rolling pin\\" that is supposed to be used to roll out the impression material. I do not recommend using it, because the impression material sticks to it, so it's impossible to smooth out. I ended up using one of my plastic baby bottles to roll it out, because the bottle surface is smooth and round, so the impression material doesn't stick to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"opened the box and the frame was falling apart had to glue it back together. Just anther cheap product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Easy","review":"I have not written a review before, but I was so excited about this product that I had to. First, the picture does not depict how wonderful the kit looks when it is finished. In the large opening the clay-like impression (which I'll get to later) of your child's foot is placed behind protective glass and in the smaller opening you put your favorite picture of you infant. The greatest thing about this kit is how easy it was to do. The impression material is ready to use right out of the bag. The kit comes with a wooden rolling pin used to roll out the material. You then gently press your childs foot into the material and if you make a mistake you can correct it. The impression then simply air-drys overnight. It's incredible. We were so impressed we are purchasing two more to give to the grand parents as gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I was very excited when I first purchased this product.

Wasted money, with a scar to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointed! Broken frames...","review":"I never write reviews, but this time I am very disappointed... SO, After reading all good reviews I was very excited when the kits arrived - I ordered two.

I did get good impressions of baby's feet, but I had to figure out several tricks to working with the clay really fast. I kneaded the clay, put it on foil and tried to roll it out. It sticks to the wooden roller. It has the consistency of marshmallow fluff. Trick: Wrap the roller in tin foil. Then, when you're ready for the impression part, get baby's foot wet to get a smooth impression. I'm currently waiting the 24-48 hrs required for the clay to dry before I do anything else. Here's hoping it turns out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but not the best quality","review":"I think the material for the mold especially and for the entire frame is somewhat cheap. I know a couple of people who've been happy with this product but it just didn't work for us. It is tough to do with a squirmy baby and once we did finally get a mold the contrast wasn't very striking--a footprint with ink may look better. Not worth the effort or $, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get the perfect print","review":"Hi. I love this product (unfortunately the picture does not show how wonderful the finished kit is, hint: look at the company website). I saw some of the other reviews which pointed out a few problems and I have some great tips that I got by speaking to the Pearhead, Inc. customer service. Be sure to knead the material in your hands before you role it out. Second be careful not to role out the material too thin. Last flip the print over after 12 hours of drying so that the bottom can dry evenly. These steps will keep it from cracking when drying and will be sure to keep it from falling off the double-sided tape. Last if you have any problems I recommend calling the company, they are very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check for freshness","review":"I loved this keepsake frame kit. The first one I received as a present was not usable b/c the clay that came with it was already hard and not pliable. I had to exchange it for another kit. There should be some sort of date on the box to check for product freshness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Frame (Like Others) - No Customer Service from Pearhead","review":"The foam worked pretty well, although it doesn't dry flat, it curls up at the corners and never gets hard.The bigger problem is that the frame came in three piece; the one side with the horizontal piece and vertical piece attached... then a horizontal piece, then a vertical piece. I thought it must be like this so I emailed Pearhead, asking about it. No response. Guess not.Look at the other reviews, this broken frame is a recurring problem that I didn't listen to. I had to use 'Gorilla Glue' to hold the pieces together, further complicating the process. This thing is cheap and no way worth the money. I'm glad I had a back-up plan, going to Michael's and getting some of that clay you bake, worked PERFECTLY and isn't 'bendable' like this stuff. It's set forever, won't damage. Just find yourself a shadowbox type of frame, it's the same thing - seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Gift for Expecting Parents, at any Age!!","review":"My Mother gave me this kit at my shower, and I've never come across another molding kit nearly as good as this one. My son was only 4 days old when I took his foot impression, and I still had enough left over to take his hand also! And don't worry if your little one squirms, 'cause all you have to do is roll it up again and flatten it out. I't took me 3 try's to get his foot just right(due to the fact he kept wiggling his toes!)and the molding clay still worked beautifully, with no sign of drying out! I now ordered another one for when my next child is born, so I can hang it under his/her's big brother's frame. My one and only complaint is that the molding will not stick to the back of the frame with the tape they give you, my suggestion for that is to use a hot glue gun set on low or some heavy duty tape, like duck tape. All in all it's a great product and well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy!","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it! The plaster works well as it can be redone until you are happy with the results. Left to harden it forms a keepsake that you will always enjoy. I would definitely buy this product again for someone who has just had a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to remember tiny hands and feet","review":"I bought this kit for my preemie, because it was the only one the nurses would allow to be used in the NICU. The molding didn't upset the baby at all. Having a very small infant, I had plenty of room on the provided material for both a hand and a foot print, and the kit was SO easy to use. The imprints of tiny hands and feet are an absolute treasure. I am SO happy I bought this kit. The other thing that is wonderful about this kit is that if baby wiggles and smudges your inprint, you just roll it over and start again (and again and again if necessary). The only thing I didn't like was the provided adhesive didn't work for long, but 2 minutes with the glue gun fixed that problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM ZACARDI'S","review":"I am writing this to warn you. I bought this frame from Zicardi's and it came damaged. After several discussions with customer service, instead of doing a return like they said, they sent me another frame. That came damaged as well. I have made numerous attempts over 4 months to resolve the problem with no success. Their customer service people are very nice, but nothing gets done.

Unfortunately, the Olympus card is complexly designed to allow panorama; consequently the Olympus card is very susceptable to disaster.

In addition, if you do re-format the Olympus card with a low battery in your camera, it will also bomb.

My main gripe is the wand. It is next to impossible to squeeze it and if too much pressure is applied, the squeezing trigger part breaks off and then the foam gushes out out the side of the nozzle on the can. Also, if you do not use all of the can immediately, the foam will no longer come out. I managed to fill only 3 little holes with this product. I wore surgical gloves so it would not get on my hands, but the chemical in the foam ate a hole through them and I still got it on my hands. Had to use lacquer thinner to get it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE STUFF, HAIR RUINED","review":"This is a hot mess to apply even though I did a test patch and got the hang of dispensing small amounts slowly, it still got everywhere, has a really bad stickiness on everything EXCEPT what you want it to stick to! I tried applying around a hole in the wall under my bathroom sink that a pipe was coming through. This so called GREAT stuff did not stick to the pipe, maybe because the pipe was too cold or smooth or had some condensation, and instead a glob dripped on my hair. I panicked, ripped my gloves off, further spreading the mess, and looked around for acetone and couldn't find it. I had to cut a 4\\" section of hair off because of this. I should have left the damn draft because now my hair is a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"One time use only","review":"I thought that I read ALL of the fine print before purchasing and beginning to use this product. Upon trying to figure out how to clean the wand that is used to get the spray foam out of the can, I noticed in very fine print - \\"One time use only.\\" This should be marked clearly on the front of the package so that people are aware of what they are purchasing. I was expecting to use this multiple times until the product eventually went bad. Why would I buy this to fill a small crack here and there, only to discover that if not used within two hours the bottle will seal itself shut? So basically, I just spent $6 to seal two very small openings. And I won't even know how well the product has worked until it cures in 8 hours. As well, the wand did not work consistently - The foam did not come out evenly and did not adhere to the surface, but rather when pulling the wand away, much of the foam came with it. Very messy. Not satisfied with this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible trigger design","review":"Anyone who uses this knows how unforgiving this stuff is if you get it on places you don't want it, like your clothing. To lessen your odds of keeping clean, they thought of this nice trigger that screws onto the top, that constantly unscrews itself while using it. Then the foam starts shooting out the base of the nozzle all over your hands, floor and clothing. Most of the time I use this I don't have the luxury of keeping the can away from my body. I'm usually on my back shooting up in cracks or whatever. Please redesign this so the damn trigger stays put."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY WORTHLESS","review":"Bought an entire case of this to fill in some large cracks in the attic.

I had issues with this game. At one of the locations, I kept getting a black screen and had trouble navigating through it. And then everytime I quit and tried to come back later, I would have to start all over again. I downloaded the patch and that still did not fix the issue with this game. I tried to play all of the way through the first crime, hoping that the problem was only with the first game, and got to a point where I couldn't figure out what to do and was unable to get a hint. I found the game very frustrating. If it had worked properly it would have been a pretty cool game."},{"rating":"1","title":"cs sucks","review":"i collected all the evidence, used all the hints, interviewed everyone and still didn't have enough to convict. i didn't know what else to do so i quit"},{"rating":"2","title":"About CSI Miami","review":"CSI: Miami, is a very good game; very challenging and hard.

Instead, the game throws you in the first scenario - that is just as difficult as the last - and you are left staring at the screen for hours stuck and frustrated. Most games start on an easy level and become more difficult as you go along but not this one. This takes all the fun out of it and even after I went online and printed out the step-by-step solution for the first level, it was still daunting and the list was so long. If you can afford to give up a few weeks of your life to this game or you are a genious with nothing better to turn your talent towards, then you could tackle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this game - CSI Miami","review":"I ENJOYED PLAYING THIS GAME.

I have all of the CSI games and this one was horrible. The graphics were horrific. The game kept freezing up and was really slow. Trying to find any evidence was hard because your pointer did not light up like in the other games. When you did find something and tried to click on it, it kept telling you that you needed to use a different tool, even though you were using the correct one. It just seems to have a lot of problems. Maybe there is a patch but since it updates automatically and is supposed to look for patches and other updates after installation, but since one never installed I am guessing there isn't one. This was a regretful purchase. I love CSI Miami. Because of that, I thought that I would really love the game. Never let your expectations shadow reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 yr old has played this every day for over 3 months!","review":"I gave this to my 5 year old daughter over 3 months ago.

The rules are simple enough that he understood them easily, in fact he was soon coming up with his own versions of the rules (play for high score rather than low, etc.) Even his 4-year-old brother enjoyed playing.

It says it is for ages 6 and up, but she grasped the concept of the game very quickly and is able to play independently. It has been a fun way to also work on addition. I love it, my little girl loves it and my husband loves it! What more could we ask for. The packaging is very nice. It is easy for my little girl to put the cards away when we are all done playing.

Their employee said it was his very favorite for the 6-7 years old age group as he played a game of Carcassone with his friends (Carcassone is our #1 table game to play but it is too complex for a 6 year old). Rat-A-Tat-Cat is one of a few games that a 6 year old can play and mom and dad will actually have fun playing with them over and over again. Playing this game your child will learn simple additions and also strategy and probability. Our little one is now 9 and Rat-A-Tat-Cat is still a frequent in our household.Rat-A-Tat-Cat makes a perfect gift since most places don't carry it and thus most people don't know about it.

It took a couple of minutes to figure out but then it is easy. So far we've only played with the two (of us) but I imagine it will be even more fun with more people.

The 6 year old sibling can play along easily as well. This game is very simple to learn. Even adults will enjoy the simplicity, and even chuckle over our 'poor' memory of cards! Game play goes pretty quickly. There is no defining 'winning' moment, only when a player believes they have achieved their best hand. There are two great skills here for kids... first memory recollection... remembering what two cards you looked at. Second, adding skills... children are able to add 4 simple numbers together to achieve lowest score. Even if little addition is known, knowing low versus high values of numbers is learned. Overall, one of our family's new favorite card games! Definitely a crowd pleaser for all ages!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The salespeople at a great local toy store recommended this game for my 6-year old.

Despite the smooth finish of the handle, due to its shape, my wet or oily hand was able to maintain firm grip on the knife during deboning of the various types of meats.The only problem with this knife that I can tell is the Type-301 steel blade seems bit softer then Shun, wusthof, Kasumi or global knives.

The center piece that holds everything up is so precarious and the little pieces that hold it in are so flimsy the piece starts tilting and then the angels don't hit the chimes. When you get everything bent the proper way and balanced and the angels do fly around and hit the chimes, you can barely hear it. The little bells are so thin they make almost no sound.

I found the novel to be wanting in good character developement, basic narrative skills and overflowing with an embarrasing sense of conceit and narcisistic self-admiration that bordered on the ludicrous. There was something very adolescent to the tone of this pompose, pretentious book that seemed to want desperately to convince us of how smart the author was.

I was truly floored by the emptiness of this piece; funny how a book can waste one's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moisturizer","review":"I have used this on my dry, cracking thumbs and the heels of my feet.

This card scored very poorly in the ratings of other cards. I initially thought it would be good to get in on a cheap deal, since this card is cheaper than the other ones. However, since I got the item, I've noticed that it's slower than my other cards, much slower. According to dpreview.com, this card only shows a 14x read (2,085 KB/s) and a measly 6x write (855 KB/s)! If you have one of the newer cameras, like the canon powershot s230, I'd recommend against it! Also, if you had a dell axim or ipaq, you'll notice the speed difference immediately when you try to upload programs on to the card!Ok for people with like to wait, and people who just want storage not speed, but I'd pay the extra money just for the faster speeds offered by kingston, simpletech or viking.If you like sandisk, their ultra series are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one to Buy!

I didn't think my 4 yr old could remember which is which, plus all the rules, but he does. Like others have already stated: really cool illustrations and a fun card game that takes about 20 minutes. All the Gamewright card games we own are excellent, but this is my boys favorite one. This is a game older boys ages 8-12 would really enjoy, and recommended age is 8 & up.Very nice card game to add to one's collection. And, cards are cards, so they will wear out/ bend over time.

I thought it was quite poorly written, and terribly edited. There are typos throughout the book, misspellings, etc. Some of the interview material was just plain confusing. However, having said that, it is the only book I personally have been able to find on Dinah Washington, so it must get some credit for that. There is quite a bit of information in the book, but I felt it could have been much better organized, and I felt like the author's personal critiques were a bit misinformed. Overall, not that great of a read, as far as enjoyment, but it does provide some information on a terrific lady, which is sorely lacking in the jazz annals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing and organization","review":"My rating would have been higher.

Gruff vocals are pitched slightly from time to time, going from rumble to screech with a touch of clean, which keeps things vital.

His description of the story's hero, Owen Gray, holding the WOODEN stock of a modern Marine Corps M40A1, is laughable, as all current USMC sniper rifles have composite stocks. Finally, none of the characters are believable or even sympathetic. Don't waste your time on this one.

From the police to the snipers, Thayer creates these characters to be no more than unrealistic, blathering idiots. Facts have no place in this book, just the fantasy renderings of a lawyer who has watched too much TV. This book may be for you if, you are a sixteen year-old video game junkie with delusions of sniping, but if want a story line with more realism than fantasy buy Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact. This book does nothing more than insult the character of Marines and police everywhere.

I expected to see many new techniques on finding new clients and recruits. They are the same methods the MLM companies have been telling you to do which do not work or make you any money. Like contacting friends, relatives, associates, neighbours. Nobody wants to be hounding the people closest to them for sales and recruits.There is no information on how to make the most of your business, shortcuts in the business, tips on how to get your business going, etc.It is a book based on the same methods and techniques that your MLM company might have told you to do. Who wants to approach their local cashier or someone you don't know at all for sales. That is intrusive. They don't talk about what a person can do if they don't have a lot of contacts or know a lot of people other than hitting up absolutely anybody off the street for sales.I do not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Period Piece","review":"A mystery/adventure novel that I found reminiscent of the work of Agatha Christi.

It calls for heating an empty cast iron or enamelware Dutch oven at high heat before tossing in the dough. We had an old cast iron Dutch oven which we had been avoiding because of clean-up difficulties, found the bread worked fine in it and decided we'd have occasions to make more than one loaf at a time and needed something else. This does a great job and it cleans up beautifully in soap and water week after week with no worries of rust. It distributes heat well. Also works great atop the stove. It is heavy as to be expected and you need thick potholders to grab the handles when it has been in a 450 degree oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem with porcelain","review":"I bought the Dutch oven for my grandmother she is 80 years old for her birthday.

I respect everyone's opinion here, but Vangelis is beyond New Age. I don't think it serves Vangelis justice to put him into a category. I think it takes away from the brilliant music to categorize it. Yanni is New Age, Vangelis is not. I do not think there is a category for Vangelis, except for \\"the greatest musician of our time.\\"Voices may not be his greatest work, but is worth 5 stars because of the quality of music. The opening song is wonderful, but seems a bit out of place considering the rest of the album. But, the way that he ties in the other songs from this opener is amazing.

It's like a musical miracle. I can relate to other reviewers comments about- Creation of the Universe and- floating in air, because this CD is very visually stimulating as well. Ask the mountains is very original. While listening to this I once visualized (while closing my eyes) seeing a female ghost like angel come down from the mountains speaking to me and fading in and out & moving around, appearing and disappearing strangly, ect...

This came close, but still not satisfied, this is why. I put it on for probably 15 minutes before I expected to leave the house. In that short timespan the top of the band had moved (slid) down squashing my boobs! Any female that has had a mamogram knows what I mean when I say they were squashed to look like pancakes. So you could easily see the top elastic line across my chest which was unsightly and looked (and felt) very uncomfortable. So size 44D is more like a size 38-40D and not comfortable in the least. I really wanted this to work out but so far I have not found a comfortable strapless bra for my size. This bra has now joined a stack of bras I call \\"The Cruel Bras\\". OUCH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Useless!","review":"I purchased this to wear with summer cami tops under other tops based on other reviews that it had support. But there is no truth to that fact. I am a 44D if this bra offers support it should only be worn for sizes that have no bigger than an A-B Cup.

However once i got it in the mail I was very dissapointed. The back of the bra was very scratchy and uncomfrotable.

I was completly disatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glamorise strapless bra - pointing breasts","review":"This bra would be perfect if the cups were seamless. There is a center \\"dart\\" (seam) stitched from under each breast to the nipple area. The dart comes to a very sharp point, much like a dart stitched in a skirt. The pointiness reminds me of the old fashioned bras that women wore years ago....the pointier the better. Unfortunately, I personally don't fill in the \\"points\\" and therefore when I wear this bra under knit fabric or something form-fitting, the points fold and are very obvious under the garment. It would have been a better design if it were \\"seamless\\" like most bras are. Otherwise it is a very comfortable bra and it is also pretty to wear under something low cut or v-necked."},{"rating":"1","title":"not true size info","review":"The bra though fairly well made is at least one to two sizes smaller than specified.

I am disappointed though. The back seems to always bunch up like a normal one clasp bra, I can't get it to stay flat. Also I feel like the elastic at the top in the front where the lace is makes it feel like it is smashing my boobs down. They seem to just be pressed and more pointy, I wore it with a camisole and just normal shirt and felt embarrassed because I felt like you could see the line and them being pushed down.

At the time I was not sufficiently able to appreciate its depth and wealth of knowledge, but today I keep it close to hand when I'm preparing sermons.

For the first 150 pages NOTHING of any real interest happens. I very nearly put the book down. After that first 150, we finally get some action, but this action is indeed centered around other characters than our heroine. It seemed like I was suddenly reading another, albeit better, book. Unfortunately, this much more action packed second half is essentially a rip off of all those many movies about men hunting men, while the first half was so much like the Honor Harrington books that I decided to simply go and reread those superior tomes. I suppose my sincere recommendation is that you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much emphasis on setting","review":"I've waded through to page 150, but it's been a struggle, and I'm absolutely bored. The most interesting things that have happened so far are that smuggled goods (never identified) have been found aboard, and the yacht owner's spoiled brat of a nephew has jeopardized everyone with a stupid prank. Much of the book to this point has been setting -- the yacht's decor, the environmental features, the characters' clothes, the cuisine, even the yacht owner's exercise equipment. I've got 200+ pages to go, and they promise to be much the same.So I set this book aside for MAROONED, a Star Trek Voyager book that also deals with space pirates. Within 30 pages, I'm hooked -- and I've never really been a Star Trek fan. Seeing the contrast between it and Moon's book I decide I've had enough of HUNTING PARTY, which goes into my box of charity give-aways.Too bad -- it could have been a good story if there hadn't been so much fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"On leaving the main character.","review":"A previous review wrote that this was not some of Elizabeth Moon's best work because she left the main character to talk about other characters that were not so likable. I understand the reviewers frustration, but I do not agree. Moon's books are not all written from a single character's point of view. Like any good author she understands that there is more than one side to any story. Besides, she goes on to develop these characters in other novels in the series and they grow and change, even as the jerks in the real world can. I feel this makes this book and this series more like real life and much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series start","review":"Hunting Party is the first book in the Seranno Legacy series. The series is a space drama with recurring characters over several years. This book features Heris Serrano as the main character. She is a former space ship captain trying to get back into the military. The series features space ships, guns, lots of military references, horses, good guys, bad guys, spies, politicians, and strong female roles. The cover art for the books is rather silly. But don't let that turn you off.Here's the book order if you are intersted: Hunting Party, Sporting Chance, Winning Colors, Once a Hero, Rules of Engagement, Change of Command, and Against the Odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Friction","review":"There is nothing like a good science fiction story... And this IS nothing like a good science fiction story. This tale has been told in many, many different books and films and every single one of them was better than this poor excuse for a novel. The characters lacked depth, the premise lacked credibility and the plot had more holes in it than a factory full of of polo mints. Instead of being an integral part of the story the science fiction element (basically a disgraced starship captain and a few wretched attempts at some futuristic style technology) was totally incidental and the story could easily be cloned to take place in any country, in any social setting and in any period in time. This was the first Elizabeth Moon I had ever read... and the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ain't no party.","review":"This was one of the poorest books I've read in a long time. I think the most frustrating thing is that she's actually not a bad writer. The story reads like a Girl's Own adventure, though the adventure part is so obvious, that you'll probably be able to guess where the cliches, oops I mean characters will end up at the end of the book. If I had to read another description of what dress the old lady was wearing or what a good jape they all had horse riding the book was heading for the bin. I kept giving it a chance but I should have done what the other reviewer did and ditch it after 150 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Class","review":"This novel, the first in Elizabeth Moon's Serrano Legancy cycle of science-fiction novels, is pure class. Space Opera is notoriously difficult to write, but Moon does so with an ability likely to induce envy in many. Quaint with its suggestion of a future heavy laden with class and caste divides, both social and political, Moon provides a welcome antidote to the often stifling Political Correctness of much current science fiction writing. Employing a fantastic and ironic sense of humour, Moon delivers a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast-paced space adventure that is a fun read.","review":"Elizabeth Moon writes a good, straight-forward adventure story that is a pleasure to read. Heris Serrano hasunwillingly resigned her commission from the Space Service and found herself a job as captain on a rich old woman'sprivate space yacht (lavishly decorated in shades of purple.) She might have found the job boring, but that was beforeshe ran across a web of smugglers, traitors, and \\"sportsmen\\" hunting the ultimate game - humans. But Heris can handleall that - the real challenges are all those rich, spoiled neices and nephews and learning how to ride that horse.

My inspiration being that if I was iliterate and had English as a secondary language I could not come up with a bigger pile of rubbish. According to some of the other reviews this book is the weakest of the series. I will never know as this book has put me off *reading anything ever again!* It really is that poor. How people can justify giving it 4 or 5 stars in a review is beyond my comprehension. Books like 'A Game of Thrones' by George RR Martin, or 'Perdido Street Station' by China Miéville, deserve that kind of rating. Read them... Go. Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Book One, The Idle Rich of the Future Are Boring!","review":"This is a book about horse back riding (and racing), fox hunting, and managing a space yacht. It involves the adventures of spoiled rich children, and their eccentric aunt, who doesn't even like them much. We get introduced to Herris Serrano, an ex-captain of the Fleet, starring in the role of nursemaid to her idle rich employers. She also gets enmeshed with the police as an investigator, which doesn't make sense as Fleet officers are not trained detectives.The first half of the book is soul-crushingly boring, and I would have dropped it already if I hadn't gotten the trilogy as one item. The second half follows odious characters too closely, over-emphasizes the setting of 'rich hunting world', and barely scrapes up an ending. I had a hard time relating to the characters, and while later books in the series are better, I'd simply skip book one. Overall, not enough worthwhile to make the time reading pay off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Survivor Fan","review":"I am disappointed. Infogames or whatever they call themselves blew this one.

Here's an example of a conversation I had with a contestant:Who do you think is going to be voted off at Tribal Council?Computer: Time is running out...for Rodger.What have you heard?Computer: Amber is on edge.Should we get rid of Rodger?Computer: You're crazy!You've seen enough. 2)The reward/immunity challenges are exactly the same: either shooting at targets, doing a race carrying something, or flinging rocks.3) The graphics are a bit subpar.4) The voting doesn't always make any sort of sense.That about does it.

They are all accurate. In the \\"survival\\" and \\"challenge\\" sections, I can't even get my cursor to work properly, which is somewhat frustrating since I bought the game with the intention of actually playing it. Plus, each section of the game takes at least a minute to download so most of the time you find yourself sitting there waiting to play. And even if you manage to create an \\"alliance\\" with some of the other characters, they are just as likely to vote you off anyway. The challenges themselves are less interesting than any run-of-the-mill arcade game from the 80's.

Another cool thing is the make a charecter option now you can design your own survivor.

It has more bugs than a Dairy Queen bathroom, and the graphics are about as clean as Richard's taint after 33 days on the Island. All that said, I did play it for 5 hours or so (unfortunately this was due to the fact that a few of the challenges took 30 or so minutes to complete). If they come out with a MASSIVE patch for this thing, it would be worthwhile to pick up (considering the low low price).

In hind sight, the game publisher should have paid me to play the game and think I would have thrown it back at them.AI is hard to get right in any game, but this game set a new standard in REALLY STUPID AI. While in camp mode, your supposed to walk around, conduct tasks, talk to tribe members and influence their decisions while making alliances. It never mattered what you did in camp, it made absolutly no difference in the rest of the game.The challenges were just too stupid and repetative to list.

Not only was the storyline development exaggerated and biased, but the writing was immature and insubstantial. Of course there are things that can go wrong within the CPS system, but to publish a story that is so grossly exaggerated and inaccurate is actually an enormous disservice to everyone.

However, I would argue that men are put in these categories, as well. It is a very quick read & does provide recommendations at the end concerning books, movies, and television programs that show strong women, not 'wimpettes'. I would suggest any parent or concerned other who feels women and girls are portrayed offensively read Issacs essay for a primer but actually write to the 'powers that be' that are in charge of network decisions,the movie makers, and, finally, the writers that put the 'pictures' in our minds of what a strong women really means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, but a disappointing read.","review":"I have to admitt that it was the title of the book that caught my attention. I was excited to finally find a critique of modern women and the wimpy, unaccountable, excuse-making attitudes many television personalities inflict upon the viewers. My first disappointment was that the book focuses mainly on fictional TV characters, not real people. What is the point of criticising a fictional personality if it is the actress' job to portray her that way? The author missed out on the major wimpette of our time - Oprah Winfrey. While I don't mean to pick on Oprah, I want to point out that there are plently of true cases the author could have used in her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I picked up this book hoping to gain some insight into the role of women and the characters that they play in books,television, and movies. I consider myself a feminist and I find most books in the Women's Studies sections of bookstores fairly interesting. I did not expect an optimistic viewpoint and Isaacs did not fail in this respect. What I found so annoying and disappointing in this book was Isaacs' insistence in defining what makes a woman a positive role model and what makes her a negative role model. By the end of the book, one begins to feel, (or at least I did as a woman) that any hint of weakness in a woman spells her downfall. For Isaacs, the ingredients that make up a brave dame are no easy feat and I beg to differ with her on several counts. By creating all of these rules for becoming a brave dame, Isaacs undermines what I would argue was her intent - to show that brave dames do exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor attempt at a comeback...","review":"Bonnie, who produced some memorable tunes in the 80's, attempts to capitalize on Nicki French's hit remake of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" by remaking Meatloaf's \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" in the same vein. The songs here are extremely weak and the entire project sounds uninspired. Sometimes it's best to rest on past glories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z-E-R-O stars!!!","review":"Quite possibly the worst 'comeback' album ever (non-)produced! Where once Bonnie's voice was husky & seductively raspy, it has grown simply as grating as gravel; the arrangements seem to have been made by a group of people who are blind, deaf and EXTREMELY dumb -- nothing else could explain the almost deliberate shoddiness of the entire affair! It's not exactly helped by Bonnie, whose old-bag-addicted-to-Pall-Mall's voice sounds uncomfortably like someone coughing up a lung. I was all I could do to finish listening to it. Not even awful enough to be enoyed as 'camp'. Sad sad sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a new direction?","review":"You know, I think it's time for Ms. Tyler to realize that she is not a biker chick anymore (was she ever?) and face the fact that it's time to grow up. Even with the raspy, damaged sound of her voice, her vocals can be extraordinary, but here, she sounds merely tired and used. Songs like \\"Sexual Device\\" wouldn't even cut it on an 18 year old's disc let alone the middle aged Ms. Tyler's. It's time for some new, more sophisticated song writers and producers to get this recording artist's career back into gear and let us hear what she's truly capable of. For shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonnie's best album of the 90's so far","review":"Bonnie gets back to more raunchy tunes, after being produced by German producers that geared her towards something that was a bit more middle of the road. It is not as good as \\"Faster than the Speed of Night\\", but it is worth putting an ear into it. \\"Making Love\\" is a must-hear and \\"Make it right tonight\\", shows off her tremendous voice. \\"Two out of Three ain't bad\\" has not much left from the original version, but it still is very good. There is no other one like Bonnie.

For a debut this was just lazy and stail. I know he's been doing his thing here and there but don't play like it's your second or third CD. He did rock tracks where he wasn't overcome by the beat and was clearly heard. As for tracks where the hooks were not need and just trash? XXL needed focus. I mean he's an ENGLISH teacher. And Bad Newz MCs don't do the whole down south thing. Keep it real, take it back to the 8ball days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifeson expands, contracts, ultimately pleases","review":"Alex Lifeson of Rush fame masterminded this 'solo' effort, aided by members of I Mother Earth. Some tracks of this disc are classic Rush-type fodder, such as START TODAY, while some tracks, like the menacing and low key title track, explore entirely different regions. The beautiful and powerful intrumental prowess of STRIP AND GO NAKED is a high point, while the muddy and repetitive THE BIG DANCE is a definite low.Lifeson sometimes emphasizes guitar power and presence over band-level intricacy, which may put off dedicated Rush listeners who worship the bass or the drum kit. All told, however, Lifeson displays a wide range of gifts and produces an interesting if not always successful 'debut' project. Certainly a VICTOR 2 disc would be an intriguing and welcome developement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alex Experiments","review":"This album, by Alex's own admission, was an experimental exercise...and it shows. The songs are definitely not Rush-esque by any stretch of the imagination. Alex's tastes in more straight-forward hard rock are in full effect. It is quite a surprise to read the lyrics to the first song, which is quite crude and pornographic. I wonder if Alex purposely led the album off with this as a statement to say, \\"No. These are not Neil's lyrics!\\" The album could be lumped in with many no-name hard rock bands of the early 90's. There is no noticeable style or discernable direction that makes it stand out.It's not that the songs are bad, they just aren't good either. It's not an album that I listen to regularly. The one highlight that I enjoy is \\"Shut Up Shuttin' Up!\\" where Alex's wife and his friend's wife bicker about their husbands while they boys play a pretty good instrumental piece. It is both an enjoyable listen and hilarious at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regressive Rock","review":"I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. It sounds like what it is: Rush without the insightful lyrics of Neil Peart or the vocals/bass of Geddy Lee (actually, the singer does sound like Geddy in his earlier days). I won't say that it's a bad album, but to be honest, I haven't been inspired to listen to it much since I bought it. The band, Rush, has grown and evolved so much over the years; this is a step backward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"While Alex Lifeson is considered a master guitarist, he's clearly not the driving creative force behind Rush these days, as evidenced by this steaming pile of musical dung.This album -- lyrically, musically and conceptually -- is excrement, with Lifeson demonstrating none of the qualities that make Rush's music compelling. From a guitar perspective, it's an aimless, disjointed soup of half-realized riffs. Lyrically, it's simply offensive when it isn't completely risible.It's a mess, and recommended only for no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless effort by Rush Axeman","review":"I was so anxious to get my hands on an Alex Lifeson solo project, and boy was I disapointed. This may be the worst CD I have ever purchased. Yes, the lyrics may be tounge in cheek and the mood of the album very dark, but I don't get off on the misogynic, violent badgery of noise that is presented on this absolutely embarrasing effort. Lifeson was a guitar idle of mine for the last three decades and this album made me re-think my respect for the man. This album does not even deserve a single star. The vocals are noisome and the guitar rarely exhibits Lifeson's talents. I try as I can to pretend that this albums was never recorded. This garbage is purely noise. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, Dark, Energetic Effort from Lexert","review":"Alex takes the energy from Rush's Counterparts CD and brings it to a different level for his solo debut. Songs like Don't Care, The Dance and Sending Out A Warning border on alternative (with excellent vocal help from Edwin). Start Today sounds a little bit like a Rush tune with Dalbello providing more range than Geddy. Alex changes gears with the title cut and At The End, providing spoken word for both tracks, both dealing with dark issues. The rest of the album rocks (Check out \\"Shut Up Shutting Up\\" featuring the rants of Alex's wife and friend) you are expecting a Rush type album (in addition to Geddy's My Favorite Headache) you've come to the wrong place."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy but cute","review":"I bought two of these pups for my children on christmas.

Another thing is there are too many pro quarterbacks and not enough pro defensive players and wide receivers. What about Charles Woodson, Jerry Rice, Keyshawn Johnson, Terrell Owens maybe (only if your desprate) Randy Moss, Derrick Brooks, Warren Sapp or Ray Lewis?

He missed more notes than he hit. Surely there are other recorded concerts that could have been released as a live album. The rest of the album sounds fine. This concert was obviously in support of their Vital Signs album but I would like to hear a live album that has some songs from When Seconds Count and Too Hot To Sleep. Maybe the band can put something together from a concert supporting Reach.

So if you've read the original rules, all their advice applies here via online. Again we're dealt with common sense advice, that was dished out on the Rules, except this time you'll hear \\"don't date a guy without a photo.\\" Its obvious that the authors are writing it just to make money and btw, isn't the author in divorce court? I believe so, and why would you want to take advice from someone that's divorcing? Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pathetic","review":"I am a 38 year-old man, and I don't play games when I am dating someone. That's what this book tells women to do. I attempted to date a few women who tried these strategies on me(I.E. not returning my phone calls), and I dumped them quickly! I treat women with respect, and am always a gentleman. Men deserve the same amount of respect they give to women, and this stupid book teaches just the opposite. No wonder one of the authors just got divorced. It serves her right for screwing up so many women with her warped sense of dating. Do you ladies really want a relationship based on lies and deceit? What is this junk about men always have to be the pursuer? If I like a woman, I don't care if she pursues me.

A little cat & mouse at the beginning of a relationship is acceptable while a couple is trying to establish a relationship and still making up their minds about each other. But once a relationship has been established, I think it's time to get real. The author suggest that you keep playing games until the wedding day. I don't see how one could have a successful marriage, when your spouse never really got to know the real you during the courtship, but instead only got to know some mysterious character you were playing. I bought this book for curiosity's sake.

We studied Qi Gong and Tai Chi (see discussion at the end of the video for discussion of the differences) for some years and then stopped. It was a hassle to go to the \\"Y\\" - took way too long. Then the Tai Chi instructor started getting carried away with the philosophical and quasi-madical aspects. None of that here.I do think they have this one mis-labelled as Tai Chi, when it seems more simple loosening and relaxing exercises - ie. Qi Gong. I will buy the other one and suspect that it will be more Tai Chi, as it mentions more advanced exercises. Will update then.

If you are truly to be connected \\"to the root\\", you also need to see the position of the feet and legs. You cannot.Despite that, the exercises are pretty good... for the hands.

My previous experiences with maps were that they almost always one-time use (unless you were overly careful).During my backpack trip, I found several additional trails that weren't on the map however I think the level of trails is just about right given the map size. If I wanted to have all the trails on this map, it would have become too complex and confusing.

The animation quality is like that typically seen in basic Saturday morning cartoons, which is good enough for kids. What I like is that all the videos in this series give all the important details of the story, rather than giving a shallow, watered-down version as is usually the case in children's stories. These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. Each video is 45-50 minutes long, and this double feature has two such videos on the disc. The only reason I didn't give this series a 5 is that each video has a hokey song that could definitely have been left out, but for such a low price and good script, I can overlook that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff!!","review":"My fav tracks are \\"I'm a Woman\\" and \\"All Night Long.\\" They have a website where you can hear some of the tunes at their Web-site.If you don't start tapping your fingers, feet, or other appendage when listening to this music, then you are made of wood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item shipped","review":"not sure if it was intentional but i was NOT sent the item I ordered, instead I was shipped the wrong title from the same author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimental hip-hop/jazz","review":"Very interesting composition by Ricci Rucker.

I had difficulty putting a B-size cup in without squishing the bra. The clasp is also badly designed. If it breaks, it's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed, but the whole thing is poorly engineered. I think it was made even harder seeing as how I tried using the BraBABY with a front-closing racer back.In the end, I think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag.I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"I bought this product with great expectations that it would save my not-so-inexpensive Victoria Secret bras from excessive wear in the washing machine. It does do this, though the product is not very user friendly when your bra is fairly large cupped. I suppose if you have smaller cupped bras, this device works wonderfully. As for the larger DD or bigger cups, you have to tuck and there is a large overlap on the smaller interior ball. Also, another problem I have found is that the larger cups with underwire are REALLY hard to use with this ball. Again, due to the size of the larger cups. Otherwise, I would think that this is a great product for use with smaller cupped bras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After less than 2 weeks, the item broke.

However, it's completely useless! She was really disappointed because the bra straps tangled and fell right through the gaping holes that are almost 3 inches wide. She had to squish her bra in because it barely fits in the plastic, and so it's probably impossible for ladies with larger sizes. The cheap plastic on the latch broke off and fell to the ground, and the rest of the plastic is very flimsy.

The plastic it's made out of is very flimsy. Underwires are a chore to keep inside while you're closing the apparatus up. (If you're bigger than a D cup, forget using the Brababy) The straps usually stay hooked inside the inner ball, no problems there. It does take up alot of room in the washer, so don't put too many clothes in with it.

However, I had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the BraBABY and they were pretty tangled when I later took the bras out. I also have to wonder how a larger bra would work, considering I'm merely a B cup and it was a tight fit. In theory, I think it's an excellent idea. In truth, I think it still needs work. Additionally, although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer, one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times I've used them - even drying on gentle cycle. It did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus. I hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"one broke at the first use","review":"It's good for its purpose but not resistant.

The narrative has an immediacy that makes one feel that one has just stumbled upon a new world, with all of its dangers and mysteries.In the last section, the pilgrim tells his story to the Spanish King, and the rest, as they say, is history.If you like the magical realism genre so popular among South American novelists, you will love this book. If you are looking for plausible historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Como NO escribir una novela","review":"Después de deleitarnos con \\"Aura\\" y \\"La muerte de Artemio Cruz\\", este prolífico escritor se lanza a la aventura de interpretar la historia y la cultura sin tener la ironía del ensayista portugués Saramago; dándonos, en contrapartida, un adobe de exquisita redacción y amplia dicción pero pesadísima lectura disfrazada dizque de novela. Aburrido, ampuloso, arrogante son los primeros adjetivos que se ocurren con la letra A. No hay trama, no hay orden.

This being no exception. When I first listened to this album I found it to be absolutly intolerable. It is filled with bouncy, rocky music the likes of which you would expect to find on a Dr. Demento album, without the twised lyrics. I felt Tori's addition was it's only redeemable quality. But, as I took the time to listen to it again, this time with an open mind and a head's up to what I would hear, it slowly began to grow on me,and grow on me, and grow on me. Now, it is part of my treasured Christmas collection that I love each year. I would recommend this to all but the most conservative out there, and even to those I say give it a chance!

You can't stop after reading just the first book of this series, you have to read them all, they only get better and better! And if you're reading this book because you heard it was romantic, that's true, it is, you just have to wait a few books, which makes it all the better, the suspense.

Like other southern sodas (e.g., Royal Crown), Cheerwine is a little sweeter and less heavily carbonated. Don't leave the lid off bottles of Cheerwine for long - it will go completely flat. The taste is mellow and unusual, not at all like cherry cola or cherry 7UP - more like cream soda with cherries added. I first tasted Cheerwine when I moved to North Carolina a few years ago; it was unlike any other soda I'd had before, and I buy it often now.Today, Cheerwine is available throughout the South and serves as the perfect accompaniment to a humid summer day. The company even has a website with recipes, including a rather tasty-sounding BBQ sauce. If you're looking for a good old-fashioned taste of the South, try out this appealing soda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses It's Carbonation Too Quickly","review":"The soda loses its carbonation too quickly like a cheap store brand generic soda. Essentially the soda is a cherry flavored drink...not maraschino/grenadine cherry like other cherry flavored sodas or products with 'cherry' flavor added (i.e. Cherry Dr. Pepper, Cherry Coke)...but Cheerwine taste like real pitted cherries. The soda has the darker red color like a real cherry, not the bright red syrup/food coloring look. I like the real cherry favor idea behind the soda; however, you cannot finish a can or bottle without to going totally flat. I assume they have to cut corners to complete with their massive corporation competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his better work","review":"Moved by Baukham's classic on Jude, I bought this book.

So here I am now, and again finding myself purchasing a Butthole Surfers product, partly because of their reputation for legendary live shows (this being from their prime), and partly again because I like the name. And once again, I don't get it.It just doesn't rock. Sort of like why I never got into Sonic Youth. The buttholes are more like a noise/joke band, and perhaps I've missed the point all along.

His live shows are not to be missed. They're full of energy, and scatting, and inexplicable noises. I bought all the albums up to this one, and I must say I was disappointed.The earlier albums were fantastic. They contained a good mix of odd grooves and what-the-hell-is-that. This album though I thought was lacking a lot of the energy that made Quintron great. It also had some serious stinkers that I just couldn't stomach. \\"It's Moving Me,\\" for example -- yeah, the whole song sounds like that. I ended up selling this CD for a couple bucks.If you're interested in Quintron I'd recommend you steer clear of this one and pick up one of the earlier gems. \\"Satan Is Dead\\" is good as is \\"The Amazing Spellcaster\\" and \\"IF 001-011\\" (if you can find it anymore)."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Deere Country, Part 1","review":"This was ordered for my John Deere loving husband.

Neither in the cinema nor on VHS has justice been done to this beautiful film, looking for all the world like an animated impressionist painting.This is Mr Allen's most sentimental, romantic and least cynical work. The location, the light, the cinematography, Mendelsshon's music and Jose Ferrer's acting all work together to make a funny, charming, gorgeous film.

There are great laughs in this modern take on a classic comedy premise. The acting is fine, highlighted by Mia Farrow and Mary Steenburgen. As a nice piece of trivia, this marks the first time that Woody directed Mia Farrow. Tony Roberts is excellent in this movie. This is Woody-lite compared to the films that would follow.

The cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged, but I don't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into (combined with the stronger cord, better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed","review":"I am wearing the earbuds as I write this and I am VERY happy with the quality of the sound of both the bass and the trebble, and when I turn on the ANR I can barely hear the washing machine in the other room!

An old Yuban Coffee commercial had a line that went... \\"you get what you pay for\\". In this case it's so true. I only paid about $17 plus 6.80 shipping for my set so I didn't lose too much. Even at that price, I'm terribly disappointed. I got mine on e-bay and they were new in an un-opened package so it's not defective merchandise. The noise cancellation is extremely poor, you have to turn the mp3 player volume up to about max to get a decent sound.

I went to the airplane washroom to look at them -- they were red, hot and swollen -- almost deformed. Clearly I was having an allergic reaction to something in the earbud ... silicone, perhaps?It took an hour after taking them out of my ears for the swelling and itching to stop.I will be doing some research to find out what I was allergic to ... a word to the wise, if you have any chemical sensitivities or the like, be VERY careful about using these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, for the love of less noise","review":"Yes, the inserts bite - into the sides of your ear canal - but the technology is solid.

With the noise-canceling on, I still need to set my Ipod at full volume to hear it on an airplane (I usually prefer sound at a much lower level than other people). I've been using these for about 2 months now (the noice canceling feature does still work on mine at least) and I'm finally fed up with them... next stop: trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"My first foray into the world of noise-cancelling in-ear headphones has been, to say the least, disappointing. I paid $A70 for this pair; a total waste of money. I perhaps should have opted for the more expensive Sony equivalent instead.I find the sound way too low. When I turn the volume up to how I like it, all I get is distortion.My $A27 Sennheiser MX550 h'phones absolutely destroy these.I'm not even going to bother to put them in my ears again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not worth $60","review":"I bought these at Fry's because at $60, they were only $20 more than Apple's in-ear headphones and I figured that the sound-canceling feature was worth the extra price. Unfortunately, the sound canceling seems to only increase the volume, making it completely pointless. Instead, you're stuck with basically regular in-ear headphones with a big weight attached to them. Also, the materials used seemed extremely cheap. After a couple of weeks, the wire coming out of the bottom ripped out and I had to glue it back into place. I wouldn't really recommend these to anybody, since the sound quality wasn't much better than any other in-ear headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very High Priced Marginal Ear Buds","review":"Typically, I don't write such reviews, but I feel so cheated by Philips, I want to try and minimize the number of other people that will be cheated in the future.I purchased these Philips HN060 Earbuds for a recent international trip. The physical design and feel of the product is very smart. The key appeal to me was the compact physical size of the system. However, the noise cancellation feature does not work at all. On or off, there was no noise difference in the rumble of the jet engines. These things will end up in the trash and I'm going to buy a pair of noise-isolating earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"noise blocking\\"","review":"I bought these for the commute (train). I am very unimpressed. Any noise reduction seems to come from the presence of tight-fitting plugs in your ears, rather than any electronic \\"magic\\". I can detect no difference in the background noise whether the noise-canceling circuit is turned on or off. The sound quality is poor either way. So this will be a returned product. The fact that replacement earplugs are unavailable seals the deal. The earplugs, while comfortable for me, are very thin and very soft. And very unlikely to stand up to daily use for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"These kill my ears","review":"These are the worst headphones that I have ever owned. The sound quality is fine, and the noise cancelling feature does the trick; for $30 I don't expect them to perform as well as a pair of Sure EC3's. My gripe with this product is that the ear buds are very uncomfortable to wear. They slip out of the ear constantly, and the plastic cones cause a lot of irritation. I have gone back to wearing an old pair of ordinary ear buds and only use these as a backup pair. My advice is to avoid purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"I have searched everywhere for a pair of earphones that would fit properly in my ears. I have a very small ear canal and hurts to use the hard plastic ear buds (even the ones with the thin, foam bud protector). I work out in the mornings and it's discouraging to have to either fight through the pain in my ear or constantly keep adjusting the buds so they would fit properly.This product comes with three different bud sizes (sm, med, lg) the medium works well but starts to slide out after a period of time. The small fits like a glove! I did even use the noise cancelling feature for a period of time because the buds seal my canal from outside noise. However ever once I did, I was AMAZED! I hear Bose and a few other pricier options are better however this was really a great buy, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well for me, but some faults","review":"These noise canceling ear buds work pretty well under my helmet while riding, which is why I purchased them.

I think the frequency response range with these earbuds are pretty minimal. To me, the music is all mids. It's missing significant highs and lows for this price range.I gave these away to a friend who's not that picky at all, but she could tell a difference in sound quality right away. She normally uses the IPod earbuds which are uncomfortable to her. However, the noise canceling out weighs the sound quality so she prefers to use these earbuds over her Ipod buds riding a crowded train or bus.Hopefully I can find something affordable that has good frequency response. Or maybe I need to educate myself. Is it the frequency response, the impedence, or something else that covers the sound spectrum? I'm just looking for a good balance of lows, mids, and highs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise altering, not noise cancelling","review":"I tried using the headphones in the presence of machines that make a continuous backgroung humming noise. The noise level and character was similar to what you experience in an airplane. The headphones diminished the noise somewhat, but very little. It also creates its own (annoying to me) white noise and the sound quality was significantly poorer than that of a $10 pair of sony earbud headphones. In my opinion these Philips \\"noise cancelling\\" headphones are little more than a gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber earbuds don't last","review":"These earphones work ok at best, but sound quality is not my main issue with these earphones. The rubber ear bud can easily rip off the base if you are not very careful when inserting the headphones into your ears. If you have problems with these earphones fitting your ears, you're probably going to be looking for replacement parts for the earphones, and they are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain without having to send your entire unit in for service. The lack of replacement earbuds makes this product useless to me, as I've chosen to throw the earphones away, rather than to have to send them in for service. I tried contacting Philips, who then forwarded me to SBC service, who said replacement parts were unavailable (even for purchase) unless you returned the product for service. Neither company was of any help whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phillips terrible","review":"These pop out of my ears constantly, I spend more time readjusting them that actually listening withn them.

I have other noice-cancelling headphones (not ear buds) that work much better, and before I purchased these I thought they'd work somewhat similar in cancelling most of the noise than my other head phones. they don't work nearly as well. I guess what I'm saying is Don't expect great things from these cause you'll be disappointed.

The cloth cable is very nice and doesn't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones. I liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning. The headphones I purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and I found only one to be suitable for my ears. Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can't use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now. In the meantime, I've returned to some $10 non-earbud headphones and I really miss the noise-cancelling quality of these Philips earbuds. Life sucks and I want to die because now I can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they really meant by \`noise-canceling'...","review":"I cannot believe how terrible these earphones are! I've had these earphones for two months. The only thing these earphones cancel is my ability to listen to music for longer than 5 seconds. And, from what I can tell from the 5 seconds they stay in my ear, the quality of the sound is terrible. I can also hear exterior noises (such as the AC vent above my cube...) Of course I can turn the volume up, but you can do that with any regular earphones without having to wear a battery pack around your neck, and these Philips earphones distort in the nastiest way at high volumes.I also waste a lot of time pushing the earbuds back into my ear, it's basically a second job since they absolutely refuse to stay in. As soon as they wiggle out ever so slightly the quality of sound deteriorates immediately, not that it has too much to deteriorate from to begin with. Please learn from my mistake, don't buy these earphones!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I have found it impossible to use these headphones because they will not stay in for any period of time. In concept they are great, they sound good and do a respectable job of blocking noise, but since they won't stay in my ears, this is of little consequence. Furthermore, the rubber bits that fit in the ear come off very easily, another poor design trait. In fact, I'm on the phone with Philips right now to get replacments and their CS has been unhelpful. They just told me to buy replacements at Radio Shack &/or CompUSA, which is annoying b/c they are lost because of the poor design. Avoid these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!!!!","review":"Just bought these and they are rubbish. Put simply, for music they are terrible. Absolutely no bottom end. At the maximum volume with my MP3 on full as well they are very quiet and cancel little noise. Infact ordinary earphones cancel more noise. For speech they are ok i guess. These really are worth avoiding though. A huge rip off. They barely stay in your ears. What a waste of my cash!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast your money!! Horrible poduct!","review":"I recently received these headphones and found, much to my disappointment, they are aweful! I had another pair of Phillips that I loved, but wanted noise cancelling ones so I orderd these. The noise cancelling is simply a hissing noise to mask other noises and even that isn't very effective. The volume on these is very poor. Leaving my iPOD at the same volume level I compared these to my other non-noise cancelling phillips and my other phillips were easily 90% louder at the same iPOD volume level, and that was with these headphones on maximum volume. They also aren't very comfortable. Don't waste your time or money ordering these, they simply aren't worth it.Amazon and the sub I ordered these through was excellent in shipping the product, all be it a very poor product, to me in a very expediant manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing, barely","review":"If you're looking for significant noise canceling activity, these are not the earbuds you want. There is a barely detectable decrease in outside noise when you switch them on. They mainly work by introducing a lot of background hiss and boosting the volume of the music. 10 dB ?

Just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your nickels...","review":"after having used them for a few days with my ipods, i have to say that they are just not worth the time and money.noise canceling is an overly ambitious statement, maybe some slight noise reduction, and most of that i suspect is from the silicon plugs used on the earbuds.the fidelity is simply not acceptable these days. i keep drifting back to my koss titanium set. light weight, good fidelity.if you really need serious noise canceling for regular train and plane travel, these are not the set for you. save your nickels a while longer and get something from the big boys...."},{"rating":"1","title":"ineffective noise cancelling","review":"Forget the hype - the main reason they work is by plugging your ears, NOT by canceling. Funny, but all my NON-canceling plug-style buds work better, and sound better, too.If you check how canceling phones are SUPPOSED to work, you'll find that they focus on a narrow set of low frequencies. There's a good chance that YOUR type of bothersome noise won't be covered. But this model won't give you much canceling, even in their target range.What to do if you can't afford the kind that really work? Simple, actually. Forget high-tech, and get good-sounding earphones that also BLOCK the noise from coming in. That time-tested method is guaranteed to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Up...Get Something Better.","review":"I needed some last minute noise-canceling headphones for a flight. Well, I picked these up for $20, because they were the only noise-canceling item that the store had left...Cons:-Awkward fit: These are basically ear plugs. You have to jam them pretty far into your ears to block some noise. Even then, some facial movements will push them out of your ears anyway.-Ineffective: The noise-canceling function is basically a joke. In fact, it seems like all it does is turn up the volume slightly and mask some of the exterior sounds by making its own background static noise.Pros:-Compact: These are small and easy to fit in your bag.-Decent Sound: When used regularly, without the noise-canceling function, these produce decent sound quality (for earbuds).Just avoid this product and spend a little extra for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise Cancelling - Not so much . . .","review":"Thses are okay earbuds - they fit better than some and the sound quality is okay - not great, but acceptable.

While I like the string-like wires (it doesn't kink and tangle like regular headphone wires), the clunky control unit is not good if you're moving around (I'd rather have one that clips and stays put...this one swings around like a pendulum). But the worst problem of all is the gels easily come off the earbuds. You cannot replace them with the proper gels.

I use them in conjunction with over-the-ear noise covers that I bought at a sporting goods store, (mine are made by Remington, designed for use at shooting ranges). Regular (not noise reducing) earbuds sound pretty good in an airplane when noise is reduced by such covers. You might want to try them at a sporting goods store.

When I turned the noise cancelling on, the volume level increased to what I expected but the noise cancelling didn't seem to work at all. I tried it near the refrigerator, in a car, and by the computer with its fan but it didn't seem to reduce any noise. Then I took it into a quieter room where the only sound was rumbling from distant traffic. In there, I noticed the headphones produced a sound similar to a stereo system when it's turned on loud with no music playing. So turning on the noise cancelling seemed to actually add noise. Back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I just got this pair of headphone this morning and I can't wait to put on and try its noise cancelling function. However, things turn out out of my expectance though the treble is good. The bass is absolutely nothing, my ipods original earphone could work better than this. So if you are consider of getting a earphone which produce much bass, this isn't your choice. I can swear you will regret it.

To give you an idea of how much fun the game is, I often threaten my kids with playing INKLINGS if they don't get their chores done (and we live on a farm!). One good thing.

I hear Heinz has finally gone back to using sugar in the recipe this year (see the ingredients listing for the US version on the L&P; website), but unless and until this product information is updated, I'll assume what's being sold here is old inventory containing HFCS.

The Lea & Perrins that is sold in the US now uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar (which is what is still in the UK version.) This may not matter to some but it definitely detracts from the authentic clean spicy taste by making it more sickly sweet which the original is not.

It used to be a dark color, now it's a light tan color. WHAT IS THIS? It no longer has the tangy bold flavor, and instead tastes like a watered down version of its former self.

My mother had just come home from an extended stay at a nursing home. Somehow, she had developed cradle cap on her scalp. We were at a loss and couldn't figure out quite what to do about it. After doing research on the internet, I decided to use Mustela as her shampoo. After just a few washings, we could tell that there was such a difference in her scalp. It is practically gone now and we are so thankful for this product. It has helped her self esteem and I am most grateful for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"my son had the worst cradle cap - it severly affected his entire face and cheeks. They were red and raised and oily and scaly. I used this foam 2 x a day and I swear it was a miracle. It cleared his skin by 80% in 24 hours. He is only 8 weeks and I was afraid of the steroids and over cleansing him but really this did the trick. I just starting using stelaker too but I don't know if has helped yet. This product is truly perfect for your little sad cradle cappers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragrance Way Too Strong","review":"I thought for my newborn son the smell (lavender) was really strong, as I have found with all the Mustela products I registered for and received. I won't use it any more on him because the smell of his skin (which I really love) is totally over powered by their added fragrance. I'll use it for myself though. If I had paid for these products myself I would feel ripped off, just because they are some of the most expensive doesn't make them the best choice. I recommend using something more mild, I switched to Johnson's Head to Toe Baby Wash (and no, I'm not getting any money to state this, sadly). If you are really interested in Mustela then get a sample first and try it out. Also, for cradle cap, which my son has gotten twice now, I just rub some olive oil into his scalp, wash off the oil, and scrape off the, uh, shall we say grossness with a really soft tooth brush. I do this outside because it can get messy, and yes, gross but do-able."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells great, but didn't help with her cradle cap","review":"This shampoo smells great, but did very little for my daughter's cradle cap. I found the old fashioned baby oil and a good shampoo afterward really made the greatest difference along with gentle messaging her scalp with a brush several times though out the day. My friends also told me dandruff shampoo works well too, but be careful not to get the suds in baby's eyes. Regardless, I say save your $$$ and try another solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product; Very Gentle, Sulfate-Free, & Smells Nice","review":"This is a great product. We tried other shampoos, but this one was the only one that kept our baby's cradle cap at bay (we used this shampoo plus a special brush every other day to gently exfoliate her scalp). She also never cries if the soapy water goes in her eyes, nor does it contain harmful sulfates, which I appreciate. Even though she is older now, we still use it as it's really a great product and I don't think it should only be used by newborns. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustela Foram Shampoo","review":"This product can be used also by adults.

Buying this book I thought to obtain some serious information on the subject. I didn't expect to buy some superficial nonsence of a local U.S. sect.

Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self promotion and sensationalism at all costs","review":"G Haugen's marketing machine is more efficient at raising money from naive taxpayers than at solving real issues. Religious fanaticism and sealous bigotry at their worst getting ready to americanize Cambodia.KM11 was excessive and prostitution is present in Cambodia, but certainly no more than in most US or European cities and all Asian countries, and Heugen is very quick to associate pedophilia to it to raise red flags and more money from all sides. His real purpose is eradicating prostitution, not saving lifes. The purpose of his action is self promotion, helped by an ever ready CBS that jumps on the bandwagon of sexual exploitation. I'm a moderate christian, not a fanatical zealot, so I would not buy this misleading book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read.","review":"I just finished reading this book. Do yourself and the world a favor and read it. Gary Haugen is a Christian, and that does come across in the book.

I liked their hits but if you listen to their debut, you get the feeling that the group only had a few classics in them. Then came Triangle. Don't be fooled by all of the hype or 4 star average rating of this album. This is a mediocre album at best and not the classic that many reviewers believe it is. And I agree with a previous reviewer who felt that the vibrato became annoying. I'm a big music lover and I look for classic albums. I have most in my collection and many, like Rubber Soul or Blind Faith are albums that I would definitely miss if I could not hear them again. Don't get me wrong, this album is not bad but there isn't one song that blows me away and if I never heard this album again, it would not matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. Several places \\"Triangle\\" has been referred to as a classic album and as the best album by the band. It does feature several fine strings-arrangements by Van Dyke Park, but the overall lack of real good songs, makes the album a pretty dull experience.Actually the first song that really stirred my attention was Randy Newman's \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" and by the end of that song, the album was over. A few more songs like \\"Magic Hollow\\" and and the title track lift themselves above average, but not enough to make the album really interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naaah!","review":"Much over rated,apart from the lovely 'magic hollow' - and very short.

I liked especially the concise critique of the self-esteem movement and the descriptions of the faculty's struggle over the desirability or feasibility of setting high academic standards. The book focuses largely on the divide between the administration and faculty, who want to keep order and run things their way, and the lives and desires of their students, who bear the onus of dealing daily with the strictures and pressures they feel from teachers, administrators, parents, and peers. Interesting reading, and a different vantage point from most of the adults-revisit-high-school literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real look at a real school","review":"As a suburban educator I can tell you this is 100% accurate.

I enjoy the sparse writing style of this author and feel that his ability to bring life to the characters and their settings in such few words is very effective. I enjoyed this tale of a local boy gone bad until the last few pages. It had an adrupt and disappointing ending lacking originality and creativity. I am glad this book was short so I don't feel my time was completely wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where You Once Belonged","review":"While I enjoyed Plainsong, this book, despite its short length, was extremely disappointing. No character development whatsoever. When the book switches from the third person to the first person, you have no clue for pages as to who the narrator is. I am utterly mystified at how well-respected book critics could find such glowing comments to make about this extremely disappointing read. It's one of those books that you are disgusted with yourself for having invested any time in reading when you get to the final page. Don't assume if you enjoyed Plainsong, that you'll similarly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep This Book OnThe Shelf","review":"I'm the kind of person that once I start a book I have to finish. After page 50 I knew I was in some serious trouble. I even got to the point where I just skimmed through the pages looking for something that might be interesting.Just in case you are under the perception that this is a romance novel, it's not. Not even close and that is the biggest issue I have with this book. When I read the back cover I was excited to read it. It was horribly misrepresented! When just about every character in the book gets burned at the stake or beheaded, it should tell you something. It was horribly grotesque. When the hero, if you can even call him that, gets an arrow in his eye, I was thinking to myself, \\"are you kidding me?\\" The character that this book is based around destroys every aspect of religion and is in essence someone that you just can't like.As a historical novel in itself, it was accurate. That is the highest compliment that I can give this book, it really was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, blasphemous and boring","review":"A reader scanning the back cover of this novel would be led toexpect a historical romance. It is not a romance, nor is it purely ahistorical novel. It reads like someone's rejected master's thesis dressed up to look like romance. The author manages to offend nearly every religion, slandering catholics and protestants and muslims alike. Usually I resell my books when I've finished with them, but this one went straight into the trash can. If Ms. Kyle wants to write some New Age exploration of spirituality, she should make her subject clear from the beginning. This is a truly awful assault on all religions.

What I found was a great story excellently written.To be honest, I could not imagine Grandmother as a sympathetic character. I do not want to give away much of the surprise for anyone who hasn't read this, but we see another side of the cranky old lady and we come to understand her better.After seeing her in a different light, I'm curious as to how Perry portrays her in the upcoming Pitt novels. I hope she will allow Grandmother's character to grow- it would be a waste of great character if she doesn't.A Christmas Guest is one of Perry's best efforts. There's a seemingly unsolvable mystery, a full cast of suspects, humor, a moral, and a great feeling of satisfaction after you've turned the last page.A lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift from Ms. Perry to her readers.","review":"Ms. Perry is a superb writer.

It is the story of a crochety old grandmother in Victorian times who is sent to stay with family for Christmas in the windswept Romney Marshes of England. There she meets a life-changing guest, solves a mystery, and comes to a new understanding of people and acceptance of herself. The mystery is more of an intrigue as there is not much suspense or puzzle-solving--it all seems to be resolved in a pat and sometimes not fully explained manner--but Ms. Perry is obviously a gifted story-teller and has you turning the pages. I would definitely pick up another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real mystery book","review":"This is the first time I've read this author.

I found Grandmama to be somewhat of a prude, but endearing still the same.

With excellent examples and the data to back them up, this book and his early Harvard Business Review articles established Reichheld as the foremost authority on all things loyalty.

The author reviews the economics and principles of loyalty based management as it applies not only to customers, but investors and employees as well. The key is not just to retain these key stakeholders, but to select them properly in the first place - and then retain them. There is a tremendously high cost for churn in the investor, employee and customer ranks as measured by several key metrics, such as lifetime present value. Reichheld also discusses the importance of choosing the right metrics and measuring the proper elements - reminding the reader that what gets measured gets managed - and vice versa.

The only slight downside on this particular pool is that it does not come with a drain. We simply let the air out, guide the water onto our lawn and inflate it again to have it dry nicely.

It portrays their withering hopes and sad compromises without any of the sentimentality one finds in American films on this subject. The usual conflicts--son against father, boy against girl, all of them in some way against society--are given an original and believable twist.If it has flaws, they would be the film's humor, which is sometimes juvenile, and a certain heavy-handedness in its criticism of organized religion and the Bourgeosie. Also, it should be noted that Rutger Hauer has only a small role in the movie, and is in fact outshone by the other, younger performers.This isn't a freewheeling caper like most teen flicks, nor a sugary or vulgar sex farce.

Also, the ties to be used on the four corner posts were too short to go all the way around the posts and tie securely. And there are no ties along the bottom of the bumper, allowing a more active baby to roll underneath the pad.

It's not easy reading, because it deals with very complex subjects, but since it's a workbook, you can always keep checking the level of your understanding.But! If you have read about and applied either Compass School or Black Sect FS before, beware! Ms. Wong uses Authentic FS and you'll realize it has very little to do with what you've believed about this ancient art of placement earlier, so it might just either confuse or kind of disappoint you. I'd say that if one of those schools have worked for you, just stick with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and Enlightening","review":"Unlike many other fengshui books, A master course in fengshui is more of a workbook instead of a quick-reference solution. Beginners will find this book useful and I would think the learning curve is manageable. Eva Wong has also highlighted some of the techniques she personally uses and coupled with the many pictures and diagrams, this is a great book that anyone interested in fengshui should get.As for the 4/5 star rating, well Eva Wong's perception of the flying star interpretation is very different from other masters. Unlike most masters who analyse the sitting and facing stars, Eva looks at the base star and facing star. Some of her interpretations seemed unsafe to me like the 3/8. Nevertheless what you will learn off this book far outweighs the controversial aspects.A good book to ground yourself proper in fengshui"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, someone has decided pull the veil off of feng shui and make its \\"secrets\\" available to all of us.

Unfortunately on her third go around she is dangerously close to self-parody with an unfocused piece of work that does little to alter her growing image as a self righteous, humorless, man hater (the later of which is reinforced by the album's title and cover photo) who sadly just may be running out of musical ideas. While songs like \\"Blood Roses\\" \\"Talua\\" and \\"Caught A Lite Sneeze\\" hint at the promise of her first two albums, far too many others undercut the momentum Amos gained with her debut and its follow up. If you still think you might be interested in this CD, save the dough and hit the used CD bins first. I run into this one all the time there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Tori album","review":"PELE is my favorite Tori album, perhaps because of the varity of sounds it presents.

This concert really showcases songs from PELE, along with songs from previous albums.\\"You don't need my voice girl you have your own\\" - Bells For Her, Tori AmosMy voice:"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and pretentious","review":"After a pair of albums with undeniably compelling moments, Tori Amos seems to be coasting at best, and pandering at worst, with Boys For Pele.Pretentious and overwrought, Boys For Pele indulges in the worst aspects of her first two albums, while virtually ignoring \\"Little Earthquakes\\" and \\"Under The Pink's\\" best moments.Here's hoping that \\"Boys For Pele\\" is not a trend in Amos's still growing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVER HEARD OF KATE BUSH?","review":"Wow, person from Ellensburg WA, one of the most original artist EVER? I would strongly urge you to listen to almost ANYTHING by Kate Bush and you will find that she was doing this twenty years ago. Note for note, phrase for phrase. Every note Amos sings is an attempt to sound like Kate Bush. I strongly urge you to check it out and you'll see what I'm saying. This is not something I say loosely. It would be obvious to almost anyone I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I absolutely love Tori's other CDs but I've found this one impossible to get into. The tunes aren't catchy like Choirgirl Hotel, and the words make NO sense. I'd say save your money for Choirgirl Hotel or Little Earthquakes, they're much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented artist seriously stumbles on her thrid go around","review":"The first pair of Amos' albums proved her to be a vital and talented artist - a writer of gorgeous melodies, startling lyrics, and imaginative musical arrangements. Unfortunately on her third go around she is dangerously close to self-parody with an unfocused piece of work that does little to alter her growing image of a self righteous, humorless, man hater (the later of which is reinforced by the album's title and cover photo) who sadly just may be running out of musical ideas. While songs like \\"Blood Roses\\" \\"Talua\\" and \\"Caught A Lite Sneeze\\" hint at the promise of her first two albums, far too many others undercut the momentum Amos gained with her debut and its follow up.If you still think you might be interested in this CD, save the dough and hit the used CD bins first. I run into this one all the time there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh! What Happened?!?","review":"This album is TERRIBLE compared to other albums of hers. Definitely the worst. If you look at this - put it down. Have somebody make a tape of it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I know the maximum words I can have for this space is 1,000 words but I could go further on bashing this album. What is sad about it and what makes me even more disappointed is that I am a very big fan of Tori. \\"Under The Pink\\" was strange, \\"Little Earthquakes\\" was the best, and \\"Boys For Pele\\" is terrible! The songs go nowhere except to Whineville. The one star was for the so-so song \\"Caught In A Light Sneeze\\" and the passable \\"Hey Jupiter.\\" The rest is junk. I could use this CD as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complex and Eccentric Work that is Boys for Pele","review":"Boys for Pele was the first album of Tori's I ever listened to. I was all at once amazed and confused. But as I listened to it more and more, I fell in love and now I own all of Tori's albums. Pele is my favorite. Tori has an amazing ability to convince you. An unworldly voice, and honest lyrics. That is how I would sum up Boy's for Pele . . . honest. Pent up sexual frustration, pain, beauty, and complexity. Pele is a genuine work of raw and rare art. Very few artists have the kind of depth Tori does. She showcases her unique artistic perseption to the fullest extent on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys for Pele","review":"Boys for Pele being Amos 3rd studio album and her 1996 release peaked at #2 in the Billboard Top 200 and also did quite well in Europe peaking at #2 in the UK Album chart. 5 singles were release from the album, these being \\"Caught a Little Sneeze\\", \\"Talua\\", \\"Professional Widow\\", \\"Hey Jupiter\\" and \\"In the Springtime of His Voodoo\\". The booklet has many odd photographs with Amos in different poses. All the lyrics are included and for each track we get a list of whom plays on it and what they play. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong seven, weak eight, hard to say.","review":"This is actually a fairly good album. In it, Tori Amos makes good use of a harpsichord in a few songs, a rare instrument in the best of times. The album seems a little more focused than \\"Under the Pink\\", but never achieves the intensity of \\"Little Earthquakes\\". In all, though, the songs are very listenable and this is a good album to spin while sitting with a warm cup of tea during long, dark, rainy days. I like it, recommend it. Polished production, good sound. More mature than \\"Little Earthquakes\\", and a little less raw."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST! Proof that a REAL artist can be successful too!","review":"From beautiful, whimsical, and surreal lyrics to brilliant instrumentation, this album offers everything that anybody interested in REAL music could want. Instead of polluting the airwaves with low-talent garbage, this album offers listeners a journey into beauty and pain as seen through a brilliant, strong yet vulnerable, artist. My personal favourite tracks are \\"Hey Jupiter\\" and \\"Mr. Zebra\\", the former for its confessional, painful lyrics and the latter for its whimsical, surreal tone. If you are looking for great music that is a little out of the ordinary, you MUST get this album. Otherwise, listen to some Spice Grrls, 98, Five, or other similar rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"grows on you","review":"I like Choirgirl Hotel so much that I've recently been dragging out my other Tori CD's and giving them another listen. This one was a hard sell but I'm starting to like how different and strange it is. I still don't listen to the whole thing straight through... I admit I'm not into it that much. But I just discovered \\"Little Amsterdam\\" and now I can't get it out of my head. \\"Hey Jupiter\\" is addictive too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not indispensable, but you SHOULD have it","review":"I don't hate it, but neither do I really LOVE it. I think that if you're going to have the rest of Tori's albums you need this one as well;however I don't think it should be the first OR the only one you buy. It took me a while to get used to. As much as I enjoy Tori, and I admire her ability to continually break new ground in her music, I feel maybe she went a little too extreme in the diversion this time. It does have some real gems, like Mr Zebra, Hey Jupiter, and the radio successes of Talula and Caught a Lite Sneeze, I will admit that. Unfortunately, I feel some of the songs were just too far out there. While I know that Tori is never one to give you the straight dope on what she's talking about in her music, there is so much heavily veiled innuendo in the songs it's more difficult than usual to figure out what she means. Buy the album for its musicality and power, but I wouldn't try to interpret the lyrics too closely on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Our little Tori has obviously come a long way from her \\"Winter\\" days... Meaningful (if somewhat hard to decipher) lyrics combine with the Bosendorfer to create soundscapes of intensity. Songs like \\"Marianne\\" and \\"Horses\\" show us her piano-and-vocals beginnings, while \\"Blood Roses\\" and \\"Professional Widow\\" show us where she might be headed. A wonderful album with the makings of a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took some time","review":"I have been listening to Tori for about four years now, and I just recetnly got into this one. At first I had no idea what Tori was singing about, and so I put it on the shelf for a while. I got it back down just about three monthes ago and looked through the lyrics, and listened to the way she sang the songs and it all dawned on me! I found out what the songs ment! Or at least what I thought they ment, and the lyrics are simply amazing if you just give them a chance! I am now hooked to the album and can't bear to part with it long enoughf to let my friends borrow it. Tori sounds just as wonderful as she always does, and now this album means more to me than even Little Earthquakes does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her voice is lyrical, but...","review":"Amos has a beautiful voice and I like her music. However, almost without exception these lyrics are completely senseless to me. Perhaps I'm just too shallow, but it's all gibberish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Tori...","review":"Tori Amos really screwed up on this album. I couldn't find one song on the entire album that I REALLY liked. Every song had something that I didn't like in it - except maybe Hey Jupiter. Really pathetic. Tori, why did you make this awful album. You should base your albums like you did on Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink. This album is too crappy to come from such a talented artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !","review":"Tori's third album, and the most criticized one. \\"Boys For Pele\\" is extremely hard to get used to, and I have to confess that each time Tori releases an album, i never like it at first.Now, don't get me wrong, this album is magical, very quiet indeed, but songs like \\"Horses\\", \\"Not The Red Baron\\", \\"Hey Jupiter\\", \\"Putting The Damage On\\" are simply wonderful and heartbreaking. Tori takes us to a long, somewhat painful but pleasant-to-the-ears journey for 70 minutes. \\"Professional Widow\\", a violent song, and definetely better that the Armand Van Helden remixes, shows Tori at her best.. There are too many songs to talk about here, i know this review won't be helpful to you, but let me tell you that \\"BFP\\" is maybe Tori's best work, listen to it several times, it will grow on you. Absolutely magical !"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I really liked her first two albums so I bought this one.Should have saved my money.The lyrics make no sense whatsoever.Just a bunch of meaningless words thrown together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori's Deranged Twin Releases an Album...","review":"Don't get me wrong - I love Tori Amos - but this album sounds so unfinished and undeveloped that I just cannot listen to it very often. I also agree that \\"Under the Pink\\" is the best. This album is less angry and just not worthy of Tori's artistry. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"Although I believe that Tori Amos is a very talented person, as shown by other albums from Little Earthquakes to From The Choirgirl Hotel, I think she has failed in this album. I sounds like she maybe tried a little to hard to keep up with what she had going and instead came up with a bunch a noise that is slightly unpleasent to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"At best - this is mediocre.","review":"Very displeased. Tori stumbled off of a cliff and landed in a bed of thorns - or at least - that what she sounds like. The songs are okay - but her voice sounds so STRANGE. I don't know what happened... but I DON'T like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Letdown...","review":"I don't think that I've ever been so disappointed by a CD before. \\"Under the Pink\\" is the best album. This album just doesn't please me. Every song has something that doesn't belong - which makes it so that you can't listen to it very often...Grade: C"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could Tori be responsible for this?!?","review":"This album is okay, but for Tori, it is utter crap. Don't read the other reviews becuase they're not tellin the truth. It is an OKAY album, but if you're used to the quality of her other albums, YOU WILL BE SHOCKED. Have someone make you a tape - this CD JUST IS NOT THAT GOOD!!!! Listen to it if you will, but there are too many unnecessary moans and squeals that it makes this album nearly SUCK. I LOVE TORI AND HAVE ALL OF HER ALBUMS, BUT THIS ONE WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. People say that this album carries them away to \\"dreamland\\" - well, it only took me to the garbage dump. C-."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Tori, But Hate This CD","review":"Let me start by saying that I think Tori's first album \\"Little Earthquakes\\" is a masterpiece. There is not one bad song on it. Her second \\"Under the Pink\\" is good and definitely worth having, but can't equal the majesty of the first. \\"Boys for Pele\\", however, is awful. I cannot believe there are so many positive reviews for this CD. You people obviously haven't listened to \\"Little Earthquakes.\\" You are missing out. \\"Boys for Pele\\" can't hold a candle to it. I'm giving \\"Boys for Pele\\" 1 star because there is one (and only one) good song on it and that is \\"Putting the Damage On\\". That song is excellent. Otherwise, you can have this CD.Please do not make this your first Tori Amos purchase. Buy \\"Little Earthquakes\\" then \\"Under the Pink\\" and then, if you must, \\"Boys for Pele\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Years On - Still A Fantastic Album","review":"Tori Amos is a magnificent musician.She is also one weird chick.Little Earthquakes is her first solo album, and its lyrics and melodies easily make it the most approachable of her albums.Boys for Pele, though, has an ingenuity and diversity that most \\"pop\\" albums fear. Ms. Amos has enough musical chops to carry it off, too. She varies her instrumentation, uses sounds of nature mixed in with extremely bizarre lyrics to create this wonderful tapestry of art.There aren't a lot of tunes to dance to (as in her middle-years albums), and no apparent rallying causes (as in her first two albums). But Boys for Pele has such a richness in melody, harmony, and lyrical sound that it remains, ten years later, one of my favorite albums.(*)>"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing alternate version of a great album.","review":"A very unnecessary release put out by Atlantic to showcase the success of Armand Van Helden's remix of \\"Professional Widow.\\" The remix is placed after the original version of the song and largely breaks up the albums feel, and quite frankly, some of its integrity. And since \\"Pele\\" is a longer album, the remix displaces \\"In the Springtime of His Voodoo,\\" further disturbing the album. The original release of \\"Boys for Pele\\" is a complex and often beautiful, though sometimes harsh, piece of work that asks the listener to look deeper. Bottom line: unless you're a serious collector, stick with the original release of the album - less money, less hassle, and a lot more of the piano songstress's intricately woven world."},{"rating":"2","title":"As rewarding as it is challenging...","review":"Boys For Pele is a dense, moody and often indecipherable work. Hard to listen to from start to finish without a cigarette, Pele is full of wordy psychoses, a clear inspiration for Alanis Morissette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.Fortunately the clatter of Professional Widow and In The Springtime of His Voodoo (both undeniably great songs) is tempered with ballads Hey Jupiter and Putting The Damage On, and the unassuming pop of Talula and Caught A Lite Sneeze.It gets a bit heavy-handed at times but it's a rewarding work and Marianne is simply one of the most beautiful and personal songs of her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"She keeps getting Better by the Album!!!!!!BUY IT NOW","review":"I loved Little Earthquakes, I liked Under the Pink but man this one's gotta take the prize. Some may say that it's not as intense as some of her earlier stuff but she sure made my skin tingle. I think with Boys for Pele Tori reached a musical and lyrical maturity lacking in her earlier work. Not to knock them or anything, they were great. But I definitely hope her future stuff will be more in this vein.

The only other album that comes close is \\"To Venus and Back.\\" I adore \\"Under the Pink\\" and \\"Little Earthquakes,\\" but \\"Boys For Pele\\" is by far the Tori Amos' best work. Immaculate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for the most part :-)","review":"This was the third Tori CD I bought in my spree of Tori, this is when i herd a song on the radio and feel in love with her music.

I really enjoy this release as it contains the most amount of Tori songs I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Brilliant Album ever recorded","review":"YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ALBUM!!! tori's performance on this album that is at once intimate, raw, focused, experimental, heart-wrenching, and a sheer acoustic delight. Never has anyone in pop music attempted something so bazarr, and been so succesful. Tori outdoes herself both pianistically and vocally. Not just another pop album, this is truely Tori's Masterpiece. Top Tracks include Talula, Blood Roses, Father Lucifer, Hey Jupiter, Marianne."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This has to be Tori's best work! I must admit I hated it at first but after I listened to Talula for the SECOND time, I couldn't stop. This cd has awesome beats,seriously messed up lyrics(it scares my friends) and great meanings. Way to go, Tori!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this is a weird album","review":"Even if Boys for Pele is a weird album it is still worth a listen. I would definitely reccomend that new listeners get Little Earthquakes etc. before this one. This album is probably most \\"accessible\\" to die hard Tori fans but it does have it's very strong moments. You can still hear bits of Little Earthquakes here and there are times on even the Beekeeper that you know that it's the same Tori- just matured. Standout tracks are: \\"Mr. Zebra,\\" \\"Marianne,\\" (strongest song on the album) \\"Caught A Lite Sneeze,\\" \\"Hey Jupiter,\\" \\"Little Amsterdam,\\" and \\"Putting The Damage On.\\" Boys for Pele may require listen upon listen but it is definitely another labor of love. It is a great thing that Tori Amos has and continues to put herself and her music out there in full force."},{"rating":"2","title":"A third trip?","review":"Boys For Pele was a very shocking album. Not only was it very abstract, but it was a mix of all things odd and confusing.However, it was an enjoyable album and it made me laugh (Mr. Zebra), just as it made me cry (Marianne, Hey Jupiter). Horses may still remind you of Little Earthquakes, the debut album that will never cease to be compared to, but if you are a true Tori listener, you will marvel at how funnily touching Boys For Pele is.Get it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"At first I was swept away...","review":"Then I heard some things.. alot of things I can't listen to Tori Amos now because of. Her \\"Father (you know who)\\" track is evil. Her various references to God and Christians throughout this album are evil as well. At first I enjoyed Tori's music for how happy it sounded, despite some of the subject matter, and lets face it, she has a nice voice, and plays well. In the end, though, my opinion of her music is a sugarcube dripping with evil at the center."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Hooked on Phonics' DIDN'T work for Tori","review":"Where the heck did Tori learn how to enunciate? Ms. Amos, let's have a quick language refresher. Today's lesson: vowels.a: the long 'a' (as in \\"save\\") should be pronounced just like the name of the vowel ('A'), not 'EYE'.e: the long 'e' (as in \\"we\\") should be pronounced just like the name of the vowel ('E'), not 'AY'.i: the short 'i' (as in \\"wish\\") should be pronounced like a short 'i', not like \\"EEEEE\\".Now let's try it. Say, \\"We wish for Tori to stop this, okay?\\"Tori's response:\\"WAY WEEESH FOR TORAY TO STOP THEEEEEEEES, O-KAEYE?\\"*shakes head*You get the point, folks. Tori's over-stylized \\"slacker accent\\" may appeal to the emo crowd, but for the rest of us it gets downright annoying. If I want to hear bizarre accents I'll listen to Bjork. I don't need some North Carolina girl inventing new ways to butcher her native tongue for the sake of gimmickery. That is all. lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Apart from \\"Horses\\" and \\"Caught a Lite Sneeze\\", this album is somewhat disapointing. It doesn't have the strength of Choirgirl or the emotion of Earthquakes. The harpsichord wears out its welcome after only a couple songs and becomes less intriguing and more repetative. This album was certainly a departure for Tori, but I think it's time to come back now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment to a huge Tori fan.","review":"I am a huge fan of Tori Amos - I have been since the days of Little Earthquakes. She is a stunning song writer and singer - probably my favorite out there. But I was terribly disappointed with this album. She seems to swing too far in the direction of self-consciously deliberate \\"alternativeness.\\" While it is an interesting musical exercise, and perhaps we should appreciate it as artistic growth that allowed Tori to reach the heights she does in her most recent album, \\"Songs from the Choirgirl Hotel,\\" the album comes off as almost pretentious. I ended up selling my CD back to a used CD place.

Instead, this disc is filled with--well--filler. There's a reason these tracks were b-sides. They sound like it cost nothing to record them. It's all experimental ambient synth stuff, without vocals. The live tracks are--well--LIVE, and I much prefer the original studio recordings. The instrumental versions of some Ultravox singles are a waste of disc space. The \\"special mix\\" of 'heart of the country' runs over 10 minutes, and is somewhat excessive, and the 'final mix' of One Small Day is ok, but lacks the punch of the one amazing 12\\" version I have never seen on CD, the US 12\\" mix that was the flip side of the US 12\\" mix of Dancing With Tears in My Eyes, which I have also never seen on CD.

As it turns out, it was just a cool vocal effect that was applied to Weiland's voice on only those two tracks. What a rip off. If you heard those two awesome singles, and had Purple in your possession, you wouldn't believe it was the same Stone Temple Pilots.

I own all their albums now, and I really liked their other three. That much said, all STP fanatics should buy this album, but if you're just a casual STP fan like me then stay away from it.Some of the music is good. \\"Pop's Love Suicide\\", \\"Tumble in the Rough\\", \\"Trippin'On A Hole In A Paper Heart\\", \\"Art School Girl\\", and \\"Adhesive\\" are all good songs overall. But this album on the whole is a pretty bad album, I'm sorry to say. I don't know who that is singing, but it sure doesn't sound like Scott Weiland. Not on one song. Some songs sound like they belong a pretty album.I'm not trying to diss STP. I like them. I'm just writing to you as a concerned reviewer who just wasted $18 on a CD. If you really feel compelled to buy this album, download some songs from Napster first and try it out. Fanatics may want it, but it's not for the average grunge fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO IS THAT SINGING?","review":"WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POUNDING INTENSE VOICE OF SCOTT WEILAND ON THIS CD?

BUT THIS CD DOESNT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst STP Album - By far","review":"Wow - No wonder I never rounded out my STP collection with this album.It is by far the worst album of their catalog. Scott Weiland was really struggling on this recording, his vocals are strained and lifeless. The song writing is poor as well. Better off skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard much better from STP","review":"A sharp contrast with the Core CD, this one from STP is definitely the worst out of all three. Although many of the songs are clever and fun, I was really disappointed after listening to this CD because I found none of the good, old, Stone Temple Pilots on it. I think that, in their effort to soften up, they've altered their music way too much, for the worse. A lot of people are whining that they were too grundgy and wanted some classic rock style music from them, but if you want classic rock, listen to Hendrix or Zepplin. Personally, I liked the Stone Temple Pilots a lot better before, and their Core CD holds as one of my most prized ones on my CD rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't get used to it.","review":"I got this CD at the same time as I got No 4. Being a fan of Core and Purple, I was really hoping for more of the same. After reading the reviews, I thought there would be some songs here that would grab me, but alas, there are not. I guess Track 1, Press Play, Track 6, And So I Know, and Track 7, Trippin' On a Hole in a Paper Heart, would keep me from throwing it out, but otherwise, this CD is not going to see a lot of time on my CD player. No 4 (the CD) is much more what I would have expected and I thoroughly love that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO SELLING OUT HERE!","review":"Its funny how people say that when an artist changes their music the sell out to all their fans. Once again, someone has to say, only a real artist is a person or persons who are willing to evolve into greater things.That is where Tiny Music comes to play. I remember working at a music store and everyone told me they hated it. I heard Big Bang Baby and it was the best song STP has ever done. Why? Because it shows how different and versatile this band can be compared to No. 4, Core, and Purple.Weilands high pitched voice accent the Beatle like sound on the album. A Low tech album compared to the others, Tiny Music does have good songs: Art School Girl, Adhesive, and Big Bang Baby are my favorites.Definte buy for the REAL STP fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, Underrated, Underrated!","review":"Amazing to me this cd never got much airplay. To anyone who dismisses this cd: listen to it again, there is something about this cd that you are just not getting. Adhesive Love is STPs finest. If you were hoping for another 'Core', then put THAT cd on, STP is a band that is constantly evolving. I wouldn't want another rehash of 'Core', I already have that cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would no longer be called a rip off band.","review":"Yeah, I hear people saying things like, \\"Were'd his voice go?\\" I like to think of it being progress. I never liked Stp before. Because I thought they were just a rip off band.Like the funny, \\"I really like Stone Temple Pilots, but I liked em' better when they were called Pearl Jam.\\"But after getting Tiny Music I have to say that they are a very tallented band. This isn't my favorite album of theirs though. I've grown fond of No.4(the new one.) Were Purple was My favorite. After knowing they weren't a rip off band.Some songs I like on this Album.......\\"Pop's Love Suicide\\", \\"Big Bang Baby', \\"Tumble In The Rough\\", And of course \\"Trippin' On A Hole In A Paper Heart.\\"I think It'd be worth your while to listen to this album. And if you already had....good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just great Rock N Roll","review":"This is a great album, but with that said keep in mind this is not a \\"rock 'n' roll masterpiece\\" like some other reviewer remarked. Quit trying to make this album some over creative concept album(which it isn't) and take it for what it is, just great rock 'n' roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked by the narrow minded","review":"This is the STP cd that I respect most. It is much more innovative than anything else that they have done. The jazz instrumentals are beautiful, and they create some great ballads with \\"Lady Picture Show\\" and \\"Adhesive\\". This is really some great stuff. It is generally softer, there is less rocking, and more singing. It does supply some hard rock songs, but not too many. Not like that's bad or anything, but just a awarning to those that think anything soft is boring. The only problem is that the tracks seem kind of jumbled together. It doesn't \\"flow\\". However, I will still reccommend this to any music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album!","review":"With \\"Tiny Music...\\" STP has strayed away from their grunge sound and let their creative juices flow, a formula that will leave many fans disappointed. However, the fans who approach \\"Tiny Music\\" with an open mind will find (perhaps after a few listens) that this album is every bit as good as \\"Core\\" or \\"Purple.\\" It may not have the heart-pounding guitar riffs or the RPM's that those albums do, but what it lacks in heaviness, it makes up in ambition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enormous music","review":"\\"Orange crush mama, it's a laugh laugh laugh.\\"A rip at R.E.M., perhaps?Nevermind. This is the best STP album and, like many of the other reviewers have said, one of THE underrated albums of the last decade. I got turned onto these dudes by my son, thirteen at the time Core came out, and this is first-rate rock and roll in an era when rock was dying a slow death after Kurt's freakout. Who knows why the critics crapped on this band so much. (My theory is that the story went around about \\"Pretty Penny\\" being an anti-abortion song, and you know how the tolerant Left deals with heresies like that one.) I guess you just need to shave your head, declare you're bisexual, and denounce the USA to garner the acclaim. Eff them. The Pilots may never wind up as background music in a TV commercial, but they truly rocked...and Tiny Music was as good as it got for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were right,","review":"all those folks who told me to forget this CD, that it wasn't worth listening to. I finally listened to this CD today, after being a big fan of the band and owning \\"core\\", \\"purple\\", and \\"No. 4\\". Now I KNOW I wasn't missing anything in not having heard 'Tiny Music'. This album doesn't rock at all. The band seems to be going through the motions of rocking, but with no feeling backing up their performance. This is to me the musical equivalent of when AMF owned Harley-Davidson. Dark days, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make It Stop!","review":"Oh, its so bad! Please make it stop.I've been an STP fan from the beginning - I bought the first album when it came out because I liked the name of the band. And it turned out to be a great album, as was their second (in my mind, their masterpiece). But this, their third, is a mess. I've never been quite sure what they were trying to accomplish on this album but I find it amazing that this group of musicians all thought releasing this was somehow a good idea.STP was accused of being a Pearl Jam sound-alike when Plush first hit the scene. And since then they've followed Pearl Jam in one important way - they've branched out, tried different things and mixed up their sound. No two albums sound alike. They're constantly progressing. Unfortunately with this one though, they went off the deep end.Please resist the urge to follow the advice of the first track - don't push play."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No","review":"This album is a joke...you can't possibly release two amazing albums-core & purple-and think that this would work!It's empty...the void, a lack of everything:energy, humour, inspiration, good songs.Any S.T.P. but this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One major hit and that's it","review":"This album has them best STP song ever.

It may take a while, but soon enough, the rest of the songs on the album start to grow on you. I now enjoy each and every song on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece that will grow into perfection for anyone","review":"When I first got this album, I didn't think much of it. I didn't hear the STP that I knew singing. Despite this feeling I popped the cd in and listened to it on and off for a few days. After a week or so I started craving this new sound. I enjoyed the entire CD and I couldn't get enough. Even now, long after those days, I can't seem to find anything that can match the genius of this album. Don't worry about whether or not you like this album the first time you hear it, buy it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their weakest CD, but still very good nonetheless","review":"In my opinion, this is STP's weakest CD. A lot of it is really disjointed and jarring, unlike Core and Purple, which flowed and fit together well. It's easy to see why \\"Big Bang Baby,\\" \\"Trippin On A Hole In A Paper Heart\\" and the excellent \\"Lady Picture Show\\" were chosen as singles...they're without question the best songs on the CD. Core and Purple were notable because almost every song on those CD's was instantly listenable and it was hard to find an unlikeable track on either one (in my opnion, of course.). That's not to say Tiny Music doesn't have good songs, as \\"Adhesive\\" and \\"Seven Caged Tigers\\" are also very good songs. Plus, it could be argued that even STP's \\"bad\\" songs are still well-written and enjoyable. Yet, this CD just hasn't hit me like any of STP's others in the 5 years I've owned it, but I'm still happy they made it and tried new things in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creatively Sound","review":"STP's third release again has a different sound than it's predecessors. Taking the cue from the beginnings of psychedelia in Purple, here it's out in full force. Not only is it psychedelic and very creative and experimental, it has 3 hit singles off of it. Not an easy task when experimenting with different sounds. For example, compare Plush (from Core) with Big Bang Baby. Totally different songs, yet both were huge hits. This could've been STP's best selling album if it wasn't for Scott Weiland's troubles.The singles: Big Bang Baby, Lady Picture Show, Trippin' On A Hole In A Paper HeartMy favourite song (not a single): Adhesive"},{"rating":"2","title":"A more than solid follow up to \\"Purple\\"","review":"After STP delivered their best album with \\"Purple\\", they returned two years later with \\"Tiny Music...\\", an album that displays the band going through stylistic changes. The grungey sound that STP got labeled with in the early nineties is almost non-existant, and is replaced with an almost new-agey, melodic, yet still hard rocking sound. And as with any other STP album, \\"Tiny Music...\\" isn't without it's share of hits; including \\"Big Bang Baby\\", \\"Lady Picture Show\\", and the rocking \\"Trippin' On a Hole in a Paper Heart\\". Other great songs include \\"Pop's Love Suicide\\", \\"Tumble in the Rough\\", and \\"Adhesive\\"; most of which display references lyrically to vocalist Scott Weiland's drug problems. All in all, \\"Tiny Music...\\" is one of STP's better albums (although not as great as \\"Purple\\"), and is some of the mid-nineties best alternative rock out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two decent tracks, the rest blow","review":"It's no wonder that STP broke up after this album. I have a lot of respect for the past guitar work of Dean DeLeo, and Scott Weiland can be a compelling vocalist at times. But this album is mostly garbage. The opening track \\"Press Play\\" is a promising, instrumental diddy but the second, third and fourth tracks disappoint. With the exception of \\"Lady Picture Show\\" and \\"Adhesive,\\" so do the rest. I get the sense that STP is struggling to find a musical identity; they're all over the musical map with this album, but unfortunately they remain lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best","review":"This one had to grow on me. I am a huge STP fan. I have all of their CDs, but this one is more than a little bit quirky compared to the rest. Maybe some of the band members had other things ON their minds when they made this one. Eventually I grew to like it just as much as the others. Now, I can't imagine STP without 'adhesive', which happens to be my album favorite. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, but maybe tell them to have a drink first to keep an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great but didn't last 2 months","review":"Worked great but less than 2 weeks after the 30 day warranty the cord blew - really blew and sparked as it totally broke off and made a slight burn mark on the couch.

I didn't care, but looking at it now....It seemed like it was following behind Pac-Man: Adventures in Time, but unlike that game, this game isn't so great. The environments are all the same dull pyramid-like look. The mazes aren't any more intriguing than the bonus mazes you get to find in the Pac-Man World games. To top it all off, the music is just plain repetitive, and the one tune (So I remember) plays throughout the game.It's nice to see that there's a 2-Player mode, but that's one of the few good things it has to offer.

This re-issue also includes the EP Surf Goddess (Amazon doesn't say that). It's a great addition to an already great cd. So all together it's 17 tracks running for about 45 minutes so it's a nice length. Some of the other Queers records are so short but this one is just right.

Of particular note are her \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" selections, which makes me wish there was a complete CD of that with her available. The only reason five stars was not awarded here is because some of the orchestrations have too much of a pop quality to them, as in \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\".

Though the story is about animal conservation, the human interactions are what make the bulk of it. The author is an emotional person, and the conveyance of his feelings and thoughts in his writing make this story very entertaining. He is also very candid about some of the things he did in Thailand.I have to say one more thing about his writing style. As I was reading the book, I could picture myself hiking along the trails of the forest reserve, or talking to the forest monks. I cringed and felt helpless as I read of the daily cases of skinning and cooking animals alive. And I felt the sense of helplessness and frustration of trying to stop an entire nation from devouring every bit of wildlife left."},{"rating":"1","title":"With Friends Like Alan, Who Needs Enemies?","review":"Self-indulgent prose about a self-involved man's self-pitying and self-important journey halfway around the world to assert himself and his culture on other people.

I bought a large initially, which I could have used to tie down building materials on my car after leaving home depot. It would fit a massive person, and in fact, the velcro wouldn't \\"mate\\" for someone my size. So I bought the medium (in black, again), and this time, I had about 2-4\\" of belt remaining after running it through the clasp. I wouldn't be confident tying off this rigger belt for rappelling, safety line, etc...They really need to make another size (XL) for these belts. The large would fit the biggest person you know... like 300-400 pounders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is way too small","review":"I'm not sure how the belt works because it was incredibly small. I have a size 35 waist, measured by actual tape measure at the skin. I ordered a size 34 belt because all of my mil-issue rigger's belts are size 34 and I have to cut off material. This belt was only 32 inches long.The point of a riggers belt is to feed it through the buckle and velcro several inches back on itself. This makes a strong enough hold that you can be extracted by helicopter with it. This belt would maybe fit someone with a size 28 waist as I couldn't even get one end to touch the other.I've usually had better luck with Blackhawk gear than the standard mil-issue, but in this case the mil-issue far exceeded the Blackhawk gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Ordering Procedure","review":"How do you have any idea how much you're going to pay.

The two that were issued are still in my closet and get used but they are black and new uniform requirements required tan.These belts are great! I've used them for years at sea and never had a problem with rust on the metal parts. The Velcro has never gotten weak and, though I have gear for carrying weapons, these belts also serve well for carrying a sidearm.The construction of these belts makes them very comfortable in thick uniform trousers. Wearing them with jeans is a little less comfortable but wearing them with lightweight khakis or shorts is not something I would recommend, the edge of the belt tends to ride above the waist of lighter trousers. If you're wearing a riggers belt because you need it, you probably shouldn't be wearing lightweight khakis or shorts though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional, durable and looks professional.","review":"I purchased this small version for a fellow firefighter but I have used this model belt for 5 years and it has held up to many shifts of abuse as a Firefighter Paramedic in Central Florida.

The belt is secured by Velcro folded over the buckle. I ordered large size and I did measure it and from the end of the Velcro to the buckle is 52 inches. I have 42 inches waist but the Velcro that is folded over to secure the end is only 9 inches, there is still another 9 inches of Velcro to be mated. So I thought if the whole 18 inches in my case, of Velcro is mated it would be more secure. The material itself I think is light but strong. I will use this belt to hook up to my lanyard. 4 stars because the velcroed part is not long enough in my case, to mate with all the velcro's length, although I ordered the longest available."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This belt is a handsome but rugged looking, and is well made.I enjoy the fit and look of this belt.I even bought a Desert Tan one also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty - this belt is for work!","review":"The belt performs as billed.

It has low/medium/high volume switch, comes with two AA batteries and there's a try me/on switch. Flipped it over to on, pushed Anthony so he'd start singing and then pushed the microphone button in the center of the toy. There was an ear piercing feedback coming from the microphone that made the dog run for cover and our daughter screamed and ran into her bedroom! The only way it could be played with was without using the microphone, which sure wasn't worth the $$. Very disappointing considering it is a Wiggles brand name toy. ... I suggest buying the guitar instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE MY WIGGLES STAR","review":"I have two boys and both LOVE this microphone... One chews it and the other sings away...

It is not just the handheld version. The laptop version suffers the same bugs. The maps are simply not calibrated right. It was often as much as 1,000 feet off.

True, there had been a few other crank call albums before this, but this was the first one that sold a lot of copies. The Jerky Boys on this album were Johnny B, Kamal and Lou Gitano (Lou Gitano did not appear on any of their subsequent albums). Most of the tracks here involve the Jerky Boys calling people up and saying things that leave the person on the other end of the line bewildered.

My daughter does not want to take \\"him\\" back to the store - after all - it's a \\"pound\\" puppy - it needs a good home.

All it does is come out of it's house, spin around, bark and try to go back into it's house. I said try because it usually can not do that iether.I would have sent it back, but the thing was so difficult to get out of the packaging, we had to rip it up just to remove the toy so we could put it under the tree on Christmas Eve.I hate wasting my money on crappy products!

Don't get it, find out it doesn't work, and try to return it but your kid doesn't want to give it up. If you read the other reviews you find out that the ramp doesn't stay on, and the dog only walks and spins. The kids on the commercial are paid to pretend they are having fun.

Hence my rating. BUT, the point of this message is now that the studio has stopped producing new DVDs of it the Amazonian vultures who seem to lurk in the branches waiting for a DVD to die (that is for a DVD to stop being produced) and then they raise their prices to astronomical heights knowing no limits except that of their own unfathomable greed. Do we have fair prices offered by people who would like to see others who want to watch this movie be able to buy it?? No, course not, it's time to rip off fans and stuff their pockets.

Intrigued from the get go: plot; characters; actors, Rock Hudson. Certainly worth a view if you like a little off beat fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Hudson at his best","review":"A chilling story from the director of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE with a nicely subdued performance by Hudson. A man who has become bored with monotony of his life is given a chance at another. A cautionary tale that is as powerful today as it was over 4 decades ago. A note: watch for Will Geer (Grandpa from THE WALTONS) in a folksy role that will give you chills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, funny and very dark.","review":"I first saw this on a local PBS station in Dallas in the early seventies. Frankenheimer was using cameras and editing techniques in 1966 in ways that were at least 25 years ahead of their time. As effectively scary as the movie is, it's infused with some really terrific, subtle humor. It's essentially an extraordinarily dark comedy with thick black & white film atmosphere. Little visuals, like party guests firmly holding down Hudson's panicky character in a bedroom all with their wristwatched left hands. Brilliantly written and photographed, it's filled with a great many satisfying scenes that can be savored for their well-crafted intentional absurdities and details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seconds - the movie Rock Hudson enjoyed MOST to make","review":"I had been curious about this movie and when I finally got to see it, I enjoyed it very much.

A fun way to introduce someone into the joys of AD&D without the huge learning curve. The module(s) are geared towards the story and the enjoyment of the adventure, rather than the tedium of rolling a character and explaining a ton of rules. The intro game _The Ruined Tower_ (the same Fast-Play game as can be found on TSR's website) serves as a good introduction, and the larger adventure _Wrath of the Minotaur_ is a small, but fun romp in the tomb of a long-dead mage... or is he? The intro game is easy to play, and the larger adventure ramps up the rules a bit while not overloading someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"You've heard them all before, and most were -- and still are -- great tracks.

Overall, bad execution of a reasonably good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Sounds, Mysterious Melodies","review":"This CD contains more Schnauss magic with songs of haunting beauty and layered, transcendental sounding themes. It contains two discs with music from the original European release and more recent tunes. Schnauss' music takes me to deep places within my awareness and while the melodies are not all that complicated, they are combined in way that is very original, melodious, and authentic sounding. Treat yourself to a mini-vacation with this music.(Dr. Simeon Hein is the author of the books OPENING MINDS and PLANETARY INTELLIGENCE.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album always feels new","review":"I bought this album for the trip I was regularly making from my rural home over the continental divide, through the Rocky Mountains, to Denver. 7 hours each way, with the most magnificent scenery I've ever seen, and I picked this album to be the soundtrack to that drive.

Great electronica!","review":"As a new fan of Ulrich Schnauss, I have never heard a more relaxing and soothing mix.

I felt a congruency of feelings with Urlich Schnauss as I did when I listened to the Icelandic band Mum. I have been overall very pleased with the quality on this 2x disc set because almost all the songs have a calm and catchy rhythem along with the songs holding similarities to hold the CD together and play as one unit of music rather than a compilation of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It","review":"I usually don't like this kind of music that much, But I like this. So much of this kind of music today is really just tuneless loop driven rythm tracks that tire quickly. This is different though, it has melodies, harmonies and some good grooves. You could say this is actually music, and very well done at that. I would say this bridges the gap from the 80's to today. I hear some Kraftwork, Tangerine Dream, Neu and much 80's synthpop. This is a long album and it all sounds good. I would like to get more of this music in the future. Great job Ulrich!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain great music!","review":"I own two releases by Ulrich Schnauss, and I am very impressed with his ability to reach deep into the listener's mind and touch it. \\"Far Away...\\" is a great soundtrack for life. This album contains six powerful tracks that may sound a little similar too eachother at times, but never become boring. Ulrich Schnauss isn't doing anything different in this genre, but he's doing it better than most electronic artists. Some of the tracks make me think of other songs that I've heard in the past by another artist, but I can never put a finger on it. This album is so good that I can't pick a favorite. I like all the tracks the same, which is a rarity for me.

Over the years I have been extremely disappointed that I could not find a copy to see it again. I'm kind of a running movie junkie owning a number of similar movies (DVDs): Prefontaine (J Leto), The Jericho Mile (P Strauss), On The Edge (B Dern), The Loneliest Runner (M Landon), Without Limits - Prefontaine (B Croudup), Running Brave (R Benson), ... in my DVD collection.Picking up this DVD a month-or-so ago I was astounded how up-side-down my memories of this movie were --- ouch. Have watched the Prefontaine and Running Brave movies numerous times, but I will not watch Running again as it accumulates dust on my bookshelf. M Douglas is still a favorite, but this movie is a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Lame movie","review":"I saw this movie when it came out and it was trully awful. The studio had to find overweight runners to make Douglas look small in the trials scene and for the scenes in Montreal.

Glenn's Australian accent is a pleasure to listen to. Places on the CD have music as well that accompanies the voice. I LOVE these CD's and own most of them. If you live in the states you may hear an occassional terminology that is not common in the U.S. (Example, in the weight series he uses a weight measurement of a 'stone' which is a British term that represents 14 pounds). This happen rarely and certainly does not detract from the message presented in any of Glenn's CD's. You can't really listen to these in the car as they are a little hypnotic so be sure you are in a stress free mind set and location when you listen to any of therse CD's. I felt they were worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slip from mr. Harrold","review":"Glenn Harrold's produces fine hypnotic CDs and much of his work is first rate. Unlike some of his master pieces (A Chakra MeditationandUnleash Your True Potential) this CD however is not worth much. It generally centers around the feeling of deserving to be rich instead of tackling the behavior needed to actually become it. Also if you want to achieve financial independence there are much better sources out there, with more concrete and usable knowledge, likeYour Money or Your LifeandRich Dad, Poor Dad.And if all you really wanted was to feel better about yourself, relax and get more energy, then getUnleash Your True Potentialby the same author, it's far better and actually deliver on its promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it work?","review":"So, who among these reviewers is experiencing unlimited financial abundance because of this cd?

Those same otakus still went out and bought it. Those set of Blu-rays are about $110. So, in Japan, fanservice still trumps creativity and plot.(Oh yeah, they did this as making Disappearance as a movie would make unimaginable amounts of money. After that plan, all they needed to do was to air the episodes in between, but they were not long enough for 13 episodes. Endless Eight filled that hole.)Disappearance has made 200 million yen and has been at Japan's top 10 list of movies for a while. Fans love it so much that they keep coming to see it, even though they've seen it about 6-100 times. I'm not kidding. It's still going strong.

What was a few pages in the original light novels has been expanded into an eight episode abomination that would test the patience of even a Saint.This might have been tolerable, save for the fact that it takes up over half the season, when there were so many more stories from the novels that could have been incorporated.For this travesty, this plague among anime, I will not waste my money investing in Season 2 of Haruhi.If you like endless repetition and being bored to tears, by all means, invest in this set.

It says that this model can be used as a battery charger and it will change from charge mode to float/maintenance charge mode without damaging the battery like trickle chargers. In July of 2011 it just stopped working while it was connected to my classic car battery in float/maintenance charge mode. Of course I bought this model for its 10 year warranty, but now I find out that in addition to having to pay to ship it to the company, I also have to pay $15.95 for them to do Warranty Evaluation, & shipping & handling fees. When you pay $47.00 for an item and it costs you around $30.00 to pay for shipping & return shipping, what is the point of the warranty? This is supposed to be \\"the best\\" of battery chargers and they basically want me to pay for anything done to the unit.

Well, I was woefully disappointed and finally feel compelled to not let this 5-star rating stand any longer. The first half of this book was well-done but the last half was awful. The characters, which were likeable in the beginning, started to turn really, really irritating. I cannot recall another book in which my opinion changed so drastically before. I mean sometimes you may not be happy with the ending or thought the beginning started too slowly, but this book simply turned into claptrap well before the end. There are many funny and well-written Regencies out there, a lot of them older titles.

Underwood will shine in later albums, but for now she'll just have to \\"get by\\" with an overdone CD that will go platinum. (Poor girl.)She's in fine voice, as expected, and has a couple of highlight songs in \\"Before He Cheats\\" and \\"Whenever Your Remember\\". Other than that, expect the usual American Idol hackjob that Kelly, Fantasia, and Clay have had to endure. Way too many syrupy selections, production that takes away rather than adds to the singer's personality, and so on.However, if you loved \\"Inside Your Heaven\\", this will be right up your saccharine alley.

I myself bought 50 copies of her CD *for Christmas gifts of course* and 1 for myself. This CD is absolutely amazing. I will admit, I had doubts. I remember talking to my friend and just saying \\"I sure hope she doesn't screw up.\\" Which does sound pessimistic, but Look at the flops of Reuben and Fantasia. Carrie's is different. Every song, every word is filled with emotion and is so amazing. Such great song choices and she sounds even better!!

However, I am interested to see what she will do in her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more than I expected","review":"Wow. So many hits on this album. I bought it the day it was released. Okay, so I'm an AMERICAN IDOL fan, but this is by far the best Idol album yet (and I've bought most of them). It is great to see song after song hit number 1.

Very recommended for a Christmas gift for friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing debut","review":"I never even watched the season of American Idol that Carrie was on til the very last week. I was glad she won because she did have Bo Dice beat on vocal ability. I bought her single when it came out because I loved 'Inside Your Heaven'. I'm not a fan of country at all, never really was. And when I heard 'Jesus take the wheel' I wasn't super impressed. But then I heard the rest of the album and was BLOWN away. Carrie hits some amazing high notes and her vocal skills are flawless. All the songs have amazing lyrics, 'Before He Cheats' is my favourite track hands down. Carrie's vocals on this track are beautiful, I love it. She is definitely my favourite of all the idols and I'd give this cd 10 stars if it were possible. Congrats to Carrie, very impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie Wins Again !!","review":"Carrie won all over again with this debut CD that will go down in history as a great CD. Below this review you will see many 1 star reviews, most all of them left as part of a coordinated plan to sully Carrie's reputation by people who have nothing better to do than lash out at Carrie for NO REASON. They have not purchased the CD, and in all fairness made up their minds about Carrie months before her CD came out.Buy this CD for yourself, buy one for a friend. I can't speak highly enough of songs like \\"Wasted\\", \\"Some Hearts\\", \\"I ain't in Checotah Anymore\\" and \\"Before He Cheats\\".This is a fun album from one of America's newest treasures !Don't think twice, pick up a copy now !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the idols","review":"I can't say that I'm too surprised by how impeccable the production is on this album but it really outdid it for me. This album is amazing and the only flaw here in my eyes is \\"Jesus Take The Wheel\\". I just couldn't get into that sone. Carrie has helped craft the best idol album since the beginning of the show. Tracks 5, 6, 11, and her cowritten track, \\"I Ain't IN Checotah Anymore\\" are real standouts. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ESSENTIA-LLY AWFUL","review":"CARRIE UNDERWOOD IS YET ANOTHER AWFUL SINGER FROM THE HIGHLY OVERRATED AMERICAN IDOL SERIES.she is even more worse than Fantasia and Kelly.this cd is the pits.YOU WILL INSTANTLY LOSE CREDIBLITY BY BUYING IT.Get WHO'S NEXT from THE WHO instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad release","review":"Horribel album ,she needs to give it up!

The likse of Shania or Martina would clobber her, and her petty little small music. She is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"she needs help","review":"I'm sorry but she just isn't made for this. She shouldn't be singing, she should be pursueing something else. Singing is for people with passion, however, if she wants to take it on.

Turn it down then it would be so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to this cd, but what a disappointment. Carrie thinks that singing loud equals singing with emotion. It's not the same thing, and screaming a song sure won't convince anyone that she feels a connection to the music. This is the musical equivalent of cotton candy - fluffy and sweet when you put it in your mouth, but gone in a flash and forgotten just as quickly. Too bad, she seemed like she had some potential, but she hasn't learned a thing since the show ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unispiring, and bluntly, just not very good.","review":"Carrie Underwood's debut, besides popular belief, is not good at all.

In theory she deserves 2 stars but I felt like giving her one because I really hate this one song on there called were young and beautiful worst song ever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The screamer!","review":"Some Hearts by Carrie Underwood is just a bunch of soulless country tunes that the artist herself doesn't even care about. Carrie's idea of singing consists of non-stop screeching and hitting notes that don't fit her range. Jesus, Take the Wheel, Don't Forget to Remember Me, Wasted, and Before He Cheats are not even real country songs, just rejects from some songwriter's pop catalogue.

Everybody knows its just one person. You make it obvious because none of them are real names and none have anything impressive about them. Now, to the album. Wasted is excellent. Some Hearts is alright, the rest stink. Buy or Not: NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRAVO!! 5 stars!!","review":"Seriously, this is the best album I have ever listened to. Every song is well done and filled with emotion. It will be a best seller. I aplaud you Carrie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal...rescue me.","review":"My wife recently received this album as a present. She played it in the car during a long trip to Vermont in a snow storm. I must have done something very evil to be subjected to this ordeal. Ouch. Pain. Agony. I felt that my ears were keyed and battered with a Louisville Slugger. This woman manages - on every bloody song - to hit tones that even the CIA would classify as torture.Every track is the same - soft followed by loud; over-produced instrumentation; and overly compressed sound. I wouldn't waste my time commenting on this album if I thought that Ms. Underwood didn't have the talent. She obviously has plenty of talent and, as she matures, will hopefully dump her current producers and come up a more diverse and interesting product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie 'Underwood' or 'Deadwood'?","review":"Cold, calculating and about as sexy as lipstick on teeth [the CD, not she], Carrie Underwood's 'Some Hearts' is about as dull sonically as her persona is visually. Her home-spun, down-home, aw-shucks attitude endeared her to millions on AI, but to what price? Can't fault her for the song choices - all typical of bad contemporary country-pop - she didn't write them; and she has zilch - zip - zero say in the production values. But I CAN fault her for her vocals. Yes, her 'technique' is on the mark...but since when does technical proficiency equal emotional capacity? She sings each song like a Star Search audition. It's not the worst of the Idol's CDs [i still believe Clay Aiken's 'Measure of A Man' is the most abominable of ALL Idol related releases], but it's still such a stagnant, emotionless dirge so unequivocally banal, we might have to rename her Carrie 'Deadwood'. My grade: C"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie Underwood will fail","review":"awful album by a pathetic singer!! Carrie Underwood sang these songs on American Idol! She didn't even do a good job then, what makes people think shes going to make a good cd now. She is awful! This album is awful!! She never sang the songs good and she recorded them like crud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in LOVE!","review":"A friend gave me this CD as an early Christmas present and oh my gosh, I think I'm falling in love with you, Carrie Underwood... what an amazing debut!!! I cannot stop playing it!!!!From \\"Wasted\\" to the final track, \\"Inside Your Heaven\\", this CD is full of amazing displays of Carrie's vocal artistry... there is no \\"wasted\\" effort here... every song is a piece of art!!! I think my favorite is the first single, \\"Jesus, Take The Wheel\\", but every song is really good. My other favs include \\"Wasted\\" and the killer track \\"Before He Cheats\\"... both of these should be big hit singles at Country radio.Buy this now!!! Tell all of your friends and family about Carrie Underwood... they will be very happy you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Initial Effort","review":"I have to say the Bo was my pick to win American Idol, although I liked Carrie too. I bought both of their albums, and in my humble opinion Carrie clearly comes out the winner. Song selection and her over all performance is classic country-pop. (Is that an oxymoron?) Anyway, she clearly has the voice and the pipes to belt out these songs. I don't think any of the songs qualify as an anthem, but the album is probably good enough to get her a second shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Lives!","review":"I can't honestly say that I am a Carrie Underwood fan because I only listen to Christian music but Jesus Takes the Wheel is an amazing song. The most awesome thing about American Idol is that all the winners have been Christian or at least professed Christians. Wether they are truly saved or not is up to God but her voice is clearly blessed and it doesn't matter if she can match Martina or Faith. If she's a child of God He will make her shine no matter what. <><"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE SHOULD'VE LOST AMERICAN IDOL!!!!","review":"After hearing this CD, my decision is finalized, she definately should've lost American Idol. She just screams and yells in her annoying, high pitched, nasally voice over and over again. Until the very last second of this album. I could barely even listen the whole way through. Every song was like a chore, each one more strenuous and painful. Don't get this if you like good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds me of Lara Fabian","review":"Unfortunately, I never liked her, down to the point:Pros*Fabulous voice*Fast and slow songs*Some great messagesCons*Doesn't include lyrics*Some not so great messages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was rooting for Carrie on American Idol. Then she came out with her debut album. I hate it.The songs on the album aren't atrocious. They aren't the type of songs that are so bad, you can't even consider them music. However, there's nothing special about them. In fact, I find them boring and uninspiring. They all sound the same and none of them have a catchy tune that just sticks with you. After lisetning to it once through, you forget all about it. Her voice nonetheless is good, however, again she lacks personality in it. It comes off to be very cold and without emotions. She sings all the songs the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie Underwood is bad!!!","review":"Wasted is the best song. The rest are mediocre. I was actually how amazed how most of everything else was rushed and crappily done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before He Cheats","review":"The life of Carrie Underwood exists within that one song. This is the type of music she needs to sing to succeed. Not sappy, construde ballads like \\"Whenever you Remember.' Beautiful girl, lacking my interest only because of poor song choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted stinks!","review":"its obvious that some stupid idiot is making repeated accounts and giving her 5 stars. What a loser. Don't be decieved by this. This CD is really awful. Wasted is the worst song ever!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE music artist..","review":"I was watching CMT the other day when an ad for her CD popped up. Anyway, I decided to pick it up. Big mistake, it was the worst album i've heard in ages. She needs to grow up and stop singing about fairys and princesses. She sounds like a little girl complaining about how shes being made fun of in the big music world. Honey, you brought it upon yourself. What a rude young woman anyway. She sang Wasted at a local fair and we all had to cover our ears in shame and she shrilled through our eardrums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offended by this intense use of religion as a tool","review":"Religion is not a tool to steer your life in the right way. What are you talking about? We, as people, must steer our lives and push ourselves in the right direction. We cannot rely on a supreme being to do that for us. She is so immature on this album, I really would prefer not to comment on any individual songs, because then I would just seem a basher. I am trying to be honest here without being brutally honest. I guess I would just say, \\"what goes around comes around\\" miss Underwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"She sucks","review":"its obvious that some stupid idiot is making repeated accounts and giving her 5 stars. What a loser. Don't be decieved by this. This CD really sucks hard. She sounds like a sad oaf who needs help eating her grains. Wasted is the worst song ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best album's I own","review":"I didn't expect music this good to come out of a rigged show, American Idol. This is a fantastic CD for people of all ages. It is just delightful. Underwood has a strong, versatile voice. Everybody can relate to this music, its pleasant. They have songs not only on 'Love' issues.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, It is good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yes, Carrie was my favorite through the entire show. So reading this you will think I am biased. But I can also tell you, I never buy country albums............never. I did buy this one because I think Carrie is an amazing vocalist. I honestly did not think I would like it as much as I do. There are some songs better than others, but overall I was completely surprised at how good it is. Jesus Take the Wheel, Some Hearts, I Ain't In Checotah Anymore, We're Young and Beautiful, Wasted.........all fabulous. This album is truly at the quality of any female country superstar."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not under my bed for underwood!","review":"This CD has quite a nice sound to it, though not nearly as good as I expected it to be.There are a few songs that I really enjoy and rate as follows:Jesus Take the Wheel:5Some Hearts:4The Night Before (Life goes on):4Inside your heaven:3We're Young and Beautiful:3I Ain't in Checotah Anymore:4Overall, this album sounded pretty good, but it could definitely be better. Hopefully her next album will have songs that aren't as 'whiny'. Also, I didn't really like how her voice strained on the high notes. Maybe other songs need lower ranges or something?Anyway, this album is worth buying if you are already a country fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate country music but I love this CD","review":"Honestly, I don't know how \\"country\\" this CD is. I do not listen to country music. I listen to metal. That is what I listen to. However, I loved Carrie on American Idol last year, and recently received this CD as a gift because of that fact. I have to say it is by far the \\"country-est\\" CD I own, and somehow I competely love it. Steel guitars, fiddles, and banjos abound on this album, as do lyrics about whiskey, cow-tipping, and other such country things, but for some reason I love this CD.The reason is that as a whole, this is a very well produced, \\"country-pop\\" album. It captures a more \\"typical\\" country sound coupling it with the modern-pop demands that are thrown on the winner of American Idol, and I must say that while it is nothing like I would normally ever listen to I really enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This CD is amazing! i love every single song... i would buy 80000 more just in case one breaks but i dont have enough money. her single \\"Jesus take the wheel\\" i GREAT! and \\"Some Hearts\\" is my favorite. i think EVERYONE should buy it. my mom HATES country but she absoultly LOVES this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie's Greatest Hits Album..","review":"Buy this greatest hits album from Carrie..it's not really a greatest hits album..but it looks like one!Because every song is like a hit single!But it fast before it's out of stock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie Underwood - country soul with some rock n' roll","review":"This chick rocks !She is already up there with the best of them.She has the biggest debut from a country artist ever !Pick up this wonderful CD, buy it for someone this holiday season."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I love Carrie's voice, but I was disappointed with this album.

Carrie has a great set of pipes and I can listen to her for hours. I really like Jesus Take the wheel. I watched her on American Idol and expected her to release a superb album and I am not dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The #1 Idol so far","review":"Carrie's first cd debute is one of the best in my collection. I only wish there were more songs on this CD. I also got to watch her perform live @ the Dr. Phil Holiday Party bash which aired this last week. She sounds even better in person that on the CD. This was a great purchase and I can't wait to see her grow and become a even bigger star. I hope she doesn't cross over too soon like Leanne Rimes we've all seen what happen with that. I hope that she continues to produce #1 hits. I would certainly love a \\"Gospel Album\\" since she has already expressed her spiritually and her love for God. For now, I am certainly one of her biggest fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average music&a Cute chick","review":"America Idol has been able to push alot of slick Acts that fit into there own Boxes which is cool for the purpose it serves,Problem is it's hard to forecast who is actually gonna have a long term career.Carrie Underwood has a nice voice&is a Nice looking chick,but this Album is too Polished for it's own good. I believe that for any Artist just starting out you need to have your flaws&work on them,but they are needed for Growth. Carrie Underwood has a chance to have a decent run,but I get the feeling that the Record company might make Her into a Faith Hill type in training. this album doesn't really have any material that stands out,but vocally she has some nice moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty bad album","review":"The worst album i've heard in years!

Well , I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic fodder","review":"This is a prime example of why country stations are disappearing & sales are at an all time low. Anyone who remembers the quality country music from 15 years ago, and farther back will realize this is future bargain bin material, another modern Mindy McCready. Flash, gone. Check back on this in 3 years, hang on until there 100 of these CDs on Amazon for $2.00.This release has a new glam-country, plastic, generic feel that will sell in mass to the niave buyers that has been brainwashed to think that today's country is good. Today's country is not selling; it's declining rapidly in popularity. Sure, Carrie should have won American Idol and has talent, but it's been wasted on this Walt Disney equivalent material. Real wussy fluff - she's the country Hillary Duff. There's a new song for ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"genuine artist ??","review":"The definition of an artist is someone who creates something from scratch.

Just another blonde with alot of makeup on with a generic voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable fluff","review":"At its best American Idol is an entertaining family oriented variety show. At its worse it is a TV show that damages our modern culture as it manufactures \\"talent\\" for the sake of high ratings. And Carie Underwood is the \\"perfect\\" winner: young, sweet, blonde, HARMLESS. I say good for her she was able to get a record deal and sell millions, but, and trust me on this, her and her records will have zero impact in the history of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singer, so so songs, bad production","review":"Carrie's debut CD is very disappointing. Carrie's voice presents great potential. Heavy instrumentation on some songs dilutes her voice. Poor song selection adds to the problem; only \\"Heaven\\" is noteworthy. Carrie needs a new producer if her potential is to be fully realized. Allison Krauss could save Carrie from her path of disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album","review":"Carrie's debut album is so great and powerful!! I really enjoyed this album. It is not your typical american idol artist. Every song on this album is entertaining. It is definitely an album you can listen to all the time and never get tired of it. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Carrie","review":"I'm surprised we have finally found a good singer..she's the most borned-to-be singer up there in the world.

This album much like every other I've heard this year are so overproduced and over polished that it takes the human factor out of music. I bought this album for my wife, and she disliked it so much that she gave it away. We both love Carrie, but hate the overproduced sound of today's music...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really disgusted!","review":"I expected better, she sounds childish on this album.

She squeals like a sow thats being killed. I don't get how 'no talents' like Carrie Underwood get a record deal. Buy other music from some different artists instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, she is bad!!","review":"I will admit that I am a Shania Twain fan, but that doesn't make me like her any less from the start. I bought the CD because i love country music. She isn't good at all, in fact, she sounds the same on EVERY single song. It actually makes me sick. I was amazed at how this girl actually made it as far as she did. Shania sings every song with her own style and sasss, that America has grown to love her for, thats why she sells so much. This girl has no style to grasp, and no individuality. The ONLY song on this album that shows anything other than generics is Before He Cheats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Not sure if this is a pop or country album.

Better luck next time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is a bad apple in country music","review":"My review was deleted so I thought I would rewrite it. Carrie Underwood is bad at country music.

Without the show, she would still be unheard of because of how difficult it is to break into mainstream country music. The girl has got some raw talent and this is an awesome debut album. Every song on the album is a hit, unlike others where you might just like two or three songs and wish that you had gotten just those off of iTunes. I highly recommend, great for all ages. Check out the samples on this Amazon page, they speak for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"You know how after a while you get bored of certain music that you've listened to over and over again?Well, with Carrie Underwood's 'Some Hearts', that didn't really seem to be the case!Needless to say, 'Some Hearts' really is the album of the year - even if it didn't win that award at the ACMs.With Carrie's beautiful voice, exquisite lyrics, and melodious tunes, this album can most certainly be labeled a masterpiece.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to the top!","review":"For a first-timer she's absolutely one to watch. It won't take long before she's really one of the great Country stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive","review":"I not usually a country fun, but Carrie Underwood's debut album is fantastic. Carrie shows off the magnificent voice that helped her to be crowned American Idol. These lush country tunes are a delight to listen to, the standouts being \\"Jesus takes the wheel\\" , \\"Some hearts\\", \\"Wasted\\" and \\"Whenever you remember.\\" Carrie showed incredible depth in her vocals, belting out and nailing the high notes with an unrivalled intensity. The lyrics to the songs are fantastic and the production of the Album excellent. Carrie Underwood has the talent and personality to succeed when other idols (Ruben, Justin) have failed, and she is well on her way to stardom with this solid debut.This album is highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie Underwood","review":"This girl has talent!

That would have been better for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT??","review":"All of you jerks who gave Carrie a bad review, YOU SUCK! You are all just jealus of her whole, pure, wonderful voice.

Keep the albums comin' Carrie! :0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"As expected","review":"I had high hopes for her first album. There was only one song that I liked.

The rest of the cd was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unrelentingly monotonous cd I've ever owned ..........","review":"She has a strong voice that lacks nuance. It is like listening to a diatribe - you very quickly need a rest from it. The producers should take most of the responsibility for this. She's capable of holding back; it's just that she rarely does, probably because she doesn't want to. She's only got one speed here - max.When a voice is this relentless it is hard to think about the songs as melodies instead of as brick walls of sound.Basically, she just sings too loud. It is tiring listening to her. You can win a singing contest singing like this (in fact you probably can't win any other way), but I doubt you can sustain a career with it. She's capable of better, but I'm just relieved to be getting rid of my copy after one listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is awful! Get a life loser!","review":"You guys are totally losers!
