While to others Denver was a visionary, someone who inspired others to look more deeply into their values, their world and do something proactive about it. Although MS Smith attempts to explain Mr. Denver's spirituality, the book is more \\"her\\" take on spirituality than Mr. Denver's. It's also distracting to find out that Ms. Smith never knew Mr. Denver personally so how can she claim to represent his views? After reading it I wondered why I'd wasted my time reading this. Rather than read this book buy more of John Denver's later cds from the 80s onward and discover his spiritual beliefs through his lyrics for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Result with Great Intent","review":"You'd have to be a pretty dedicated JD fan to like this book.

I had been looking forward to reading this, but unfortunately from the moment I began I only became more and more disappointed and uncomfortable. The author moves away from the humanness of the artist and focuses on creating a picture of someone that we seem to be expected to worship as a deity rather than appreciate as a humanitarian. John Denver was a committed and conscientious believer in the goodness of the human spirit. I think you will find his philosophy is best represented in the tableau of his own music. Truly, it would seem a much better place to go to understand his spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I'm a die hard John Denver fan, so it would be very hard to displease me.

The new covers were supposed to show a change in Gaia's life, but all it shows is the author's lack of creativity. The new books are muddled and all they do is make more problems for Gaia, Sam, Ed, and Heather. There are no new situations and hardly any new characters. After Gaia and Sam hooked up, Gaia has nothing else to obsess and dream about. Also, the old Gaia we know and love is being replaced by a spacy and cheerful person. And what about Ed? Now he can walk again (which the author shouldn't have made happen because it was really cliche) he has lost his cynicism. It seems that everyone is misrable. In short, Francine Pascal has messed up a wonderful series and words cannot express how disappointed I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing Steam","review":"The series started out great.

So sue me, I'm an emotional person, but you've got to admit that it's just so sad! I feel horrible for Ed, and Heather's showing what I consider to be her true colors. (Sorry, and Heather fans ::shudders at the thought::) She seemed a lot more humanized in the last few books. I know, they're just characters, but they seem so real!

I do not agree here, they did spread, not to Asia, they are Natural from Asia and spread to Europe. When they arrived in Europe, they already had their gods, similar to the hindu ones, even the druids sat cross legged like the orientals. So, if it was like historians say, they spread to Asia, \\"learned\\" their religion and myths, and then came back to Europe with brand new ideas??? I think not, they came from Asia and spread, not the other way.Anyway, the book is excelent, I've learned quite a lot of the Celtic ways,the author is precise and non fictional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Sound Critical Thinking","review":"Hello,I've read this book with eagerness and passion.

It seems particularly apt for college students and other young people, yearning for meaningful ideas through the maze of collectivist propaganda.Nevertheless, it does have one sin: it is at once too broad and too narrow. Too broad because it covers too much ground and, at times, complex arguments are deprived of part of their explanatory power. Too narrow, because there are some significant omissions. In particular, I would have liked to see more examples of contemporary anarcho-capitalist theory (e.g., David Friedman).Notwithstanding that qualm, I found this volume extremely helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good \\"film\\" or video... not a good value, though","review":"This is probably the most passionately eerie video I've ever watched. Blending old footage of Cash with the new, this video \\"Hurt,\\" seems a melodic retrospective of Cash's life. The juxtaposition of \\"my empire of dirt\\" and images of Cash's awards, plaques and tributes is especially poignant. Just to note, though, this \\"film\\" is really only a four-minute video, nothing else. For value, this DVD should at least contain an interview, behind-the-scenes footage... something, anything, not just the video.

This is basically Johnny Cash doing his video for \\"Hurt.\\" That's it. It's a single 4 minute video. While one would complain that this is far too much money to pay for 4 single minutes, it can also be gotten for about the same price with the cd/dvd edition of The Man That Comes Around.What do I think of the video/song? It does justice to the original Trent Reznor version of 1994. And while not better than the original Nine Inch Nails hit, it sure does hold a candle to it, and atleast manages to keep burning while lit.Buy it. Even if you're a fan of Nine Inch Nails and have never even gotten much into Johnny Cash, you'll probably enjoy this video/song for the simple fact that it pays homage to Trent Reznor.

Grant basically turns Acton's saying about \\"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutley\\" into his conclusion that overwork and poor health mixed with a healthy dose of fear will do the job even better. As a historian Grant is first rate and cites all the obvious sources for his subject (Suetonius, Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny etc...) As a writer however, Grant is not as accessible as someone like Joseph Ellis, James Reston or Steven Ambrose. He has a penchant for the more \\"scholarly\\" style of prose which can often make good information like this a bit less accessible for the general reader. These guys led amazing lives full of intrigue, violence and incredible self-indulgence.

When I saw this product on Amazon, I was immediately intrigued. It looked like just the thing to allow me to massage my own neck when the pain hit. After receiving the Accu-massage, I immediately tried it out. The little balls at the top screw into the handles and can be adjusted to one of 3 different settings on each side so that you can customize to your needs. I think what most disappointed me was that the balls are stationary. They don't roll around as you move the sticks. The balls are hard rubbery plastic and don't slide easily over the skin so it mostly feels like it's just pinching your neck rather than massaging. It just didn't work for me. If this company could make a similar product with balls which would roll as you massage, I'd definitely give it a try.

I think the biggest issue is it's too flexible. When I put some pressure it just bends too much. There's no resistance. Most of my energy is then used to \\"shape\\" the stick and not actually apply pressure. It's entirely possible that if one was not to press too hard it may work. Problem is if I have a need for a massage, then I need a lot of pressure.

I had just moved them from the middle and was {successfully} releasing my trigger points when it just gave. Looking at it, it broke almost perfectly in two, leading me to think the design is faulty, yet seeing \\"Made in Taiwan\\" lends itself to the culprit being poor materials used in production.If the former is the case, I'd suggest a low tension type of coil, covered by rubber/material to protect and contain if the coil ever sprang.

Evergrey had been consistent if not brilliant. Each album was better than the one before it. The concepts on the albums were dark and thought provoking, but with no compromise to the music.

I purchased it to replace a model RN-108 which unfortunately was dropped and broken. The replacement doesn't even come close to the original. I have tried all settings...speed, voice activated, etc to no avail. The replay of recorded voice is not natural and there is always a continuous whiring or hissing in the background. The similar microcassete it relaced had no such annoyance. Recordings from the old recorder sound ok on the new recorder so obviously the recording properties of this new recorder lacks any quality. Can't even return it due to a 3rd party that hides behind Amazon.com in the wood-work."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a while, then it stops working","review":"I bought this recorder for college. At first it worked pretty good, sound quality isn't great, playback is a little fuzzy and distorted, but overall it was good considering the price. Now after a couple of months it only works when it wants to. It will be fine one day, and then the next it won't play the tape back, or it won't record at all. I thought it was the tape, but it does this with all the tapes. I replaced the batteries so it's not that either. I have lost hours of lectures because of this thing. I am buying a digital recorder to replace this one. Hopefully that will be more reliable and maybe even last me the entire semester!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated technology? Yes, and it is fine for my purposes","review":"I wanted a recorder to 'catch' my thoughts as I went for a daily walk or drove in the car.

It does what I wanted to do - capture thoughts that come to me when I am away from my computer. I like the simplicity of the design and it is working just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like MOTOR NOISE","review":"I agree with another reviewer.

Therefore, she has included EVERY IDEA SHE EVER HAD. It's got puns. It's got plants. It's got magic. It's got space travel. It's got time travel. It's got (failed) attempts at humor and (failed) attempts at profound obsevation about love, romance, and sex.

A manic portrait of psychosis, it is also a fascinating examination of the soul and a tour de force critique of American conciousness. It is complex and intellectual without being ostentatious. It is also so cutting edge that its diction and style precede the sword's razor in the air. Combined, The Alphabet Man is an extremely good read, along the lines of the best Wallace, Vollman, Gass, or Gaddis could offer. And that's just about the highest praise I could possibly offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this video!!","review":"I am fourteen and really enjoy this video.

At first, his attraction is just physical, but as the story continues he finds himself falling in love with her. Each character is so well written that I actually found myself smiling when they were happy and crying when they were sad.

But, I regret buying the Sod Buster. It was dull right out of the box. Even worse, it absolutely would not take an edge. The blade shape isn't very useful. Too fat and not pointed enough. It's more of a glorified paring knife, except my paring knives are sharper."},{"rating":"2","title":"This could be the last knife you need","review":"Like the title says, this can easily be the last knife you will ever need (although if you are like me, it won't be the last you will buy). This knife has a very utilitarian blade shape. The steel takes an awesome edge. I was able to put a mirror edge on mine very quickly with my Lansky sharpener. The pull and snap of the blade is very good and tight. People who I let look at the knife say it is a little too hard, but I like it and it will likely loosen up over time. When closed, mine does have a little off centering of the blade, but not nearly enough to send it back, even though I know Case would take care of it.All in all, this is a very classic and thoughtfully designed knife. No frills. Good steel. Tough handle. Good proportions on everything. This knife is meant to be used and it feels great in the hand. For the price, this knife cannot be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made in USA","review":"i luv my Case Sod Buster Jr pocket knife. single blade & just the right size. excellent steel that takes and keeps a fine edge. i appreciate being able to buy a qualitypocket knife made in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"This product is just \\"okay\\".

This book is essentially one big chapter about a hundred brothers reuniting for a dinner. What follows is a series of squabbling between brothers that is at most incoherent. The prose is really bad, with exaggerations and flowery words (more like a Venus flytrap). Donald Antrim seems to have written the book in one night, because the events don't make sense. My advice is start with one brother, and go up from there. Leave this bin of mumbo jumbo for graduate students and intellectual snobs.

Maybe the author tried but does not succeed in connecting all 24 ship disaster stories from centuries at sea. The author, Bernard Edwards, tries but doesn't succeed in making me interested in the sea disaster stories listed here.For starters, he starts telling stories from the 1770s to the 1980s. Remember this book was published in 1990. While I found the Titanic disaster to be the most fascinating, the author writes another side to the story entitled \\"Scapegoat\\" about Captain Walter Lord on the steamship, California, that was rumored to be nearby while the Titanic sank. I found this case to be most interesting because of my interest in Titanic.Apart from Titanic, the other stories are often short and repetitive in nature. The stories just blend together.

I am preparing for my first trip to Spain. Hoping for a summary of the country's history and people that would help me appreciate what I am about to see, I anxiously opened Lalaguna's book. Instead of text that would bring the country's culture and historical figures to life, I found a mere time line. Chapter after chapter that traces groups of people by date and geographical location. The Black Plague, the Inquisition and Ferdinand and Isabella's reign were all dispensed with in a mere paragraph. What a shame that such a rich heritage could sound so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Iberia instead","review":"Having read several other Traveller's History books (Turkey, China, Greece) and enjoyed them, I expected much more than I got from this book. The author makes no connections and assumes the reader already knows a lot about Spanish history, in which case, why read this one? I was particularly turned off by the author's terrible punctuation and sentences that went on for 10 lines. Doesn't anyone edit anymore? Wish I had read the other reviews before buying this book. Someone planning a trip to Spain should read James Michner's Iberia instead Ñ not as much history, perhaps, but a lot more understanding of the country and what shaped it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and money!","review":"Bought this book in Canada from Chapters. Dropped it after the first 100 pages. I love history and enjoy history books, but this one is terribly boring and unprofessional. There is no systematic approach whatsoever: events, places and names mentioned without proper introduction or reference. The book fails to build link between the places you might visit (it's a \\"travelers history\\" after all) and the historic events. It is neither popular reading nor academic textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biassed history always unwelcome","review":"While shallow enough for those like me who have little patience for over-scrupulous books, it is strikingly biassed and opinionated. Some remarks about historic figures are blatantly subjective, and bias reaches its zenith when the author goes to great length criticising the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez. As a Spaniard who has lived that period, while I acknowledge the right of the author to hold an opinion on Gonzalez's period in office, his comments go way beyond admissibility in a history book.

Not much in terms of straight autobiography here, as the flow is mainly in the stories, which Bobby tells very well.

In his days with the WWF, his quick jibes always got a laugh out of me.In his book, Heenan tells the story of his life and journey through wrestling. While their is no real \\"dirt\\" in the book, Heenan's humor is as sharp as it is on the television. Some of the stories are hilarious and give real insight into the business. Heenan also talks about his personal life including growing up without a father and finding his long lost family members only a few years ago.

A runaway bestseller in Europe (where they like their humor black, hold the sugar) Miss Remarkable is sure to find a niche audience among cynics and optimists nationwide.

GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Original Teleplay by Robert Bloch","review":"This is my favourite episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER. The script was written by Robert Bloch, based on the short story of another writer. In the original story, I believe, there is a painting of a woman who weeps real tears. Bloch changed this into a weird tale concerning a diabolic painting that carries a curse, and brings death to they who own it. A premonition of Death appears on the scythe held by the painted Reaper -- the blade of which is said to become stained with stigmata as a forewarning of impending doom. The cast is brilliant, and the ending is one of the most frightening moments of pure terror even caught on film. As with most episodes of THRILLER that were in the Gothic mode, this episode has extremely effective music and photography. Bob's script is laced with his sardonic humor. Happily, an official DVD box set of THRILLER is set for release in early 2010!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Had purchased this mustard in a specialty shop in Niagara-On-The-Lake in Canada.

Doesn't give any description how to prevent them---other than buying virus protection software, which most computers come with now. By constantly repeating everything at the beginning and end of each chapter with litte content in between, the book could of been scaled down to 10 pages of non-repetitive words from the 350. It's ONLY redeeming quality is a couple C++ programs he copied from other people and some of the websites he mentions.

Ten minutes can really make a difference and I like watching the clock....very motivating.The first segment with Minna is the best...uses weights and works the whole body; the second has fun boxing moves and great bun & quadriceps exercises; the third one has a different style to it with lots of strengthening and stretching moves.

Nothing can be done to stop that noise. Hopefully, it will keep the cold air from pouring into the kitchen until I can track down a better damper.

I have read in the mean time that people complain about that noise when the wind is blowing. I didn't have any windy weather yet to see what;s happening, but I am not looking forward to it.

I bought the book knowing nothing more about it than Dr. Dunn's international prominence as an ornithologist at the Canadian Wildlife Service and a prime developer of Project FeederWatch -- and I wasn't disappointed. She and her co-author based the book solidly on an analysis of the data submitted by thousands of observers since 1987 in the immense network of FeederWatch volunteers across the U.S. and Canada. It seems to me that this important publication has not received the wide attention it deserves.

In addition to these, I own dozens of other books about bird feeding, and bird identification. I have to say that of them all, this book is the worst of the lot. Its quite boring, and written more like a text book than something meant to be entertaining. And I found it relentlessly technical for just a backyard feeder like myself. It contains almost no illustrations, and also gets very bogged down in bird identification rather than the true nuts and bolts of bird feeding, seed choices....etc. Read some of my other reviews of bird books on here to make a better choice.

It takes consumate talent and impeccable timing to pull it off. In my book, Don Knotts ranks right up there with the very best, and I'm talking Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Buster Keaton, etc. When Don has had good material to work with, as he did on the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, and in some of his other projects, he showed that he was a master of his craft, for he not only was funny, he set a standard that those who followed could measure themselves by. This warm memoir provides an intelligent and insightful look into the life of a great comic actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, that's all that need be said!","review":"Don Knotts has a certain exquisite vulnerability that makes his work so endearing. Every character he plays, while hilarious, is sensitive, gentle and human. In a world obsessed with wringing the integrity out of every thing of beauty, for fear one might discover an emotion and there in be forced to live as something more than a faceless drone of mediocrity, Don Knotts is a revilation. The innocence of a man who wants to do nothing more than give a world in chaos laughter terrifies people. It forces them to reevaluate their lives, and wonder what they will leave to mankind.

We see a picture of his kids, and that's it. What's their names, Don? Do you love them? We hear about a divorce, thrown out like an after-thought. With what little I've been able to glean from other sources, Don Knotts is maybe the greatest missed chances for comedy, ever. Without killing himself with drugs or stupidity, Knotts blew it. True or not? I'll have to look for the answer somewhere else. He blew it with this pablum book too.

These are a little trickier to sharpen when the edge does eventually dull, so make sure you know what you're doing. You need to hand wash and dry immediately - if you let air dry you'll get spots on the blade that are very difficult to remove . (You should hand-wash and dry any good knife, but this isn't clearly stated in the product description for this series).Just some things to consider before buying...Overall an excellent knife series. When sharp, probably the sharpest knife I've owned. Holds an edge longer than most.

Of course, had no time to watch all discs in a timely manner. One of the disks (so far) freezes and would not play. I contacted AMBROSE VIDEO PUBLISHING and they say that since the set was not bought from them directly, most likely is a illegal copy so they will not replace it.The DVD is most likely original (I can tell a DVD-R from an original) but it will not play.On one hand, AMBROSE VIDEO PUBLISHING wants to increase the sales by using Amazon but on the other hand will offer NO support from purchase made outside their site (if even this is true).Other customers complain also about this kind of problem. Frankly, until this DVD, it never occurred to me to find an original, brand new DVD that would not play.Update:In the end, Ambrose got to better feelings and said \\"we stand behind our products\\".

Because my license and credit cards are all together in two pockets, without a divider between each card, the wallet is much thinner. The only drawback that I found, was the fact that I needed to transfer a few of my cards to another wallet.

But, recently, I was in the mood for something a little different, so I popped this one in. A lot of times I like to put the tv on mute, and listen to my music, and watch whatever happens on the screen. I love doing this because I am a huge fan of film music. I happen to be flipping through the channels and HBO was showing \\"Titanic\\". I muted the tv, and popped this cd in, and let the music do the rest. The experience was so heartwrencing. The beginning scenes of \\"Titanic\\" when they are veiwing it on the ocean bottom had a totally different, more \\"personalized\\" feel to it. This album is really unique. It really took some time for me to get used to it, but it was worth it. And oddly enough, I like music that is unusual, but this one took some \\"gettin used to\\". I would definitely recommend this for any \\"Titanic\\" freak like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"obvious, superficial","review":"I can't imagine that the reviewers who call this meditative, deep, poignant, etc. have much truck with the music of Morton Feldman, because if they did, they would hear this muzak for what it is.

Those who listen to Feldman, Webern, Stockhausen, Cage, will find this superficial, more annoying than moving.

It went droning on for 40+ - the same Adagio molto the entire time. I had a long drive and listening to this was similar to watching a building burn - you know you shouldn't, but you just can't help yourself.I love music from all eras, but this isn't from an era and I honestly couldn't call it music. I've never heard so many excruciatingly slow I, IV and V chords in repetition in my life, with an occasional cello player creating a dissonance by having fallen asleep.It's easily the worst piece of classically oriented music I've ever heard, and I sat through a lot of music school experimental nonsense in the 70's. Sorry - just not sure how this ever got recorded, let alone played on the radio. I'm guessing people who like it saw it with some video footage of the titanic, but having only heard it on the radio, it's got no legs of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably perfect...","review":"This music destroys me. I'm a huge fan of pretty much everything Gavin Bryar's has recorded, but this one probably beats out all else. It's a tough call between this and 'Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet', but I think this one wins out. 'Titanic' is some of the most beautiful, haunting music that I've ever heard. I've heard it called good ambient music, good music to play in the background. I couldn't disagree more. This is music that -demands- every iota of your attention. Put it on, lie down, turn out the lights and just listen to the whole thing. It is a truly overpowering experience. Bryar's has a way of doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning use of music to experience an event.","review":"Bryar's Titanic is unforgettable. It is, literally, stunning. You feel as though you are in the water, as though you yourself are drowning, caught up in the confusion and timelessness, the slowing down of time as life washes over you.

The writing is generally amateurish and the plot less than challenging.

Give this pretender to the throne credit for including the work of such true royalty as Dr. Seuss, but this only demonstrates how Lansky's own efforts pale in comparison. In fact, Lansky's writes a poem that parallels one of Seuss' classic works, but where Seuss is ever-elegant, Lansky comes across as down-right nasty. If dropping a baby on his head is your idea of cute, then these poems are for you. I would recommend something less insulting for the children in your life.

It's extremely awkward with some strange movements throughout. I love moves that challenge my strength, stamina and balance, but the odd routines aren't that kind of a 'challenge.' She talks nonstop and most if it is not about instruction, direction or guidance, it's just chit chat, and the movement sequences are extremely awkward.

Too many reviewers worry about the avant-garde nature of the Yoko Ono performance. The film documents one of the best and most feral rock concerts ever given. Lennon's performance is raw and exciting. And, if you've ever doubted Lennon's estimation of \\"Don't Worry Kyoko...\\" as one of the best rock songs ever, you must see him and Clapton getting into a fine guitar groove that works like a mantra. And the live version of \\"Yer Blues\\" is as exciting as the performance in the Stones' \\"Rock and Roll Circus\\" (not to mention \\"Cold Turkey\\"! This is a classic moment in rock history that testifies to the power of Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band. Don't miss it! I waited years to get this DVD. It rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The performances are historic, but...","review":"As with the album that came from this concert (\\"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\\"), the quality of performances is very uneven. Yoko's songs are not ready for prime time, and her attempts at singing and vocalizing make Linda McCartney sound like a nightingale. Nevertheless, the rough, underrehearsed sound of the Plastic Ono Band is still exciting 31 years later.The film would be worthy of three stars just for capturing Lennon and Clapton in a historic concert were it not for the low quality of the cinematography. The film looks lousy, even for an impromptu filming. Buy it ONLY if you are more interested in the authenticity of Lennon trying to establish an identity separate from \\"Beatle John\\" and less interested in a polished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Story Teller","review":"I don't give 5 stars out easily, but the content of this CD rates up there with the likes of Harry Chapin, Loudon Wainwright, and Simon & Garfunkel. What you get is a man, his guitar, and his intellect. At first I was concerned with the CD becoming tedious. How interesting can 30 songs be with the same singer, no band or voice backups, and no electronic wizardry? The answer is I was stunned at how good it was. I sat and listened to 135 minutes of pure entertainment. The talent Pacheco possesses is real and deep. This is a rare & expensive CD, but if you're a fan of story tellers, you must add this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This game is really not what I was hoping it would be. First, it's controls are fairly complicated for getting simple things done and it allows you to do stuff that is inappropriate. For instance, it is possible to fold a hand that was checked to you. Second, it makes you sit through a fake shuffle and deal sequence each hand which is just goofy. It really serves no purpose other than slowing the game way down. I hope the makers don't think that are actually recreating the feel of a real game of poker. They shouldn't even try, that is not what this game is for. Third, the computer players play like idiots. They will call repeated raises with nothing pretty much down to the river. Once they get low on chips and pot odds dictate going All In with almost any hand, they will begin to fold much more regularly. So they play almost exactly opposite of what they should.I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-5 straight beats a 2-6 or higher straight.","review":"Whomever programmed this surely was not from Texas and knows nothing about poker..

Lo and behold, the sometimes competent actress is reduced to starring in a film like this. Ditto to William Devane, who for years entertained us on KNOTS LANDING, he too should fire his agent for getting him involved in this psychobabble mess.Young plays a sexy psychoanalyst with unconventional techniques whose patients keep disappearing. Devane plays the father of a hot-tempered former boxer (a studly but untalented Will Schaub), who evidently was pretty cruel to his sons.The plot is so contrived with a distraction of an unconnected murder, and the rest of the cast are reminiscent of community theater actors, and that's an insult to them.More time is spent on showing naked women, some of them apparently bulemic or anorexic, and the whole thing is just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the cover...","review":"This is the worst movie to ever be made in the history of movies. However, if you like softcore porn, you may actually enjoy this because that is about all there is to it. I would have to say there is more plot in porn movies than this movie.

I have seen some really bad movies but this has to be the worst. No joke... However, if you don't heed my advice and you do buy this movie you can always use the disc as a frisbee for your dog or a coaster to put your drinks on. Personally, I'd set it on fire and see how fast it burns. That would be more entertaining than what this film had to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I like most of the songs, however, the case was broken so I dropped my rating (bad packing) but if you like Elvis there are a few songs you will really like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orion Dead at 53","review":"Although \\"Orion\\" (Jimmy Ellis, Orrville, Alabama) never attained the fame he so desperately sought, he was an object of much affection from his loyal fans who constantly supported and encouraged his career.

I then contacted Dell who manufactured my computer. The tech at Dell could not resolve the problem, so he conferenced with me with my internet provider.

I no longer have access to this book- because Grandma burned it years ago! She bought it at a garage sale after only looking at the first couple of pages, but once she realized that there were pictures of exposed phalluses and breasts, it went right into the attic! Of course, we all still found it and marveled over the artistry every chance we got, but she put the ol' kibosh on that as soon as she found out. Some people have no appreciation for art! Truly, this book is wonderful to behold and one of the most imaginitive I have come across, if you can get past the nudity. It's one of those Graeme Baese-like books where you keep turning back to the pictures to see what you missed! I highly recommend this book as a conversation piece for the wide-eyed wonderer in all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Textbook","review":"Having used this as a textbook for a distance-learning class, I've found it to be very poorly written. Its greatest fault is that in calculations and procedures, many of the examples provided have incomplete explanations, leaving out crucial steps. This leaves the student staring at the example, trying to figure out how it was done. An in-person instructor can compensate for this by showing examples on the blackboard, but distance-learning students need to find alternate sources to fill in the gaps.The exercises in the book are also poor. For example, sometimes a factual question is asked, for which the information is not present in the book. Or a problem is given where prerequisite examples or explanations are absent.As a high-level overview of computer architecture, the book is alright but when it gets into details, it leaves students floundering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I used this book for a course in Computer Architecture. Except for one chapter, I read the entire book and I practiced almost all the exercises. As a novice reader, I liked the book very much. The book is very well organized, chapters are laid out in logical sequence and the writing style is very clear. Many illustrations are presented in the book that make it easy to understand concepts. Many examples are presented in special cases that help the student understand complicated stuff. Overall I am very much pleased with this book. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the answers to the exercises listed at the back of the book had errors in them (I confirmed this fact after checking with my instructor) and these are not fixed even in the last edition. Highly recommended to those who are new to this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells great!!","review":"I got it for my BFF for Christmas and she loves.

My first impression by just looking at the front cover that Pat Metheny was going to be featured throughout the concert, but alas, he only appeared on two songs and two awful songs they were. Terrible, absolutely terrible. Second of all, who filmed this concert? A 17 year old high school kid? Totally unprofessional looking and lacking any kind of character. Lastly, the caliber of musicians who appeared on this film is truly disappointing. I mean these performances sound like college performers...in fact I've heard many college jazz musicians that sound better than these guys sounded.Don't waste your time or money on this DVD.

Mr. Reed captures the colorful world of horse racing and mixes it with the seedy world of conmen and greedy bad guys. The characters are exceptional and the bad guy is really bad.

This is a richly detailed, atmospheric \\"ride\\" with one of the more uniquely sinister villains -- Malcolm Marquis Ravling -- I have encountered in quite some time. Equally notable are the good guys -- trainer Cliff Dante and his pal, Dan Van Berg, who kept this reader engaged, not because of any tendency towards overblown, super-heroics, but because they are \\"regular Joes\\" who are only looking to get what they deserve -- a well-earned \\"big casino\\" on their favorite horse. Well-paced with flavorful dialogue and memorable characters (particularly the bone-chilling Malcolm), this novel is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst show ever","review":"I wish I could give this show negative stars.

Clinton did an outstanding job on the song selections, eventhough every song that he ever put out can't be on here, the choices are great. Glen Goins did a masterful call and response and sing-along on \\"Mothership Connection\\". The concert effects of dropping the Mothership is far out, and very entertaining! Plus the camera work is not bad at all, for a concert recorded live from Houston, TX @1977, which was originally released in 1986 on VHS. Other song highlights are, \\"Undisco Kidd\\", \\"Dr. Funkenstein\\", \\"Let's Take It to the Stage\\", \\"Night of the Thumpasorus People\\" and many others.

But only certain people could grasp the P-Funk idealogy, but the ones that could! It was nothing but a party baby! Back then musicians played real instruments and entertained on stage but the P-Funk boys were the \\"real deal\\"! Other outstanding groups of that era were Earth, Wind, and Fire, if you ever get a chance to buy any of there concerts on DVD from that period (70's & 80's) go for it! You won't be disappointed!

My version came in a cd jewel case, i dont know if this is normal but i like it better this way.I have not found any easters eggs yet, if indeed there are any.If your a collector like me you will want to own this dvd, but if you allready own the video and have grown tired of it i would suggest to save your money or buy disaster pieces if you dont allready own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"they could do better","review":"ok my frend jordan let me barrow this dvd. it was ok. on the dvd you get a chose to pick eather 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, righteach pick has the same thing. same music video's the same people talking it just shows the same thing over and over agen. it not woth the money.Disasterpieces was SO much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"big rip off","review":"I thought this would be like an inside the nine sort of thing but it is is just a Hight video with the Surfacing,Wait and bleed, and spit it out music videos.

I went to a local store to trade some points on a credit card I am about to return or cancel. I asked the guys how much points I had for trade for credit in the store and they gave me the ammount so I start to see what I could pick up.My first choice was the BlueRay of 'Rust in peace' from Megadeth but I had to give $11 in cash, but I am going to make some spends for the hollydays so I went for something cheaper ... the Slipknot DVD was then choosen.I dont want to bore you with my review... two stars are split in this order,star 1) I am a Slipknot fanstar 2) I had some time holding the purchase of this so I finally get it for my personal collection.This DVD should be retired from the market and be included as a bonus DVD on Iowa or the self titled...

I think that the author has used good judgement in balancing depth of coverage and breadth of topics. I would strongly recommend it...surely worth the money. Competing titles that I've seen are not meant for the newbie, and many such as Newton's are good but do not solely focus on the wireless aspect of things.

He covers basic concepts, does a good job of explaining the terminology, surveys the different types of systems and the components used to build them, and manages to keep everything readily understandable. If you need to pick up the concepts quickly, pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An RF book for dummies","review":"I recommend this book to those who are not EE major and want to know the ABC's of RF and wireless technologies.

Land constantly has his Palestinian character go on tirades about how \\"thousands (of Israelis) were involved in the administrative detentions, the torture, the terrorizing (!) of our young, the closing of our schools.\\" The Israeli character just makes dumb replies as if to admit to such nonsense. Land often makes the argument that the only reason Palestinian terror exists is because the Israelis were so mean to them.What drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenseful Book!","review":"I bought this book to try out a new author. I was not dissapointed. A Palestenian detective is paired with a female Shin-Bet investigator to solve a series of serial killings. The Palestenian detective was formerly a detective in Detroit.After the murder of his family he returned home. He and the Shin-Bet agent form a good working relationship that eventually leads to a romantic laison. This book does a good job of describing the worlds of both Palestine and Israel. The team have to deal with some dangerous and seedy characters with their investigation. When they finally reach the guilty parties the killers are very shocking to say the least. A plot to destabilize the peace process is under way. This is definitely a well written book. It also impressed me with Jon Land. Read this. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Walls of Jericho Review","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is the first in a series and I am now working on the third book.

Disney has taken out 8 minutes from this movie for the dvd release. This movie is supposed to run 89 minutes, not 81. The 89 minute version of this film is only available on VHS. For whatever reason, Disney doesn't want the fans of this great film to ever own the original uncut 89 minute version on dvd. I can't stand it when Disney shortens movies when they're released on dvd. When Disney does this, they're trying to re-write history and they're acting like the scenes taken out of movies aren't important scenes and they also act like no one has the right to ever own the original uncut versions on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Beginners","review":"I am relatively new to yoga and was fortunate enough to have purchased this dvd by Gary Bromley. His explanations are clear and concise, the movements entertaining and rewarding. I cannot believe how my flexibility has improved by doing this class 3 to 4 times a week. I have tried others that are very good as well but there's something about Mr. Bromleys approach and style that appeals to me.

As odd as that sentence is, you may want to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed-of little value other than background noise","review":"I had hoped to use a portion of the cd for a presentation, but it was so hard to decipher the words that without a lot of work to set the context and hard listening by the audience-more than I could expect and still hold interest, it was not workable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it first","review":"Buy CDs that you expect you'll want to play reasonably often; otherwise borrow them, as I did with this one, from a library - - that'd be my advice. Borrow it again if you find you want to listen to it again.I don't think this is a religious piece; at least, to me it seems to be about experimentation (taken, as one reviewer put it, to the breaking point).

Having now heard the cd, I hope I never hear from Mr. Bryars again. I admit the idea of using a found tape of a hobo as the launching point for orchestration is intriguing, but the experiment went horribly wrong. This cd became annoying after about the first three minutes, and from there soared to new levels of obnoxiousness. Even the contribution of Tom Waits does little to redeem this pretentious absurdity. Jesus save us all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"All you need to know about Jesus..just about all you need to _know_...is in this recording. I don't remember ever crying at the sound of a record (except when my mom bought me a Michael Bolton CD, but that was when it finally stopped.); but I cried when I first heard this.

I listened to it twice and then gave the CD away. I feel bad for the person I gave it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE RUBBISH","review":"Jesus' Blood seems to be part of a current trend. The trick appears to be to take a single phrase and just repeat it and repeat it and repeat it. Mr Michael Nyman is a notable exponent of the technique, and the 3rd symphony by one Gorecki seems to have got itself a considerable following for much the same reasons. To my mind nothing could more falsify and betray the genuine spirit of musical creation. Hypnotic repetitions can obviously be effective, but they are a substitute for genuine inspiration. Ravel himself called his Bolero 'an orchestral piece without music' as he happily raked in the royalties. To me this kind of stuff is simply an affront. Given the supposedly religious impetus of this particular bit of pseudo-music, I would suggest that we all look to the salvation of our musical souls and separate ourselves from the Gadarene temptations that are putting them in peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"God help us","review":"I can understand why people say they heard this once five years ago and have been unable to forget it. If you repeat a 15 second clip over and over for close to an hour it will be hard to get out of your head. But I am not sure why you would want to do that.I cannot understand why people think manipulating an unpaid and uncredited drunk to the sound of weepy strings is an art form, or worse, a spiritual experience.But some people do. So a word of warning, before you buy this CD listen to the clip. Then listen to it again. Listen to it a couple hundred times. Is this a spiritual experience? Are you in the presence of the divine? Then buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one escapes me","review":"I should love this album; maybe if I'd heard the original (others complained about this re-release) but to me it sounds poorly mixed and kind of dull. And endless. Just not hearing what brings people to tears. And I love found recordings and all. I heard about it via the re-realased Bush of Ghosts booklet that referenced this as a landmark, and maybe it was, conceptually and musically speaking but it fails to reach me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and wonderful","review":"This piece defies normal categorization. It may drive you nuts or it may creep under your skin into the subconscious. The sleevenotes tell the history behind this highly unusual musical loop that gets built out into a minimalist symphony of sorts.My only criticism would be that the orchestration could have been rather more varied in places, but that tramp's voice will really get to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Song, in the classic sense of the word","review":"To say that this song \\"haunts\\" its listeners is perhaps not entirely accurate. Once you hear this recording, or portion thereof, you will be stalked persistently, relentlessly, and endlessly. I knew of the piece's reputation before a friend put the cd in the player and smirked as the first strains reached my ears. As my friend sat mesmerized in front of the speakers, I did housework; putting things away and doing the dishes. It was with considerable surprise, therefore, that 10-15 minutes later I found myself standing in the kitchen holding a dish towel, bawling my heart out. I wish that I could find something in this world in which I could believe as strongly as that man believed in Jesus. Faith of that kind, however, continues to elude me although the conviction in his voice urges me to keep searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"I heard the tune on the radio 5 years ago--still remember it","review":"A friend of mine and I both remember hearing this thing on the radio.

You can hang your keys on them and I maybe a pot holder? Anyways, you get the picture. If I need more of these babies I will buy them but not here - I noticed they are in stores everywhere as well.

They're clear and tiny, which makes them pretty unobtrusive. I used them to put up two pretty big wall hangings, and even though the package says they're only rated for half a pound, they've been up solidly for a few days already. They left no mark when I had to take them down after some mis-placements, and there are plenty of extra sticky strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked really well","review":"i used these to hang my xmas garlands with decorations. i know each can only support half a pound so i didnt space them too far apart. the transparent design makes them nearly invisible when mounted. great product"},{"rating":"2","title":"They are Awesome!!!!!11111","review":"They really are. u can use them anywhere and they come off easily. and fairly strong...but not great, especially if they havent been set right.SWEeT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unhappy","review":"I gave the item four stars because the item in itself is good.

I figured that priests, bishops and the parishoners all believed in the teachings of the Church, consistent over 2000 years, or they would move on to the \\"church of fun\\" down the street. Wrong. I was dismayed beyond belief. I've always been a voracious reader and went through writings of various saints like Aquinas and St. Augustine. Where was the Catholic Church of history? It certainly isn't the one with the sign that says, \\"St. So-and-So Catholic Community.\\" That one is Catholic in name only.Through God's grace I discovered the traditional movement where people like myself will drive over an hour each way to attend \\"The Mass.\\" People attend because they want to be Catholic.

I remember having a Communion rail, then not having one. Over the years, I felt that the Mass provided me less and less grace. I have gone for years not going because there seemed to be no point. I won't say the New Order itself was bad, but in the way it is celebrated, it does seem to be susceptible to being \\"dumbed down\\" way too much. Almost by accident, I discovered that a Latin Tridentine Mass was celebrated near me every Sunday afternoon. Since then, I never miss Mass unless I have to work. It is almost like the Tridentine Mass provided something to my soul that the New Order did not. This book helps a lot to explain that phenomenon. If I felt that way, how much more deeply would the priest feel it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable sandal","review":"Stay away from Crystaluna brand although its by Stride Rite.

Stocks go down in bear markets. 3. Nobody knows when a bear market will come.Well, duh.The book does not purport to advise readers how to predict a bear market, how to invest in anticipation of a bear market, or even what to do in a bear market.

If you use arrows to move, you must arrow over, then hit enter, THEN click the mouse to designate direction. By the time you finally get to each square to type in a letter, you have lost interest.

THIS IS NOT AC/DC LIVE, ITS AC/DC REDUBBED. THE NICE PART IS THAT IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC!! THE AUDIO IS DARN NEAR PERFECT. HOWEVER, THE VIDEO QUALITY IS VHS AT BEST, THE BLACKS LOOK GREY AND WORN. WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT FROM A 1991 CONCERT? SOME REMASTERING WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE. IT TAKES A FEW SONGS TO GET USED TO IT AFTER WATCHING OTHER DVD'S, BUT DOESNT DETRACT TOO MUCH FROM THE EXPERIENCE. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD IS THE FACT THAT YOU GET SOME SONGS YOU CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE (ON DVD), SUCH AS \\"FIRE YOUR GUNS\\" AND \\"HELL AIN'T A BAD PLACE\\". ... ANOTHER COOL THING ABOUT THIS DVD IS THE AUDIO COMMENTARY, YOU JUST DON'T FIND THAT WITH TOO MANY CONCERT DVD'S. ALSO, YOU CAN WATCH ONE SINGLE MEMBER OF THE BAND FOR SOME SONGS, WHICH IS COOL CUZ I LIKE SEEING ANGUS YOUNG PLAY BACK IN BLACK. ANYHOW, THIS DVD IS WORTH THE PRICE, ...

Regardless, this DVD is still amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest concerts on video EVER - BUT.....","review":"I have had the VHS version of this concert for years and I've noticed that on the DVD version, the sound has been altered. Some of Angus's lead licks were slightly edited and at the end of \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\", Angus holds his hand up in the air and screams into the microphone. Well, the video of him doing that is present on the DVD, but the audio of his screaming was edited out! I was a bit disappointed with that. Also, on \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\", certain sections have \\"backward masking\\" in it. If you listen real close, there is definitely a voice talking. It's unmistakeable. If anyone out there can figure out how to isolate the voice and figure out what it says, please let me know. Probably something like, \\"your mother sews socks that smell\\", or something. Did you know that if you play the Mr. Ed themesong backwards, you can hear a voice say, \\"s-s-s-s-s-s-s-satan?\\" HA HA HA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Angus and company are in top form delivering a high energy show shot in great HD quality, well worth the purchase price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows it's age in a bad way.","review":"I picked up this concert DVD on a recommendation from a friend. I was interested to see this newly re-masteded concert, so I fired up my home theatre and gave this DVD a spin. I only made it half way through before turning it off, the sound was good, but there is no way that this was a live sound, my guess is that the sound was either re-recorded or re-dubbed and it left me with the impression that you were listening to a CD! and not a live concert. Second, the so called re-mastered picture was also a disappointment, there was too much grain and artifacts present that it gave the feel of watching an old film projected image from my days at high school! Overall, I was not impressed and this concert is only from 1991, so there is no reason why the film and sound quality should be this poor. I have seen many concerts on DVD that were either this age or older and they looked spectacular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled: AC/DC overdubbed w/ video from Donington","review":"The sound is obviously not from this concert, that makes it awful.I'd expect something like this from Britney, Madonna, Milli Vanilli, Ashlee Simpson, etc. I can even take the disclaimer on VH's DVD that says.. \\"we recorded this over 2 different shows to get all the video\\" and I can handle the Zep DVD where they did an AWESOME job considering that they had limited video to work with.Other reviews have said \\"Disconcerting.\\" It is downright awful. The sad thing is that the audio is a good rendition of their work and the video makes it appear that it was one smokin' show, they are just not the same. RUSH in Rio was a show with low-quality audio, but you knew when Lifeson was playing, it was not some studioed-up version.The liner says \\"One of the greatest live concert documents of all time.\\" This is only true if Winston Smith was doing the documentation of the concert. They had 26 cameras, but apparantly forgot to plug them into the microphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED","review":"It couldn't be more blatantly obvious that the audio was dubbed over the original recording, if it was even recorded during the actual Donington show at all. When I watch a concert DVD, I fully expect to see and hear what I would have seen and heard if I had attended the concert. This experience however, was more like watching a bunch of MTV videos where the audio was from CD versions of the songs, but the video was showing concert footage. I contemplated giving it two stars instead of one because of Angus' high-energy performance, but the fact that I kept fast-forwarding to the next track during my initial viewing should tell you all you need to know.The bottom line is that I will most likely never pull this DVD out of the cabinet to watch it again for my own personal enjoyment. It will only ever see the light of day again if a friend still wants to see it even after the forewarning that I am sure to give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Band, Not So Great Mix","review":"I have been an AC/DC fan for as long as I can remember. The thing I love about those guys is they are who they are. They rock their way. I liked this DVD, but the mix wasn't what I had hoped it would be.

I like the setting, just would have liked to hear all the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than the DVD version.","review":"I just got this yesterday. Really a waste of money unless you're a hardcore AC/DC fan and have a proper 5.1 channel PCM audio set-up.I'd have to rate this as my worst blu-ray for video quality in my collection of over 100 discs. Can't see how this one is much better than a regular DVD. Anyone else notice a lot of problems with the lighting and the color of blue? And overall, it's blurry as all heck. And the grain... were they shooting this thing on 8mm home movie?Yeah, I know I shouldn't expect much from a 15 year-old film-shot grain-fest, but hey... I still expected a whole lot more.And no \\"Sink The Pink\\" played at the concert? I saw this concert when they came to Des Moines, and they played \\"Sink The Pink.\\" Argh!A tragedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdubs SUCK!!","review":"Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD version of Donington. They aren't overdubbed with other audio tracks. For instance, during Shoot to Thrill, Brian screams something, but his microphone is on his belt. During Back in Black. He says \\"hey mama\\" but his mike is no where near his mouth. One of the solos doesn't line up during Fire Your Guns. Thunderstruck even sounds different. There are lots of differences in the US DVD. I don't have time to name them all. The undoctored versions of the show also LOOK DIFFERENT. The show took place near a storm, but on the US DVD, there aren't any storm clouds. The sound is great, but its not from Donington. The original video and audio was fine. They should've left it alone. I strongly discourage the buying of this DVD. Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD to get the full effect of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"This is one excellent concert DVD! Picture and sound very good for an older concert.

Came down to Donington with a few friends. Watching the video truly relives the experience. Suddenly everything came back - the sounds, the sights. Of course this time I'm nearer the stage - that time I was in the middle of the crowd - about 200m from the left of stage. Truly excellent concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Damned Concert","review":"When this video was released way back in the nineties, I ran to the store to buy it. After seeing countless other concert videos since, I still say this is the absolute best live show you can find on DVD. The photography is beautiful, the editing is a good mix of band/audience footage, the sound quality beats anything, and come on, it's AC/DC--no other band could ever compare to these guys live! I've waited for this to come out on DVD for over a decade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock DVD! Must See!","review":"This DVD is a MUST HAVE for any fan of AC/DC! What a performance by all, especially Angus. The guitar solos alone are worth the price of the DVD, this guy is FANTASTIC!

The audio and video quality of this DVD is superb, the camera always seems to be in the right place all through the video.

Really good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I know that this concert was filmed back in 1991, and to compare it to more recent recordings that were made for HD isn't a fair comparison, but i doubt that there is much a difference from the regular DVD and the blu ray version. The footage is very grainy and when you see the shots from a distance it looks like every other pixel on the screen is a white dot. The sound is great(especially if you have a good theater system), but the video of this disk isn't up to what i'd expect for High Definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thunder From Down Under Blow The Castle To Smithereens","review":"AC/DC is bar none one of the finest live acts I've ever seen, and \\"AC/DC Live At Donington\\" is proof of this. This is one of the most lively, energetic shows I've ever seen. The band is simply on fire. Each of the 18 performances look and sound great, and command your attention.This new dvd also comes equipped with audio commentary from Angus and Malcolm Young. It is a dvd that belongs in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music, Poor Video","review":"Gave this a two because of the songs. The video on this DVD is very poor. I don't even think that the sound is from the actual concert. If you watch everyone playing and listen to the sound, their movements don't match up with the music. I guess if you were going to order this, you'd want to get the Blu-ray so you'd at least have a better video (although I haven't seen the Blu-ray, I'd imagine it would be crisper). If you just want to listen to some songs, and see the band along with those songs, then get this DVD.

I've never seen such amateur artwork.Add on top of that the authors' cloying style which is both demeaning and seriously unfunny (but three cheers for trying, right??), and you've got a huge book that is a nightmare to plow through.Oh, and Sandee Cohen never worked for Adobe...that was Luanne Seymour Cohen, who has written the excellent Design Essentials book covering both Illustrator and Photoshop.It's too bad that Amazon doesn't let you preview a chapter...I doubt any copies of this book are being sold in real bookstores where you can actually pick up this \\"work\\" and leaf through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little light for a \\"big\\" book","review":"The authors seem to gloss over a lot of Illustrator 9.0's features.

It is not for the squeamish! Lots of outlandish stuff, like intestines being pulled out of victim's bellies, chain saw action, etc. But the characters are so compelling that it comes across as more Saturday Night Live than Chain Saw Massacre. One really great scene involves all the characters suspensefully standing around waiting for a pager to beep, with quick closeups of faces and different angles, obviously pantomining a scene from the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly--what a hoot! This is a GREAT audience film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demonoid...","review":"HELL'S HIGHWAY is another brilliant low-budget film from the makers of GOTH.

The girl looks fine and acts normal for a moment or two, but then it becomes clear that this hitchhiker is bad news. Mayhem ensues from this point onward. I guess this could have been a decent movie, but it is too over the top, and while I've seen worse acting for sure, the execution of this movie left a lot to be desired on every level. The fact that it does not take itself seriously enough is a drawback and the reasoning behind the movie's rash decision to take things over the top with ridiculous kills, terrible gore and almost comedic scenes. This kills any horror that the film was trying to create. I would skip this one because it really is garbage, but I feel like with a little bit of atmosphere, suspense and a steadier hand, this movie could have been more than it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Horror Flick","review":"I got this in a pack of 4 DVDs for 5 bucks.

It is very useful, especially for young vegans like me who need to cook for themselves. The recipes are easy follow, but sometimes complicated to prepare, and not always quick. I really like the poetry and biographies in it, but some of the information isn't completely true, for example, they talk about Ben Franklin being a vegetarian, but they don't add that he decided that vegetarianism wasn't for him after smelling fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"spiral bound please","review":"I've had this book for about 6 years. It's now falling apart and some of the pages stick together from the food splatter. That is why my recommendation to the publishers is to consider a spiral bound book for future printings. I would even buy it again! My 18 year old, loves the carrot nut spread. The info on proper nutrition is helpful just to have it in one source. Although the recipes are not always fancy, they are great base recipes to start from and change to suit your taste. When you've been vegan a while, especially a whole food vegan, your taste buds change and you don't require fancy as much. That may be why the recipes seem bland to some readers. I bought the book when I first started trying out veganism and I've not regretted the purchase.

It works well, it is well constructed and easy to use. I use it every night when I get in bed so I can get some sleep. I recently had a hip replacement surgery, and then a serious infection set in causing a lot of muscle pain. The heat attachment really helps relax the muscles, although I wish the heat was a bit hotter than luke warm. The other attachments, especially the scalp attachment, feel wonderful and add to the relaxation. The two speeds give the massager more range when using the facial attachment as well as the scalp attachment.

Any deep pressure will stop the vibrations, so it's pretty useless for deep tissue. The heating element doesn't get better the luke warm, not enough to penetrate the skin and do any real good.

The on/off switches are sensitive and in a lousy spot if you actually grasp the handle to work out your kinks and soreness, your hand will constantly hit the switch and accidentally turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good one for the price","review":"It is a pretty useful massager and for the price it is worth trying !The heat is not pretty good, but overall a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Made - Lacks Power or Heat","review":"Being familiar with Wahl's reputation for quality and customer service I purchased the Wahl 4196-1001 massager after having several Homedics units over the years. Homedics no longer offers the heated unit I wanted hence I went with this unit. It arrived promptly and was obviously well made. It didn't even come close to the deep massage or heat output of any Homedics units I've had in the past. I returned the unit and was promptly refunded. I then purchased a Brookstone unit which, while lacking the heat feature, is an amazing VERY QUIET massager that really penetrates and is also well made.

One thing to be aware of, however, which I found a little disappointing -- you can't use any of the extra attachments with the heating function.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish the heat function got the unit hotter faster than it does. It's also a bit heavy for comfortably reaching my upper back with a sore shoulder. But overall it's a great massager and I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope my experience was the exception and not the rule","review":"Upon opening the product, I tested the massage function and it worked great. Lots of good attachments that really loosened up my shoulder immediately. However, as soon as I put the heating attachment on, the plastic rim around it started to crack and fall off. And not just a tiny bit, but the entire ring. I thought I had used the product incorrectly, but re-read the instructions front to back and found that I had followed them to the letter. In fact, there was a blurb about NEVER using the heating attachment if the plastic ring cracks or falls off. So I'm not sure if that was included because this is something that happens regularly or what, but needless to say I was very disappointed. Again, I hope this is the exception and not the rule. All of the other reviews seem pretty positive which is why I was so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good massager","review":"I don't use the many plastic attachments that came with this unit, but you might. I find the heat very helpful for fibromyalia and deep spasms. I think the head or surface are is a convenient size and easy to slide across the skin. This massage is very useful and helps you get into the tight muscles that feel like knots. I would definitely recommend this unit.If I had to give a con, I'd say that it does heat up after about 20-30 min, but how often do you need it for that long? The cord can get in the way if you aren't paying attention, but its more sturdy and powerful than a battery operated model and you never need to buy batteries either.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NSG98Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vibrations","review":"Turns out this product is exactly what my wife's physical therapist was using on her hand.

I paid more for this than others because I thought it would be good.Moments after first trying the regular head, I tried to replace it with another head. The instructions say \\"with thumb and finger, pry off\\". Well I tried and it was on very tight. So I tugged it until it pulled off....along with pulling out the inerds of the machine. The cheap plastic on the outside cracked.The head came off, but the connecter to the head was dangling outside the plastic.What a piece of horribly-made cheap plastic garbage.If you have a Wahl clibber, this must use the same motor because it has that horrible whining that the clippers has. The clippers at least are made somewhat solidly. This is junk.Not worth the price. Wahl probably makes it for $2 in China and sells the crap for $50. TOTAL RIPOFF.Not sure why so many good reviews. The heat is barely noticeable and the vibrations aren't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It feels Amazing","review":"I love this thing.

Addresses Christians with the mind set of separatism and asceticism. Realistically that's a limited audience, and what is needed more is a book that challenges Christians to be radical influences within the culture and still be set apart (but not a 'hermit'). My biggest problem with the book is that it is riddled with Open theism, aka God doesn't really know everything nor does he have power over any or everything. Very distracting from the main points of chapters. That pretty much destroyed his ethos for me.His section on technology was particularly weak (Check out \\"Small is Beautiful\\" by E.F.

Overall, I would avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboys With Chrome Horses","review":"The first book to explain the historical interlacing of the independant American spirit with the allure of that most enigmatic machine, the motorcycle. Everyone who rides understands this sense of spirit and freedom. Bad boys on bad toys was a fiction created by the meida. The intertwining of that fiction with the rise in popularity of the era of the cowboy is explored historically and romantically. This book explains that saying motorcycle saying \\"if I have to explain you wouldn't understand\\" to both riders and non-riders alike. Easy to read, fasinating connections made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowboys With Chrome Horses","review":"I received \\"Cowboys With Chrome Horses\\" as a gift and got into it right away.

The directions are horribly unclear; it seems that this author thinks that whatever she means, she can say \\"open it to the top\\". Four completely different folds she describes as opening it to the top. My, that's not helpful. Also, you just have to guess if valley or mountain folds are meant, because for both identical dashed lines are used and both are described as \\"fold\\". It's terribly confusing to have to make models just by looking at the pictures, when several folds can yield identical-looking results from the camera's angle, thus leaving the folder with all sorts of superfluous creases and frustration.

I mean, Jesus was that bad. I haven't been bamboozled out of my money like this since the last time I was at the fair. Or was that a strip club?

This author purports pure fantasy. Want to know the truth about religion? Spend time reading comparative religion, comparative mythology, archeology, history, rather than nonsense like this book. I recommend reading, The Jesus Mysteries, by Freke and Gandy, Joseph Campbell's works in audio, video and book forms, Robert Price's, Deconstructing Jesus, and a vast array of other authors sourced by these and many other authors. Oh, be sure to read, Unearthing the Bible, and find out what archeology says, now, today, with the most modern of techniques utilised, about the land of the Bible. Spend your money and time discovering truth, rather than the nonsense espoused in The Jesus Papers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bovine Scat...................","review":"at it's smelliest.

What an insult to our intelligence!I saw this clown on TV, completely staged for filming, with his dark glasses, leather (or imitation)jacket, long hair, and chain smoking cigarettes, and his pompous attitude. I almost fell out of my chair laughing, but gagging at the same time. He reminded me of a teenage motorcyle punk trying to be intelligent.I admit, I did NOT entirely read this book; I was tired of being sickened.

Thankfully books of this nature need not provide 'lock-solid' proof of their claims to be interesting (or even entertaining) particularly when they are clearly intended to spark debate and confront assumptions which are themselves questionably valid. While Baigent seemingly writes with this end in mind, he ultimately disappoints providing instead a rambling, meandering summation of his theories that clings (barely) to its narrative structure. Save yourself the time and money and avoid a book all-too-conveniently produced to coattail off of the release of the blockbuster Da Vinci Code and buy Holy Blood, Holy Grail (by the same author) - a far more persuasive and moving read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing based on previous offerings","review":"Michael Baigent is an expert and icon in his field. His breadth of reference is highly impressive and whilst there were some very interesting elements in this book, for me he rambled and spent an inordinate amount of time talking about the exploration of the caves around lake Avernus. I felt the book had been padded."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Michael Baigent","review":"Baigent's Holy Blood book was an excellent book and a best seller. What happened in the intervening years to produce this book? Baigent must be short of money. I'm a lay person so I really can't comment on the depth of his scholarship, but even a lay person like me can see that Baigent is stretching the point.Of course it isn't all bad. In fact the book is well written and does seem to have some useful facts. But unless you are qualified to separate fact from fiction, the book can create a problem.I don't recommend this book to anyone, unless you already have sufficient knowledge to be able to benefit from whatever truth there is here and weed out the craziness."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if this were all true?","review":"This was an interesting read for me, even more than Holy Blood, Holy Grail. He had some plausible theories, but he either couldn't or didn't prove them. That didn't take away from my interest. A lot of Christianity is based on faith. Oh we say it is based on scripture, but I am finding with some digging that a lot of what we claim is scripture-based just isn't there. In the long run we believe what we choose to believe. I recommend this book for its mind expanding theories, but don't read it if you can't stand to have the things your religion teaches challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jesus \\"Capers\\" is More Like it!","review":"I am so disappointed because Baigent does nothing but rehash his old theories in a new updated bookcover! This book is a recap of Holy Blood, Holy Grail and the Messianic Legacy. Although the title is provocative enough, there is no further information afforded by reading the text. Like so many other authors who seek to lure us in with \\"secret\\" or \\"arcane\\" knowledge, there is nothing new! It's all hype - I'm tired of spending money and being duped into purchasing a book which is merely all a come-on! Grrr! I'll give it 2-stars because he does delve into the Egyptian connection to the teachings of Jesus. Other than that, I was hoping for more substance. Come on, Michael, we've heard the swoon theory a million times!! And, by the way, you never tell us ---just what are the Jesus Papers????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Blood, Holy Grail is much better","review":"Too bad I read Holy Blood, Holy Grail first because it is the benchmark for this author's works. This book is a rehash of the aforementioned. You'd be better off reading that one than this. The author reads his own work, which repeats itself so there is little meat in the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supporting illusions...","review":"So continues on the scheme to deface and devalue Jesus Christ.

Everything else, highlighting this shabby attempt to further a mudslinging campaign, is a unthinkable strech of unsupported faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"What people do for cash","review":"Books like this one are nothing new. The idea of Jesus having survived the crucifixion is hilarious for HISTORICAL reasons: If anyone knew how to EXECUTE a man in ancient times, it were the Romans. A very high profile \\"criminal\\" like Christ would not have been allowed to be taken down from the cross unless he was dead. Just give the Romans SOME credit!And Pilate making a deal to save Christ's life? Oh, for the love of GOD! (Pardon the pun) This is just RIDICULOUS!I don't mind theories and additional thoughts. But THIS is just hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was the worst load of crock I have ever read. Unsupported facts, unsupported beliefs. It sounds to me like this man is on a witch-hunt to say everything written in the Bible is wrong. How much sense does that make???

He does a good job of providing historical facts to the life, death and ressurection of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for shock value and profit!","review":"This book which is nothing more then sections of his book \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\" Baigent regurgitates his theory of the \\"Jesus conspiracy\\" The book is a work written not for scholarly pursuits but shock value. It is a work that was written for the money and nothing more. If he had some new insights to offer or critical analysis of text the book might have some value. In the end it has no redeeming value as the author appears to be clearly attempting to capitalize on the sensationalism of Da Vinci and the law suit he was in over the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled and rambling","review":"I bought and read this book in order to find out what all the fuss is about. I'm very disappointed! \\"The Jesus Papers\\" rambles all over the map; it's muddled; and it's unscholarly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Hypothesis","review":"I am an open mindex reader. I was simply let down with what Professor Baigent had to offer. It wasn't until the final 20 pages of the book that he brings together the \\"shocking\\" details of the Jesus papers. With so little substance to back up the argument, I was left with an odd feeling at the end of the book. It was so speculative, I could never use his information in any kind of debate. I would be referencing documents that many believe exist. I did not mind the read and it is an interesting Egyptian section, but to call this book the Jesus Papers should tell me we are going to focus on those docuements. Thinking about this book, I almost feel like it was written to put pressure on the antiquities market to sell the remaining scrolls and documents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here.","review":"Warning warning Will Robinson! There is nothing new here! Our beloved author basically summarizes and remixes his earlier work Holy Blood Holy Grail like a DJ at an all night rave, which in it's self, was based mostly on conjecture and theories (the book not the rave).If you like money and would love to buy something for oh say $20 DO NOT buy this book. It is a total waste of time and paper... those poor trees.However on the overall idea of the book, I'd have to say it's a nice story and very inventive however the fact that it lacks a shred of any sort of corroborating evidence in it's self should be enough to help people decide that both Baigent's earlier work and Brown's funny novel are in no way true but simply works of fiction. However people will of course take these works to heart and we will be descended into chaos, dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodge-podge of theories with not enogh time spent on any one of them","review":"Many of the ideas that Michael proposes in this work are interesting and seem reasonable but he doesn't follow through with nearly any of them. Even worse is that they don't seem to really relate to one another. Though perhaps that would be too easy (and certainly prove them untrue) if they did fit together like a tight little thriller puzzle.Unfortunately this book comes off as a well written (and sometimes exciting) hodge-podge of alternate histories of Jesus combined with sometimes unrelated global travels, promising meetings, and ancient secret digs. Maybe he will explore some of his theories further and spend more time writing about them soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps...","review":"Perhaps Jesus survived or avoided crucifixion and lived until at least 45 A.D. Perhaps he and others \\"visited\\" the afterlife while still of this world. Perhaps the Church surpressed or destroyed documents proving the human side of Jesus while at the same time building its foundation from the blood of dissenters. Perhaps some such documents still exist in the hands of clandestine merchants, poorly cataloged manuscript libraries or hoarded in secret in the Church's own restricted collections. Very interesting postulations, of course, proving nothing, but interesting nonetheless. Something to consider for anyone who takes modern doctrine at face value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Save your money. This could have been a fiction story for all we know. The \\"evidence\\" he provides are privately held documents that the author has \\"seen\\" and taken for granted that the owners told him the correct information about the papers as the author cannot read the papers that he has seen. All his \\"evidence\\" is totally anecdotal. The only other \\"evidence\\" is of a painting done in the 1600's or later as \\"proof\\" of a hoax.While his theory that Jesus lived after his crucifixion is interesting, he provides no proof except one interesting sentence in the original gospels.The Jesus Mysteries is a much better read and an incredibly scholarly book with dozens of pages of references."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I was expecting...","review":"The information in the book is interesting. Problem is that it doesn't have much to do with the topic at hand. The chapters (maybe 3 of them?) covering the topic were good.The material in the book seemed to be more about the history of the area Jesus inhabited rather than about how the Catholic Church is perpetrating a lie. I won't lie, I am a practicing Catholic, but I was really interested it what he had to say and what evidence he had to back it up. I don't, for a moment, think that what the Catholic Church teaches about Jesus is 100% correct. There is also the fact that there is a great deal of information about Jesus missing from Catholic teachings (from he was the age of 12 or so until he is in his late 20s is all but missing).I have about 2 chapters left and am greatly disappointed in this book. I borrowed this from my mom (not a practicing Catholic) and I think she was actually more disappointed in it than I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Baigent writes a fascinating book AGAIN!!","review":"I have never been disappointed in buying a book written by Baigent.

Maybe Dan Brown will write a fictional novel based on this book too, and it will be a blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Duke of Denial","review":"Sounds like Duke is in a little denial of his own along with the author of this book. Like the author, Duke provides nothing substantial in his review rantings other than disdain for Christianity under the guise of incoherent \\"logic\\". The presumption that Christians are morons and void of apologetic thought is pervasive in his/her review.

The final disc is the most interesting whereas the middle discs drag on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A search for profit","review":"It has come to my attention that, although this book obviously has very few objective truths, or anything beyond conjecture really, it continues to attract readers. While I can understand wanting to read an intellectual work before judging it, in this case, that is unneccessary. There is very little representative of intellect in these arguments, and by purchasing it merely to disprove it, one would only fuel this man's lies. By putting cash in his pocket for spouting out mistruths, we are perpetuating and, indeed, encouraging this sort of book. Save yourself some money and say \\"no\\" to misguided works like this that broker upon their controversiality to make an easy profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Reading","review":"Mr.Baigent introduces some very interesting perspectives within the realm of religion, and its foundation. I found it hard to put the book down. However, at times the author does become long-winded and goes on a tangent. But this aside, I highely recommend anyone seeking to explore the (true) foundations of religion to invest in this writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jesus Papers","review":"Michael Baigent's work is one for those readers who crave different points of view. This is a book that is not for those who have a blind faith in Jesus as the son of God ... the be all and end all. This book offers some compelling data to 'suggest' different alternatives to those of the Bible. Was Jesus the son of God? Did he survive the crucifixion ... and how? Was he married and were there children from this marriage? Plus much more that is not taught in Christian education. This is not a work of fiction by a 'fly-by-night' author, but well researched alternative explanations for Jesus himself, well assembled by a scholar.This book was first published in 2006, so the suggestions in it are not really 'new'. The historical information provided gives a remarkable insight into the clash of the Roman and Jewish cultures of the day.If you are not averse to having your pre-conceived ideas about Jesus challenged, this book is certainly a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Circumstantial","review":"Very poorly written. Reading the summary at the end of the book eliminates the need to read the book. With atrocious sentence structure and pages of tangential information the author fails to substantiate the main premise of the book. At best, he introduces facts from which arguments can be made to raise valid questions about the life and death of Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen Fantasy","review":"No matter how \\"well researched\\" this book is, no matter how great an \\"authority\\" the author is, I cannot get past the fact that in the 1960's Jane Roberts \\"channelled\\" an entity called Seth and published some very popular books. This Seth entity asserted the EXACT SAME THING as the author, that the crucifiction was a hoax, there was a stand in, yadda yadda yadda. My opinion? If you are going to expound some outlandish theory, at least be original in your ideas.So basically, in my mind, Baigent and a channeled enitity have equal credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jesus papers","review":"Mr. Baigent is obviously a kook. Just one more attempt to discredit the gospels, written by men who ACTUALLY were there and witnessed the crucifixion. This kind of writing is right along the lines of those who say the Holocaust never happened.Don't waste you hard earned money on this collection of rhetoric bologna. This type of slash fest also has one good end result. It proves what the bible says about those who will always try to distort, discredit, and twist what the Word says. And for that, we thank Mr. Baigent. This is a foolish piece of rubish not worth the read. From the first page to the last, nothing but garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Cover up story","review":"Mr Baigent did a great work to write down this book, he have great heart to do the research on this topic.

Nevertheless, the end left me wanting more information. The book is not for the fainthearted or extreme believers. It is a book for a seasoned reader on the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baigent Wants Our Bucks","review":"I read Holy Blood Holy Grail years ago and re-read it later. I found it quite interesting. I have to agree with the reviewer \\"Pen Name\\". Baigent himself is now on the DaVinci Code bandwagon.Let us not forget, Holy Blood, Holy Grail was released as a work of non-fiction, while Dan Brown wrote his as fiction (very well, I might add, it was a great book). It is ridiculous that Baigent is suing Dan Brown for \\"stealing\\" his ideas. He should also be suing all the others who wrote books on this subject. I guess he thinks Brown has more money than the others.Personally, I feel that Baigent and his co-author fitted their unsubstaniated findings and some ideas taken from the Masons (both are Masons).This is not to say it was not a very interesting book and an interesting theory, however it is very difficult to trace a specific idea from the present to 2000 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting title Half deceiving content","review":"I was appealed by the title in a bargain price of a bookstore and I thought it could have been an interesting reading after books from Elaine Pagels about gnostic gospels. The first 8 chapters are the most pertinent to the title and give some historical context of Jesus' life and of spread of early Christianity in first two centuries BC, mostly from Josephus, other Roman historians and gnostic gospels. After this, the author digresses on mysticism and finally goes back to Nag Hammadi and Dead Sea Scrolls, supporting the destabilizing influence of these on some principles of Christianism. Sometimes the author tries to give evidence to some of his hypothesis by stretching too much the relevance of archeo findings or of some excerpts of texts mentioned above. Surely provoking and revealing for readers that approach gnostic gospels for first time. Teh book could have been long half its actual length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing exposed here...","review":"Although this book provides some interesting information about archeology and the workings of the black market in dealing with ancient artifacts, there is absolutely nothing new revealed in this book.At the very most, after teasing readers throughout the book with the revelations to come, in the last few pages Baigent claims he saw a document, which he could not translate, but that supposedly exposes history's greatest coverup. Huh? What am I missing here? Don't you have to be able to read and understand a document to know what message it reveals?I would advise you that if you're really interested in the type of information this book purports to reveal, read any of Elaine Pagel's books. This one is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book","review":"The idea behind this book is great. The authors support for the book is thin, and they tend to repeat themselves. It seems as if Major Garrett had a US News article and stretched it into a book, but it didn't work for them. An example of this is on page 105 where they talk about how 26 of the 104 House races they were decided by 55% or less went to the candidate who spent less in 1996, but on page 107 the number changed to 23 candidates. This really disproves their theory that money does not buy elections, well that's 75% where money did buy the election.

I thought the authors' \\"analysis\\" was unbalanced in that, for each \\"lie\\", they included only those points to analyze that permitted them to support the conclusion they wanted. For example, under the \\"lie\\" of \\"Religion and Politics Don't Mix\\" they failed to discuss the efforts (and success) of the religious right to influence the content of school textbooks or to require the teaching of creationism along with, or in place of, evolution. This book is clearly an attempt to support pre-determined positions rather than an analysis of some very important issues. Our book group, including the conservatives (Republicans), agreed the book was not well written and a poor choice for discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to those who actually follow politics","review":"If you follow politics, you'll find their writing and the \\"lies\\" they dispel, such as \\"All Politicians Are Corrupt,\\" to be condescending and insulting.They present evidence irresponsibly, such as charting projected Medicare spendings in the future and failing to mention whether or not the dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation.It is apparent that the target audience here is those that have an obscured and cynical view of Washington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivil","review":"Major Garrett is a follower of Rev.

In a concise manner, it explains what exactly is going on in the world today. I love the author's ability to define complex environmental trends and organize them into useful lists (10 Negative Environmental Trends, 8 Ways to Change). He takes the vagary out of the science that often indimates us from truly grasping environmental issues. Warning: now that you understand, you will feel forced to act.One of the author's recommendations is for environmental education to increase, so the gap between environmental science and the average person will close. Read this book and the gap will lessen for you. Futhermore is his collection of resources for those inclined to take action (websites, books, etc.). I found these resources an excellent start for all, from housewives to students to policy makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful and fun to read","review":"My son had to build a mousetrap powered racer and we did not know where to start, ordered the book and it was a HUGE help.

This is not a collection of photos of the 9/11 tragedies, per se, but a collection of 9/12 newspaper front pages from nearly all the major US dailies, the biggest national papers (USA Today, WSJ, Christian Science Monitor), plus several major newspapers from around the world. Horrible as the events of that day were, it is interesting (and revelatory in some cases) to see how the events were covered. Obviously the NYC and Washington newspapers had a special closeness to the events but there is plenty to learn from reviewing the coverage in distant cities and small towns across North America, by US allies and traditionally non-allied nations (and even a few enemy states), and of editorial decisions about headline phrasing and photo selection. In a way, a book like this makes a case, for better or worse, for the world as global village. Not for the feint-hearted, perhaps, but an interesting collection and certainly worth preserving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting for news buffs and others!","review":"If you were wondering what various newspapers said on 9/11, this is the book for you.

Come on guys, you have 2 entire CDs to fill, don't edit the band's debatably greatest song.But the big problem is the sound quality.

But nooooo, they have to make it profitable for all the little teenies of America who don't know who the classic punk bands are because of their steady diet of breast-fed MTV lies! I mean My Chemical Romance covering the Misfits?! That is absolutely ridiculous! And Emanuel did the impossible, and made a Stooges song sound completely lame. As for the album cover, that is the most f***ed up, cheesiest thing they did. Tony Hawk makes a complete joke of a high-caliber band such as the Clash.

Also, if you're going to go with emo and pop punk groups, why not pick AFI to do a Misfits cover? They did start out as a Misfits cover band... Hopefully, a kid or two follows up on some of the groups that inspired these covers and learns about how great they were/are, what it means to be 'straightedge', what a dogtown is, et al.

These covers are the worst covers I have ever heard. They are devoid of anything that makes them worthwhile for covers. The bands all tune their guitars to sound like the originals but they don't have the standout voices that the originals had. The only exceptions are the Dropkick Murphys and Hot Snakes. Those two make this album worthy of one star. Personally I like Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day and several others on this cd, but they don't understand that a cover is supposed to be your sound and interpretation of the song. Let's face it, the original musicality of these bands was fairly low. The things that made them stand out were the fact that this was a new kind of music and they all had such interesting vocals. These covers use the same music that these guys used twenty years ago with throwaway vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm with Jake on this one","review":"I know Sony has to pimp their bands, but gimme a break.

The result is something they were both very pleased with & which neither could have composed on his own.

The play takes place in 1960s Algeria during a struggle for independence from France. This is an excellent collaboration for Glass, but there are a couple of Suso's contributions I could live without. For me Glass's The French Lieutenant's Dream is the highlight of the CD. Like most of the composition it is delicate and ephemeral. Good quality headphones are recommended here, as should be with most of Glass's work now that I think of it.

I was told that you needed to buy a VGA cable for the best picture but mine actually looked better with the component cables. The next test was to watch a regular DVD on it and I was impressed that as well. I played Mission Impossible III on my regular DVD player and then in the 360 HD player and could tell a BIG difference.

Gamming was already stunning but adding this HD DVD drive for only $200 has resulted in a fantastic movie experience.

In fact, I have a Blu-Ray player for all the great new releases and use the HD DVD for older catalog titles. For instance, why pay $20 for \\"Casino\\" on Blu-Ray when you can get it for $1 online on HD DVD? With the Xbox 360 Elite, all you have to do is plug in the HD DVD player, no install disc needed (if your connected to Xbox Live). And, if your Xbox is connected to the TV via HDMI, you get full 1080p picture! The Xbox HD DVD Player is one item all High Def and Video Gaming enthusiasts should have.

That's 3/4 of the Hollywood movies, so I bought a blu-ray player which does play them all. No thanks, this was a clunky piece of junk. If you have spent money on a good hdtv, buy a blu-ray player. If you have spent money on a decent stereo system, buy a blu-ray player, most movies have uncompressed sound and sound alot better because blu-ray discs have 20gb more space, less compression for audio and picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"We did an \\"Office Space\\" beat down on this junk.","review":"Having to download constant updates to make your Microsoft Windows product work properly may be acceptable for an internet connected computer, but a HD-DVD player?

It is a pain for me to have to go to internet via my computer and burn a disc for my Xbox 360 HD DVD player everytime there is an update that is required to make the newest HD disc play. I have had to do this 3 times for this product. Add to these woes that it doesn't even have basic functions that we have come to take for granted in a dvd player (such as slow motion, frame by frame steps forward and back,etc).

Only way for me is to open and close the HD trey.2- Once I power on the system with the remote control again the movie wont start no matter what button I press on the remote it goes to the guide which is correct but wtf?

When I try to play a regular dvd I get this loud annoying beeping noise for about 6 seconds. I'm sure it would be a great product if it worked, but it doesn't. This is why I usually don't buy from online stores. Because now they can't replace it because they are out of stock until october.

There is no real replay value once you've finished the game.

How do you accumulate points? By picking up garbage and throwing it in trash cans! Wow this is fun! Or collecting letters that make up the name Universal Studios Theme Park. My daughter and I played for about half and hour and finally gave up. It was dull, boring, and frustrating. We had more fun making fun of the game than playing it.

This was exactly what I hoped for: I can take quick photos inside and out, dock the thing, transfer to the software with one touch, modify the photos, and email to grandpa/granma. It will make me get DSL service to speed the emails on their way.Photos are sharp and the detail is just fine or better.I got a 128 storage card from my son for XMAS, and it is terrific. Overall battery life seems fine and the camera traveled to and from Florida easily. Software installation went fine, AFTER I got smart and turned off the Norton junk beforehand. I have 2000 Pro. Only quibble: got to use their dock. On the other hand: seamless activity for the everyday user."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bet you can't find a better digicam in picture quality","review":"...You can't imagine this DX3900, a cheaper model, is even better than my DX4800, 1st winner in picture quality by PC World for many months this year. I've taken 271 pictures (LCD panel off) with the lithium battery (equivalent to 2 AA batteries) included in the package and it is still going strong. I'm a picky person and I seldom give anything a five-star rating, but this Kodak has simply overwhelmed me. Now you have to have a professional medium-format traditional camera to beat this Kodak. I bet you can't find a better digital camera in picture quality at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this camera from Amazon...","review":"and you will feel like you got a great deal. The price here is the best I've seen. As for the camera's functionality, I'd rate it a 9 out of 10. The pictures are really, really nice. I cant imagine why anyone aside from a very serious professional would want more out of a camera. The photos dont have a very wide angle, and the software is a bit \\"to simple\\" (I think they designed it to be totally user friendly, but for anyone with a good handle on using the computer might desire more features),but dont let that stop you. You'll use Image Expert or something similiar to spice up your pics anyway. It was my second digital camera. My first was an Olympus in the same price group. This beats my old one hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor after service","review":"I have had this camera for about a year now--and suddenly the LCD screen that shows the pictures went blank.I tried calling kodak help--but only after multiple attempts was I able to speak to a live person--who quite frankly said \\"it will cost you $150 to even get it looked at--you are better off buying a new one\\"!!I for one, did not shell out all that money on a camera that goes dead in 14 months.I will buy another camera--only it will definetly not be Kodak.very .... off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this camera","review":"I got this camera for Christmas and I absolutely love it. I had a Kodak DC 215 and it was a great camera but the pictures on this camera are fantastic. It is easy to use but lots of options if you want to use. The pictures are clear and sharp. The price you cannot beat either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Cheap Cheap","review":"Stay away if you want quality and durability. The discontinued Kodak DC280 is a much much better camera than this sad piece ... I don't mean to be so harsh but I was really disappointed when this camera arrived in the mail. The covers and doors open by just brushing them accidently - it's slow, the LCD screen is no better than the earlier models and actually a little worse. I know now that for an upgrade from my older Kodak I will have to go with another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is everything so red","review":"SO I have had this camera for a year and anything that has red in it is intensified, people look like drunks with splotchness and when I use it for work the products look much redder that they really are. The only way, I have found to get rid of it is to use ACDC to modify the photos what a time consuming affair. Other than that it is really simple to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong camera - wrong price","review":"I bought this camera two months ago. The pictures are a good quality...except the battery life is horrible. It will only take one set of pictures ( 4 or 5) before the battery goes DEAD. I have contacted Kodak about this problem and their solutions to it are to have it serviced by their representitives. I paid OVER ($$$) for the camers and docking station.....and it has to be fixed???? It also claims that leaving the camera in the docking staion charges the batteries....WRONG.....their technical people said that it actually drains the battery if left in there too long. Well, what good is it???? When the battery goes dead...it will not trasfer pictures through the docking station. All in all it is poor quality with horrible customer service. Try another company for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never again buy a Kodak product","review":"While this camera takes superb pictures for the price, the associated software is terrible. To make matters worse, customer service is virtually nonexistent.To anyone thinking of purchasing a Kodak product, I would recommend attempting to reach somebody via customer service, or I would recommend attempting to email kodak customer service, just to test accessibility.My recommendation for anyone looking at this camera, or any Kodak digital camera, is to pay a little extra and get something of higher quality, like a Canon. In the long run, you'll get much more out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise","review":"I bought this in a hurry. I was saving for a Sony CDR-300, and my sister went in to labor, and I was in charge of new baby pics. THis was the nicest camera I could afford at the store. As it turns out it was a great investment. It took me about 5 minutes to learn, and the Included Li battery pack lasted for about 350+ pictures and a lot of time using the LCD, which usually kills stuff on most other cameras I have used. I would lastly like to reemphasize that it took me all of 12 seconds to learn, and with XP the camera interface solved itself, I bought it two weeks ago, and still haven't installed the software. Woohoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera but...","review":"This is my first digital camera and I have to say I'm impressed so far. It's great for my wife, who isn't near the tech weenie I am. At the press of a button, she can charge the battery, download pictures, and initialize the memory card.My only complaint is with the battery (or so I think). I can charge the battery all night, put it in the camera, and the camera will not turn on. If I turn it off and on several times (when this happens), the camera will eventually turn on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best value in 3+megapixel photography-Kodak DX3900","review":"I have owned 3 digital cameras, and purchased them for work as well. I can honestly say that this is by far the best. It is small, light, has more than enough features, is the simplest to download with its port, and can equal cameras costing twice as much in picture quality. You cannot get more value in a digital camera today. Keep up the great work Kodak!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"Easy to use, takes great pictures, and with the docking station makes transferring images simple. I love this camera. I use it for my business to document contracting work and it does the job.If you just want to take excellent pictures without a lot of fuss, Buy it! If you want fiddle and be a pro buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Kodak","review":"I purchased a DX 3900 in June 2002. By November, I had to send it in to have the status lcd board replaced. By July 2003, the lens cap was no longer retracting, but by then it was off warranty. The support was not very helpful either. Overall, my experience was that this was a poor quality product, and I wouldn't purchase any of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the DX3900","review":"We bought this camera because we had purchased a Kodak DC215 about 2 years ago and have taken over 3000 wonderful pictures with it. We wanted to upgrade from our 1 megapixel to this 3 megapixel to have better quality enlarged prints. Boy were we disappointed! Unless you're in bright light - outside, the pictures are blurry and grainy. We tested shots with our old camera and this new one and our old Kodak took great pictures. We were able to return the DX3900 by showing the store prints from each camera. We purchased a Minolta S404 and took it on vacation to Colorado. We now have beautiful mountain prints and even the low light pictures are clear - not grainy and blurry. If you want to upgrade - I would recommend the Minolta very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"We bought this camera about 6 months ago when our daughter was born and are thrilled with the pictures. We use Shutterfly.com to get prints and people can not believe that they were taken with digital. The dock is a great accessory and one of the reason I bought the camera. We do not have to worry about hooking up cables and charging batteries. Just drop it in the dock and you never have to worry about it. The one knock I do have against this camera is the battery life. I have a 64 MB CompactFlash card, which give me a total of about 64 pictures. At around 25 - 30 pictures that battery is nearly dead. So, just cary some extra batteries. Highly recommend for picture quality and easy of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor long term performance","review":"When I first got my Kodak DX3900 camera, I was pretty happy. Yes, the memory card is too small, but otherwise it seemed to have all of the features I was looking for. The first few photos looked pretty good as well. However, with continued use, the camera simply doesn't perform. After taking only about 30 photos, the camera now refuses to take any more photos, and those last few photos were out of focus and either over or under exposed. Changing batteries helps for a short while, but even using CRV3 lithium batteries rather than AA's, after a very short while the camera refusues to perform other than to let you see the few photos you've already taken. I'm not aware of other cameras that consume battery power like this, so my plan is to get rid of this camera and buy a new one soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring cocktail party more like.","review":"I only bought this book because I read on the BBC that the Gallagher brothers from Oasis were thinking of doing a film based on the book, I paid $25 dollars for it as it was a collectors item and it was in my opinion a big waste of money. The book is badly written and very dull, my advice don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves it","review":"i got this when i was pregnant for my son ..and had it all the time he loves it because its soft he is now 2years old and still likes it to sleep"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best about Domingo","review":"This is the best book regarding Placido Domingo's career, character and musical abilities, which are considerable. Highly recommended for any fan if you can find a copy of it. Mine is autographed and I consider it priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie is so entertaining that I thought the book would be even better. Not so! I found it very disappointing and would not recommend it..... First time I can say this about a book/film comparison. The book lacked the humor and fun of the movie and was just too serious (for me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Palmer is brilliant","review":"As something of a freelance poet, Michael Palmer is someone I've turned to for inspiration. I don't know any pseudo-intellectual words to describe it, but his manipulation of words and ability to touch people with even really abstract work astounds me. He moves me. For an example of some of the brilliant work in this collection, try looking at \\"The Sun\\" online. (...)P.S. Who is the moron that copied and pasted rave reviews but didn't star them? It really deflated the score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"A powerful collection of three sermons directed at current and future pastors, Taylor discusses the role of a pastor in the church and society. She accurately describes the hot oil feeling of interpreting the Word of God for receptive and unreceptive ears. And she details the awkwardness of that relationship when the pastor feels the well of communication has dried. A must read for anyone who preaches or seeks a conversational relationship with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to know this before you buy","review":"As a beginning teacher I found many, many tips to help me make the classroom experience challenging and fun for my students. Therefore, the content is worth the price of the book.However, what I object to is saying that the book is 183 pages. Each 5-1/2\\" by 8\\" page has a quick tip (many times including a fairly large cartoon illustration) and the back of each page is blank with the word \\"Notes\\" on it to justify not printing information on it. This cuts the book down to about 30 pages of usable information (this is not an exaggeration!) Also, on my copy the spiral binding was so tight and excessively glued, that I actually tore pages off the spiral binding trying to turn to the next page.It is a shame that the publisher let this author down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for both new and old teachers","review":"My co-op teacher during my field work recommended this book to me because it was quick, sensical, and effective. I borrowed the book for a couple nights before I decided to purchase it. The other four-star reviewer is correct in saying the information contained in this book could be boiled down to a succint thirty pages or-so. But don't let that confuse you, this is a valuable aid.A lot of the ideas here are common sense solutions. There are some creative classroom managment ideas as well. Sometimes this book comes in handy just to curb your occsional frustration. I plan on keeping this book by my desk at all times, in preperation for those days where your mind just doesn't fire correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the seasoned teacher","review":"I read where the book's length was exaggerated since the information was only printed on one side. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Turns out the blank pages were as disappointing as advertised. Every once in a while there is something to make the seasoned teacher pause and think, however most of it leaves one wondering where on earth \\"that\\" would be acceptable, much less allowed.After reading through it, letting a colleague do the same, and then discussing it, it strikes me as something a university dust bunny wrote who has no concept of what does (or can) go on in a real school setting. It might be tempting for a newbie to invest in, but don't waste your time (or $). Go find the folks that have a good reputation for classroom management and reaching kids (does not mean the ones the kids like). Listen to them, copy what you can, steal the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is a perfect example of an OK idea presented in a bad medium. Had the author chosen to make this a web site or a magazine article, I don't think anyone would object to the rudimentary information provided within. Instead, the author presents 100 \\"hacks\\" comprised entirely of overviews on quickly-dating shareware and freeware downloads, as well as step by step instructions on how to use the intrinsic Windows dialogs to change properties and settings. Little presented here could not be as easily discovered by Googling \\"Windows XP tips tricks\\", browsing popular computer magazines, or using the internal Help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of errors","review":"It seems like no one edited or tech edited this book. From the start, where he talks about putting 'huskies' (they are wolves) as his boot screen to the bootvis problem already discussed, to numerous other technical errors, this book is not up to snuff to the rest of the hacks books.I didn't even try half the registry hacks because if he can't get some very basic information right, am I certain I want to trust someone with more detailed, specific information?Very poorly edited, very poorly researched book, and not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't improve your skills much","review":"I bought the book even after reading previous reviews. Oh well. If you have any knowledge of Windows and it's functionality and want to improve on those skills, this book won't do it. It's all about tools and utilities you can download or purchase, and how to use those programs. Not much insite into Windows built in tools and better ways of using them. I did think the host files and DNS section could be helpful, but as a previous poster said, you can find tips like that on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Not \\"Geek\\" Enough","review":"I have to confess. I am just not \\"Geek\\" enough to fully appreciate this book. And while I have used Windows XP for years and have taught Windows usage, I found that there was only a couple of things in the book that I could actually use. Yes there was a wealth of information for those who dream of things to do to their Window's registry. And yes you can find lots of stuff to do to Windows XP that will make your little \\"geekie\\" heart go pitty-pat. But for this advanced computer -jockey, I'll just stay on the side-lines playing with the Power Toys for Windows XP Tweak UI program, the one program I found in the book that I felt I could use without blowing up my computer, and be glad I didn't do any damage to my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Great Advanced Tips","review":"I know my way around XP pretty well, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. What I found was great: dozens and dozens of hacks, tips, downloads and help. I wish this book had more than 100 hacks, because every one teaches me something. I hope the author comes out with a second edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!

It does everything from light crunch, to Marshall-style thick rhythms, to all out face-melting distortion.Rich harmonics, near infinite sustain, and a mid-range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal.This pedal has not left my board since the day I bought it. The fact that it's built like a tank ensures it's going to be around a long time after my playing days are over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good anymore..","review":"This is the chinese version of the ProCo Rat. The build quality is quite the same as previews versions. However the original RAT featured the LM308 chip which has been now replaced in this version of the RAT. Also, if you have seen some of the most recent versions of the American made RAT, the knobs and logo used to glow in the dark but that's not happening either anymore, of course, that's not big deal, but it used to be really handy because you can see your pedal better while playing in the dark. I found the sound to be a lot different from the vintage versions. I ended up selling this pedal on craigslist and upgraded to an older one for a few more bucks on Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foreign Castles built in the Faculty Lounge","review":"Bruce Cumming's long campaign against American \\"imperialism\\" has led him to embrace the Kim dynasty in North Korea. It is, afterall, the most virulent opponent of U.S. policy (though Iran is vying for that title, having more resources available to play at that game and weaker neighbors to bully). Like other academics during the Cold War and Maoist eras, Cummings had built foreign castles fit only to be viewed in the faculty lounge. He, of course, prefers to live in the United States where he can enjoy all the comforts offered as chair of the History Department at the University of Chicago. It is the wealth of \\"imperialist\\" states like ours that make career postions like his sustainable.

When a 40 year old mechanic, Georges, whistles at Isabelle's cousin, Isabelle falls madly totally in love with Georges. She starts stalking him, desperate for his attention. She even goes to the trouble of running off Georges' adult girlfriend, several times. This movie has scenes of total hilarity as Isabelle messes with the girlfriend and misfires while trying to seduce a cop on a crowded subway car. I would recommend this movie to the parents of daughters as a cautionary tale. One huge surprise is that there is no nudity in this French flick, which is surprising for a French love story. I would even go so far as to rate this movie PG-10, meaning that kids over ten can watch this movie with parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is about a famous american hero","review":"A great story about my dad.

So, it gets four stars. I read it pretty fast, but not 5-star fast... I don't agree with the people that commented that the book was disjointed. Though at times the author digresses to future time periods, these digressions are always relevant to the time periods discussed.I learned a lot from this book about the Balkan/Ottoman history. It's not extremely extremely detailed, which was good for an introductory Balkan reader.What I was disappointed in was, for the description of the 1912-1913 Balkan wars, the author really needed to provide maps.

I feel I was falsely led to believe that this video is largely about lesbian vampires when in fact it's only that one scene.

It also gives us a very good snapshot of the way people thought and how, you are defined by the class of your birth and how difficult it was to change. There is also uncertainty as to which house Hervey used as a muse and central charater of this book. Something worth a return trip, just to sleuth it out. I thought it was out of print, so I was very happy to find this paperback available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockabilly Retrospective","review":"If you long for a return to the pre-glitz simple days of rockabilly, country, western (before Country Western), swing and pop, this collection is the answer. In addition to the CDs there is a printed history with photos telling the story of LIN and KLIFF records, all covering the l950s through 1960s.The musical themes are traditional: love, heartbreak and infidelity, plus a sprinkling of humor and tenderness for your listening pleasure. If you are familiar with and appreciate this genre, no further explanation is necessary. Just order it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JOANNE WOODWARD IS VERY GOOD IN THIS DRAMA","review":"I saw this film when it first came out, and I just got it on DVD today.

The plot wanders. I don't have the book in front of me (I got rid of it), so I can't remember the details, but I seem to recall that Raggedy Ann and Andy set out to discover something related to a tree with golden rings on it at the beginning of the story, and then that part of the book is seemlingly forgotten by the author. There are two very similar villains -- one repents of his evil ways part way through the book, so Gruelle replaces him with a villain who acts pretty much the same. The illustrator (another Gruelle, not Johnny) actually illustrates one character two different ways. Really, this is one of the worst children's books I've ever read. Gruelle must have been tired of the series, and the editor didn't care enough to do his or her job. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for used book","review":"This book was great read.

Jumps from one area of California to another, the video gives each place a cursory overview, lasting about one minute each.

From the novice to the experienced user, Real World Adobe GoLive 5 is the book to have. The chapters supply useful information that can save time and increase one's productivity. Real World Adobe GoLive 5 is very through (e.g., the section on GoLive inspectors is 90 pages long)! Real World Adobe GoLive 5 covers everything from the basics to site management.

It is a sham. This album is not a \\"lost classic\\" from 1967. If someone today set out to create a bona fide knockoff of 60's psych and was convincing about it, I would enjoy it. However, nothing about this record sounds as though it is of the psychedelic era. It is empty contemporary corporate hard rock. A flourish of sitar is not enough convince a psych fan. The melodies are garbage, none of the sounds even bother to approximate actual psychedelia, and the vocals are bar-band tough guy, which isn't very trippy. I was sorely disappointed when I bought this by accident when I was trying to aquire work by the 70's psych/folk/rock band Unicorn (who was sometimes produced by David Gilmour). Unfortunately, I did not do enough research into that band to find out what their albums looked like and were titled, and ended up with this insult to my sensibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Triceratons are back, and this time they're invading Earth!","review":"Prime Leader Zanrumon still has his sights set on the Fugitoid, and now he's planning a massive invasion of Earth to find him.

Along with the groovy headlines, the author cleverly uses stills from classic and not-so classic flicks (Cleopatra, Salome etc.) to illustrate your favorite historical figures. Abraham, Rasputin, Joan of Arc are some celebs described in wonderful mini-articles. These articles' trashiness, yet relatively good knowledge of historical detail, set me into wild fits of giggling.

It only handles 5 pages of regular stock paper and that only works (very slowly) if you put them in at an exact right angle. If even one piece of paper gets caught at an angle the whole system freezes up and you have to reverse or rip and cut out pieces of stray paper. It's true that staples go right through the shredder without a problem, but it's the consistent jamming that really made me nuts. Plus, the shredder sits precariously on top of the basket, so if you don't align it just right on top of the basket, it falls in - its heavy. Really search around for a good shredder and make sure it shreds at least ten sheets of paper at a time.

But the audio version of Deadly Housewives was terrible. While the stories could have been interesting, they were painful to listen to, especially those read by Henrietta Tiefenthaler. Why would they select a narrator who talks with a lisp? At first, I thought she was just trying to get into the character she was \\"playing\\" by slurring her speech as if stoned.

Nothing remedied this problem - no matter how close or how far away you were standing from the TV. I ended up going to the store and buying another Mission Paintball game and had the same FRUSTRATING results. We tried the original and second paintball units on other TVs but the same problems persisted.How annoying and disappointing for me and especially for my son who was so excited to get this toy and just HAD to have it.

Clicking on the letters ABCD to build your first player name would show on the screen YOUA or any other odd creation. Never what you were spelling.Trying to get it to click 'accept' also was a losing proposition. The Accept would highlight in yellow but go no further. Cancel, accept, letters. Nothing worked.

Evidently there seems to be a problem with some of the baking recipes. His Panettone recipe calls for 3 oz or 6 packages of active dry yeast. At 2 1/4 tsp per package this would equal 13 1/2 tsp of yeast, which is enough to make about 20+ loaves of bread. I checked four other recipes and they show the same problem, way too much yeast. Also the directions are confusing. You soak raisins in one cup of milk and then drain them. The recipe doesn't say to keep the drained milk or not. It turn out that you do need some of it. The ampunt remaining would depend on how dry and/or how large the raisins are. Also, the egg wash should have a little water in it and not be straight egg yolk.

The first three quarters of the book move right along, not too many characters, neatly divided between the good and the bad, and a clear if somewhat simple plot. Then, when the story is set for a nice (if perhaps unimaginative) finish, suddenly a lot of complications are thrown in as if the writer forgot his 101 writing class (open story: main character suddenly in trouble and has to do something to get out of trouble, take it from there till main character is out of trouble). From then on there is to much trouble for JOAT to do anything about it, nothing makes sense, everybody does just the opposite of what they promised to do and JOAT is thrown back and forth like a rag dol, boom, fortunately she lands in the black, somehow (how?).

While it was a little disappointing not to be about a brainship, it had great potential.

However, despite meeting the likeable characters from the first book again, this one was a disappointment. It started well enough, but the end fell through completely. I felt cheated and even went back to see if I'd got a faulty copy with pages missing!The tension builds up, the characters are all in trouble, separated and discovered by the enemy and the next thing is that the heroine wakes up and all the action is OVER!

In this book, Mr. Dalcour defines the biblical doctrine of the Holy Trinity. He also defines the Oneness view in both historical context and today's version of modalism. His exegesis of the Holy writ is that of a scholar, his passion is that of someone who loves Truth, and wants that share with others. So many great features of this book. Mr. Dalcour looks at the great church fathers, on their view of the Godhead, which was the Trinity. Mr. Dalcour also refutes the main man in Oneness pentecostal today, David Bernard. In the end, this book not only defines oneness theology, but teaches you the Trinity. It is two books in one if you will. The last chapter contains something about the Trinity, about how to discuss the Trinity and show Christians that when they first believe in Jesus, they belived in the Trinity. A Classic indeed.Great Work Mr. Dalcour."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent discussion on this heresy!","review":"I own three anti-Oneness books. This is by far, the best of the three. It compares the distorted, twisted logic of the Oneness (UPCI) viewpoint and its founders with what the ORIGINAL Greek and Hebrew Spirit-led authors wrote as being the ordained voice of God. It also shows without any doubt, the veracity of the Trinity so that all who doubt it fall far short in their belief. Mr. Dalcour uses Scriptural references, point by point, to prove out what God said, not what someone \\"thought\\" He meant to say, or might have planned to say. Simple, easy to understand what the Gospel says.Mr. Dalcour offers up a wealth of citations easily verified. He offers historical, theological, apoligetical and Biblical proof...the exact proof that anyone needs to be shown that there IS indeed a Trinitarian God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question and answer session","review":"In his preface, James explains that his reason for writing this book was to answer the \\"many questions and of the kind that's been asked of me often.\\" Although packaged in the guise of a story, UNCLE BILL manages to be little more than a question and answer book-and only slightly more entertaining.The premise is simple: two city children, Scootie and Kip Powers, come west to visit their cattleman uncle for a summer. Their uncle, being busy with ranch affairs, turns the kids over to an old cowpuncher known as \\"Uncle Bill\\" (no relation). Uncle Bill hauls the kids all across the range, teaching them to ride, rope, and take care of themselves. Although a few of Uncle Bill's stories are amusing, his unending instructive speeches have a decidedly didactic feel.I rather doubt that even children would find this story entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters","review":"This could be a simple, ... book about a teacher seducing his vulnerable, 15-year-old student. Sure, Russell included graphic ... in this story, but ...isn't what this first-class novel is about. \\"The Coming Storm\\" is compelling reading because the characters are so well drawn. You watch those characters make their choices, knowing almost every choice is wrong. But you can't stop wishing the disaster you can see ahead -- but the characters don't -- could be avoided. You know it can't. And so, like a gawker at an accident, you are drawn into the watching the carnage. It's powerful and will leave you with plenty to think about. I'm recommending it to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throughly enjoyable","review":"I bought this book on a hunch that it would be a good read. I was right. I was a little put off at first by the taboo subject addressed (Student/Teacher relationships). Especially since I have a 16 year old son! But the author presents the material in a sensitive way that made it quite believable. The book is written from different characters perspectives. This was annoying at times, and I have to agree with other reviews that this was distracting. Sometimes I wished that the story was told strictly from Tracy's perspective. Overall though, I really liked the story and the characters were richly drawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"finally finished it","review":"I received this book for x mas from my partner on a recommendation from the reviews on amazon. its now July .. and try as i might, i am still on chapter 3. i think the main problem is, Russell tried too hard with too many words to draw the charactersOK finally finished the book on august. This was one of the longest, dullest reads I have ever had. I didn't care about the characters in the slightest. I was looking forwards to this book, but I was greatly disappointed. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, obvious, 2-dimensional fairy tale...","review":"I really TRIED to like this book, but in the end, it was impossible. I was hoping for a little depth, a little insight, a little of the sexual tension that's so clear in other classic prep-school novels to which The Coming Storm has inevitably been compared.There are a couple of promising relationships established here, but their potential is never realized. This book is characterized mostly by lost opportunity, as the potential for character and situational depth gives way to simplistic stereotyping that could just as easily have been composed by a homophobe as by one within the fold.Obviously, St Martin's Press (a/k/a Stonewall Inn Editions, their queer imprint) has no problem promoting mediocrity. I just hate to think of all the talented gay writers who are having a tough time breaking in while this ditzy author and his fluff novel gets all the glory.P.S. What dimwit picked this title? Did anyone else find it utterly telegraphic and inane???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, tiresome, and infuriating","review":"I will not deny that Russell has talent with his words. However, just past the halfway mark through the novel I became so angered by the plot (extremely slow and ponderous up until mid-book) and the characters that I threw the book across the room and never opened it again. In fact, I tossed it. No recycling, no used book store. The trash heap. I felt he had created characters that he hoped we would care about and then, when it became clear he had grown bored with the story and their roles, made them into masochistic icons. If you are bothered by unsafe sex, especially with the notion of \\"bug-chasers\\" this book will hurt you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and dark book","review":"funny that the reader who gave this book one star became so wrapped up in the one aspect of this novel that could be seen as \\"controversial\\" and loses sight of all of the wonderful narratives Russell manages to capture in this sprawling and well-executed work. This is a web of stories and experiences that is rich with metaphor and love. And despite the central relationship between teacher and student, the real \\"titillation\\" here is between the author's prose and the reader's eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shcoking!","review":"Loved this book. It is filled with twists, and horrible revelations. Some of the implications and revelations that you read are never made aware to the characters they effect!

Pitch = Dead Poets Society plus My Own Private Idaho.It would be bad enough if Russell stuck to telling the story of an elicit sexual relationship between a student and his gay teacher. Scandal makes good prose. However, the author insists we should approve of these activities. In fact, it is possible to come away from this book thinking (as Dennis Drabelle from the Washington Post did)that the affair between teen and teacher a beneficial academic experience. Or as my friends from National Review put it: \\"So there you have it: Pedophilia is good for your grades!\\" When any culture (prep-schools included) removes strong negative sanction from purient sexual activity, it is the vulnerable who suffer, mostly women and children. I suppose this is a victory for sexual liberaation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Coming Storm","review":"First off, let me say I loved Sea of Tranquility. So Iapproached this new novel as a fan, excited to read it. But once intoit, I was instantly bogged down in prose that seems tired, at best. Every scrap of dialogue, line by line most of the time, is glued down with reflections, reactions, ruminations, memories, allusions, wispy sexual fantasies, subplots, or (sometimes even \\"and\\") snide rejoinders. It takes pages and pages of overwrought, adjective-laden prose just to get there. I am not one for Grisham-style speed. But I would like the plot, hackneyed and tired as it is, to move a little faster. After all, from the start, we know where this thing's going. Sure, you can get on the interstate and go somewhere you've been before. You can even take some of the turn-offs.

Catherine Robbin and Anthony Rolfe-Johnson are particularly fine in Death where is thy Sting.His best, though, is the Amen. It is deeply felt and intelligently planned. The sopranos are especially silky and elegant, in part because Gardiner had the musicianship to use adult females rather than bow to the current obsession with historicity and use boys. Only weakness here is the trumpet sound, which is dramatic but dull and out of tune. Modern trumpets, as always, would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rendition of Handel's Messiah","review":"While I don't claim to be a trained music critic, I am a performer who appreciates fine music that is properly interpreted and performed. I carefully read a number of critical reviews of Handel's Messiah as performed by various conductors and orchestras. I chose John Eliot Gardiner's interpretation as conductor over the several others I reviewed and heard, simply because I thought his work was most representative of how Handel himself intended it to be performed. I was NOT disappointed; in fact, I am quite pleased in all respects. The vocalists are top-notch, the pace is correct, and the message of the Messiah comes alive in this performance. I don't hesitate in recommending that you add this CD to your classical collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fusion pioneer on autopilot","review":"Too much of this sounds (as another reviewer aptly describes it) like \\"Fu-zak\\": bland and hummable but ultimately unmemorable.

I was reminded of that several times while listening to this...)Only sporadically did songs from this one jump out at me (\\"Time Track\\" and the title track are 2 of the better cuts) and several cuts (\\"Flamingo\\" is a case in point) were downright yawners. There's no question these are fine players and that Corea himself was critical to the formation of jazz-rock fusion as a member of Return to Forever but this just doesn't excite me.BOTTOM LINE:I'm at a loss as to why I bought this one now that I listen to it years after purchase. Definitely one to skip.

This shipment (and I trust that the other 11 boxes are the same) was truly what it claimed (a pleasure). On the other hand, the packaging wasn't up to par. Many products today use a laudable packaging technique which provides the buyer with a means of locking the package closed, and this package is no exception.

At once humorous, insightful, satisfying, and, above all, REAL, Karin Cook's first novel explores the complexity of mother-daughter and sister-sister relationships. But even if you have neither a mother nor a sister, this book is a great read. It is a book to be literally devoured, and be sure to leave yourself some time to cry and reflect when you finish it. Believe me, you will need to. The second I shut the book, I ran to my mom's room, crawled into bed with her, and simply breathed in her scent and aura. If you don't live with your mom, this book will definitely make you run to the phone and call her. I HIGHLY recommend buying a copy for yourself, and one for a good friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"This book was oustanding! You can definitely learn from this book.

Cook takes the reader to the mind of Tilden, and allows the reader to experience Tildens pain, love, curiousness and more. HIGHLY RECOMENDED for adolescents!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending","review":"I feel that the ending of the book was well writen, but the last chapter of the book was unnecessary. I felt that the chapter Procession held enough closure to end the book with the reader felling satisfied. In Procession Elizabeth ends the rivaling sisterhood by explaining to Tilden that she doesn't really hate her. There is an unspoken understanding and settling peace between them now. The chapter ended the same way that the book started, with the two girls being together. However, in Memory, new issues are brought up about Tilden being depressed and not sure how she is going to handle her problems without her mom. It felt that after all their issues were resolved, Tilden regresses by restating that she was still upset. I think that the novel would have been better if the chapter Memory had been edited out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diffrent","review":"This book is a lot diffrent from the books that I have read.

They learn hard lessons along the way, especually when there mom comes down with a serious cancer and has to try to battle it off and raise the girls at the same time.Its a very heart warming story that does have its bad points in it that are a little disturbing. This does show how a sister realtionship is now, and it shows how single mothers struggle, even if they do re-marry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"This is one of two books I've read in my life that made my heart twist.

Once I got into the story itself then I relized that I am liking the book more and more. The author does a great job of ending one scean and going right into the next scean. The book does have its flows, like the mother didn't marry Nick right away but you realize that she is doing it for a purpose to make sure this is the MAN that she wants to spend the rest of her short life with. You will laugh and you will cry but overall it is a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Which chapter is the real end","review":"After reading this book I have realized that there is actually two different endings. The last two chapters could both be the ending to the book. The book would still have the same effect even if one of these chapter was cut out. I think that the chapter \\"Procession\\" is a better fit ending to this book. I think that it is a better ending because it ends with all three of them driving and being together. In the begining of the book we see how the three of them are very close and always together. So this chapter actually puts some closure to her death and the girls realize that they are going to be on their own. This chapter shows tham dealing with their mom's death and how they are going to have to go on with each other and without their mom. This ending is better than the chapter \\"Memory\\" because memory is almostr like an epilogue and it shows the girls a few years down the road. It doesn't put actual closure to their mom's death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom in anguish and hilarity in sibling rivalry","review":"In this debut novel Cook integrates keen social observation with deep empathy for her protagonist. She accomplishes this through the often wise, always shortsighted eyes of an adolescent girl. The warm glow that surrounds the family composed of Tilden, her glamorous younger sister, and their mother at times threatens to cross the dangerous line into the maudlin but Cook skillfully draws us back into the central tragedy of the story--Tilden's mom has cancer. It is testament to the deft storytelling that we can know this fact all along, guess the ending, and yet desperately hope that Tilden and her sister aren't devastated. The wisdom Cook finds in anguish and the hilarity in sibling rivalry make this a profoundly affecting story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate","review":"I cannot believe what I read here.

The Bartimaeus books are at the top of our list, wonderful characters, original plots, and unique historical what-if-magicians-ruled background. Good reading, and we're eager for the third book; and waiting for some filmmaker to decide to make great movies from these books, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story, unevenly written.","review":"Throughout the book, Stroud chooses to muddle first and third person. This is done only in the sections told from the perspective of Bartimaeus (the demon), who will speak as 'I' and then speak of 'the guinea pig' or 'the bat', Bartimeaeus _being_ (at that point in the narrative) the guinea pig or the rat. It is disconcerting, and repeatedly jolts the reader into full awareness that he or she is reading an awkwardly written piece of text. This makes it impossible to remain immersed in the story -- which is a pity, because Stroud's world is a fascinating one.Another thing that struck me as unfortunate is that Nathaniel, far from becoming more multidimensional as a character, is losing complexity. Bartimaeus, on the other hand, is being given new facets.I hold hope for the third book in the trilogy. Perhaps, by the time that one is written, Stroud will have found an editor who can help him to decide between first-person usage and third."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golem's Eye","review":"I was looking forward to this book, since I thoroughly enjoyed the first in the series. I'm happy to see so many great reviews. The writing was wonderful and strong. I just didn't think it was as good as the first one. Bartemus's character is wonderfully put together and it is easy for the reader to see that he is wise (how can he not be with all those years behind him). Unfortunately, Nat has is growing to become snobbish and conceited. I wished for a bit more action and flow of writing, which is why I gave it four instead of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but slower than \\"Amulet\\"","review":"My children and I enjoyed this book. However, the pace of the book is slower than the \\"Amulet of Samarkand.\\" Mr. Stroud spends the first half of the book describing and filling in past events of the story, unlike \\"Samarkand\\" in which he allowed the actions of the story characters to reveal the necessary story backfill.Finally, the story resolution was enjoyable but the character motivations upon which the resolution was based were not presented well earlier in the book. It left my children and I with a sense of flatness, unlike the well crafted resolution/ending in \\"Samarkand.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've read in a while!","review":"Fun and witty, this entire series is one of my favorites. I haven't enjoyed the humor in a book as much as I have from this series since I first read Pawn of Prophecy. Darker than the Belgariad by David Eddings, this series is well written and filled with flawed characters you can't help but want to knock some sense into...much like the djinn, Bartimaeus, wants to. If you only read one book from this list, it should be either this one or the first from the Bartimaeus Trilogy, The Amulet of Samarkand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarcastic humor at its finest","review":"As with The Amulet of Samarkand, the book's main demon, Bartimaeus, steals the show with his hilariously sarcastic humor. His sarcastic wit alone makes this book worth reading.Moreover, the complicated plot and use of a very sympathetic character, Kitty, made this book even more enjoyable than the first in the trilogy. As with the first book, the author's intertwining of real places and historical figures with fantasy - such as Golems in Prague and a demon whose essence is fused with the skeleton of William Gladstone - makes for very interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing, fun plot and interesting charcaters","review":"Ditto for the first novel in the series. (The djinni is so much fun!)I listened to the unabridged version and would highly recommend it for those that want an entertaining way to pass their commute."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golem's Eye","review":"I really enjoyed this book and would have given it 5 stars. However, I think the author could have used Bartimaeus more in the dialogue. He wasn't developed enough in this book. There wasn't enough interaction between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel, and too much time on Nathaniel's job in the government. All in all it was a good read. I stayed up late for several nights reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Funny Follow up to the first book. Remember to read the footnotes!Book 3 will wrap it all up.

Stroud again managed it to make it a thrilling adventure during the young Nathaniel and his magical companions search \\"the Restistance\\".

Combining the wickedly humorous djinni, Bartimaeus, with the somewhat gloomier Kathleen, and good old Nathaniel who, like Bartimaeus, played one of the two main parts in the Amulet of Samarkand, and has now become a high-flying magician commonly refered to a \\"Mr. Mandrake\\"Together with the intriguing prologue, cheeky footnotes from Bartimaeus, frightening monsters faced by Kathleen, and the traditional Bartimaeus-picking-one-Nathaniel, this book is the perfect read.

Both are marvelously descriptive, and beautiful in their own dark ways..."},{"rating":"1","title":"total snooze fest","review":"Amulet of Samarkand wasn't that good (mostly it stinked) but I thought the second one would be better.

It is true I've probably read this book outloud to my kid three times - so I know it pretty well - but the abridgement cut out the favorite bits (how can one leave out Prague?) and we kept getting lost but not in the story because we couldn't figure out why we'd gone to that part.My kid used her birthday money for this purchase - and she's so disappointed that here I am getting the first one on cd for her.

In the current time, Delia is holding the hand of her best friend while he dies. Kleenex alert!! Delia and Timothy walk this path together in an agony of loss and triumph. We meet Delia some 13 years before as a physically and emotionally bankrupt 17 year old. She comes to rehab as an 89 pound, half dead druggie/alcoholic. Faced with the choice to live or die, Delia makes the courageous leap to grab life. In the rehab Delia meets a delightfully quirky and human cast of characters who will become her friends and guides as she learns how to live a sober life. This book is gritty and sweaty and unflinchingly honest about what it is like to be in recovery. It's a story about how Delia learns to live and to embrace all the scars and challenges that polish and grow her into being a beautiful and unique piece of art, like Beachglass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush words, gripping story","review":"Blackburn captures the trials, the grit, the anger, the rigidity of the young addict with exacting detail AND eloquence.

I came to it because of the actor from bones that came to here. Loved his acting and continue to think he is brilliant! The characters are more real to life in not always getting along.

Still sci fi but lots of reality poured in"},{"rating":"1","title":"One day they'll do this idea right on tv... not today","review":"It's not a crazy concept. Fun super hero-y people fighting crime after being assemble by a government agency. But this lacked charm or good effects. Only watched the one episode. But I did watch the whole episode. I tried to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical superheroes","review":"What would real superpowers look like?That's the question behind Alphas, Syfy's newest series. Alphas follows an unorthodox group of Government Agents who have unique abilities that set them apart from others. Led by Dr. Lee Rosen these Alphas stand in the way of \\"Red Flag\\" an Alpha Terrorist organization.The thing I like about Alphas is the abilities are rooted in reality. You believe that a person can summon superstrength by consciously increasing Adrenalin like Bill Harken or have finely tuned hand/eye coordination like Cameron Hicks. Alphas is a show for fans of Misfits, Heroes, The Cape or for people who like action comedies with heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alphas","review":"This is a great title a very modern title which has a great view how people can use special abilities to help or cause problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome show","review":"I hope this will eventually be offered on a DVD as it was highly entertaining...many plot twists and turns and it always kept me guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great excuse to turn off the TV.","review":"The story-line is predictable,ordinary people living most of them in 700.000$ houses(an extremely ordinary price) with special superpowers helping the government (sounds familiar????); the characters seem more interested in representing sociological stereotypes than in being people; and the location is not very original (New York, New York,,,,,, again)The rest of the world wonder:\\" are there any other cities in America?\\": A great show for those who still feel some nostalgia from the 80's:"},{"rating":"1","title":"angry, depressing... just not interesting","review":"Take some great actors and give them a script that is dark, angry and depressing - give them a boss who has his own issues and can't/won't stand up for the group - have no real structure for what the group is supposed to do - and then give them gritty, ugly, gory scenes to do their 'work' in and you have \\"Alphas\\". Such a disappointment. Kept watching waiting for the show to 'get legs/find itself' and all they did was add more issues and scenes that are hard to watch. Too bad someone with a real heart for these characters and good ideas for using their abilities didn't get a hold of the scripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Average","review":"I am a bit over this type of series this seems like a bit of a rehash of Heroes with a government twist as it is I would have preferred they keep making Eureka why do Syfy cancel really good series and bring out crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why must they make things so difficult?","review":"Bought a number of these during a remodel for use in plaster ceilings. The plaster ring/ clip combo is terrible. Nearly impossible to get the clips to hide under the trim, even when cutting the clips. The retainer springs that hold the baffles are the worst I've seen, and barely hold the trim snug when installed. Terrible remodel cans. Two stars because they actually look nice when you manage to get them into the ceiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could of been more.............","review":"There are some very noticiable problems with the dvd. First of all why don't they show the whole concert, I know there were 3 or 4 more songs that just weren't included from the show. Also not much in the way of extras, but some of the extra footage meshed in with the concert between songs could be viewed as extras.Now with my gripes out of the way.........This is a must buy for any casual music fan, watching Green Day play live is a treat for almost anybody. Overall just great musicianship. Its also nice to hear songs with a new twist, such as the second guitar in \\"hitchin a ride\\" and the hair raising guitar riff added near the end to \\"time of you life\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day - Transcendent Punk that outshines the shadow of Dookie","review":"I once read somewhere in a Rolling Stone, 'round about Dookie, where someone recommended that I see Green Day before they sell out. I am quite astonished to say that after seeing this band live for the first time on this tour that the only thing they are selling out are the tickets.Here is a band which have reached an epoch in popular culture where a statement, an album and now a tour have redefined the essence of 70's punk rock for a new generation.I would like to recommend that you see this band live on this tour, second I would recommend that you add this tour cd/dvd to your collection.I would have given this a 5 star rating, but I don't believe in perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day live is awesome","review":"Well, I have seen Green Day live 6 times and they never get old. Seeing the DVD of them perform live again makes me want to see them live again. They are so energetic and they keep the audience involved. I personally love this DVD/CD, although I think they should have included a few more tracks on the cd the DVD makes up for that. It has some documentary and behind the scenes stuff and I really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it the last?","review":"I have been a green day fan for years and i am disapointed in their album bullet in a bible. Their did not make any new songs and simply put old songs on one album. Usually when an group/artist does this it means that this is their last album and they are quitting singing. I am scared that green day will stop singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day Freakin' Rocks!!!","review":"I was so excited to get Bullet in a Bible. I was waiting for it to come out. As soon as I bought it, I hurried home to watch it. I have to say...WOW!!! On a big screen with the volume on high it seems like if you are almost at one of their concerts. I took the CD to work and heard it over and over. Obviously, it's not the same as the regular CDs, but, again, I felt as though I was in the concert. I got butterflies in my stomach. There is no one better than Green Day!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"documentation of green day's worst tour ever","review":"basically, this cd/dvd is documentation of green day's sloppiest, all time low, and over all worst tour ever. with the addition of so many band members onstage, why, i wonder, do billie mike and tre play sloppier? on this tour, mike misses many backing vocals, billie's guitar playing is at an all time sloppiness (embarassing for such an amazing guitarist). also, billie's guitar sounds are TERRIBLE, why can't he make his les paul juniors as powerful as they sound on the recordings? anyways, about this cd/dvd: it's nothing more than a handpicked selection of the most overplayed songs from the tour (their \\"greatest hits\\") with the banter completely cut out. it is very very dissapointing coming from a band who used to put on an amazing energetic live show. but.... if you are a new fan to the band or are young and stupid, then you will probably love this cd/dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah! This is great!","review":"Alright! Green Day! My favorite ambiguous emo-punk-pop disaster's still as popular as ever, luckily. I just love this live DVD. A jewel case? Man, that works so well with the faux-melancholic nature of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and others. This DVD is superb, I just cherish every moment of a grade school dropout strutting around in a king's crown. I've always dreamed of listening to guitar and vocal studio overdubs to compensate for lack of real talent. Green Day delivers!!An American guy bellowing \\"ENGLAND!!\\" every two seconds in a British accent? That proves Green Day aren't posers.Furthermore, Green Day's audience is a very open-minded and intelligent lot. As one reviewer proudly proclaimed, \\"if u think this cd sucks then u suck.[sic]\\"Boy, Green Day fans can offer some real intellectual stimulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL LIVE CD","review":"This live album sucks! I mean what is all this singing by the audience? I mean it is a really bad Green Day compilation. And I've always never liked live because they scream, yell, & clap.If you want a good concert album...I recommend you to purchase Dire Straits On The Night. It has none of that!!!!!!!!!!!

No where is the description did it mention what region it is and that bugged me. The work around for this is to download VLC player (which is free) for your computer and that will play it. Also, the package came damaged from shipping (I presume) but it wasn't to bad. I decided to keep it because it was on;y $11 but I might look somewhere else to buy CDs next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD/DVD","review":"I got this cd/dvd the first day it came out. WOW! This is an incredible dvd (I'll get to the cd later)! First of all there are no moments in the concert when the performances start slowing down or get even a little dry. The interview segments are awesome and funny and tell great insights on the making of AI and Bullet in a Bible and everythiung in between. In the concert it starts with American Idiot and goes through the album up to St. Jimmy with the exception of Boulevard which is number 13. The highlights are \\"King for a Day/Shout\\" \\"Minority\\" and the electric guitar version of \\"Good Riddance\\". And there is also a great segment where they interview people in the audience. It's really interesting. The CD was also incredible. It is the Milton Keynes concert with the exception of some segments where billie joe talks to the audience. It's one of the best concert cd's I've ever heard, the sound quality is incredible. Overall this is an incredible buy. Green Day rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok could've been better","review":"Green Day was great as always....But the editing of the concert could've been better I agree with the guy below too many view changes and come on people can you not afford putting the whole thing in color.....geez this is not the 70's....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greenday Rocks!","review":"This is like the best performance they have ever done. It is so good. Not only that, now you can watch it on your psp, and bring it every where you go. By the way, Billie Joe Armstrong is the best.

Billie Joe is the voice of his generation, like Bruce and Elvis before him, he can sing anything. The whole concert breezes by because it just takes over your mind for a while and let's you have a rest. As far as the \\"explicit lyrics\\" warning, forget it, that's ridiculous. These guys are as pure-hearted as you can get. Great versions of all the songs, particularly \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\\" at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Awesome!","review":"Really good, definetly worth the $$$. I just wish they had added more of their old songs, it would be cool to compare their earlier like Dookie to say, American Idiot. it would also help if the interviews were grouped together and not interrupting every song. It would also be nice if they had included some more music videos in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day Bullet","review":"Excellent DVD & CD! Not all inclusive from the show I saw...where is the wasted pink rabbit? Nonetheless, love it & would recommend it to any Green Day fan. Great comments from the band and excellent music. Thank you for making it. I'm going to go watch it again now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one comment...","review":"For the Ammazon.com reviewer I had to set the record straight, American Idiot and BIAB are not anti-American. And if you had watched or listened to it you would know that. Billie-Joe himself says it quite plainly that the song Hoilday is anti-war. And after many, many listens to both AI and BIAB I agree. It's quite possible to be an American and not believe in War or support the current administration and punk has always been the voice of the disaffected. I just hope Green Day continues giving us such great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"We watch it over and over...","review":"For a real critique of the DVD editing etc... you are referred to previous reviewers. I don't really know alot about that. I do know that I have borrowed this DVD from Netflix twice and we have watched it over and over and over. Hence, I am here at Amazon to buy it. It's great, and I truly enjoy the insights into the lives of the band members. I kind of like how the interviews are interspersed throughout the concert footage, otherwise I would probably just watch the music over and over. You can go directly to \\"chapters\\" and watch the songs you like. The sound is good, and if you are a political progressive in a conservative state, the political statements can be affirmitive (that's a good thing). If you like Green Day, you will not regret having this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good overall","review":"This is a DVD of one of Green Day's first stadium shows ever, and it comes with a CD of all the songs too. Interspliced with the footage are interviews with all the dudes and some short clips of them doing funny stuff and touring a war museum.If you like Green Day's live show, you will like this DVD, and it definitely captures the essence/power/emotion of the event. They play the songs well, but Billie Joe runs around doing the whole rock star \\"HEYYYY, HOOOOOO...\\" thing. I'm not so into that. The interviews offer some pretty good insights, but then again, there is some more rock star posturing mixed in there.Anyway, I liked this DVD/CD combo, and I recommend it to Green Day fans. It's pretty good overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great package... but it could've been better.","review":"I would recommend this to any fan of Green Day. The DVD was very good, but it could've been even better. The concert itself was great. The irritating \\"film it for an ADD person\\" approach to camera angles was anything BUT great. It bugged the bejesus out of me in Revenge of the Sith and it did not score any more points during Bullet in a Bible.The CD part was.... well.... pretty much the DVD concert minus the documentary and the in-song banter. Ok, well the annoyingly frequent cries of \\"ENGLAND!\\" are still there... All in all this is a very good live package. It does have a \\"rough around the edges\\" vibe to it at points, but it is still a great addition to the Collection nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Green Day.","review":"Corporate egotistical financially-driven puerile juvenile idiotic sophomoric unintelligent wannabe intellectual punk-rock posers with not a shred of talent or dignity.\\"Hey, we're Green Day!

The \\"Empty Nest\\" pilot amazes me in that it even got sold! It was forced, unfunny and the chemistry just wasn't right with the cast of the pilot. The series worked however after major surgery -- and Richard Mulligan in the lead. The \\"extras\\" on \\"The Golden Girls\\" have been terrible. Volume One had Joan Rivers and her daughter. Those shrill, shallow hags are so annoying! And the trivia quiz on Volume Two was absolutely boring. What I wouldn't give for a blooper reel or unaired scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a shame!","review":"Does anyone know why Season one allowed the viewer to advance by scene and not episode like Season two? I find this situation a huge disappointment and very frustrating. Season 2 does not have as many good episodes as other seasons, and being forced to sit thru the opening song repeatedly to get to below par episodes is not only annoying as all get out, but an insult. Every other show allows one to fast forward within an episode, except this season 2 DVD does not.I love this show, it saved my life, and will continue to purchase the entire series, but the makers should know the viewers expect basics, like being able to skip the intro and get to scenes they want to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Girls DVDs Season 1 and 2","review":"I really enjoy the Golden Girls.

All 26 episodes from season 2 are really done well in 1986 and 1987 jam-packed with a bunch of laughs, confusion, and cheesecake. I always feel real emotional when I watch the last episode of the Golden Girls because I think \\"WOW! that is the end of an incredible show\\" but then not too long after that on September 18,1992 The Golden Palace was born which is today a really cool show to us fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a half stars at best","review":"sorry to say but this is not a 5 star show as most other people would have you believe. the humour is tired,the writing is weak and the mother is annoying. the saving grace of the show is of course Bea Arthur. when MAUDE is finally on DVD,then you will really see Arthur at her best.again Golden Girls is no classic but is good for a few chuckles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Golden","review":"I love The Golden Girls :) The humor in the second season is great. In this season, each character sets into their own personality. Dorothy: The serious, smart, dry humor one. Sophia: The sarcastic, quick-witted, wise one (picture this...). Rose: The dumb one (well, not really dumb, just lacking some common sense), huge heart/love for animals, huge story teller. Blanche: The Floozy with the southern draw.If you are looking for something with humor and an great story line, The Golden Girls is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful!!!!!!!!! Onle one drawback!","review":"I have been watching this show so often, and it is always a new discovery. I also bought Season 2. The Season One has one major drawback - ABSOLUTELY IDIOTIC COMMENTARY MADE VY TWO LADIES THAT HAS NO VALUE! If the studio decides to reedit this Season 1, I would recommend to remopve this commentary and add those retakes and outtakes and bloopers! So is this Season 2 that has wortless trivia! I hope the Studio will consider this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show... poor quality DVD recording.","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Golden Girls series. I ordered the entire series from Amazon and have been extremely disappointed with the poor quality of the DVD recording. The picture is not clear and seems to be either a pirated recording or copied with poor technology. I feel jipped that the show I love the most is not enjoyable to view with such poor quality recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection but.......","review":".....where are the outtakes and bloopers? I LOVE this show but the special features on both season 1 and 2 have been lacking. Season 1 had a totally lame fashion commentary by Joan and Melissa Rivers and Season 2 has an idiotic trivia game where not even all of the questions have to do with Golden Girls trivia. You can't tell me that there aren't hours of re-takes and bloopers that could be edited down into an entertaining extras feature for these collections. Please try harder for Season 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm squealing already but why the delay?","review":"(one season every 3 months instead of 6 would be so much nicer!)There's already a great review incorporating the episodes, but I will readily say that season 2 takes the successful elements of season 1 and embellishes them into an even more successful mix of the witty, urbane, and emotional. Great stuff.The more memorable episodes are: \\"End of the Curse\\", \\"Take Him, He's Mine\\", \\"Isn't it Romantic\\" (riotously funny and possibly a test episode whose success allowed Blanche's brother to eventually 'come out'), \\"Love, Rose\\", \\"Twas The Night Before Christmas\\", \\"The Sisters\\" (Nancy Walker was PERFECT casting), \\"The Actor\\", \\"Before and After\\", \\"And Then There Was One\\", \\"Son-In-Law-Dearest\\", and \\"To Catch a Neighbor\\".I'm sure the DVD quality will be as respectable, but I am most looking forward to this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic female comedy of all time","review":"As a big fan of the show from Australia, I have purchased Series 1, and now this one.Disappointing that there is no special features, who cares about a stupid quiz! Would love to see the lifetime series featured on these as a special featured.The episodes are great, the girls funny as always.If you live in Aus/NZ this DVD only works if you have a multizone player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it get any better?","review":"I LOVE this show! There isn't much more to say about how amazing the actors are and the plots are absolutely hilarious! There isn't a question about that. So I will cover the other basics.-Packaging- strudy, cd's stay in place, everything is clean and neat. Five stars.-Quality- Wonderful, episodes are complete, and good viewing quality. Five stars.-Delivery- Was speedy and punctual.DEFINATELY BUY! This is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH YEAH!","review":"How can you go wrong with these broads? These girls are always up to some crazy shanans. Get this show and watch it everyday! Would have given it more stars but they only offer five to choose from. In my opinion its a few to little. 8 or more stars would allow for a much more accurate representation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Repetitive and Bland","review":"I find this book, though filled with decent (not excellent) content to be very long and bland. The author continually repeats himself within chapters, extending the length and making it almost confusing to follow, not reinforcing. This is not exciting, neither in writing style nor content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed versions","review":"These are not the original classics. The producers have remixed to add extra percussion, a thumpa-thumpa/hip hop bass and slowed several of the songs down so the original Motown sound is lost with some songs sounding particularly heavy and dragging."},{"rating":"1","title":"haven't received it yet","review":"hasn't arrived!!!!!!Have sent reply re not received but nothing from your end, no contact just emails re new books or CDs"},{"rating":"2","title":"I heard it through the grapevine ...","review":"... that you might be considering this CD. Well, grab it! It pulls in lots of hits, even from the very beginning, you can hear how Motown seems to have started in a basement, to the empire it became."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motown Sound","review":"\\"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\\" and other hits will have you or your friends and family reminiscing about the \\"Good Old Days\\" of Soul Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Man's Marathon","review":"Steven Hatch manages to write with both wit and gravity about going through the third year of medical school. His unique voice comes through the subject matter clearly; he narrates his own experiences in an engaging journal/diary style. He simultaneously illustrates the amazing, bufuddling, and shocking aspects of this less-written about yet transformative year.Steven's insights into the medical profession and the practice of being a doctor not only made me think, but made me laugh. His ability to accomplish both in the same text is deserves high accolades. I highly recommend this book as an excellent and enlightening read for anyone, not just those pursuing a medical degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty bracelet.","review":"Bracelet is a lovely color.

Shania has had an impressive carreer so far and she is not slowing down. After watching this DVD you will run out to see Shania live next time she comes around.

DVD Well Worth the Money!","review":"I borrowed this DVD from a friend that purchased it today, and let me say that this is one of the best quality concert DVDs I have seen. The sound and clarity is second to none. As far as the content goes, there are definitely more songs on this DVD than one could hope for, and most of them are her greatest hits, with some new ones thrown in for a little variety. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD like I am going to do. If you're not a Shania fan yet, you probably will be by the time you are done watching this concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"UP!

In Chicago special, all I can say is this lady knows how to perform. However, I had the distinct feeling that more songs were performed than shown on TV and I believe this DVD proves that true.All I can say, I can't wait to see the concert without commercial interuptions and hopefully, no backstage scenes except possibly as extra bonuses on the DVD AFTER the concert.My two daughters ...just LOVE Shania's music, as do I. All I can say is, all three of us are eagerly awaiting this DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dvd!","review":"This dvd is excellent!

Her happy music makes you get up and sing along with her. Her clear enunciation allows you to understand the lyrics. I believe in the theory K.I.S.S. (Keep it Simple, Stupid), and Shania's music is fun, exhiliarating, and uncomplicated, each with its own special message. Her very talented band provides an impressive background to her performance. Whether she sings country or pop, Shania is unsurpassed in voice and presentation.

Older efforts have more liveliness.I can't get over the feeling that Shania wishes she was somewhere else instead of onstage.Of course the sound and picture quality are absolute glossy and perfect, but have you ever seen someone with such stature seem so bored with her robitic renditions? How about some real passion instead of ultra-marketable bland!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is horrible","review":"I bought this DVD because all of the previous reviews I read said this was one of the best of Shania Twain.

I'm not questioning the quality of Shania's reppertoire and skill. No. I'm giving it two stars because of the appearance of a \\"cheap\\" and rushed product this DVD have.How can it be possible that, in the DVD era, Shania release a DVD with absolutely NONE extras, no bonus material, no backstage footage, no interviews, there is not even the names of the band members at the final credits. Incredible! THis, of course, its typical example of an artist (no, I mean a record company or manager) that knows that its artist reached a level of fidelity from his fans that he can release any kind of product and it will sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania Twain dvd","review":"Shania sings all her hits in this explosive dvd that would be a great gift for the holidays. she is a very interactive performer, and you feel like you are performing with her she is so crowd oriented. only 3 songs from her woman in me album though, but come on over and up she sings most all of the singles and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"Shania Twain's Chicago DVD is a must-have for every Shania fan.

A Chicago dvd of course. Shania is by far the best perfomer out there at least in the opinion of her fans. Shania captivates the audience with old hits and new songs. The pyro-techs are not to be missed. The editing could have and should have been better. It's still an enjoyable dvd though. If your a diehard shania fan you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets go","review":"Like Shania said in one of her songs LETS GO.

Shania has not grown as a recording artist and she has not grown as a live performer, either. Basically, she is doing the samething she did during her 98-99 tour. The only thing different is her outfits (which are uglier) and she added some new songs (from her UP! album). But other than that, nothing is different...nothing improved...nothing changed. I will give her credit for her energy and she sounds pretty good. But I expect an artist of her level to give me more (especially after selling 30 million off her last cd and taking a long vacation).

From the simplistic, awkward wording of the book to the lack of creativity, this book was just bad. The main characters were whiny and emo, and I found it difficult to get behind them and feel supportive. Not only that, but the plot, for me, fell flat. There was no real cohesive plot, and certainly nothing creative or remotely deep. The fantasy world was ill defined as a whole and fell well short of worlds created in other fantasy works. I finished the whole book, not out of any sort of attention but more out of an incredulous horror that such a poorly worded piece could be successfully published. However, I would still recommend reading it because if you don't take it too seriously, it can be absolutely hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indepth look into abusive relationships and hope.","review":"Julie Brady is a new writer of great talent combined with the premier Fantasy writer Piers Anthony and you have a wonderful new world created by dreams. It's a Love story and a quest novel roled into one with a heroine instead of a hero. This book gives some insights into why women stay in abusive relationships and the hardships that sometimes ensue when they leave. You can feel the self hatred and feelings of worthlessness of the main characters. You can also feel the strong hope and dreams of each of them. This story covers it all from despair to aborted suicide to the bloom of new hope and selfworth. It gives a feeling of hope and a reason to believe in our dreams. Well worth reading. Keep a hanky close by it may cause tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely readable","review":"I found this clumsily written, and reading it was about as much fun as chewing tinfoil. A pity, as Anthony wrote some good things once.The plot read like bad wish-fulfillment fantasies.

And this, I'm afraid, isn't.I've never had to apologize to an author before. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a space for zero stars","review":"This badly-written, poorly-conceived excuse for a novel makes me ashamed to admit liking Piers Anthony's work. Ever. It reads as though written and edited by a classroom of first-graders. Except that first-graders are generally more imaginative. This derivative drivel is... self-gratification splashed onto a page, ready for unwary readers. The characters are flat, the plot is trite, and the writing itself is so incredibly clumsy it made me wince just reading the first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalism Is Not The Be-All and End-All","review":"This book is flawed from its basic premise. It doesn't get any better as it goes along.Capitalism has only one goal - maximizing profit. Period. Anything that gets in the way of that is the enemy, whether it is government, the environment, whole populations, or basic human needs. Theory is one thing, reality is another. This book is built on thin air, no matter how well \\"documented\\" or heatedly argued.If there was such a thing as a free market and everyone had equal access to it (which is the only thing that would really make it free) then these theories would be interesting. Otherwise they pose more threat than promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb historical perspective","review":"just the kind of book i like--one that gives me an enormous wealth of historical information while explaining, in very readable terms, the economic forces that were and are in conflict with one another. my only criticism is that the book does not take social and psychological factors into enough account in describing the reasons for the various economic decisions. perhaps this excellent book should not take on such a role, but the reader ought to be cognizant of the other, non-economic reasons that play a major role in moving world leaders towards their economic policies. nevertheless, i strongly and highly recommend this superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell to Philosophy","review":"I love this album, but as I'm not a muso nor a classically literate listener, forgive my probably naive reasons. I found this album more accessible than others of his, but I do not think that it is in any way simplistic. Perhaps it is because it is more lyrical and less angular than other albums. Perhaps it is just that the closing piece, featuring Charlie Haden, has one of the most aching passages (and note! - trust me) that I have ever heard. Either way if you're new to Bryars I can't think of a better place to start. If you know his work then I hope you have this one.

It's powerful and can do just about anything...which makes it kind of difficult to learn to program, even using Logitech's website-based program. It took me about 5 evenings to get it configured the way I wanted, but once you figure it out, it makes sense. The only minor complaints I have about the remote itself is: 1) the six buttons on the left and right of the LCD display are very small and often difficult to press; and 2) I wish it had dedicated \\"Info\\", \\"Power\\" and \\"Cancel\\" buttons.

And for $35, I was finally able to get my hands on a harmony remote!My only fault with the remote: you can't really turn on your electronics manually and use the remote at the same time. IE: if I turn on my tv set by hand, the menu will not come up on the remote; likewise, if i want to activate the TV function on my remote, it will send an ON/OFF signal as well, thus shutting down your TV again. besides that, a wonderful remote well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use up to the challenge.","review":"Pros1.

Then each action goes to the correct device.

The execution of the concept is another story. I have upgraded the firmware as well as updated the software. I have set up the devices multiple times and they have always had difficulty controlling my set up properly. Unless I happen to have a faulty unit (low likelyhood), I would recomment staying clear of this product.

If you need to replace remotes with lots of buttons, this remote is utterly useless. It will lump all the functions without dedicated buttons to the LCD screen and you'll have to scroll through them. The LCD menu will only display a few characters, so you'll have to guess what the LCD key stands for. Only 3 activity buttons, if you have more devices, this means you'll have to scroll through the device buttons. This remote is going to the drawer for me. Not easy to program, this is from a software engineer. My old Sony RM-VL900 is much,much, better.

The only drawback (which everyone else seems to indicate) is that you need to be PC savvy to tweak the remote properly but once you have it configured properly, it works great! I then bought another remote for my basement where I have a Samsung HLR-5667W DLP TV, which is a great TV by the way but the remote stinks. The Harmony 628 remote handled all of the functions with ease, including functions (such as PIP) that are performed by going through a tedious menu process to use with the TV remote.I highly recommend this remote so long as you are patient with the setup process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 112","review":"By far the best album from this group IMHO!

The background harmonizing resembling Boyz II Men on \\"Now That We're Done\\" and \\"Can I Touch You\\" as the production was both done by Tim & Bob and Wanya Morris (of Boyz II Men). The non-bottom beat of the banger \\"Cupid\\" still has the same feel of its original release. Faith Evans adds a woman touch on \\"I Can't Believe\\". Both versions of \\"Only You\\" features The Notorious B.I.G. while the Bad Boy remix has a verse featuring Mase as well.

When I heard the first part of the CD, I was almost shocked because they had some tight ballads that I wasn't expecting to hear. There is an excellent mix of ballads, midtempo songs and uptempo songs. The best examples of this are \\"Come See Me\\" w/Mr. Cheeks from The Lost Boyz, \\"Pleasure And Pain\\", \\"Cupid\\", \\"I Can't Believe\\" w/Faith Evans, and \\"Now That We're Done\\".

In his book, he attempts to disprove science by simply dismissing it, rather than actually addressing the issue. It is by skirting the issue that he hopes to make his impact. Also, he uses italics and exclamation points heavily, which is a sign of emotional, rather than sound, scientific logic.

It's similar to the feeling one gets when reading the Feynman Lecture Series about physics -- they are both masterful distillations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book out there for IIS 6","review":"As an ASP .Net developer, I've had to deploy to IIS too many times to count. Invariably, something goes wrong. This book will make you a master at IIS 6. It goes into very advanced details such as the metabase (which I haven't seen any other book do). It also gives a quick historical lesson on IIS which really helps to place IIS 6 in context and gives insight to why things were done a certain way. The author starts from the foundation and branches out from there. Without a doubt, the best book on IIS 6 available."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I expect...","review":"for $20 bucks...After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up, I still can't get more than a -20db signal from my guitar...Save your money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING! - Intel Macs - Set input in GarageBand prefs!","review":"I just got this cable today, and experienced the same problems some of the other reviewers had with getting sound out of the guitar. It's not the cable's fault. If you're using one of the new Intel Macs, you have to go into the preferences for GarageBand (not the general system sound prefs), and make sure that your sound input is set to Line-in, instead of built-in microphone. Without that setting, you're going to get nothing but feedback.When you're set up properly, however, this cable does exactly what it's meant to do... turn your Mac into a thousand different amps. It's fantastic! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly, no issues at all","review":"A lot of people seem to have experienced difficulty figuring out how to select the input source, but I'm a Mac noob and found it very straightforward. Just go into system preferences->Sound and select line input. In GarageBand add a \\"real instrument\\" track and select the \\"monitor on\\" option. You're all set. You can run iTunes or a DVD at the same time and play along simultaneously in GarageBand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best or Cheapest Option...","review":"This product will get the job done, but, really no need to spend more $s for this dedicated/single-purpose cable.

Especially good option if you already have some high quality instrument cables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks logic for where it goes.","review":"This book has a great premise and some interesting ideas. Too bad it has almost no characterization and some decisions make no sense.The biggest problem is that the main characters are in no way qualified to continue to deal with the big discovery at the heart of the story. A pilot, a lawyer, and an lab tech are in charge of the discovery of advanced technology? The author tries to justify it in various ways, but I think even he realized he was stretching it.And I agree that the ending was very weak.Skip this one and look at one of McDevitt's better novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makings of a TV series","review":"This book is a masterpiece!I hope that a mini-series on TV can be properly developed and implemented.Ed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak ending- Don't worry, the scientists know best!","review":"Like many reviewers, I thought this started out strong. However, by the middle, I really started to not like this. I had a hard time believing the lack of precautions taken by anyone, leading to somewhat predictable results. Many of the characters were just unappealing, and there were probably too many to begin with. I could have dealt with that and still enjoyed it as a light read. Mostly, what turned me off was an end that turned into a cameo-fest and the none-too-subtle \\"Government is evil, but scientists know best\\" message. The \\"scientists know best\\" bit is just a little too arrogant for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good vacation read.","review":"It's not \\"literature\\" but it's a pretty good book. I burned through it over a few days while on vacation. It's a good nerdy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated at one star...","review":"This book takes an interesting idea and then somehow takes and pours concrete all over it! This was an incredibily slow read and one that does little to to look into the possibilities/problems the chance of new worlds would bring to society. There is little written here about exploring the world(s)opened up by the discovery of \\"gateways\\" to these worlds. The idea is pretty good of these gateways to other worlds craeted by an alien race but the book spends too much time on mental moral arguments. It limps along trying to tie everything in with some angst about the sins of the whites in their contacts with previous cultures on our world. Yeah, here is an opportunity for humanity to spread out again and these two shallow, boring characters spend most of the book in debate...Overall, a waste of money, too PC and just boring. As already stated a great idea done wrong! Try SM Stirlings \\"Conquistadors\\" for this type of book that works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the cover led me to expect!","review":"This novel reminded me of the science fiction I used to read in high school, back when I was a fan of the genre. The mystery item found in the North Dakota field drew me in and the story continued at a page-turning pace to the very end. I enjoyed how the discovery of the two alien artifacts impacted different people around the world. The ending was a little predictable but it was wonderful none the less. The characters were rather thinly sketched, which is why I gave it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"More human interest than reals SF","review":"Too much, yet not enough. That is the way I would describe my feelings about this book. On the one hand, McDevitt once again has an interesting idea. The problem is he doesn't do enough with it, but tries to change the book into a human interest story. As a result the focus is too much on the persons in the book, whether relevant or not. This results the characters to be too extreme, and in a number of cases, irrelevant. The flip side of the coin is that he doesn't do enough with the science fiction ideas: not on the human side nor on the technical, political or socio-economical side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A couple of scientist types find something that should just not be there.

In the end it was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Implausible -- not one of his better works","review":"I came very close to dropping this book midway through. It is quite some way into the book before anything remotely interesting happens, and even when the plot begins to move it is fairly prosaic, along with being completely implausible (and I don't mean the sci-fi elements are implausible -- I mean the more mundane aspects of the plot such as the unrealistic course of governmental intervention, superficial invovlement of business entities, complete lack of normal precautions taken by the characters at some points, etc).McDevitt's books are not, in my experience, generally this poor. I rather liked Chindi. Perhaps he has gotten better as time goes on -- \\"Ancient Shores\\" is fairly old now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, Not Great","review":"An interesting premise never fully realized. The initial story of possible first contact through an unearthed link to other worlds is intriguing but never really developed. Many minor characters come and go to illustrate the effect of first contact on society, but very few of these characters are interesting and eventually it becomes deadening. The story manages to create an occasional sense of wonder, and there is some suspense at the end, but the payoff just isn't there. The story never resolves itself and is unbelieveable at best, leaving unanswered questions and a sense of unfulfillment. Nicely written but don't expect to discover much about the book's central mystery, which is who built the advanced technology about which the primary story circles and circles and circles without landing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"Rhapsody in Blue,\\" plus a bonus","review":"This is a must-have CD. It contains the best recorded version of \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" I have ever heard, and the Warsaw Concerto is terrific. But the bonus here is a gem of a piece, the Scherzo by Henry Litolff.

I couldn't be more disappointed. BOTTOM LINE?...The London Symphony is a powerful tool in the right hands. But in the hands of Jaz Coleman it has been beaten into a mid-eastern scimitar and used to hack and butcher some of Zeppelins best tunes...\\"HASSAN CHOP!\\". I've enjoyed other \\"Symphonic Rock\\" treatments, e.g. Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc. and Led Zep has great potential. Unfortunately I didn't find much enjoyment here. In fact the first and last \\"tunes\\" have NOTHING to do with either Zeppelin or Classical music and are nothing more than eleven minutes of random noise...please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethereal, Epic, Moving - NOT","review":"There is nothing at all clever about it. The original songs had far more subtlety than this adolescent exercise. After a montage of stereotypical \\"middle east\\" noises, the music on Kashmir begins with a solo violin seemingly attempting to imitate Robert Plant's voice in an awkward dinky phrase that repeats and repeats without variation. Very annoying. The orchestra throughout the rest of the ordeal is wasted on only two functions: rumbling slumber and flatulent orgasm. I hope the brave and hapless musicians were fairly compensated for their time. The star is for them.Anyone remember the old Monkeyshines calenders that featured chimpanzees in various human clothing, settings and poses?

I am more than happy; I am thrilled with the results. While lacking in the Bonham department, this interpretation is truly incredible. There are bits in the music I never noticed before that has me running back to the originals every time I listen to this symphonic version. Kashmir alone is worth the price.If you buy this you have to be looking for something different. There are only so many times you can listen to Plant, Page and Bonham scream and beat out their music.

I did some drawing while letting this wonderful mesh of classical and Led Zepp assail my ears I was blown away.The only down side that I noticed was that a couple tracks weren't different enough from the Zep originals-the rest are quite breathtaking.This is a good, solid album and I recommend it for classical and Zep fans alike. Heck, I think I'm going to bring it to art class tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff (but you will still want the real LZ)","review":"I have become convinced that the less an orchestral, solo piano or jazz version of a rock song imitates the original, the better it will be. This music does not slavishly follow the LZ originals (except for Kashmir, where the original is already symphonic) and works really well. Some of comes across as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" type music, in other places it is sort of Ralph Vaughn Williams pastoral. This type of CD is caught between LZ fans and people who like Lord of the Rings music and Ralph Vaughn Williams - it doesn't seem likely to please to please either type of person for long. But I like it enough to keep it on my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"First couple of tracks are pretty good","review":"Well, in reference to the terrible review above me, its not THAT bad. The first and last tracks, granted, have little to do with Zeppelin. However, tracks 2-5 are INCREDIBLE- they alone are worth the cost of the CD. Both the three minute mark of Kashmir and When The Levee Breaks make me tremble. Kashmir especially contends with the actual Led Zeppelin recording of it. The other tracks do have a tendency to dissolve into mush, but man, those first four make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done! Mr. Jaz Coleman & London Symphony Rocks!

Later with piano tape loops, which is recorded piano notes on repeating tape, with the CD \\"Litania\\". This is her newest musical addition, & what an addition it is: \\"The Art of the Toy Piano\\". Margaret Leng Tan plays every style from Classical music (Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata & Erik Satie's Gymnopédie No. 3) to Rock (Beatles's Eleanor Rigby) with a semi-off tune, percussion like toy piano which adds an unique edge to some tunes you may know or never heard before.

I am not ready to perform yet (ha!), but it is fun to play with it. Mine had the highest Bb so flat it was the same pitch as the A below it. So I have started to tune it up to pitch. I am half way there. A scary process, because it is easy to sharpen a note, but you cannot go back very well.It is a shame that many toy pianos are pretty junky, but the Schoenhut ones, at least their better ones, seem quite good indeed, and are beautiful to look at besides.

The video uses song and a kind of techno sounding beat to try to teach the steps. My daugter was a bit confused when she used this. It was like a game of twister for her. She wasn't sure where to put her feet and at times and needed encouragement from me to help her place her feet. It says you can combine the foot moves to make a dance.

And if you knew my daughter, you'd know that she is easily pleased and very grateful for any present she receives. She can turn anything into a game. But this toy was pretty disappointing. The flimsy bar is not designed for little girls to hold onto to practice ballet, if they did hold onto it to help balance, they'd topple over in an instant. The video has awful colour and sound, not to mention it is boring and annoying. We had to skip forward to get to the dance part which followed a lot of babble with some strange puppets. Although she only took a few ballet classes 3 years ago, my daughter said it was too easy for her and not much fun.

Oh, the shoes barely fit too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Ballet Video-not worth the $","review":"Our family got this for my daughter for her birthday after she wanted her cousin's at Christmas. The barre is neat but the rest of the kit could've been left out. The mat with foot positions is way too confusing for a young child. The video is very poorly done and does not really teach much about ballet. I'll stick with my 1970's video of children taking Royal Academy ballet exams. My daughter loves it and it isn't full of silly puppets, bad graphics, and poor ballet instruction.I wish I had the idea to do something like this.

Koop is also featured prominently with two songs - again highly recommended.I'm particulary intrigued by some of the highly hard-to-find Eastern Germany /Polish/Czech vintage 70s jazz that's available on this release - it's definitely an area I would not have considered for jazz back then.Overall, top notch stuff - 4 stars - (No 5 stars as it's not ground-breaking but it is solid).

It just did not resonate with me at all. The writing is fine and Dougan is at his best when zeroing in on Kim's family dynamic - but the whole thing is ultimately an empty exercise. I found it hard to care about an essentially shallow, incredibly beautiful woman with father issues who spends her entire adult life as the mistress of a very wealthy man. PUH-LEEZE! Even AFTER she realizes she needs to be independent in order to have any kind of meaningful existence she flies to Paris ON THE RICH GUY'S DIME!

Norman has a huge cathedral of a voice, and this recording has its visceral thrills. That she ignores Strauss's \\"nicht schleppend\\" marks troubles me, because the composer clearly wants the music to move, and the performer seems to be more interested in luxuriating in her voice.

Also Sena Jurinac, but it's hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating and misguided","review":"Jessye Norman has a gorgeous voice and superb breath control. The problem is that her and Masur's tempi are so slow that the songs are brought to a grinding hault. Particularly in \\"Im Abendrot,\\" the pace is so slow that this incredible song is turned into a shapeless ruin, with no sense of line left in the orchestral music. Again, Norman's breath control is miraculous, and if you can make it to the end of the song you will be amazed at her talent. Strauss, however, gets left behind. The early digital sound is not great, and the playing time, at around 46 minutes, is outrageous for a full-price reissue (this is about 36 cents a minute, as opposed to Karajan/Janowitz's 16 cents a minute). There are no translations except for \\"Im Abendrot\\", and that isn't even next to the German text! To be avoided at all costs, unless you are looking for a lesson in how NOT to perform these songs.

The physics concepts covered in the book include friction, inertia, force, and acceleration, momentum, strength, center of mass, rotational inertia, energy, and torque. The book is designed to help you experience the process of design. It helps you take your ideas and apply them to produce a working model. Building mousetrap cars is problem solving with two main ingredients: (1) you don't know what problems will be encountered; and (2) more than one solution might work.

In addition, he goes to great lengths to explain how such a model could work effectively within a church setting. The last three chapters are especially practical in their step-by-step presentations of the strategic pastoral counseling model and two well-presented case studies.

He enlisted the help of wonderful artists to work with him, but his playing is out of tune, sloppy, and a sad reflection of a one-time great fiddler. He was an innovator on the instrument, but this recording should have never been made. If you want to buy it for nostalgia, fine. But don't expect anything like the old benny Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to see new gals!","review":"Two words: Brooke Berry. Okay, two more: Shanon Stewart.

Not abstract. Not trip-hop. And yet, somehow Moodorama weaves all of these threads together into a remarkably solid album. Each track is its own vibe -- its own MOOD -- but, they've all got one thing in common: quality. I've listened to this album in all sorts of scenarios and, while the best may be late-night with your girlfriend, the CD's got plenty of energy to get your head nodding no matter what you're doing or what time of day you're doing it. One of the best down-tempo discs I've heard, comparable to (and/or better than) the likes of Massive Attack, Portishead, and the other female-vocalist-led groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the perfect aid to better grades","review":"This is not a book which correctly solves problems in a heat transfer course. Much less \\"fully\\" solving problems. My biggest letdown in this book is in the manner the authors solved some of the problems in the book. Specifically problems dealing with the Biot modulus for a carbon steel sphere. It incorrectly lists the formula to solve for this type of object. It also does not show how to solve for the Biot modulus using the graphs provided. This book also incorrectly lists a method to solve for the amount of time needed to cool a heated sphere. Studying these incorrect methods caused my exam to drop a letter grade. I do not recommend this book to anyone trying to grasp the concepts in a heat transfer course. I suggest to save your money for something else that may help."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and misinformed","review":"While this book has some great tips and some good info, I was appalled by the misinformation in the section on breastfeeding and how negatively it was presented.

Overall, I would not recommend this book to anybody who has any interest in breastfeeding, or wants to read a book with correct health information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is printed on.","review":"I read this after catching parts of the tv show hosted by the author.

Since my first Girlfriends' Guide was published around 1995 with six other Guides of similar titles following in the subsequent years and as recently as Jan. 2007 with the Second Edition of the Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy, I am now accustomed to being ripped off in one way or another, but it is always the girls who live in my backyard who try to capture the Girlfriends' Guide 'tude and flavor that really chafe my hide. Modern Girl's Guide? Hello? Is the eureka moment of inspiration really so rare that we need to rip off our successful sisters? No one was writing Girl's or Girls' guides to anything except perhaps camping until 1995.

And, frankly, anyone who has seen a one-year-old cry and then stop to see if you're watching knows that babies indeed can be \\"manipulative.\\" Perhaps that is too harsh a term, but I have the sense that the people who vehemently criticize this book are the same people who still share their beds with a four-year-old who asks, \\"Mom, could you lift your shirt so I can have a snack?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Advice","review":"I really believe that this book gives AWFUL advice and can ruin an expecting mothers views on parenting.

Half of the \\"advice\\" given is just plain bad - is it meant to be sarcastic? It sure seems to be. Yes, you need a sense of humor as a mother, but to have a book that claims to be a \\"guide\\" or give advice and have it in the Parenting sections of bookstores... that's not right.

If you are self-absorbed and interested only in your own well-being and not that of your baby, then perhaps this books is for you. Being a parent isn't about doing the most convenient thing, it's about doing what's best for your baby - and apparently this author has missed out on that important life lesson. If you care about the health and well-being of your baby, you'll stay far, far away from this sad, sad book.

I have several books I refer to, but this one stays on my bedside table. It is insightful, witty, and encouraging - unlike many of the comments on these reviews that seem to have been sabotaged by some self-righteous breastfeeding clan. The breastfeeding portion is a tiny portion of the book and it encourages you to do what's best for BOTH you and the baby. If you want to breast-feed, it offers helpful suggestions. If you can't, it offers solutions. I recommend this book to all my friends, no matter what their parenting style is. Ignore the sabotages and let the sanity begin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If being modern means being a bad mom, then call me old fashioned!","review":"WoW just WoW!!!

She disregards most medical recommendations, and acts as though children are just a burden to deal with. Her information on breastfeeding is beyond sad, it's reprehensible, and not the least bit accurate. Her attitude that children at the ages of 9-12 months are manipulative when crying, and should cry it out is sad, and out-dated, not to mention dangerous to your child's health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling!","review":"This book is an insult to any intelligent mother.

It contains a disclaimer that the author is not to be held accountable for any injury or damage resulting from using the information and advice within the book. Smart move on her part as her bank account will surely thank her in the years to come. I admit she had a few humorous things to say, but in all the book was not an accurate account of how a modern woman (because let's face it, girls should not be having babies) would want to raise her children. The book discourages appropriate bonding with your child and eludes to the philosophy that children are to be seen, not heard. If you want things easy, don't have a baby. And if you want to raise your child to be a healthy, well-adjusted adult don't take the advice in this book. There are a few useful tips, but you can find those on the internet for free rather than wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, NO- Do NOT buy this book!","review":"Misinformed, personally biased, and sometimes outright dangerous.

Or, do your own research."},{"rating":"1","title":"What bad advice!","review":"Please, if you are planning on breastfeeding or following your child's cues do not buy this book.The breastfeeding advice she gives is just plain wrong and uninformed.

Brother Cadfael was an interesting mix of the world (due to his previous life outside of the ministry-as a soldier) and the Spirit. He was very smart, but was not my favorite detective. The thing I loved the most about this book was Ellis Peters' descriptions about people and situations. The description that struck me the hardest was the one of the woman's body Brother Cadfael found in the beginning. I'd like to conclude by saying that the historical information was invaluable as well. A mystery with a historical context is something I thoroughly enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more gothic romance than historical mystery","review":"At her best, Ellis Peters can write a solid mystery in a fascinating medieval setting. this did neither. More gothic romance than historical novel. Very phony plot and characters. everything seemed exaggerated. Annoying attitude on author's part of hero worship of upper class, warrior values, the romantic Arab. Cloying. I agree with the reviewer who found it slow and boring. I got to the end only by skimming the last quarter very quickly. there was a lot of wordy repetitive prose to no effect.

Particularly interesting is the fan survey which gives us a look at the nuances of everyday life from alumni, fans and those who take it to another level altogether (like myself).

This not only gives you an idea of what deep sea creatures look like, but amazingly shows predator/prey interactions (though some of that was dramaticized, it was entertaining none the less).

The pool is just horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a good investment","review":"I completely agree with the other reviews, it took forever to blow this thing up. Although mine did come with a drain, it sits flush with the ground and will not drain unless it is lifted up. The arch was very difficult to attach and burst immediatly when the water was turned on. I finally took my scissors to the basketball hoop, palm tree and slide and now my kids have a wonderful square puddle pond to splash and play in. This is how it should have come in the first place. Next time I hope Aqua Leisure keeps it simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!! Why All The Bad Reviews??? A+++","review":"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews?!?

Don't expect first quality balsa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoggyboy's review nails it.","review":"I am a big fan of Midwest's wood products--the ones sold individually on the rack at the hobby store. Those pieces are always pre-sanded/finished and look/feel great. This bag is full of nothing but rough un-sanded pieces (literally splinters coming off of them at all angles; that bad) which are good for only a few applications where scrap wood is needed. I create enough scrap with normal wood usage so I don't need a bag of scrap. I thought this would be a sampler bag of different wood sizes/shapes and while it is that, they are not of the same quality as Midwest's normal line of wood found at the local hobby shop. I can therefore not recommend this product to anyone looking for anything other than scrap wood pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"not blocks","review":"There was only one \\"BLOCK\\" in the package, the rest were really just sticks.

Although most of Tchaikovsky's score is (laszily) played, the skating stars are wasted with indifferent choreography and perfuctory camera work. There is no invention, no tension, no lightness. The production is just dumped there as another Christmas \\"special\\" to be forgotten on December 26. Believe me, there have been terrific ice productions of this ballet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I greatly enjoyed this and highly recommend it. It is especially effective in the second half.

Sweeping synth-made orchestral strings backed with a bouncing minimal beat help carry the off-the-wall vocals whose subject matter ranges from the leaving her native England for Berlin (\\"Bolton Wander\\") to a lover's cannibalism (\\"Bite Ya\\").PTR's live shows have generated much attention as Rostron dons an interest yet ridiculous persona wearing home-made helmets and an oversized PTR bling necklace, while the videos for the songs display a captivating obsession with symmetry.For further interest, check out there the \\"All Stringed Up\\" EP, which of course, presents string acoustics to 4 of the best tracks on the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the $20 price tag","review":"I am currently a high school student and we are about to start our football season. That would mean that we will be marching as well. In previous years of marching, I have used the traditional wooden reeds. The only gripe I had with that is they would either get a) chipped during the game or b) just lose the tone quality, rendering my instrument out of tune, which is a problem when I switch to concert music. These however, are definitely worth it because you will most likely get more use out of it especially if you plan on practicing your saxophone. No need to make the reed moist.

Well if you like Brooke Shields captured on video using a camera with its lens smeared with Vaseline, then this movie may appeal to you. I've always had the opinion that anyone selling a VHS tape should clearly state whether it was recorded in the SP, LP, or EP mode. Why buy a movie if you can't sit through it because of poor visual quality?

Instead, I got a book that was only 187 pages long--many of them photographs--that only got to the meat of the investigation process at Chapter 4 (which, by the way, is on page 114!) The bulk of the book is devoted to the author's in-depth knowledge of the history of certain serial killers. I didn't need this information, and I don't suspect many other writers do, either.

Normally, you could modify the moves by performing them slower, but, because they are time crunch workouts (about 10 minutes each segment), you really don't have the time to do that. Definitely, not one of her better videos. The routines are easy, but because of the improper form used, not recommended for the beginner, as it could do my damage then good.

This book is an excellent overview of how the Mind functions to create our reality, color our perceptions, and drive our actions/reactions. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand more about the science of Mind and Buddhism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom from a master","review":"It has always struck me that the people who are the most nimble atpresenting complex topics simply are those with the most understandingand the least ego. Propelled by interest, they present ideas with quietenthusiasm. In his generally much shorter books written in a poetic,almost childlike voice, Thich Nhat Hanh consistently hints at the wealth ofBuddhist knowledge this book presents. The book outlines for me how very much more I stand to learn about this way of thinking, while allowing me in the meantime, ways to continue to practice fundamentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"a voice teacher and early music fan","review":"PLEASING TO THE EAR, BUT NO EXCITEMENT I FEAR!This is a pleasant album with a nice variety of songs some of which I have not previously encountered.Drew Minter's voice is correct in every way; that is: nice tone quality, accurate pitch and excellent diction. BUT there is no excitement to be had; there is no emotion to latch onto. He sings \\"O Solitude\\" just the same as he sings \\"Crown the Altar\\" which contain totally different meanings. His best renditions are: \\"Lord, What is Man\\" and \\"Be Welcome then,Great Sir\\". The only thing I detect that conveys some sense of drama are changes in volume.These songs can be very meaningful when the performer takes note of the song's message.The accompanying instruments are excellent and the album is worth buying if you are \\"hooked on\\" Purcell.But I suggest you try Michael Chance or David Daniels for exciting renditions of these wonderful songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not humorous...it is very tactless","review":"Where did you find this book on the New York Times Bestseller list reviewed by Jason Blair?Seriously, this book is not only offensive it is down right hurtful. Soldiers are dying trying to find Saddam and this author thinks it is material for a satire. Each page, and there are only approx. 16 or so, are filled with distasteful illustrations. Making light of torture chambers, Michael Jackson sitting in hell with two kids on his lap, or WMD's in the form of a vibrator is not funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view from Baghdad","review":"I came upon this book while serving in Baghdad and laughed out loud. Given the conditions under which we are living, any opportunity for a laugh is welcome.

I do understand and respect the views of those who found the book objectionable, but with respect, I disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Saddam? The answer is we've got him!","review":"This book was funny, but as of today, outdated. I am sure its price will go down now, as it quickly becomes a piece of nostalgia.

The only problem is, serious research conducted by disinterested researchers shows that whole language basically does not teach many children to read. It is especially malignant when it is used on our most vulnerable children--disadvantaged children--for whom direct and explict phonics instruction is almost a necessity. The self-pitying style of whole language writers (complaining that researchers and politicians are against them) is too ironic to imagine. Who weaps for children made illiterate by whole language? Certainly not its advocates and purveyors."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Wright Brothers","review":"Very good book for students in upper elementary and sixth grade middle school.

The handle is made for a small hand, the lead constantly gets stuck inside and you have to push the lock button a million times to free it.

Phone cord connections are not new and, in fact, the connection to the handset is quite secure, as you expect with phones who have handset and phone line connections. It is absurd and stupid to have these connections so insecure that important calls can be disrupted so easily. I might have rated it too high overall, but most of the electronic features of the instrument have worked OK, so I did not give it the lowest rating.

She weighs 50 lbs and was not even pulling that hard when the clip gave way. We live in a city and she is not car savvy, so it was quite a heart-stopping moment. After getting her home safely, I tested the clip by attaching the collar and pulling it in the direction of the pin - it popped open and released the collar ring with very little pressure! I had this problem with another leash, but (naively) trusted this one because it was from a 'good' manufacturer - never again! This appears to be another cheap, untested 'made in China' product. I will never walk my dog without thoroughly testing a leash again and will probably go back to using a carabiner as an extra reinforcement on all my leash clips. The lesson: when it comes to buying any dog/leash or collar, BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fitting Sweater for my Lhasa","review":"Very happy with this sweater...my Lhasa Apso is nearly the same color as the sweater and she's a 12.5 lb Lhasa and the sweater fits perfectly!

Not to worry. New tracks from Life In Slow Motion, including The One I Love, Nos Da Cariad and Lately make the first half of the show a roaring success, before Gray dips into the multimillion selling White Ladder archive for This Year's Love, Silver Lining and Babylon. A top notch band ensure that even the songs from the comparatively unloved A New Day At Midnight album sound powerful and emotionally charged. Nice one, wobbly head.

Why anyone would want to use a PVC compression fitting on 1-1/2-inch copper tubing is beyond me, $16 down the tubes for me because of a very poor listing, one naturally assumes that a 1-1/2-inch PVC compression coupling would fit PVC (and steel) pipe OD, when not specified.

Clifford analysis has recently emerged as a subject of fundamental importance in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Since the first text on the subject appeared in 1982, the field has undergone rapid and significant changes. Although the book under review is a conference proceedings, I found its introductory portions so well crafted that I was able to learn the fundamentals while being led to the frontiers of current knowledge. Obviously a lot of rigorous editorial work has gone in to make this far from the usual volume of proceedings. And the selection of material was no less careful, resulting in a broad spectrum of important research while avoiding fringe topics of little general interest. In addition, there is 16-page \\"Problem Book\\" where all participants got a rare chance to state what are, in their opinions, some of the great open problems in the field. Well-done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love them!","review":"I purchased these in \\"argento\\" (silver), and they are absolutely spectacular!

The base of the shoe is on the narrower side, so these look best if you have longer feet. They require no breaking in -- wear them comfortably straight out of the box. They are made in Italy, so I can't believe I scored these for just about $20!

When Tomie was 5 years old his house was picked up by a hurricane. So then Tomie had to move to 26 Fairmount Avenue. Tomie's house was going to be on a new street. But workers came and made the street very deep so it looks like it was on a hill. Tomie's mom started to cry. Finally New Years Eve came and some of Tomie's friends came over for the celebration. The excitement doesn't end there.I like this book because it is really relaxing and funny. The pictures are very detailed and the writing really keeps you interested.The author taught me a lesson that you just have to be patient and something might come to you.

The telling is dry. The events unexciting to young children. No doubt, however, that this book will likely be popular with dePaola's fans, of which I'm one. There is much biographical information to be gleened from it. However, it reads like an old man's memoir rather than a book for children. Tomie, whose strength is illustration, should stick with what he knows best. Obviously, someone at Putnam's must believe the corporate addage: Greed is good. There is simply no other reason to have published this lackluster title."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly bland","review":"As a fan of de Paolo's warm books, this novel was a real disappointment, full of bland generalizations and cliches. Worse yet, the tone was patronizing. As if kids do not know what an \\"outfit\\" is, the word appears in quotation marks, and the Easter holiday is described in similar simple terms. The whole book reminded me of a doddering relative's boring, yet endless (for such a brief book) dinner table rambling.

Some folks find bluegrass to be too shrill and hyperactive. You don't get that sense, even when they're frailing at top speeds.

There are sweet songs (Parlami D'amore, Mariu), cute songs (Palco della Scala) and then bittersweet songs (Addio, Songi Di Gloria and Rondine Al Nido.) This CD comes with liner notes and I recommend taking the extra few minutes to see what he's singing. It will enhance your enjoyment (although the music alone is enjoyment enough!) Mancini's arrangements are really what helps to make the difference.

I came upon it a bit late, but it was a great idea for Luciano Pavarotti and Herni (Enrico? ) Mancini to get together and introduce us all to these standard Italian favourites. Henri Mancini somehow knows just how to polish a tune and Pavarotti's \\"millenium\\" tenor puts in that last sparkle. I've fallen in love with \\"Parlami d'amore, Mariu.\\" and whistle/sing/hum it all the time. (The original by Vittorio de Sica must be interesting.)

I've never come by a weight loss pill that actually does anything and doesn't have health risks. Out of all the supplements I've tried this one makes me feel the best. It definately works as an energizer and maybe it's just the mentality of taking a pill and believing it is doing something, but I really feel better about myself when I'm taking it.

Lief and his obese buddy and the girls represent some Lion team or something. ANyway a superhot blonde is found dead and it is believed to be a suicide, but another cheerleader who has 'dreams' suspects foul play. So we have another 90 minutes of boredom and stupidity as we await the final outcome. If you've seen as many 80's slasher flicks as I have, you'll guess the killer with 5 minutes.Lief's acting is deplorable, even for a B flick. Teri Weigel, although very hot, cannot even steal a scene when she's the only one on camera.

Crap. The film is called Bloody Pom Poms but renamed to Cheerleader Camp. I dont know why and it's never fully explained in the booklet. It's a horror comedy but has more comedy with one really good kill. The cast was decent with some hot cheerleaders, of course. They had a fat guy who was funny and seemed to blend in quite well with the cheerleaders. It was a breath of fresh air they didnt make fun of his weight and make him a joke thru out the film. The story has been done countless times before and alot of characters could have added to the story, were misused. Hell I viewed the film once and cannot remember half of it and i'm not drunk or stoned. Well its not as bad as horror films of today, its not one i'd recommend.

Nothing ever really happens until the ending, and after all the build up, most of the murders occur offscreen! So, basically, there's no payoff. What a waste of a great set-up an an eager, game cast.

Additionally, I was supremely disappointed in the plot of the film as it relates to Gohan's involvment.It is obvious from the film that Broly's ultra-super saiyan form is more powerful than Gohan as a super saiyan, which is as it should be. However, at this point in the Dragonball timeline, Gohan can ascend to super saiyan 2.Unfortunately, the writers of this film chose to ignore this ability, which, presumaby, could have led to the defeat of Broly. Clearly, this ability was ignored to rationalize the presence of Goku in the film - a very poor choice in my opinion.If you are like me and watch these films for the artwork, soundtrack, and transformations to higher levels of consciousness (and the associated drama), then I think you will feel a bit let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah... uhm..

Wow. My friend loaned my the first and second Broly movies. Obviously I watched the first one first, and then the second one. I thought the first one was piss poor. It takes everyone in the Dragonball galaxy to take him out, and Vegeta is a coward. And if he's so strong, why does nobody go to SSJ2? Or SSJ3? So I thought the second would be better. Boy was I wrong. In the first movie, Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Future Trunks, Gohan and Krillin couldn't defeat Broly. In the second one, Broly has trouble even putting a scratch on Chibi Trunks and Goten. This movie is what the DBZ staff and FUNimation do when they're bored. Do I dare watch Bio Broly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"broly 2 is pretty good............","review":"I REALY LIKED THIS MOVIE BECUSE IT BRINGS GOTEN AND TRUNKS TOGETHER AND YOU GET TO SEE VIDEL, WHO DOSEN'T GET MUCH AIR TIME.ALTHOUGH THEY SREWED UP WITH THE TRANSLATION A LITTLE- SO MY ADVICE IS TO WATCH IT IN JAPENESS WITH SUBTITLES.

Sure Trunks and Goten can be amusing, but this is too much. Not only that, Broly comes across as a real dufuss in this one - the endless repetition of his grunted one line gets really annoying and in itself merits the whooping that he gets in the end. Broly was a ruthless villian bent on destruction in his first appearance, but he just kind 'floats around' in this one not really doing much of anything. I'd like to say that there is hope, but Bio Broly is even worse..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a weaker DBZ flick.","review":"Movie 10, which featured the return of Broly, is definitely in the \\"bad\\" list. In it, Goten, Trunks, and Videl are searching for the Dragonballs. Eventually though, Broly(because at one point Goten cries and it awakens him) attacks, having landed on Earth. Gohan eventually joins in on the mix(Krillin too!), but Broly's too strong even for him and things don't look good as a result. It's going to take a miracle to defeat Broly. Personally, this film didn't really go anywhere. I lost interest about halfway through it. The ending is also quite stupid. It's a complete rip-off of the Cell saga ending.

In this one, Broly has barely survived his last encounter with Goku and is hiding deep in the mountains on Earth, recuperating. Now Broly has come back for some violence, and Goten, Trunks, and Gohan are the unfortunate ones who stumble accross him. This movie, like Bojack Unbound, dousn't have very much combat, mostly Broly just slapping Trunks but not trying to kill him. It gets more interesting when Gohan comes around, because then Broly remembers his face and he starts kicking @$$. It's pretty laid back, but it's still worth buying, at least on VHS.

Let me clarify that I like bitter flavors- I love radicchio in my salad, drink goldenseal tea, and love Angostora bitters on a sugar cube for a pick-me-up. Therefore, when I spotted Sanbitter at an Italian grocer I had to try it. I think this is what I sputtered out after the first sip: \\"Dear God, that is the worst tasting thing I've ever had\\" and \\"I never thought I'd taste that cherry fluoride the dental students painted on my teeth again.\\" Enough said.

Different and complex. Enjoy.p.s. I'm an American. So no, you don't have to be Italian or European to enjoy this.p.p.s.

The plot is thin and, worse, the hero seemed morally weak, jumping to the villain's tune like one of Pavlov's dogs.

If installed correctly I have never had one come down, even when hanging more than the recommended weight on them. I have them on painted surfaces and on the backs of doors. I even hang my heavy full length terry cloth robe on it when it is wet after a shower. I know it weighs more than the 7.5.lbs for the jumbo hook. I think that the key is to put the adhesive strip on as directed and then hold it in place firmly for at least a minute. Then do not hang anything on it until the next day. I have had some of these hooks up for years and have never had a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I purchased these hooks to put up some holiday garland and they were absolutely horrible.

Regular tape will hold better than these absolute rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not stick to wall - caused injury","review":"I found that the command hook did not adhere to the wall as well as I had expected; my husband hung a robe from it and it fell right off the wall and then stuck to the floor.

The sticker didn't fail. The problem was that the paint and plaster peel off after months of stress. So now my walls have these big 3 inch scrapes where the plaster peeled off. Much worse than having a nail hole. The smaller hooks though, are still holding up well. I wouldn't recommend hanging anything more than 3 pounds off of these for more than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but. . .","review":"These might work well on tile, stainless steel or other solid smooth surface, but they are advertized to work well on regualar painted walls and this has NOT been my experience. I mounted several 1lb or less pictures with the hooks rated at 2lb, and after a few days, they came tumbling down. I hung one of the same pictures up with the large hook with the same result. I think they stick ok to the paint, as in each case the paint and some of the drywall paper came off with the hook. The problem is that small areas of the wall are just not made to handle that much stress (my theory), so after I repair my walls, I will be going back to traditional picture hanging methods. With this poor experience, I'm NOT going to test my theory with regards to other types of surfaces - it's not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filler","review":"Command hooks are always good to have around the house.

Then, the remote started to work very strangely. The play button would change tracks. The stop button would sometimes change the volume and sometimes turn the bass on and off. The bass button did nothing. The rewind and fast-forward buttons selected random tracks, rather than going back one track or forward one track. To me, the remote is a very important part of this walkman, especially on the go. I don't want to dig into the belt where my player is and fool around with it every time I need to. And now, the remote doesn't work at all. The same problem happened with the previous player I had, which is the same product. But that one had a longer life span.Other than the remote, the player works fine. The sound is good, but I don't know about the radio, since I don't listen to the radio.

Also, it is based on the graphic novel, with many of the best parts removed. With only 209 pages a lot of stuff just did not make it into the novel - but the stuff they cut out was either very important or really cool. What we get as a result is somewhat bland, like pudding without any flavor. Good to fill in the time between GOOD books, but nothing to bother with. Start with Prey and end with Hunter's Planet. DON'T get this book, new, used, downloaded. Just don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent read.","review":"I love the AVP series but this one felt a little out there. I understand perhaps a certain Predator or pack deciding to return to hunt humans as they are off limits and a proud creature would like to test their metal against that which he is not allowed to, but the fact that she was with them while they did it seemed to make them look ignorant. Like she wouldn't ever notice? It de-humanized them greatly but still I guess it was the only way to write her out of their pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well at least its better then the last one","review":"From all the other reviews I have seen I agree with Cody Menzies the most. The only two things that made me finish this book was the fact that it is a AvP novel and that it continues the Aliens: Berserker storline. However it is still a vast improvement to the last book, of which I feel should not even be in print any more. S.D. Perry is a great writer and should be able to do better then this. The first one was great so what I want to know is what went wrong? But as soon as you get by the errors in this story you will be in for a some what pleasing read. Just don't go thinking you are going to like it as much as Prey or Berserker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's forget this book ever happened.","review":"When AVP:War came out by SD Perry after 4 yrs when she wrote the first AvP: Prey novel, I was overjoyed that she came back to write another novel. Gee I was sorely disappointed. The book failed to follow the timeline of the series. The Predators were underated, the Marine main characters overated and overemphasized, and you hardly ever see Machiko (hardly had a role and her character was misdeveloped) in the book. Some of the Pred characters are back from the book Hunter's Planet by David Bishoff. But how can that be (Those who read Hunter's Planet would know what I mean). Aliens were harly in it either. Lack of consistency with the AvP novel timeline as well as lack of species development; as well as a lack of character dev. and epilogue in addition. I have been a AVP fan for a long time and well I was dismayed to say the least. Maybe she should go back and write Resident Evil novels, she wrote those well anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perverse and a very passe.","review":"This took us through a world unrelated in the name of \\"archetypes\\".

As a person who is very aware of the wonderful books on meditation available today, of which Kabat-Zinn's Wherever You Go There You Are is one, I recommend that you not waste your time and energy on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming to Our Senses","review":"Kabat-Zinn's writing is accessible and understandable to those who may not be well-versed in meditation techniques and the concept of mindfulness. He is able to convey to newcomers how to practice mindfulness in every day activities, provides very helpful analogies and images, and gives the reader a concrete idea of the benefits received from practicing mindfulness. He is the best author out there on this subject that I have come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"how awful is awful? read this book to find out","review":"actually, i couldn't read this book. i couldn't get through it. all i can say is this guy needs to stop over analizing meditation and do more of it. i know, i know - he has creditials but that didn't change the fact that i often found myself exhausted by the run - ons in this book. most sentences are a paragragh long. maybe jon just likes to hear himself talk and is facinated by his own mind's constant banter. if you want to read from an author who clearly has incorporated meditaion and mindfulness in their very being try thich nhat hanh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good observations, but mostly new age rubbish","review":"After seeing Jon Kabat-Zinn on McLaughlin's One-on-One I was intrigued and decided to buy this book. I was sorely disappointed. He makes some good observations (e.g. about ADD and the 24/7 lifestyle), but offers solutions based only on far-eastern philosophies (yoga, meditation, etc). Not what I expected. I would not recommend this book to devout Christians or Muslims. Better stick with the Bible or the Koran, or the writings of accomplished Biblical or Koranic scholars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow It Really Works!","review":"I started paying attention to the physical reactions my body has to stressful situations and thoughts about a month ago.

I have been reading a 'chapter' (about 5 pages) every morning. It really helps me to be more present in my life and has a lot of tidbits of historical reference, mostly about Budhism and meditation.It was good to start with 'Wherever you go', since it seems that 'Coming to our Senses' is a bit more of a commitment to read and ponder.A great book for those seeking to find more peace with their world.

I'll admit here and now, I haven't read very much of it -- mostly because it's too painful to read. The writing is extremely stilted, unemotional, and unrealistic, almost like the author is writing a report rather than a romance. It made me wonder if this was a story written by Coffman in earlier days that she's recently decided to recycle. I hope so -- otherwise I'll think twice about buying future books from her.

As indicated in the title, this movie plays like soft core pornography in many scenes (Eyes Wide Shut is tame next to this one) and the actors in their limited depth give solid B movie performances. Richard Grieco is the closest to quality acting this film has, and he basically grunts and smolders his way through each scene, bad boy that he's trying to be.I gave it two stars because the ending actually kept me guessing and caught me by surprise, and up until that point I'd had it pinned as pretty formulaic. Other than that, it's pretty much a wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angie's hot, but not worth buying","review":"This is a barebones DVD, 90 minutes long, that reminds me of other erotic thrillers like Basic Instinct (with Sharon Stone) or Body of Evidence (with Madonna). Here, we get to see Angie Everhart act as a sex freak, and she has two really nice love scenes where she bares all, each scene lasting about a minute each.Richard Grieco does an OK job, but at certain points, he does seem like he's sleepwalking through this role. It's amazing how badly his TV/movie career has stumbled to be starring in direct-to-video movies like this one.This DVD is indeed barebones, not even a theatrical trailer or cast filmography. Just audio, subtitles, and chapter selection.This DVD's worth a rental just to see Angie in the buff, as well as a few other women, but otherwise, it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely nice","review":"Here in EUrope is already out, since 5 days. Is a nice moovie compared to the rest of the moies where she played. I have lot from them, where she's a star, but in this one (even if she's finally naked...) she is great. The characters she play is OK, the rest of the cast is OK. There are sex scenes absolutely nice, and she look excellent.... Hope for her is the first step for a series of decent movies now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy acting, but Grieco's a real hunk!","review":"The plot has definate potential, but the movie was unfortunately ruined by poor acting from both stars, neither of whom seemed capable of reading their lines with any emotion at all. The ninety minutes I spent watching this film was saved from being a total waste only by the sight of Richard Grieco, however -- his acting talents might be minimal, but his sex appeal kept me glued to the screen. And male viewers will be equally appreciative of Angie Everhart's nude scenes. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angie Everhart","review":"Angie Everhart's combination of tease and delivery two or three times made this movie worth the extra cost and wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise the Lord for Joel Osteen!","review":"God brought Joel Osteen into my life at a time when I really needed him and I have listened and watched him ever since then.

To me, the most compelling indictment against the book comes from a post by a reader who found it refreshing for this reason: it didn't push scripture on the reader the way another Christian author did.Is that supposed to be considered a plus?Mr. Osteen should take heed of this backward compliment and understand that his book is drawing people to this life and not to the next; to self and not to Christ.What are we to make of this from the book of Hebrews: \\"...you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.\\" This great encouragement to materially bereft Christians appears antithetical to the premise of Mr. Osteen's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sincere Simpleton","review":"Steer clear of this product of the underbelly of shallow charismatic Christianity.

A title like the one on Mr. Osteen's book says nothing about humility. I admit that I have not read the book, but I also am letting it be known that it is not worth wasting your finite time here on Earth reading it when it's evident that Mr. Osteen is, at best, an Arminian heretic mixed with postive-confessionism.

Osteen is just another in the ancient line up of con men using the Christian religion and its Bible to bilk the disenfranched, depressed, and misguided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Great book i love Joel Osteen. Originally received wrong book but was sent the right one. Thanks! I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I am just 1/2 through this book. I find it very satisfying,and inspirational since the death of my husband. I have been struggling with different emotions and this book has mentioned everyone of those emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Positive Book that is Weak on the Gospel","review":"Joel Osteen has the best of intentions. I believe he is trying to break the cloud of bondage, heaviness, and depression that hangs over many people today. But his positive, encouraging spirit seems to be borrowed from an author of another era--Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Peale wrote about positive thinking in the 1950s and influenced many people (including Dr. Robert Schuller's \\"possibility thinking\\"). Like Peale and Schuller, Osteen never fully explains the reason Christ died on the cross for our sins--that we are law-breakers under the wrath of God unless we repent and have faith in Jesus Christ.Osteen's book will lift your spirits and give you a big pat on the back (as well as a hug and a kiss), but he misses the mark on that which is the most important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats in it for me Christianity","review":"What he teaches is a \\"what can God do for me?\\" Christianity, when in fact the opposite should be our attitude: What can I do for You Lord? God didn't put us on this earth to see what kind of a wonderful life we could make for ourselves, but simply to serve Him. I gave it 2 stars because the chapter on giving is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, and misunderstood","review":"Having just finished listening to all 5 discs comprising the audio CD version of this book, I am convinced that those reviewers who are so vehemently condemning the book must not have actually read it. Did they not notice that the author spends fully HALF THE BOOK exhorting the reader to acts of Christian kindness and charity and cautioning against falling into the trap of selfishness and narcissism? And what on earth is wrong with attaining a positive self-image and viewing ourselves the way God does? What on earth could possibly be wrong with claiming in faith the blessings and restorative power of the Holy Spirit in times of financial adversity??I think this is a great book, an eloquent reminder of the reality of who we are in relation to God. That so many guilt freaks would see fit to condemn the book is utterly dismaying to me. I suggest you buy it, read/listen, and decide for yourself. But you have to get through the whole thing, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Man Centered Book","review":"Being a Christian is about worshiping God and not ourselves. This is another man centered, self help book. There is not that much Christian in the book except for using Christian vocabulary. The Gospel is Great news, but Olsteen preaches a false half Gospel. Jesus commands us to repent from our sins. He doesn't suggest or even ask, He commands. Joel Osteen said himself that he does not use the word sin, there for he is not preaching the Gospel of the Bible. He is preaching a wealth, health and prosperity gospel that is not in the Bible. This book is damaging, and Christians need to learn how to discern. Some reviewer states that Osteen makes alter calls, but how can you make an alter call if you haven't even presented the real gospel. Instead you get false converts that want Jesus to be their magic jeanie. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A closer parking spot or A Closer Walk With Thee","review":"According to the Bible, God spent six days creating the earth, the sea, the firmaments....and now He's got nothing better to do in his leisure time than listen to and grant bonus coupons to people like Joel whose main heart's desire is a closer parking space next to the Safeway or Bloomingdales?

From page 1, Mr. Osteen glorifies money and the things it can buy. It's no wonder that this book is a huge success as we are living in a highly narcissistic society. I think if God meant for us to be rich, He would have had His son live in a golden temple while on earth. I also do not think that God gives a damn about whether we get a blouse on sale or a parking space close to the mall. This book does not represent a Christian attitude; it plays on the \\"I think, therefore, I am\\" concept, which can be effective as our minds are capable of great things. I threw this book in the trash bin where it obviously belonged."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed the power","review":"Joel has millions of fans and ghost writers must be busy, these books lack the POWER of JESUS and his NAME and authority given to every believer. weak,,,watered down,,,,fluff,, For DEMON and ANGELS read Hagins books oin VISIONS, HEALING and DEMONS,,the books not booklets for a penny...u will be blessed"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"My Husband loves Joel Osteen and so I got it for he for a Christmas Gift.I also love this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous.","review":"Jesus Christ did not sacrifice himself on the cross so we can be blessed with material things, and be 'happy'. He did it so that we can repent of our sin, and receive God's gift of salvation and eternal life. Our sanctification includes necessary tough times, including times of personal great loss and sadness. These are used by God to grow us in holiness so that we might achieve God's plan for us. Taking scripture out of context to 'prove' a point is dangerous, deceptive and destructive. It was used by Satan at Jesus' temptation. Avoid this book, and all others not grounded in truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it all about the money?","review":"I used to admire Joel Osteen mainly because my family watched him on TV and enjoyed his sermons....then as I grew in Christ I started asking \\"Where is the substance? Where is the content?\\"I agree with another viewer. I think Joel just inherited this business (not ministry) and ran with it.If you are into \\"feel-good\\" preachers who don't preach Salvation through Christ, but tell how God wants to supposedly bless everyone financially, then this may be the thing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misdirected Message","review":"The euphoria filled religion-through-television crowd will rally enthusiastically around this self-promoter. Frenzied fundamentalists love this stuff. This is easy to buy into if you believe that Jesus' message centers around making yourself comfortable as opposed to directing comfort to those who live hard lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel gives fuel to the empty soul","review":"I read this book within 4 hours on a flight. It really changed my perspective on life and how to put a painful past behind me. I have bought at least 10 books for my friends whom are going through some very trying times. I can't speak for them but I know it's altered their lives and thinking.It's an easy read book you won't want to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another self help book","review":"I was disappointed to find that this was just another Carnegie-style self help book. It may be just the ticket for the \\"seeker\\" but if you are a faithful follower of Christ you won't find anything of biblical value. There wasn't a single concept that I hadn't already learned somewhere in a non-christian positive thinking self-help seminar or book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reminders","review":"After having seen Joel on tv several times, I decided to get his book. If there is one thing we should all love about this guy, it is his great, and very positive attitude. We know how important this is, and yet most of us forget it. I was reminded of this and many things that I needed to be reminded of. This is a book that just about anyone would benefit from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Forward","review":"My son purchased this book for me. I started reading a chapter a day. I thank God for giving Joel the gift of being able to write this book so that so many others may walk in God's favor. So many things I have taken for granted like my personality, communication skills, and compassion I realize that these are gifts God gave me to use in his honor. I don't know where I am going but I am on my way.Because I have read this book I have purchased the Journal to enrich and deepen my knowledge of what this book is teaching me.

Christ came so that we may have life and have it more abundently and I am not talking about money here although that could be if God wills.

This book is wonderful and I really admire Joel for stepping up and spreading this message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book to read in 05'","review":"Joel Osteen is an excellent writter, who will touch anyone with an open heart and mind. A spiritual awakening for any believer or nonbeliever. It helps someone who feels depressed, burdened, or seeking to have a better relationship with the Lord. Everyone should read this book.

The Lord will definately bless him, for how many lives he will touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is negative better?","review":"I am always amazed to see people comment on Joels' unrealistic, positive attitude, etc. Would these critics be happier if say, they turned on the TV next week and saw him complaining and being negative?Come 'on. Let's give this guy a break. Isn't his book and tv appearances, doing more to help Gods cause, opposed to if there was no Joel Osteen?Sad but true, people will always criticize God's workers. But then that's no surprise, since Jesus warned us about this in advance.Keep on truckin' Joel!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possitive and Incouraging","review":"I am about half way through the book and I have been greatly encouraged by it. When I am feeling down and read it it gives me some renewed strength. I am personally a realist and reality can get you down. I am from Katrina Ville which has been mentally challenging. It was hard loosing our home, business location and a lot of friends. Although I was fully insured and we are doing well the realization that you can loose it all so fast is depressing. So many that have gone through it are not even as fortunate as I am. So many around the world would love to trade places with me.I am reading this one slowly and trying to absorb as much as I can. Joel Osteen has been able to reach me with his positive message when others just couldn't.

Could it be that my review is just as much fluff as this book? Or is it a conspiracy? Is Joel Osteen having an affair with Mr. Amazon so when somebody writes a bad review Mr. Amazon deletes it? Es Possible!Here is my problem this book is fluff. It says be rich, be happy, who cares about the poor? As long as you are happy you will get to heaven. See any parallels to Jesus's message? Neither do I. It is the new corporatization and watering down of Christianity in America. Coming next, taking your Sunday service in pill form while you shop for a new Hummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grace With An Asterisk*","review":"So in this book, Osteen tells me God loves me and wants to prosper me beyond what I could think or imagine. He says I am the apple of God's eye. He says that God looks at \\"my two good moves\\" instead of the many times I mess up. He says that God loves me like a father and holds nothing against me. He says I should look forward to the future and forget the past.BUT* (Here's the fine print), If I am one of the millions not able to hear the message of Jesus Christ, or if I am a Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, B'ahai, or whatever, I am toast for eternity.

He uses bible verses out of context to show you that God has locked tremendous power within you and it is up to you to use your \\"happy thoughts\\" in order to release it.What about the fact that we are worthless sinners who need to cling to the cross of christ for our only salvation?Our best life now and forever comes from the total sacrifice for our sins that Christ made for us on the cross.

Osteen delivers a thought-provoking message that will truly help believers fight the good fight of faith, receive the promises of God with obedient living and the faith of a mustard seed. Too many believe that having a positive attitude is all it takes to have a successful life but Joel Osteen provides the missing link-the power of Jesus Christ. The Bible reminds us to meditate on the Word of God day and night and then we shall make our way PROSPEROUS and have GOOD SUCCESS.Pick up this book today.

He is just trying to get people to keep a postive attitude about life in general and not dwell on negative things, it will only bring your spirit and you health down. His stories keep you reading and its an easy read. I enjoyed the book, its non-denominational and all you have to do to read it is have a heart and sense of humor.

He has a Scripture index at the back of his book, but you cannot discern how or where he's using the verses in each chapter.

But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

There is absolutely nothing Biblical in this book, and most of the time he does not even try to pretend that it is Biblical. He makes unqualified statements like, \\"God only sees your two good moves\\", and does not give any evidence that that idea is anywhere in scripture. He leaves out the whole idea of sin and pretends that God is happy with everyone no matter what they do. He promotes the prosperity gospel which is not Biblical in any way whatsoever.

Not the best choice. Collectively, we got through Ch. 2 (I read on through Ch. 9) and learned that when Joel Osteen gets on a plane in coach, he prays and God moves him up to first class.All of the first portion of the book was dedicated to financial success and how God wants you to be wealthy. It was completely under the \\"ask and you shall receive\\" mentality; which is tricky because some people are dealing with truly unfair life situations and, by this mentality, they should have just asked God for things to go better.We scrapped the book very quickly.

How can a \\"Christian\\" book not even mention Christ's substitutionary atonement in an eleven page chapter on forgiveness?How can multiple chapters on feeling good about yourself not even hint at the doctrine of justification? The reviewers who love this book don't even understand why this upsets me or what I am writing about, and that is truly sad. St.Paul wrote \\"for I was determined to know nothing among you but Christ crucified.\\" Joel Osteen's approach seems to be \\"for I am determined to proclaim anything but Christ crucified.\\" Over two millenia, millions have been martyred for the cause of Christ.

Until I read this book, I hadn't realized how far I'd drifted from basics I knew were true and that made a positive difference. I hadn't realized how negative some of my attitudes had become, attitudes I began to see reflected in my adult children.Osteen brought me back to center, to my foundation: God is good; He loves me and wants the very best for me.

I generally trust the Gerber brand, so I decided to take a chance on this blade. I was looking for something to replace my well used Paraframe, so i was interested by the look when I saw this. Once I got it I was immediately impressed by this knife. Very light in hand, and for my hand fits nicely. I like the combo style blades, but the straighter blade of this EVO feels better than the angular blade of the Paraframe. The blade is thinner but so far I haven't noticed any functionally issues due to this. I recommend this knife to any hikers, backpackers, survivalists or anyone that wants a solid, all around good pocket knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came up short","review":"The blade length is listed as 4.84-inches, but the actual blade length, even stated on the box I received, is 3.5 inches. I don't feel like going through the hassle to return this item, because the mistake was not on my end to begin with. I also noticed that in the item description for the Evo \\"Junior,\\" they don't even list the blade length, but if you look it up elsewhere it is 2.5 inches for the junior. I don't get it? Why is it so difficult to get the length correct for the Evo and Evo junior on here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice knife","review":"I cannot attest to its endurability but on my first camping trip this knife was the new star player of my gear. Very sharp out the box and so light I didn't even remember I had it clipped to my pocket a few times. It tore through tough steak like a laser!The finger flip is great but the thumb flip is almost useless and need to be modified; I'm not sure how I could even do this but I will probably try.Overall a great knife for the price.Update: Used it on a piece of flint and the blade dinged very easily. Used the back of the knife instead and this was damaged also. The steel is alot softer than I previously thought but for the price I still recommend this knife. Just don't use it like its invincible, its only a Gerber... I wouldn't depend on this knife with my life, I'll be buying a different one and keeping this as a back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heck of a knife.","review":"This is a good value.

He's easier to affix to his base than most of the other dragons are, he is the ONLY water dragon with a smooth, hydrodynamic body devoid of the rugged scales more common with land dragons, and he has one of the most detailed bases of any of them, complete with a sinking ship and its stranded inhabitants. The only thing I didn't like about him was that one of his wings isn't permanently attached to his body, and mine doesn't fit into the body as snugly as I would like.

Boy, was I disappointed! My daughter opened this gift, emptied out the contents, looked over each item, and then left it there on the living room floor. After checking it out, I don't blame her. There really isn't much here to keep a 3 year old interested. They'd much rather have something as close to what mom has. Everything is made of cheap plastic, no moving parts, no buttons, nothing to manipulate. Yes, it would be good for pretend, but I think a 1 to 2 year old might enjoy it more for it's simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of our daughter's favorite toys","review":"Our almost 2-year old daughter got this for Christmas, and she still plays with it several months later.

She loved it for about ten seconds. The contence are not very interactive and nothing that makes you say wow! She ended up filling the bag part with other things.

She put a bunch of baby clothes in it and played with it for a long time. The upside and maybe even down side to this game is that it gives a small child a credit card. On one hand it teaches them about credit but it can also lead to children believing that money/credit is easy to have/use. However because the girft was for a 1-2 year old this really shouldn't matter. As for the durability she plays hard and it has lasted her so i believe it is a good buy for so much product. Mirror isn't good but it serves it's purpose.

Initially she enjoyed the purse and everything in it; within a week she had lost interest in all but the cell phone. For another week she enjoyed imitating her Mommy by walking around with the cell phone propped between her ear and shoulder, but it too was soon forgotten. During a resent visit I noticed the purse at the bottom of her toy box. It was doomed. Understandable some toys are not intended to hold a child's attention over a long period of time because their sole purpose is to provide entertainment for the child until the novelty fades. I prefer buying toys that my grandchildren will enjoy for longer than a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"My mom got this for my daughter's 2nd birthday - my mom is a purse fanactic and is trying to turn my kids into one too!:) My daughter loves it, she loves the play lipstick and mirror.

It doesn't come with any play money, so she took the money out of her cash register to put in the play compact which she calls her wallet - now she has money.

Its definitions are dry, informative ones, and cover a wide- range of entries though one can feel a British focus.Where I found it inadequate was in giving evaluations of the playwrights and works. For instance in the Arthur Miller entry there is no mention of the fact that 'Death of a Salesman' is still considered his most important work. And there is no explanation whatsoever of what that importance is. So too in the Shakespeare entry we get an overall classification of the plays in three periods without real description of the overall significance of Shakespeare's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba is great no matter when or where she performs","review":"Can't say anything bad about Reba, her talent shines through no matter when or at what age she performs.

I had to lubricate the bases where the upright poles thread into the base and they were sturdy before I put the speaker bracket on. I am not sure if there were extra welds in the base (or poor quality control) that attach to the stands, but they sit crooked (NOT level) on top of the poles. It is kind of pointless to have speaker stands that support weight at an angle. Unfortunately, the seller I purchased from required me to pay return shipping and these stands weigh too much and have odd box dimensions to warrant paying that much in shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"The stands showed up in good condition, no parts missing. I used them for 8lb. speakers. The speakers aren't really square, they have cut off corners, so the clamp base of the stand wouldn't hold the speakers secure, had to use wood screws from the bottom to hold the speakers to the stand. (Something to consider if your speakers are not squared bottom).)For the price the stands were exactly what I needed. My only warning would be, if you have toddlers running around I would think twice about these stands, with an 8lb speaker on them they are a little top heavy.

However, for the money, they serve their purpose and look good doing it. My speakers are a little on the large size and heavy, but the stand holds them fairly well. If I bump the stand, they sway from the pipe flexing, but the base is solid. Getting the speakers level is a little frustrating, but for the price, I can't complain.

One might quarrel at times with the Jackson interpretation, but there is no doubt that he took Tolkien seriously.This is not an impression one gets with these animated cartoons. They might be described as Tolkien for children--in the worst sense of this expression, because it seems to be assumed here that children are not beings one need bother about.While there is little if anything redeemable about the Lord of the Rings cartoons per se (that is, the cartoons that purport to cover the story told in Tolkien's huge trilogy), the same cannot be said of the cartoon version of The Hobbit.

And that is saying a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"The only film here that is even remotely good is the Hobbit. Bakshi's Lord of the Rings is dreadfully dull, choppy and poorly animated, and is so inferior to the recent live-action films as to be unwatchable.

The Books as well as the DVD's, should be sought out for reading and watching, by all ages of children. With a wonderful cast, that delivered their characters to Oscar status and with Jackson's vision of the Tolken story so well directed that at times I knew he had been reading my mind. I fell in love with the trilogy when I read it and I was only 22, and now at the age of 51, Jackson, his vision, and wonderful cast, have given back to me encouragement, adventure, warmth and love, and most of all that no one anywhere will be alone.

Ever since I was a child I have compared every animated film to this one, and but for the recent technological advance in animation, I have always believed that Lord had the best.I echo the comments that Return of the King was a huge letdown after the first two animated films.

The hobbits are drawn well, except for Sam, who is for some reason turned into a blithering idiot. Legolas looks like a bad plastic surgery \\"after\\", and Galadriel looks too much like Swan Lake Barbie to be believable as the elven queen.The story remains true to the book, though, so it's a good way to introduce kids to the story of LOTR...just try not to look directly at the rotoscoped orcs and Uruk'hai, who look like the Sandpeople from Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Redo","review":"I have these films on VHS, purchased years ago.

The digitization of the films on DVD was excelent but without the original words and sound affects I would recomend a redo."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST LOVE LORD OF THE RINGS IN ANY FORM..","review":"I already had this boxed set but I have a son-in-law that wanted it as he has all the movies and figurines.

We find much outabout the man himself (Count Fersen) from reading hisown thoughts written in letters to his father and othersand from their letters to him. This book is definitelywell worth the read and to have as a resource on thehappenings during the French and American Revolution.If I had it to do all over again, I would buy thehard cover edition though.

It is not a new book. The original was an excellent book, but if you already read/own it, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I too was disappointed that it was \\"The Miracle Strain\\" with a different name.

I'm not sure how to explain this without giving away too much of the book. So, if plan on reading the book and you want to be surprised read no further.....The book is about the search for the \\"messiah\\" by matching his DNA. In chapter 19 they search their own database. In chapter 21 they are surprised when they find the messiah's DNA in someone else's database. The problem is the DNA was entered into their own database in chater 10. So, why didn't they find it when they searched their own database?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Messiah Code - Michael Cordy","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers that the plot was really interesting and the book very good. I thought the characters were developed well, and the scientific information necessary to further the story was presented clearly at the right level. I did not figure this one out until right before the major twist was revealed, and really enjoyed the ending. I will definitely read more of Cordy's books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"It is hard for me to find an author that I can enjoy reading. Michael Cordy is a pleasure to read. I also enjoy reading some Koontz books and all of Dan Brown's.Good story line, interesting characters, just enough twist and turns for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Basics: Step 2, Acoustic","review":"This was the first instructional guitar video I obtained, and after playing the guitar for some years now, I still refer to it.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but short guitar instruction","review":"Guitar Basics was a very good instructional video. It covered a lot of information that is very applicable to beginners. I wish it would have been a bit longer. A 30 minute video is tough to take a whole lot out of. Its great for a single sitting, but I wish it would have been a bit more in-depth. Overall it was a very good video with a bunch of great info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas Present I ever gave","review":"My father is hard to buy for. On a hunch, I bought him this CD, as I knew he was thinking about the war a lot. In all honesty, I thought he would play the CD once, and that would be it. At least once a month, my father comments on how much he values this album. He never removes it from his player. It has moved him and, in its own way, I think, provided some sense of peace about a troubled time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful resource to teach people how to do ministry in a way that pleases God","review":"God used this book to help me teach His people how to do ministry at a critical time in the churches life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good detective yarn, even with the golf....","review":"A Jewish publicist who is an amateur detective, Coben's character Myron Bolitar is always fun. This is a murder mystery associated with the game of golf. You don't have to be an expert in golf, though, as Myron certainly isn't. Lots of twists and turns. A good detective yarn. Yeah, I know, this is an \\"old book\\" by today's standards, but isn't it nice to go back in an author's opus and find enjoyable reading?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!!","review":"Great product; it was exactly what I expected from the author!! Harlen Coben is a literary genius <3 Love this and all his books - can't get enough!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does \\"Classic\\" mean previously released?","review":"This is not a new story. Back Spin was the 4th release in the Myron Bolitar series. Also, this is not the first time Harlan Coban has released one of his older works without making it clear that it was a redo."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book...","review":"It kept me guessing and had the typical Coben twists. However, I like his non-Myron Bolitar books better. If you liked this book, then you will love Tell No One, The Innocent, Gone for Good, and No Second Chances. You really can't go wrong with Harlan Coben for a wonderfully written suspense thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the plot?","review":"If the plot is about golf and you're not a golfer is boring.If the plot is about kidnapping you'll read almost zilch about it.If the plot is about repartees forget it.So read another book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listen!","review":"We are very fond of Harlen Coben books so when I found this one in audio format I jumped at it. It did not disappoint. The story kept us entertained from Sacramento CA to Portland Or. We both love golf and this has its setting in the world of professional golf. Lots of characters and a surprising plot twist at the end. We would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"As usual, Harlan Coben delivers once again. I am a fan of his books, especially the Myron Bolitar series, and was not disappointed in Back Spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent action","review":"One of Coben's early novels, this is one of the best ones in my opinion.

So glad I bought six of his books , have now finished all of them and loved each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I never ceases to amaze me just how mystery writers, especially Harlan Coben, can inventsuch devious, evil and self-serving characters. The twists abound and continue to the veryend of BACK SPIN. His unique grasp of current language is also worthy of mention -- he'squite a fun guy, indeed. I recommend this installment of the Myron Bolitar series withoutreservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Harlan Coben has a lovely style of writing. He consistently produces great story lines, usually with a good twist. This book is no exception. His laid back sense of homour is very refreshing. Like his other books, this is a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story - terrible editing","review":"I am a big fan of Harlan Coben, but I can barely finish this edition of Back Spin. The editing is abysmal - there is an error on every second page. Most pronouns are capitalized and sentences begin with a lower case letter. The characters speak all in the same paragraph, so it is difficult to follow the narrative. I am new to Kindle. Is this what I will expect from this ebook format?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Really... I didn't like it. Not so horrible, but boring. I've read a lot of Harlan's books and loved all of them, but this one didn't seduce me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately decent performances marred by poor acoustics","review":"Sawallish's performances of the Dvorak Overtures and Les Preludes (Liszt) are decent enough - but the orchestra's playing is pedestrian and not focused. The acoustics are terrible with balance non-existant. Strings are weak, so much so that a single tambourine (in the Carnival Overture [12 measures before rehearsal letter \\"L\\"]) is able to blot them out completely. There is no virtue in a bottomless orchestra. Having conducted in The Academy of Music, I know, from performance experience, what is possible. This recording is interesting purely to demonstrate the limits of older technology. It is NOT to be recommended, either for the performances and certainly not for the recording. If you want examples of excellent recordings \\"the old way\\" you need to go back to the old Mercury series (Dorati, Paray, et al.) to see (i.e. hear) how it should be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound is just that, great sound.","review":"Great music is so much more. Slow, plodding, lifeless; not qualities one would associate with Liszt. This release helps explain why people question the pursuit of the absolute sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable as I expected","review":"I purchased this product in April. The programming was simple and I am extremely pleased with the operation of the water timer. I checked the unit last week 7/13 and noticed the LCD screen was not working. I changed the batteries and nothing happened......I cannot see the screen. I called the 800 number and it belongs to another company, the website does not work, Wal-mart's warranty was 90 days(so I cannot exchange it)and I do not want to pay for another unit. I decided to spend the extra money and purchase this product, which states it's suppose to be extremely durable. I live in Texas so that means somewhat durable, the unit was placed on a spicket that did not get direct sunlight during the day, and the weather here has been warm (in the mid/late 90's)but not as hot as it can get for July (102-115). This is a good product but make sure you don't mind buying one every couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"After one season, LCD no longer works","review":"While it lasted, this was a reliable device, but after only one season of use, the LCD no longer displays anything. While the valves still open and close properly, the unit useless since I cannot set the time, set any programs or see what programs are currently set."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD Failure - 3 months later","review":"I too am victim of the LCD failure.

After just 6 weeks the display failed for me too. The unit still works with the last settings I entered, but I cannot now make any changes. Presumably when the batteries run out and it loses its settings it will be worthless.POOR quality - display failure seems common! No use without a working display. AVOID at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic, practical, and hopeful.","review":"As a psychotherapist and author who teaches the importance of facing fear head on (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco) I am always glad to see a book like Chapters that offers a realistic perspective, useful guidance and a hopeful message. Uncertainty is indeed the very nature of life, and Ms. Carpenter's well-written and organized book is based on the premise that coming to terms with that uncertainty (accepting that we cannot change this fact) is the key to feeling secure. (Isn't irony ironic?)Like Gavin de Becker (Fear Less), Candice Carpenter has a way of pointing to what is real and reassuring us with it. The best news is that her reassurance --- backed by her own experience, thoughtful research, and genuine compassion --- has tremendous credibility.I can think of at least a half dozen people I will recommend Chapters to immediately. And it certainly will go on the next edtion of my reading list for clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but I would not recommend","review":"I've only read half the book and have stopped. While she does offer some good stories and a few suggestions I found the book monotonious. It was filled with a run on story about her work with others stories thrown in the middle; instead of ALL the stories (about CEOs and heads of comapnies - I couldn't relate) shorten the book and give the suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeh...","review":"I bought 8 of these pedal coupler cables from Sam Ash a few weeks back, but I'm kinda wishing I didn't. The cable seems durable enough and I've noticed no change in my guitar's tone, but being only 6\\" long they are extremely inflexible. They're meant to be used as shown in the product pic; the way they're packaged. Even straightening the cable is difficult. Should be priced under $5 each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This book got one star from me because it was in excellent condition. However, the images are very fuzzy black and white. I had hoped to learn something about how still life composition/design had changed over the years but couldn't see the images well enough to get the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and Irrelevant","review":"Most of the essayists here write badly on purpose. Most importantly, however, they are all trying to explain why they are not postmodernists. Nietzsche is almost never discussed. Lots of them are disgusted by Clement Rossett's description of them as ignorant of Nietzsche. This might be worth the time of a few folks. But the title of the volume is misleading in the extreme. Why we hate Rossett would have been good. Why we can't see beyond our PoMo numbness would have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for children on use of crayons in art.","review":"Excellent step-by-step instructions for unique art projects using crayons - useful to children and adults who teach children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Qué pérdida","review":"Considero que los reponsable de la edición de este DVD se burlaron de la gente.

Video of the Beatles during Beatlemania days and interviews with some fans. To true Beatles fans (like me) that normally would be pretty interesting, but this footage is junk.By looking at it, it appears to me the producers couldn't find the original prints or even decent copies.To hide the fact the quality is so bad they tinted it in different colors. Blue, red, purple... etc. At times you can barely make out what it is you're watching.Maybe the producers thought this looks psychedelic or artistic... I believe it's just to cover up bad video.There is no music here sung by the Beatles... it's all by some Beatles sound alike band... why would you want to hear that?The bonus features are laughable... a few still pictures of the Beatles.Please don't waste your money on DVD like I did. If nobody buys this... maybe producers will get the message and stop releasing more stuff like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE BEATLES?!","review":"The Beatles are the titular stars in this poorly made video. Instead of being treated to the REAL Beatles, we hear an ersatz band of quasi sound alikes.

The horrible reviews were enough to keep me away. But I will say this: seems like every year some poor, pathetic creature attempts to cash in on the Beatles' popularity. First came Alone and Together, then Alf Bicknell's Beatles Diary, Celebration, Love Me Do, the Big Beat Box...you get the picture. I'd have a great DVD collection were it not plagued with bad Beatles films! Every now and again there's a break (like Anthology or the First US Visit) but on the whole, there is a dark cloud of unauthorized, lousy material that keeps coming out. Somebody should do something about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"review of CD: Nutcracker Suite","review":"The musical quality of the CD is not in question as it was what I expected. The problem was the CD itself. The first time I played it, it skipped on the first track. I saw no reason for it when inspecting the CD so assume it happened during the manufacture of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endlessly rewarding and insightful","review":"Marcus's book is sort of like a lecture from a brilliant, eccentric professor, already prone to paranthetical asides and lengthy detours, with one too many drinks in him: occassionally obscure, wordy, quick to assume you've done your homework (the book presumes a working knowledge of popular culture), but always fascinating.Finally, the book passes the test of all great music writing: you want to listen to the musicians he's talking about RIGHT NOW. The wonderful (and updated) appendix of recommended recordings is alone worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read it.","review":"Maybe its me, but I could not read this book.

I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mystery train blues","review":"I had to struggle to get through this one. I found the writing style contrived and full of meandering attempts at placing rock and roll in a larger philosophical context. If you can get past the uninspired political & cultural observations, and also the party line, accepted musical interpretations as well as a writing style still staggering from the excesses of the 60's then perhaps this is the book for you. There is also a minor point of a liberal interpretation of the facts (such as the erroneous retelling of the meeting between Elvis and Nixon in the footnotes of the \\"ELVIS: Presliad\\" chapter). If you're looking for good, intelligent, insightful commentary on rock and blues music I recommend Peter Guralnick, who lives up to the praise that undeservedly graces the back of \\"Mystery Train\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too much information","review":"Lost me in the intro.

They should have waited to release it until they were fixed (I'm sure the testers had the exact same errors that everyone else is getting) and yet it was still released...the first Fable was much better, it had a few bugs but nothing compared to this.

The inventory system, the fickle gold trail, and the disjointed regions should have been perfected before the game was released. Also, the graphics should have been optimized as they look the same as the first Fable.But while Fable 2 is not a fantastic game, it is a good game. It's fun and time consuming. I like running around with the dog, trying to find new dig spots and silver keys. And there are plenty of xbox 360 achievements to keep you going after all the quests are complete. When you consider the hours it takes to finish the main quest, side quests, treasure hunts, and xbox 360 achievements, this game is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game of 2008","review":"The story is great, the graphics are beautiful, and the battle system is awesome.

The co-op is an interesting twist, although I wish you could jump into someone else's game as your own hero instead of a generic henchman. At least you get to keep gold and xp from your adventuring. My only complaint about Fable 2 is that, like Fable, it is very short. I finished the whole game in about 2 days and did not have much else to do except achievements, repeatable quests, and buying items and property. Hopefully, Lionhead adds some dlc to the game so that there is more of an endgame.

I am not alone in experiencing a game ending bug. A quick visit to the Lionhead forums will show you the extent of the major bugs that this game contains on release, and I'm afraid that despite the quality of gameplay I couldn't recommend Fable 2 to anyone at this point.

It's much more constricted in it's gameplay and the graphics aren't much better considering it's on the xbox 360. It seems like there is less to do, with more rules and very little freedom in comparison to the original. I felt like they regressed in every way possible other than adding a few things like working on jobs and such. The spells are blended for a boring mix and gun/crossbow targeting sucks. For god's sake, you can't even fight with your bare fists anymore...so much for punching out villagers! I couldn't wait just to get the game over with!!

Started happening to me shortly after i got through the childhood scene. After that I couldn't take more than a few steps in game before it started freezing.I tried contacting Lionhead for support and they gave me a canned response that totally skirted the issue then directed me to their forums. I posted in the forums in a thread 20+ pages long. These freezes soon started happening outside of fable 2. Now i have to send my xbox in for repairs. My xbox was not having issues before I played fable 2 and is now having issues all the time. It's not the RRoD, but a glitch that seems to be repeatable on many other customers machine too. Columns of white artifacts, freezing and a loud buzzing noise.If you decide to buy this game, definitely do a lot of research.

Had to restart the XBox. Froze up shortly thereafter. Had to restart again. And again. And again. No pattern to these freeze-ups. Searched the 'net for help. Found lots and lots of people having this same problem, some to the point where their XBoxes were being rendered useless, broken or scrambled. Many theories, no one answer yet.It's inexcusable. You won't see anything else like this.Maybe Lionhead will patch things up very, very soon.

I loved the freedom and the unique RPG elements. You can buy real estate, own a store, get married, have kids, get a job, etc. However, it really doesn't last long enough if you go for the main quest. The flow of the game is interrupted during the main quest, which I didn't care for. I would recommend the game as a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disapointed","review":"If you are looking to get into the business of Beta Testing or Quality Control, then look no further than getting this game. The goal of Fable II is obviously to see how many bugs, glitches and piss poor coding you can spot, and believe me, there are many.It is unfortunate that a game that promises so much, and has an incredible art style, is technically flawed beyond belief. Common issues have ranged from game ending freezing, graphical glitches, loss of experience and attributes, shoddy co-op camera control, and loading issues. This wouldn't be such an issue if the programmers would have allowed the user to have multiple saves, which of coarse they don't.Fable II was one of my 3 must have games of the year, too bad it has turned into the worst gaming experiences in the past 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent with major flaws","review":"I just finished Fable II and I'd like to say my overall impressions were that of disappointment. While it is lighthearted and fun at times there are too many flaws that far outweigh its fun factor. Menus are poor both in game and out. The game occasionally freezes and co-op is a struggle. Load screens take extremely long and the repetitive game play forces the player to endure the load screens frequently.The game is extremely easy. Even in the unlikely event you actually die. You will most likely simply revive immediately with only a scar on your face as a consequence. Gold is simple to obtain, which makes getting items unfulfilling. There are loads of treasure chests and dig spots, but 95% of them are only good for selling and really benefit you in no way.My girlfriend and I both played this game through to the end and a good portion of it was fun, but I would certainly warn anyone before buying it themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All...","review":"this is a Continuation of Fable 1...but this game is no way, shape or FORM anything BETTER than Fable 1...if anything, it is a step backwords. the graphics are in alot of ways WORSE than Fable...the Music is EXACTLY like Fable..this game in General did just Not do the trick for me. i would rather play through the entire first game than play through one mission of this. they tried, i give them credit..but they would been better off putting Downloadable Content on Xbox Live for the First fable instead of coming out with a brand new game.get Fable (original version) for the xbox...and leave this alone, trust me, your not missing ANYTHING...iLL ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but why was it named game of the year?","review":"Overall it's a solid game with a decent story to tell.

If anybody is on the fence, I will surely point them in the right direction and that is to just rent the game so they will hop off on the right side.You will have a blast, I did and the game took an entire year to get everything.It's open world and there are side quests virtually everywhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible crap packaged onto a disc.","review":"You know the game ending glitches people have been so pissed about?

It happens every 5 to 60 minutes and you have to restart the game and it is very annoying. This is a reoccurring problem for many fable 2 owners and Lionhead studios has done nothing to address it. Besides this, the gameplay isn't bad, but the storyline sucks worse than fable 1 and it is way to short. It seems like nowadays most game developers choose to put most of their time into graphics and whatnot instead of basic hardware and storyline to make a good game. Bottom line, save yourself some time and don't buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh awesome mega ultra with cheeeeeeeeeese!","review":"This game rocks the world and beyond the universe. It is funny as hell and easy to pick up and play. No pressure to finish, feel free to explore the world and there is always something to do. I was addicted to the original Fable until I finished it and this game is 10x better! The only reason I did not give it 4 stars is that it could be more challenging at times; it's super easy to get a lot of money if you do the jobs and it's very difficult to get killed. Even if you do, you wake up right away, but the design of the game also never disappoints, so that's not necessarily a mark against the game. It's simply a different choice. However, there are a lot of hilarious elements to this game that make it worthwhile to own. The bottom line is that despite its few shortcomings, this game is FUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"a great game. my only complaint is that the storyline couldve been a little longer and it couldve had more to choose from as far as weapons go and it could do with some armor as apposed to just a wardrobe change. but the graphics rock. i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes RPG and action/adventure games"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped Up","review":"This game is fun, I'll give it that and the story is decent.

Fable II promised alot and delivered a game that is seriously lacking many qualities. The story is tedious and frankly boring, the maps are difficult to use, the \\"action\\" is sporadic and often not very good, in total the game over promised and under delivered. Rather than a great sequel to a great orginal game, this came off as a tired re-tread almost a low budget knock off of the original. A tremendous dissappointment. I would add the the added adult content really makes this game inappropriate for anyone under 18 years of age. This game was a tragic failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a reason why it was game of the year...","review":"Its a really great game to play on your xbox 360...

The ability to earn income even after the game is turned off is truly innovative and more games should copy this feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't read the text at top of screen","review":"Wasted money on this game since I can't read any text at the top of my poor standard def TV. Unless you have one of them fancy new TVs that allows you to modify the screen/display settings, don't buy this game. It was poorly tested despite the claim by Lionhead that they did indeed test it on all TV types. I'm holding my breath for a patch and then maybe I can play it for another 2 minutes and then find another problem. I couldn't return the game b/c \\"nothing\\" was wrong with the game. Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very big let down","review":"***THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS***I was VERY disappointed by this game after playing the original Fable. It's all gravy up until about 2/3 of the way through and then it gets incredibly repetitive and you're just fighting the same enemies over and over again. The end boss \\"fight\\" with Lucien was such a let down that it ruined the entire game for me. You build up your character for nothing, basically. I can't believe that they had the balls to put this game out with that ending. They probably thought that it would make you excited for the possible 3rd Fable but it really just makes you angry that you spent all this money for a sub par story line with no payoff whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fun, light game","review":"Very fun, light role playing / hack and slash game.

The dev's put a lot of time into creating a fun and interesting world. However, I have also noticed that the dev's probably did very litle if any testing of the game before it went to sale. There are numerous bugs that will ruin your game (i.e. you will not be able to make any progress in the game) as well as those that will make the game really annoying and not fun to play. Lionhead studios need to get rid of the people that made this game and get some people that know how to make a playable game. You are much better off buying The Elder Scrolls Oblivion if you want a really good fantasy RPG. If you really want Fable 2 wait a month or ten until the game is fixed and playable. In the mean time you could play Oblivion. I should also add that the story for Fable 2 is utter trash. It often makes no sense and feels like it was put in the game just to give the player a main quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually quite boring","review":"I really tried to give this game a chance but I got so bored of it. It is so mechanical and it portends to be sandbox but it really is not.Pros: graphicscons: boring. You just follow a yellow-lit path to next quest, click somne buttons and move to next quest. Actually the blacksmith job was the most exciting part of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Repetition","review":"The first Fable I gave up on because I didn't like the game mechanics and the graphics were ugly. Now comes the second one and I waited a year to get it. I played through half of this game and NEVER have I been so frustrated with a game. I wanted it to be over and be done with it but I couldn't play it any longer. The combat is so repetitive and you can never block or have a fair fight with any enemies. Either you're getting hit from behind when you want to block and hit someone or you just massively take over the enemy. The voice acting is extremely annoying and fake sounding. I was planning on getting Fable III but forget that now. I have lost any hope for this franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child's game with a M rating","review":"I do not understand the concept of this game. I am a huge fan of RPGs, as a matter of fact it is the only genre I buy every game released in, at least for PC that is. I was long curious about this title, I did play the first, I didn't necessarily enjoy it but I didn't hate it either. This game picks up a similar vibe as the first. It is sort of a The Sims meets the Fantasy RPG world. The main problem is that the depth of the story is that of Harry Potter books. That is all well and fine but then at the same time the game receives a M rating because it has sex and drugs. Is this game for kids or is it for adults? The storyline is really just as cliche as the rest. I recommend going and picking up Dragon Age of Mass Effect and avoiding this. It's not the worst RPG ever but it is definitely the most overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time Favorite","review":"Fable 2 has to me one of my all time favorite RPG action games. I love all the interactions you can have in the towns with the townsfolk. Yes my female character went evil, and people were very scared of her. I mean eating meat makes you evil in this game... funny! I real time fighting is fun especially when you mix up magic and good old hack and slash. Slow down time and start swinging wildly into a mass of baddies. Good times. The story was fun and heart string tugging (when you see your dog again after years and years apart) My only complaints seem to be things that Fable 3 is going to address. So maybe the future Fable game will be my new all time favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a much better game","review":"This is a game that is sort of like elder scrolls, but not as good. It has a somewhat interesting plot, the gameplay is enjoyable, and the quests are entertaining --but the maps SUCK! I never know where I am, because you just get this little map that changes depending on what region you are in and is nearly impossible to use. So basically you're stuck wandering around from place to place without any idea how to get around. The game does provide you with a glowing path to the next goal you've set, but it's not enough for you to ever get your bearings. I gave up on this one after about 10 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Errors","review":"There are so many glitches with this game it is ridiculous. So far I've had several key NPC's disappear, making quests imposable to finish and a troll monster become immortal; thus locking that character in the Crucible. On another character- I've had a spouse that will not die, respond, or move. You're faithful little \\"companion\\" runs through walls and floats above chests and (every time you dig), turns the dog the color of the ground its standing on. The dog also misses many chests or just sits in your way.The chat scenes and sequences are extremely slow and glitch as well. Some games the NPCs will finish what they need to say- and others they will simply stop in mid-sentence.Although I expect Peter Molyneux to lie through his teeth almost every promise he made turned into a false-hood.Buy the original fable-it is amazing. Stay away from this unfinished game there are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More glitches than quests...","review":"How do you take an amazing game idea and ruin it? Simple really, you do not test or prepare this game for commercial launch. Action RPG gamers will love this game... in the semi-distant future when patches for the extreme amount of glitches are finally released. Don't buy it now, odds are you'd have to abandon your time spent when your game hits an error that you can NOT correct. When fixes are available this will be an amazing game... Until then it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The beginning is too slow. I don't have the time anymore to play a game and hope it gets interesting. I loved the first FABLE, but I also found the beginning of that one to be slow. The same goes for this game. Too much time is spent running around doing stupid things. It should get more interesting faster! However, because I lost interest and stopped playing the game early on, perhaps it does get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this game!!","review":"Fable 2 sucks. The game contains long (several minutes sometimes) cutscenes where people stand there and talk and you can't fast forward through it. The quests are boring. The jobs are boring. The story is boring.

Our game arrived the day it was launched and it has not been put down yet. Seriously this game was worth waiting for. The graphics are amazing and the story keeps moving.

This one is really worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From All Of Lionhead","review":"Ok first off ill start by saying i was a huge fan of the original fable and actually preordered fable 2...Big mistake. Ill tell you all a word of advice right now, never Ever listen to a word Peter Molyneux or anybody that comes out of Lionhead spews out because it is all just for hype and always ends in making you feel like an idiot for believing them.Onto the review of the game, as far as an rpg goes it was Decent but nothing special. As far as a Fable sequel goes it is horrible, story wise its not Fable 2 but more of Fable 1.5 or even 1.25, compared to the firsts compelling story this plot goes nowhere and you can see the ending from a mile away. Not only that but Lionhead even struck the low blow of leaving critical story points (post ending-pre fable 3) in costly DLC.Bottom line is i learned my leason and will never buy a Lionhead game again and id recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Misled by the Jersey!","review":"Unfortunately I thought I was ordering the same gloves I purchased last year and was disapointed upon receiving these.

His insistence on boosting the use of adjunct faculty since it allows \\"colleges to enrich their curricula with real world perspectives, and expand the number of course sections offered, without permanently increasing their operating costs.\\" is hiding the fact that adjuncts are simply getting paid much less for the same work. The majority of adjuncts in general education are not enriching the curricula but instead fattening the wallets of administration types, of whom I highly suspect Dr. Lyons to be one.

Chances are a significant portion of that faculty is also an adjunct and many work full-time on low wages and without health care/retirement safety nets.Adjuncts are like the migrant workers of academia: they are vital to get the job done, are compensated at the lowest levels, work under the most austere conditions, and are not seen in polite company.It's shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time!","review":"This album has been missing from the catalog for many years. Like John Ford's \\"The Searchers\\", it's a seminal work, influencing others over the years. When you listen, you hear things that sound like other artists - that sounds like Lyle Lovett, this sounds like Jimmy Buffett, that sounds like J.J. Cale, this sounds like Robert Earl Keen, but then you look at the date and find that this collection was published in 1972, and these other folks sound like Willis Alan Ramsey.The production values are not as of 1999, but the creativeness and talent are ageless. If you are a fan of 'country rock', or progressive country, or Texas music, or anything along those lines, this is for you. (P.S. I'm married to a Dallas woman, if you know what I mean, although I'm not from Texas.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Air","review":"This self titled album is a landmark.

Just as KFAT was happy to mix, say, John Coltrane and Johnny Cash, this album mixes a bit of just about everything. Sure, it's country...using guitar and cello (Angel Eyes) or soprano sax and accordion (Ballad of Spider John). Every cut is good, even that sappy thing that America recorded, and every one is unique. I am so gassed that this is back in print.--NJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a remake!","review":"Contrary to what the previous reviewer wrote, this is not a remake, but a re-issue of the original glorious recording.

The Leather Boy must be one of the first to use sound effects on a rock and roll record to such great effect ~ BLISTERING motorcycle engine noises get you in the mood for some high octane 60s garage.Alice Cooper's early recording with The Spiders is a real snotty punker. Cooper was the son of a preacher and rebelled from the outset. Don't Blow your Mind - this tune will.Gypsy Girl (Vinnie Basile & the Staaccatos) and Joanne (The Grim Reapers) cool things off towards the end as the tempo settles down.

Someone please remind Tracy that once you're saved, your sins are tossed away as far as the east is from the west;they are no more. Yet she tells us them in sensational graphic detail. Why does Tracy and Susan Wales go fishing to reel them back and then serve it up for us to read? I bought this book thinking it would spiritually lift me, but it sank me.

Being In the process of reading it now, the book so far is along the lines of how to improve humanities condition using energy. So far it is not technical enough to try and duplicate any of his work for my course.Ever since having learned that Tesla was able to produce electricity from the Earth, I have been curious about him. With the things that Tesla has done, I would rank him up there with Einstein, a childhood hero of mine . It is too bad that Tesla did not have the notoriety that Einstein had because we use so many of the things he created but yet he does not get the credit.No buyer's remorse about buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I research global warming and I found it very interesting that this book was written in 1900 and that Tesla was warning about the problems back then.

The Kessinger version literally looks like someone scanned a PDF copy of the document, faxed it, and then scanned it a few more times. Due to this, the text is extremely hard to read and all of the inspiring images have turned to black splotches. No effort in reimaging or restoring the work at all. The content is five stars, but this version is one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insight","review":"This book is amazing in the fact that it was written 100 years ago and the concepts he was putting forth then are only now beginning to be desired on the whole. Some of the predictions he makes are spot on. Some held up until maybe only 5 years ago. A few were totally off (that copper would become obsolete to aluminumb is the big one I remember) This is an amazing piece of inspiration, but it's a little too theoretical at parts in that certain logic gaps are not filled at all.

This collar does not have a closure hook or clasp so it must be put on over the dog's head. Well, in order to get it over the dog's head, it has to be much larger than the neck. The collar slips down and does not stay in place and therefore cannot work properly. It should be made with some sort of a hook closure to put it on and off without going over the head... Won't work, it was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works like magic","review":"I have a very hyper Pug. He LOVES to pull. I placed this around his neck and he's just walking beside me now.I took one link off and it fits loosely around his neck until I tug on it.It's really hard to put back on him since you have to hook it back into place, and that's really hard with a hyperactive dog.Another thing I don't like about it is that the rubber pieces fall off and him and my other dog started chewing on it. I don't wanna take all of the pieces out because I know it's going to hurt a lot more.Either way, its cheap and it gets the job done. I'd buy a second one if this one broke.And to the people who's saying it fell part, you're probably using it wrong because it works just fine. And my Pug is WHITE.

Even the more advanced workout is pretty slow moving and not very challenging.The easiness of the workout is not the only thing that I don't like about this dvd, the instructor who I'm sure is a wonderful fireman, is not very good at directing you.

When asking at a record store a couple of years ago, the attendant lady brought this album. I remember I could buy more than one and a half of any pop or rock albums for that price... I confess I made the numbers in my mind, and finally I bought it. Just for three tracks: Concerto for mandolin in G major RV532. Then I discovered concerts for trumpet, horn and bassoon that I've never heard of before. Sir Neville Marriner conducts the orchestra with sensibility and full of emotion.

That is more an observation about the record company than this performance, and that said, Dame Kiri is an indispensible part of this program. A soprano who can sing Verdi and switch to Mozart is a great find, and Kiri has exactly the right temperment. The Vespers are well played and sung, under the superb baton of Sir Colin Davis. A very slow tempo for Ave Verum Corpus still flows perfectly and comes off divinely. And nobody should be without this recording of Exsultate Jubilate.This CD is required owning for Mozarteans, lovers of good singing, and any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite music ever - a non-expert review","review":"I turned on my poor quality car radio and this was on, about halfway through.

If I turn everything off for a second or two and then turn on the devices I want to use it all works OK, but that is more hassle than I will deal with. I don't think this is a problem with the Terk, just a limitation of any switch that relies on auto-detecting signals on the inputs.I am swapping the Terk for a switch that has a remote instead of auto switching.

We tried another 8ft cable and got a picture at 1080p, but white dots would appear and disappear at random, ruining the picture. We couldn't get any 1080p picture when using the switcher with a 6ft cable and our Xbox 360 running at 1080p.

Because I can see how much progress I'm making, I actually enjoy vacuuming now -- go figure.I love this sweeper so much, I gave a Dyson Slim to both my mother and sister for Christmas.

I was happy for a while- the smaller size, the lighter weight and the way the head swiveled was great. I have two small dogs, however, and one of them sheds like crazy- so the sucktion would give up regularly. I would have to take off the canister and pull the hair out because it would clog up so quickly. I constantly was having to turn off the vacuum to pull the hair out. When I would use the hand tool to get the edges and small areas, there was NO SUCTION. I looked everywhere in the manual, I tried to contact Dyson, I was not able to get an answer to why the suction on the extention was not working.I gave up. I finally went back to the reasonably priced Hoover and have never been happier. My carpet hasn't been this well vacuumed in over a year.I'm sure Dyson is a great product, but it seems I may have ended up with the lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"does its job well","review":"After having owned vacuums that lost its suction over time this to me was a breath of fresh air. It is lighter than the bigger ones and takes up less space in the closet. I have a mix of hardwood floors and carpet and the ease with which you can switch is great. The amount of stuff it collects is great and it so doesn't loose suction. I can pick it up to move upstairs with not too much hassle.the negatives - the hose is a bit awkward in its set up and not long enough for me to use with the attachments for stairs etc. I don't find I can just press the button and all the stuff will just fall out from the bottom, I find I have to poke my hand in to get all the stuff out.But apart from those things its great and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"We got this vacuum soon after our wedding, and not long after we got a cat.

I got the 'Slim' - trying to save a bit of $$ over the 'animal'. At first it worked pretty good - I really thought it would have more suction power than it did, but it worked. After 2 weeks of use, it started to get clogged every single time I use it. In all fairness, we do have a dog and 6 long haired cats, but still.... Now it barely sucks at all (no clogs that I can find), and the base of the unit gets super hot after just a minute or so of use. The stand doesn't always kick down when it's pushed upright, and it just falls over - very annoying.Maybe I just got a defective one. I called Dyson's helpline, which was no help at all. After reading all the stories of being charged for replacements and services (even tho it's under warranty), I've yet to take it into a repair shop.

On day one I could tell it had less power than the cheap, 6 year old Dirt Devil that it was replacing, and it only got worse as the unit aged. At two years old it couldn't pick up dry cat litter off a tile floor. I've very happily replaced it with Hoover that cost less than half of what the Dyson Slim did.

It's been very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced piece of plastic garbage","review":"I have had NOTHING but trouble out of this piece of garbage. I have had it in the shop more than out, be forewarned the \\"warranty\\" doesn't cover much because when you take it to the shop you will get a bill for items that aren't covered usually about $90+ worth. I don't abuse this vacuum, and had my old Hoover for 10 years before replacing it, so I know it isn't me. I don't try to suck up anything large or bulky just normal floor dirt and yet it constantly loses suction and doesn't work! I had this thing in the shop within a month of purchasing it!

We live together and I have a large dog who sheds a LOT. This was my peace offering to her for tolerating the pet hair. The vacuum is small but powerful. It is AWESOME at picking up dog hair, grit, and all other dirt. It's easy to use, easy to empty the dirt bin, and has been worth the price tag. We have ALL hardwoods in our house, with linoleum in the kitchen and area rugs throughout. This makes cleaning the floors so much faster than sweeping the hard surfaces with a broom and vacuuming the rugs separately. The DC18 picks up equally well on both and saves time. My sister was annoyed that I spent so much when I gave it to her, but she was quickly converted and LOVES this vacuum now...

Anyway...it's great. I love the size-it's small enough that I can stash it on my first floor rather than having to lug it up and down from the basement. It's quiet- I can use it easily while kids are sleeping and not wake anyone up. It's effective- I was repulsed to see how much *gunk* came out of the carpet the first time that I used it. Blech, but very satisfying. The first time through the house I had to empty the container several times, but that was more a testimony to it's superior suction than to the small tank size. Once the initial clean was done, the tank size is just fine and I don't feel like I'm constantly emptying it. It's easy to switch from carpet to wooden floor with a push of a button near the handle. It's easy to release stuff that gets wrapped around the brush.

I have found a few flaws with it that I shouldnt have, considering the price I paid for it.It is a great vacum when it works fine, however if you happened to get someting on your way of vacumming and it gets caught in the brush - the brush attachement will stop working - you then have to rescrew it and reassemble the whole attachement.Secondly, the tool attachement is placed so akwardly, and it is not at all convinient to use it. The storage compartment is also very small and you have to empty it frequently. Overall it is a good vacuum - it didn't seem slim as the name suggest - I cannot imagine what size a regular dyson would be - difinetely storage issue.

I can't say for sure but I bet these are knock offs. Bottom line it's a better deal than paying over $40.00 for a BR50 at the dealers and not knowing whether it's going to do any better.

When I got them, I fully charged both. Unfortunately they only last about 15 minutes, which is ridiculous. My expectation was no hours of talk time, but I thought they would at least function as a fully charged battery should.The company is shady. I formerly posted about the problem that I had with the battery, and then was contacted by eForcity asking to remove my negative feedback in return for replacement merchandise. I removed my feedback and they never sent the replacements. When I emailed them over a week later and attached the original email offering me the deal, and my reply when I accepted their offer, their response was \\"do you want to have a replacement on this item.\\" I'm pretty sure that was the point of me emailing them inquiring about when I would get my new batteries.This company has poor business practices and sells merchandise that doesn't even live up to minimal expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend it at all.","review":"Bought 4 of these.

So, I pulled a Go-Pro Camera suction cup out of the camera case and adapted it to the Gtech.

Winslow is a quick witted writer and the story has enough twists and turns to keep you going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining early work from one of our better writers","review":"I really enjoy everything Winslow writes and so I finally got around to his first novel. I thought it was better than some of his later work and really enjoyed the whole set up for Neal Carey. I mean how many times have you read novels with banks in Providence Rhode Island having a major role? Winslow is at home with creating intelligent social outcasts and he has a couple of them in this novel. If you are a fan of Winslow you should definitely read this debut.

But this search is framed without trying to \\"put a favorable spin\\" on the challenging and sometimes very humorous experiences of a \\"city family\\" trying to \\"make-it\\" in the wild and harsh wilderness of Glacer National Park.The beauty of God's character is highlighted while your own religious experience will be challenged."},{"rating":"2","title":"A God that cares about the little things!","review":"As a mother of 4 boys, I often feel overworked and stressed as the duties of daily life DEMAND my attention. I often make mistakes and I have often felt like it is impossible to lead the life that Christianity alludes to but always seems just out of reach. Reading Escape to God gave me renewed courage and insight into how to really have a personal walk with Jesus as a best friend. Any mother feels a need for insights into how to be a better person as life presses in upon her. I would declare that any person who wants to not be led by circumstances but be renewed into a closer walk with God must read this book. It has changed my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I did not really like this book. I had to force myself to finish it. It was not badly written, but I did not like the characters. Right in the beginning the heroine is shown to be vain and rather selfish and self-serving. I could not bring myself to like her after her unfavorable introduction. The hero is an annoying and whiny. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho - Hum","review":"Artsy-fartsy.Good quality recording, good quality musicianship, but the \\"pulse\\" of the music doesn't do it for me.

Though I didn't like Jessye Normans part at first (being used to much more delicate/lighter versions), I now regard it as absolutely fantastic. You can really feel her anguish and pain in the final lament (Goosebumps).Furthermore, it is a very well balanced performance, with music and artists matching perfectly. The quality of the recording lives up to Philips reputation. Good job!Maybe not worth 5 stars (what is?), but definitely 4.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leppard's Purcell","review":"This never seems to make it into any \\"top\\" lists of this very dramatic short opera. I have heard the famous Janet Baker/Anthony Lewis recording for Decca. It is a fine version which I recommend. But it simply isn't as colourful as this one. Jessye Norman is a perfectly wonderful Dido. Perhaps not as moving in \`drooping wings' as Janet Baker, but still in strong competition. Leppard directs better too. Anthony Lewis had a more plain-sounding orchestra, and the sound wasn't as opulent.Four Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still the Best","review":"After all these years, no one captures the pathos of the situation and the nobility of the character as well as Victoria de los Angeles.

During the course of a day i threw this book across my room at least 5 times.

Wires were detached, preventing it from being able to work. Nothing happened when I pushed the buttons even though the blender was clearly plugged in. I was just about to return it or get it replaced, but luckily, my father opened it up and managed to fix it.I do not recommend buying this blender. It is very low quality and it would probably be worth investing in a more expensive blender instead. The blender is very noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"My daughter and I purchased this to make smoothies for breakfast. The motor is not strong enough to really blend so you have to keep it running for a few minutes, states it is dishwasher safe but after a few washings the handle just cracked off.

This pad has a foam wrist support which is way to soft. It feels like my wrist is sinking in when I use it. I never had that problem with gel supports before. At the price I really can not complain though. I just do not think I would have bought this no matter the price if I had looked at it in a store and felt it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't know I needed it until I used it","review":"Bought it for home but took it to work to unpack and am keeping it there. The mouse at work feels much better with the pad and wrist rest.The wrist rest is not as springy as the gel rest I am currently using and it is lower and softer. Actually this feels very good and maybe better than the gel pad I have at home (and which is starting to seep gel matter).The pad works great with the laser mouse. The surface area is bigger than I expected, maybe a little too big for what I need but it does not hurt that it is big. I put the edge of the keyboard over it on one side.It has a little dent in the middle of the wrist rest - I think built into the design. I can shift my wrist to the side for a higher angle or the middle for a lower angle at the mouse - useful variety. The nylon cover feels very nice compared to the plastic of a gel pad.Overall I really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard, wrist hurts more","review":"Thin, very soft layer over narrow hard wrist pad -Felt ok at first, but after a few long days wrist pain got much worse.The top layer is too soft and the whole rest is too smallfor a tall man with heavy arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"great surface, bad wrist pad","review":"I was hoping that, despite reading a few less than glowing reviews, I would be able to rave about this mousepad.

Now there is a huge indentation in the wrist gel (I've had it for maybe 2 weeks if that) and my wrist sits on the hard portion underneath. I will be looking for a better pad with more wrist protection and I will be heading the reviews on the next one...I gave it two stars because the actual mouse pad space for moving the mouse is perfect, not too big, not too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really","review":"I've been using this product for about a year and honestly, I'm disappointed. The memory foam wrist cushion feels nice at first, but it compresses over time and eventually you're resting your hand on a solid rock.

When I first bought it, it was very hard and uncomfortable and I thought I had made a mistake. So I took a hammer and hit it a few times out of frustration, but that actually seemed to soften up the wrist pad. It is by no means real memory foam, but after a good hammering and some light use I found it quite comfortable. The fabric does feel a bit cheap, and the logo is in a different spot from the picture, but overall I am very happy.Works perfectly with my microsoft x5 gaming mouse and my craigslist table, I have noticed 0 performance interruptions or hindrances with it.Overall, it isn't the best but it is far from the worst, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great support","review":"I brought this months ago and it still has it's form.

By way of response to the one reviewer who said \\"it doesnt work with my logitech g5 optical mouse\\" their problem was probably just that they had to *clean* their mouse. I had to clean mine, because I was getting some errant tracking (a little before I got this pad, more after). After cleaning it (especially the optical window) it now tracks just fine. The wrist pad is comfortable, and I am sure the edges will flatten out in a few days. This is a good deal, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I bought this Mouse pad to replace a traditional square foam pad in order to give my wrist more cushion at the edge of my desk. I also wanted something stylish and non-traditional for my new Logitech MX Air and Revolution Mice. The memory foam conforms comfortably to my wrist, lifting it just enough to prevent it from sliding against the sharp edge of my desk (a converted drafting table). It is also very attractive with a nice velvet black finish and round shape that contrasts nicely against my white desktop. Overall, this quality product is just right for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and affordable!","review":"This mouse pad was a great purchase!

In fact, my wrist hurts every time I use this mouse pad. I am not sure if it has anything to do with I am a woman and have small wrist, but I always have to press/push really hard with my wrist for the memory foam to form some shape and have to continue pressing very hard for the memory foam to not return to its original state. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a small wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Spectacular","review":"A thin surface--make that a very thin surface. The part where you put your wrist is comfortable, I'll give it that, but no different, positive or negative, from other brands with the same design. I had another (unknown) brand that became discolored, faded, and indented after about a year, so I got this one, and that is what happens to this type of mouse pad with the wrist support--no matter the brand you buy. It can't be helped. It is nice while it lasts, but don't expect it to last a long time. You will see an easing of tension in your wrist, but it is extremely thin and cheaply manufactured.

Holds some fairly large shampoo/conditioner bottles on the top shelf. Sturdy. The gap over the door could be smaller. It would hang over something a lot wider than a shower door.

Just reordered and this latest batch has a new slick finish. It doesn't print nearly as well as the old finish, which was a little rough and could grab the ink. This results in a loss of image detail. The ink just sits on top of the label and is prone to smearing. I had excellent results with the rougher surface and am very disappointed with this change in the product. I'll have to look for another brand now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Software, Unusable for anything beyond text","review":"Wasted 10.00 dollars on this product.

Add the fact that my season 2 box was ripped with center disc holder broken. Im not sure if they packed the wrong discs, or if its just advertised incorrectly, but I am left puzzled as to why I paid so much money when I could have bought them individually and saved $$ seeing how they were going for about $15 a piece.

This isnt so. Unfortunately the selection of bands presented on 3 disks is far too limited, and while the music is good, its a disappointment to those well versed in the genre. You need a bigger variety of bands. A good rule of thumb: not more than one track by the same band per disk. The only reasons to buy this album are: 1. Its cheap...

She used it to fix her toilet, found out what to do when lightening strikes, learned the parts of her cat's anatomy, and followed the advice for dressing for the first date.

The major exception occurs at the World Championship of Foosball when an aerial trick shot makes the preceeding two hours suddenly seem worthwhile.

I passed it over in hardcover--frankly it didn't sound very interesting. I couldn't have been more wrong: it's one of the best written, engrossing novels I've read in a long time. Peters is one of the few military thriller writers that can name drop Thomas Hardy novels and actually make us believe his characters read them.

He happens to be an organian, those throbbing balls of light who enforced a peace with the Klingons.This is nothing to remember, just a rehash of well known scifi and comic book traditions, however well it is executed.

Even so, the oboe parts are performed masterfully, and the sound is most pleasant.The compositions are not particularly memorable to me -- I don't find myself whistling the Bach oboe concertos after listening to the album a few times -- but they are great examples of the baroque genre no less.

I'm always an admirer to filmmakers who are willing to take financial and artistic risks no matter what the other side awaits. Overall, I can't wait to see more films by this filmmaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but not quite.","review":"This was like a student film from a seminary. It was 37 minutes of awful acting. The idea had potential, but lost me completely between the awful acting and the failure to sell the story.These two \\"kids\\" get introduced to witchcraft, which sends them on a downward spiral. Said spiral mostly consisted of reading satanic texts, frantic scribbling of silliness on to post-it notes, and foreplay with razor blades, blood, candles, bad music and goth makeup. Their weird foreplay introduces them to a \\"dark lord\\" with a little girl as a sidekick, who commands them to kill a christian. Many silly scenes involving rape, knife-waving, demonic possession, etc. follow. I won't spoil the end for you.Overall it felt like a \\"reefer madness\\" style movie, to scare good little Christian kids into avoid the dangers of the occult. You never know what you might be inviting in, right? If it weren't for the occasional exposed breast, I could see this playing at a church youth group movie night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable as Obamas idiocy","review":"Nothing new.

I bought this book because of the title and description on Amazon (no reviews had been posted at that time).All I can say is this IS the worst how-to book I've ever read. It contains about 80 pages of info that is relevant to the title of the book and even that is repetitive. The rest is travel routes for NASCAR and Casino touring, some dealer listings, and miscellaneous other peripherally related material.What was this guy thinking? I wanted to know about RV pros and cons for Class C RV layouts. Issues with satellite dishes. Detailed maintenance issues. How vehicle maintenance might be different than a van? What accessories might be useful? What can I expect at an RV park? Few of these questions were even remotely answered.I can't believe this book is the \\"ultimate\\" guide to anything. This book is just plain bad news. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's behind the scenes...","review":"Heartfelt, soulful, sincere performances by Mr. Thicke and his band. Very clear close-up video footage. However, I gave this DVD only 4 stars because it would have been PERFECT if it included the raw footage sequences of The Making of these AOL Sessions, which I know exist, because I have seen them. They show some honest behind-the-scenes commentary by Robin Thicke and co., in the embryonic stages of the meteoric rise of this album. I am puzzled as to their absence.

Rosenthal explains everything so clearly! I feel so empowered with this book. It covers everything you need to know about your cancer and especially all about follow-up scans. I found this chapter the most useful for me because it's a very confusing subject. This book answered all my questions and concerns about withdrawl scanning. Everyone with thryoid cancer should have this book. I have her other thyroid books, and they're all really well-written and informative, but if you have thyroid cancer, you need this book especially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date information","review":"The book is very out of date and not organized well at all. It does not answer more than 50% of the questions I had regarding this disease.At 186 pages (at least 1/3 was filler regarding general issues on healing and disease. . . something I could get from almost any web site on serious illness), this book is certainly not worth the expensive price. I would not recommend it at all. Visit the web sites specifically for thyroid cancer and you can educate yourself much morethoroughly than by buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"I like it because it has a lot of links on the end off the book.

It wasn't easy. I really had to think about my story and characters and if there was a deeper meaning to my story. I had to press through areas that I thought were boring or that I really didn't want to think about and was rewarded with a much better concept and deeper characters that were much more interesting than the motley crew I started out with.Is it worth the $$$$ I think so. I never was any good at outlining and this program not only helped me out there but helped me create something better and more interesting to outline."},{"rating":"1","title":"For theorist only","review":"This will hurt your brain. A detailed book needs to come with the software. It's too complicated and confusing. Don't bother with this if you use your basic instinct to write stories.

Save your money for something more productive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of my time and money","review":"I bought this hoping to use it as an editing tool for my writing. It is not at all what the description purports it to be. It has an extremely long learning curve and the user is expected to plug into the software writer's idea of novel creation, rather than provide tools of support to enhance or streamline the writing experience. The clipart employed for distinguishing the characters is completely hideous. I don't know who this product is intended for, but in my opinion, the description of the software's intended purpose is completely misleading. At the risk of sounding cliche, I would still say that this is a nightmare rather than a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected a lot more","review":"I've written one book without the use of such software and I thought that it would be great to try this for a second book. I tried and only get words to come up and can never get it to form any type of story. I'm like another reviewer, \\"Maybe I'm green to this.\\" I think I'll stick to the old fashion way.

Myhappiness goes out to those who can master this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME","review":"I purchased the product two years ago when I was drafting my novel. I went through the menus and tried to use them to outline my story and characters... my head still hurts.

To this day I look at the cover box of this product and shake my head...then I suddenly stop, because I remember it makes my head hurt even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Software Misleading Description","review":"This was given to me as a gift in order to help me write short stories.

Well, once I called technical support, they admitted that \\"the wording should have been clearer\\" about the templates. There are no formatted forms. Also, for those who are not computer elitists, this program is confusing and frustrating. I ended up using the trial software (included) and found Screenwriter 2000 perfect, easy to understand and well organized. I learned the hard way, and ordered Sreenwriter 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"I suggest saving yourself the $34.49 and instead investing in a Bickpen and one of those little black journals we used in school.

I tried the software... It does not work at all. It will not even install on my PC. I hope Amazon will refund my money... Concerning theory, I would stick with McKee's Story and Vogler's Hero's Journey. The Dramatica theory requires an almost complete re-learning of story theory. Instead of writing your screenplay or novel, you waste a lot of time learning Dramatica's terminology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great software for beginners","review":"I've been a writer for a few years now and I wanted to get a cost-effective piece of software for my novels and screenplays. This was a dream come true for me. It is easy to understand if you jump right into it, but I wouldn't rely on the users manual as it is a bit vague. You go thru the steps of fleshing out your ideas, characters, and chapters (or scenes) and go thru a Q&A where you fill in the blanks you didn't know were there. You can write novels, plays, scripts and more and even convert your work into another medium. Reports that are detailed are available at any stage in your work and revising is easy. I think any writer who wants to get cracking on that piece of literature but don't know exactly were to start should try this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Aggravation","review":"Bought this program and couldn't even instll it.

I bought this thinking it would do just that. However it was problematic from the beginning just to get it to work on my com-puter and when it did smooth out a bit I realized why I do not like Hollywood and american movies as a rule: They are canned products.I do not know what the alternative is but this product is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what to be expected!","review":"I bought this because I am an inspiring romance writer. This was an \\"ok\\" program. It only lets you write everything you want to put in each scene and then you can print it all out.

The sound is more rock than goth rock and that's not a good thing. It was hard for me to really differentiate between all the songs, since they all sound the same. Perhaps, they're failure was in trying to have a more commercial album, instead of keeping it honest and true to their sound. Also, their new video sucks too. Here's hoping they bring back Bam to direct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest effort...","review":"This lp has two fantastic songs on it. \\"...Wings Of A Butterfly\\" and \\"In The Nightside of Eden\\" are great songs and Ville performs them well enough, though you can hear very clearly that his voice is not what it used to be.

It's unfortunate that it took Bam Margera to bring attention to this band when it should be the record companies and MTV doing the job. But whatever it takes. Anyways, if you like this kind of melodic gothic metal-light, take the time to discover other bands in the genre, who, in many cases, are even better. So, let me play the Bam role, and point you to: Paradise Lost, Flowing Tears, Tiamat, The Gathering, the already-pretty-successful Lacuna Coil, Katatonia, Beseech and Type O Negative, to name a few.

First of all, the pentegram-heart thing? Contrary to what somebody tried to tell me, it's not the Star of David. Seriously. Look at it. And H.I.M., referring to \\"Him\\" as in God? No, it stands for \\"His Infernal Majesty\\" and if you can't figure out WHO that is, well, it ain't Jesus. All of this, plus the fact that their song's subject matter is heavily doused with suicide and how great dying would be, plus all those 666 songs- and yeah, let me repeat, H.I.M. is NOT A CHRISTIAN BAND. So, if you are a Christian, go for goodies like Day of Fire, Skillet, and Project 86. If you aren't Christain, by all means have a good time with H.I.M. Just don't recommend it to your Christian friends under the guise that they are a wholesome, God-focused band. That, and give some of the Christain hard-core bands a try...great music with an actual purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE F*CK?!","review":"this aint metal retards! u can click no and call me names all u him fans its not gonna change the fact the HIM SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother listening to HIM","review":"The only people I know that like HIM are wannabe goth girls or afeminate guys, I see them every day at my school, me on the other hand like brutal music like Dying Fetus, Slayer, Tool, Cannibal Corpse, Sepultura, Obituary, Meshuggah and hell even Arch Enemy and Lacuna Coil are stronger singers than that HIM guy. The singer looks like a Failed Michael Jackson impersonator. The music is twice as awful as ever, wings of a butterfly is just dumb emo music that people eat up because his music is so deep.

It has some good parts, but like previous reviews i agree it sounds a bit the same. Another confusing aspect is that the keyboards now are thrown into the foreground and take too much away from the guitar. His vocals sound way too clean, there's not enough of his low deep voice or the trembling vocals we are used to. This is an extremely watered down, bland, overproduced version of a band i love.

Based on this book I think Jove has a winner with the Irish Eyes series. I liked how the romance between Moya and Rory was contrasted with the romance of an older couple. I didn't like the fact there was little in the conflict between Moya and Rory. When their desires conflicted with each other the problem was quickly resolved by Moya and Rory or an outside force. I haven't read either The Irish Devil or To Marry an Irish Rogue, the first two books in the series.

The interface is clunky, it didn't work with Microsoft Word as promised, and the pronunciation feature must be run from the hard disk. .... .

The main reason I'm giving this album four stars is because of the departure of Mantas, who to me, was the most important aspect of Venom. Without him, the music leaves something to be desired. Still, there are plenty of great tracks on here including \\"Black Xmas\\", \\"Metal punk\\", \\"Under a spell\\", \\"Calm before the storm\\", and \\"Gypsy\\".

It seems to be a bit more difficult to figure out how to use this machine to it's full capacity since it doesn't operate in the same way all of the former calculators I've used did, therefore, the 4 stars versus 5, but overall, I'm happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I had to replace a calculator that I had dropped a glass of water on at my office. This was exactly the same model, was very reasonably priced, arrived in a short amount of time and is just what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calculator does not work in printing mode","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. The calculator works fine in the \\"on\\" mode but once you move the dial to the printing mode an \\"E\\" (overflow error) displays on the screen and the calculator stops functioning. Also the ribbon inside the calculator appeared to be used. Contacted the 800 number that came with the instructions and was told that it would be best to return item to the seller because it would take up to two weeks for Canon to begin processing the item once they receive it...WOW. On other sites people complained about the short life span of this calculator therefore I'm returning for a refund. In addition, the calculator was a bit larger than expected. This is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is he really?","review":"Jake seemed to come out of nowhere thats what Rick thought... So starts this novel. The story is told by Rick, who is friends with the quarterback and this new individual called Jake. Right away you sense something is not right. Jake begins to have a party every friday night at his house, before you know it he is the man to know. As others have said in their reviews this novel is very similar to The Great Gatsby. The school is even named Fitzgerald. In this version nobody gets killed but they are some serious issues that arise. To me the book comes alive with the way the author describes the emotions of the characters. It makes me begin to imagine how they look. To me this is a not just another typical teenager book about high school life but it actually has some morals and values to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Korman's \\"Schooled\\".","review":"I did not enjoy \\"Jake Reinvented\\", and this is not based on a comparison of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" because I have yet to read that one. I found the characters in JR flat, some of the plot elements were not believable, and the Jake's \\"secret\\" was really no big deal. Also, there was no particular appeal for me in reading page after page of a teenage party scene - one where most of them are getting wasted.I may have been let down by JR because I so thoroughly enjoyed one of Korman's other books, \\"Schooled\\" - JR was no where, I mean NO WHERE near as enjoyable. Of course, this is all subjective, so give JR a try. You might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible Remake!","review":"Jake, Reinvented was such a disappointment! For any Gatsby lovers, don't read this book! Maybe I'm biased, but I love Gatsby and this book was just a poorly done carbon copy of the classic. My school librarian told me this was a supposedly a modern Gatsby, but I don't think she knew that it's basically a rip-off of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pitiful retelling of Gatsby","review":"If I could, I would give this book negative stars. The characters are flat stereotypes, the plot a simplistic reduction of the original, the language mundane. I was insulted by the brute characterization of the football players and the vicious hatred of the nerds.I spend my days in an American high school and the kids there are much more tolerant and sensible than any of these characters. This retelling of Gatsby eliminates any of the romance of the orginal in favor of trite descriptions of drunken high school frenzies. At least Gatsby's parties included some beauty.Finally, the premise that Jake finances all of this by writing college essays and that his father doesn't notice the destruction of his house just doesn't work.Shakespeare took plots from many sources and enriched them. Korman has taken the Gatsby plot and simplified it into a crass portrayal of fools. No beauty, no romance, even Jake's idealism of Didi comes across as ridiculous.Don't bother reading it."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},M={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(B,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-4f84c0a0"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/34.md","filePath":"quotesmag/34.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/34.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
