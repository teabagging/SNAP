The thing that we love the most about it is the fact that you don't need to unscrew the cap all the way to pour the liquid out which is helpful because it helps the liquid stay warm even longer. You can simply unscrew about half way and tilt the thermos (directional arrows guide you) to pour. It's got a stainless steel exterior which is easy to clean and is very durable. 5 stars !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermos Nissan 61 oz Loving it!","review":"Love this thermas, hold almost a pot of coffee.

Always used the plastic coolers but they just seem to absorb dirt that can't get cleaned off. They get pretty nasty after awhile so I took a chance on this stainless steel thermos. I typically drink a half gallon of water in a work day so the size was right. Load it up with ice and cool water. Did a test run and much of the ice was still there after three day. What's nice is, if I do run out of water there is still plenty of ice for job site refills. I also tend to carry lots of equipment so the over-the shoulder-carry strap is nice too.The lid was the type that you have to unscrew totally to get a drink of water. I swapped it out for a $5 Klean Kanteen Amazon sport cap which has a sipping nozzle.All the other reviews were right.

I brew it around 6:00am, and it's still hot in the late afternoon around 3:00 to 4:00pm. Just be careful not to soak bleach water anywhere near the inner rubber lining around the mouth of the thermos or near the stopper. It's okay to fill the thermos with bleach water to clean, but just make sure you don't fill it all the way to the top mouth where the rubber lining is located. If you let bleach come in contact with the rubber lining for a few minutes the bleach will warp the rubber and you will lose your seal. You will have to buy a new thermos then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thermos, small opening","review":"I spec'd out this thermos and ordered it based on the volume it could hold and how long it could keep stuff cold. It might sound weird but I was also hoping to put solid food in the thermos, as well as liquids, but I didn't realize the top opening is not as wide as the inner diameter. The opening diameter is only about 1-3/8\\". The small opening also makes it hard to clean out. You would need a long handled brush to reach down inside to clean.

It might not make all that much difference but in the case of tea, EVERY tea processor recommends hot water in the teapot BEFORE brewing.

This is a much better solution than using the thermal carafe coffee makers. We've had several over the years and they don't come close to keeping the coffee as hot as this thermos does.

Everything about this thermos' finish and functionality is beautiful. The stainless steel interior and exterior mean it can be properly cleaned. The cup is a great size. The cap doesn't leak and it unscrews part way to pour without spilling the entire contents into the cup. The thermos cap is also designed to keep air from your liquids so that they maintain their temperatures. The folding handle is great. The sling strap is adjustable and easily removed before cleaning the thermos. It's clear the a lot of intelligence went into its design, which is why I bought two. On hot days I'll go through 3-4 liters of herbal iced tea while working outside. It's truly luxurious to have my beverages on hand (fresh brewed iced tea sweetened with stevia) instead of paying up for whatever is available.

The photo of a man rinsing cochineal-dyed skeins in a stream is especially evocative, showing clouds of the red dye blooming in blue water. My only complaint is that the author occassionally seems as if she's selling the town and its inhabitants in the same way she sells their crafts. I think we need to ban the word \\"magical\\" from all descriptions of indigenous/low tech comunities until we acknowledge the \\"magic\\" of our voodoo market economy and the hard materialism present in even idyllic-seeming villages.

However I'm a slow jam type of guy and the slow jam jazz covers on here Let Me Love You, We Belong Together, Lovers & Friends and Diary all stand out. The Usher/Lil Jon/Ludacris composition titled \\"Lovers and Friends\\" retains its soulful ballad ways, while the addition of certain jazz elements delivered from Baldwin's keyboards and the soulful horn charts played to the hilt by Nelson Rangell and Marion Meadows. The same can be said for My Place which becomes a even smoother slow jam when the sax is added to it. If you get a chance pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think this is a knockoff","review":"I picked this up by chance.

If you're going to rip off a great thing like the GTA line, why mess with what works? True Crime, no great game in comparison to Vice City, is a masterpiece of open play and nonlinear storyline compared to Mafia. To be honest, I only played half of this game...because I got bored with a lack of variety, one-strategy mission completion, and uncooperative controls.

The game isin't very realistic either, you can shoot somebody with a shot gun point blank and watch them go flying back only to see them get back up and start shooting you.

It's basically a rehash of Grand Theft Auto 3 or Vice City only with slow cars and bad music. Some of the control changes like the way you control your character on foot are unnecessary and kind of jarring. The makers took great pains to recreate the look and feel of the time period but it resulted in top heavy and SLOW cars. There are some really annoying dead ends to get your car stuck in if you take the wrong turn with the cops on your tail. I can kind of see what they were going for but for anyone who has played the GTA series its more hokey than charming. The Character models in the cut scenes are extremely well done though.

It was so obvious whose baby it was, and stupefying that the characters did not guess from the outset. Give readers some credit puhleeze! I must admit at this point that I'm not a fan of Rochelle Alers and as an AA myself I'm disappointed in her typecating of her female characters; whiny, in your face and a little bitchy - going from one end of the emotional spectrum to another with blazing speed and for no good reason. Her plots are sometimes disjointed and secondary characters merge in and out of the story without purpose. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"I love Rochelle Alers but the last 2 books I read were not enjoyable. I was glad to realiaze that this was one of her earlier books. I don't even know where to begin with this book. The characters were stereotypical. Beautiful weak woman - has to be protected, cannot even think for herself. tall, strong gorgeous man who is rich, controlling and kind of stupid.Some of the other 1 star reviews sum up the story. Just skip this one and get one her latest novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expect it to be sensational","review":"All of the other books I've read by Ms. Alers have been sensational.

Paulus, chronologically all over the shop, very limited attention to civilians.Yes, very interesting but not at all satisfying for either a military historian or anyone interested in the history.

A lot of water has flown under the bridges since in the field of genetics, the fastest evolving science in the early 21st century. I have read my fair share of books about genetics, and try to keep up-to-date with the scientific literature with regards to population genetics in particular. This is probably why reading this book came as such a disappointment to me. It already seems so antiquated. The fact that the writing style is so dense and repetitive does not help either. The strong point are the maps and statistic tables, but even they are of little value if you have seen more recent data, notably Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA studies. My recommendation would be to purchase a newer book on the subject. If you are looking for a good popular science book on population genetics, go for The 10,000 Year Explosion, by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of everything","review":"Cavalli-Sforza presents the nearest approximation possible to the correlation of all measurable human genes, markers and attributes. You might think of the work as the \\"unified field theory\\" for evloutionary biology, culture and linguistics.While the heft even of the abridged version is imposing, the component parts are manageable for those who already have basic statistical knowledge or who are willing to pay attention to the author's explanations. The world's populations are addressed in geographic chunks, and then at various appropriate points, more general conclusions drawn from the pieces.Given the advances in genetic research acheived since publication, the model may ultimately prove more valuable than the particular contents...but for this decade the contents are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I got out of this book","review":"I learned who the people closest genetically to Basques are.

This movie is a refreshing alternative to the gay=consumer message of more mainstream representations of gay youth. If you loved Anthony Rapp in the broadway musical Rent, you'll like him as David (easily an extension of his Mark character from Rent, only gay!). Manheim is wonderfully funny and surpising and warm and forces our weight-ist society to see that bigger is sexier! But be forewarned, this is an indie first film and it shows (the dialogue and filming are sometimes hit-or-miss), leaving the viewer occasionally distracted from the story.

The tuning is so finicky that it takes 2-3 minutes to fine tune each time you wear them. And finally last night, I couldn't tune them in at all.For some reason, the volume through the headphones is very low, and the volume control knob, also on the headphones (and unmarked as is the tuning knob) must be turned all the way up to reach an acceptable listening level.On the only bright side, the headphones are a bit lighter and more comfortable to wear than the competition, but if they don't work, what good is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when they work...","review":"Brand new, out of the box.

The whole deal was that Tod and Copper were two friends who didn't know they were supposed to be enemies. This sequel clouded it with some non sense country music and singing strays. I didn't like how instead of making a real sequel with events that happened AFTER the first film, they made a story that happened in between the first. They shouldn't have called it a sequel, more like a special. I was highly annoyed and I do not think it was 'Worth the wait' as it says on the back case of the DVD.

The way they are made, the hook does not disengage well enough when pressing the right combinations of buttons, so the plug becomes permanently locked into the socket.

It is full of creepy atmostphere and comes across as a psychotic jumble of some classic modern horror films which it uses as inspiration. Pino Donaggio's brilliant score helps pile on the weirdness. There is a horrendous death by suffocation scene by a Leatherface clone...........scary stuff indeed. oN the whole, despite problems with the plot and a certain uneveness, this is a classic that got away and never found its deserved audiece. it is a flawed classic within 80's horror. Worth it just for the style and the bizarre psycho in the movie.........mad enough to join the ranks of Norman Bates.

I gave in recently and bought it on DVD after failing to find it for rent anywhere.Let me first say that I had high expectations based on some reviews I'd read. However, after viewing \\"Tourist Trap\\" I can see why I have not heard of it before. It just doesn't work! The terrible acting, the ridiculous masks that Chuck Connors wore, and the lack of atmosphere. I wasn't at all scared.I think the movie may have fallen into the category \\"it's so bad, it's good\\" scenario. Plus it was made in the late 70's when horror films were a big industry.

The first time I ever watched it was on cable when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Of course, this movie ruined my sleep for many weeks afterwards, as it further fueled my \\"heebie jeebies\\" with mannequins, dolls, and the like. Even after 20 years of its release, \\"Tourist Trap\\" still continues to be a classic horror film, that's more frightening and nightmarish psychologically, than it is gory or bloody. So if you're tired of \\"Scream Part 19\\" and \\"I Could Care Less About What You Did Last Summer\\", and you're in the mood for a truly eerie and creepy movie, definitely check this gem out!

The only portion of the holes that are compacted were the ends of strokes, the forward end and the backward end, while the two side of each hole have very little compaction.

I agree it is not scary and it is far less frustrating then Silent hill.I fell in love with the world buka had created.This is defintley a game that deserved it's mature rating.

The graphics and dialog are decent but there seems to be no reason for actions of the character or for the \\"inventory\\" he uses. The item description is terrible! Like with Alone in the Dark and others, you can click on an item in inventory and it describes it for you. Not this one.

In the book there is a example of betrayal between the two families because the Feirs light a huge fireat the Goodes, house and believe it or not the Goodes and the Feirs use to be friends.This book takes place in Massachusetts where two families the Goodes, and the Feirs have been in a battle for years.There had been a great fire that had taken two special people away from William Goode. One was his wife Martha Goode ,the other was Susannah Goode, his daughter. Now William seeks revenge on Matthew and his whole family.I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and horror books and R.L Stine books.There is a second book but I have not chosen to read it because it gets slow at the end and they talk about the same things over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikki's review","review":"I liked this book because it was scary. These things could happen in real life, and I thought that was what made it scary. And it left me hanging a few times.This book was about a sixteen year old girl who lives in the 1660's. She came from England. She falls in love with a wealthy boy, son of the majesty. When he decides that he wants to marry her, he tells his father. His father wants him to marry a wealthy girl, and he refused. The father, Ben, decides to do something very mean to the girl and her mom so that the girl, Susanna, won't get married to his son. Eighteen years later, Susanna's dad sets out to get revenge on Ben. When he finds them, terrible things begin.I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and spooky stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna's review","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. It was fun to read but I got a little bit sick of it after awhile. It just keeps going on and on about the Goodes getting revenge on the Fiers. Everybody keeps having bad luck, but some parts were exciting.Susannah Goode loves Edward Fier. They always have secret meetings in the woods until Susannah and her mother are found guilty of being witches. They were burnt at the stake. The Fiers had done this, but why? Why call someone a witch when they weren't one?People who love scary stories will love this book. It will definitely give you nightmares, so watch out for the Fiers in your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fave In The Series. . .","review":"The Betrayal, the first book in the Saga, is my fave (so far).

The novel was originally titled \\"Scénes de la vie de Bohéme. This book is Murger's tribute to Bohemians. He chronicles the adventures of four Bohemians as they struggle to survive in 1840s Paris. Murger seems to have created a tale based on his own adventures in Bohemia. So there is a trace of autobiography in these pages. Rudolph is the character most similiar to Murger. He is joined by his friends Schaunard, Marcel and Colline. They are all artists of one kind or another. They form a Bohemian club which is like a support group. Their lives and loves are well documented here. Murger must have felt great nostalgia for his own period of Bohemianism. It is a passionate tale that still resonates today. If you are a fan of the opera or just interested in Bohemians and French literature, this book is a pleasing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, but does OK for close-ups using a DSLR camera","review":"I use the lens cap and cap keeper all the time.

The inclusion of Kawabata is especially inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORLD'S GREATEST SHORT STORIES (not so much)","review":"There's a certain arrogance that is attached to the title of this book. Most of the entries of the \\"world's greatest\\" go from late 19th century and stop at 1968 with Jorge Luis Borges. At the same time I bought this book, I purchased BEST SHORT STORIES of 2011. Quite frankly, most of the short stories in the 2011 volume were superior to the offering in \\"World's Greatest\\". I would even quibble to the extent that, in the case of Hemingway, they didn't even choose his best short story. the same is true for Borges. I can think of many stories written past 1968 that should have made it into this volume, if for no other reason than the simple fact that the short story has evolved considerably since the \\"world's greatest\\" were written, and now quality short stories can be found almost anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest short stories","review":"This stories are written (supposedly) by the greatest authors of our time.These authors are titled and credited with being the most auspicious writers.Each and every story left me with the feeling that there should be more to come.I thought these stories were written as a serial and I was looking for the next page would begin the final story installment ...Well, just to make it simple, it was a waste of my time.

It doesn't. And she gets many of her facts wrong, such as her claim that ganja was still legal in Jamaica in the mid-30s.If you're interested in the life of Leonard P.

I normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good. This one was just overkill that was not even funny. I initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like \\"nursury\\" comedy if you know what I mean. I turned it off after the whole overdrawn toilet scene with the wedding-gown-infomercial-in-a-movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Turn It Off","review":"I loved \\"The RM\\" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.

If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and hopefully thought provoking to LDS","review":"Very funny slapstic story around two opposite end spectum LDS Home teachers. The message of the film is to find the realistic happy medium in life and Church service. And that there is a reason for Church sevice... and it isn't to \\"look spiritual\\".While I think that you have to be LDS to get all the humor in this story and certainly to get the underlying message of the film. Any fan of slapstic humor should find this film enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too over the top to even be funny","review":"I have a good tolerance for implausibilities in comedy shows, but this one pushed it too far. Many of the gags were also amateurish. It reminded me of a high-budget Boy Scout skit. Really the only thing it has going for it is a gimmick: a show for Mormons about Mormons."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun family flick","review":"I don't know what that other guy is talking about. As far as LDS films go, this one is the funniest of the bunch, better than Singles Ward or RM, both of which I enjoyed. Michael B does a great job of capturing every sport-enthusiast-Mormon stereotype and pokes fun at all of the nightmare aspects of home teaching, from the last minute scheduling to the un-prepared-and-desperate spiritual thoughts. Although I've not tried entertaining my families with clogging demonstrations. Yes, the whole movie is over the top. But its hilarious because you'll see yourself or your home teacher is many of the situations. Its just good fun, folks. And I love the soundtrack, too. Can't get enough of those jazzed up and hip-ified primary tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"physical comedy with a mormon twist, and a spiritual message.","review":"This movie was great for the most part. A few over-the-top comedy skits, but mostly just good, clean, physical comedy. I loved it, and the best part was the great message at the end. A must-see modern mormon film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I really enjoyed \\"Single's Ward\\" and thought I'd give this a try. The characters were overplayed and the movie seemed drag on and on.

My copy has only been used once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny over-the-top LDS Humor","review":"I was very surprised by some of comments by those who gave negative reviews. This is a comedy and it was meant to be over the top. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, many of us have met folks who approach both ends of the spectrum presented by the two main characters. This fact and similar stereotypes are what make these two caricatures so funny. My wife and I were rolling during several of the scenes. Better than some LDS movies (RM, It's Latter-day Night), nearly as good as others (God's Army, Singles Ward, Saints and Soldiers), it's worth a view if you want to have a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"There are sometimes humorous situations in the life of an active member of the LDS Church, including home teaching, but this movie is an extremely poor attempt to portray them. The characters are not authentic active members (that is, the only ones that actually DO home teaching). One of them can't wait to get out of church to watch football games on Sunday, while the other (portrayed as the \\"spiritual one\\" in some reviews) is depicted as a \\"letter-of-the-law\\" fanatic that will insist in visiting all families even if is the last day of the month, but will use the visits to promote and sell the Scripture CDs which are his business. The \\"comic\\" situations are highly exagerated, and for long stretches nothing interesting happens. It is said that this movie was done very quickly, which is evidenced by its poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective unit.","review":"I have purchased these at Walmart before, and have had no problems.

Even without instructions I was able to figure out how to install this in 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Nothing","review":"This thing is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. The \\"safety\\" design as I'll laughingly call it seems to be based around the idea that you have to pull the two tabs you see in the picture out to unlock the compartment and then the case slides out of the way. I have no idea why there are two tabs since you only have to pull one to release it. And even if you don't pull either tab it just means a little more force is needed to tug on it and it still slides apart with relative ease. So easy in fact that my 16 month old toddler defeated it just one day after we bought it. I wish I could give this thing zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has room for big plugs","review":"This covers large plugs.

It is designed for larger plugs & adapters but must say I will likely order only this kind verses the smaller covers even for smaller plugs. It is much easier for an adult to remove the plug shield than the smaller plug covers and I like that it replaces the wall plate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed for large wires on power strips","review":"Most other covers work fine with lamp cord wires but will not work with the larger wires found on multi-outlet power strips. This one does. It is made of heavy duty plastic and the locking cover should be difficut for toddlers to open."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pain to use","review":"The benefit of this cover is that it expands so you can control how long the cover is (as in, its length along the wall, not how far it juts out from the wall). So if you have a long adapter, this is probably the cover you need. But I found this a complete pain to use. You have to take the whole thing apart in order to plug a cord in or take one out. The bottom part doesn't stay attached while you remove the top part to access the plugs. This got annoying fast.

The trouble is - they make that measurement after removing the stock OEM factory flare that's on all the Tacoma 4x4s and Prerunners. So at best, you get about half-an-inch more tire coverage than stock; hardly worth the trouble. Certainly my 285/70R17 tires on 17x8 wheels with 4.5\\" backspacing still stick out past the new bushwacker flares I put on today.If you're looking for a fender flare because you need better tire coverage for your oversize tires - may need to keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"mestre","review":"grande mestre espanhol, grandes interpretaes de bach, bom acompanhamento de orquestra nas ultimas canoes. poderia ter mais musicas. recomendado. vpp"},{"rating":"2","title":"(:","review":"Got it just in time for halloween!

Because we are not experts, it takes us a while to find a pulse on an infant. Once we find it, most of the time the sound is poor and if our kid is moving, then it is nearly impossible to count pulses for more than 5 seconds; let alone if she's crying. On top of that, the pressure in your ears, from the plastic tips, is unbearable. It is really uncomfortable to use and poor sound quality.We can still monitor our kid with it, (we've gotten better) but for $[...]we can make this a more pleasant experience, so I am buying another stethoscope and keeping this as a spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"At first I could only hear out of one side but then I kept trying different things and reassembling it.

So, I decided to give it a try hoping id have better luck but to my surprise I couldn't even hear anything through it.

The most infamous episodes of lying, in particular Hitler's Big Lie, along with modern theories of propaganda are not even mentioned. This mislabeling would hardly be a fatal flaw, but Campbell badly misreads the record of modern philosophy on the issue of truth. Descartes, a thoroughgoing nominalist and a liar by necessity (as he wrote at the time of the Inquisition) comes across as a champion of God, Ideas, and absolute Truth. Hobbes is hardly mentioned while much ink is spilled on minor linguists like Derrida, and having spilled it, Campbell fails to mention the Heidegger affair, Paul de Man, and other notorious instances of postmodern mendacity. Campbell has written a bad history just good enough that an important historical subject will have to wait for the next generation of scholars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is a Liar","review":"Alas, the lovely cover of this book obscures the fact that it is little more than a sophomoric rehash of highlights in the history of Western philosophy.

What I wanted when I picked this up was a nitty gritty encounter with human falsehood ... conscious or otherwise. I sher didn't git it.

Sure enough he is a woman-hating homosexual. I have had a little experience with women in my life and I have never met any women who would put up with the treatment they accept in this film.

This book examines the features, advertising, and \\"advertorials\\" of magazines aimed at teenage girls AND interviews teenage girls (both magazine readers and non-magazine readers). So, in addition to anazlying content (something that is important and interesting but has been done), Currie speaks to girls to find out how they read the magazines, why they read the magazines, and what they get out of them. The results are surprising. In addition to the interviews and content analysis, Currie also provides information about social research methods that I, someone outside of the sociology field, found very interesting. One complaint about the book is that she used several of the same quotes in more than one section of the book. This repetition made me wonder if the author actually intended for someone to sit down and read the book cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, wrong color","review":"The product is nice in that it supports single DIN and ISO options for fitting multiple radio styles.

Probably not, but I would still definitely recommend it for the rhythms that make me dance in my seat at stop lights.

The best track is definitely Represent Cuba."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, was it ever awful...","review":"I would give this soundtrack 0 stars if it was possible, I was very-very disappointed (probably just like most people that expected to hear some good ol' latin music). This CD has only three songs I would consider remotely appropriate for a movie about latin/ballroom dancing: Satellite (Spanish Version), El Estuche and Do You Only Wanna Dance by Julio Daivel Big Band. Everything else is either spanglish Rap or Hip-Hop. When I first started listening to the soundtrack I thought I inserted a wrong CD.. If you like latin music or expect to find few nice danceable Salsa or Mambo on this CD - FORGET IT, you're better of getting something different, 85% of this one is Hip-Hop and Rap.

I just knew it was going to be as good if not better than the original soundtrack to Dirty Dancing. When the music started playing I could not believe my ears. A soundtrack should embody the music of not only the movie but the time the movie is set. I was expecting great music from the 60's with latin flare and some of the nostalgic big latin bands like Tito Puente. What I received was rap music and one horrible remake of You Send Me. I guess I don't remember there being rap music in the 60's. I am not a fan of rap music so the disappointment I felt while listening to this cd was extreme.

Its a good mixture of the latin world, and hip hop flava. I am not spanish, but even the songs in spanish were addicting. I found nothing wrong with this album, because its good to dance to, and I couldn't get the songs out of my head, when I left the theater. I picked up the CD in a hurry.

They have nothing to do with Cuban music and I found them to be a waste of my time. It seems suspiciously as if the songs chosen had titles that had the word \\"Dance\\" in them without giving any credibility to the authenticity of the movies theme at all.

I saw the movie and while it didn't have the classy flair of the original, it was fun to watch. The music (in the movie) was GREAT! Naturally I gravitated toward buying the soundtrack. Again, without looking at each song, etc. The soundtrack and the movie have nothing to do with each other. The CD is loaded with 2004 style R&B and rap-esque music. The fact that some of the titles are in spanish, does not make this a latin CD. And don't even think you are getting Cuban music. If you like R&B, this might be a good choice. If you are expecting Cuban music - STAY AWAY and look for traditional Cuban artists"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that made the Movie","review":"Loved the music. It has everything in it.

It's often difficult to gauge the reliability if you order only one or two because bad monitors are probably chalked up as a fluke and quickly replaced by the company. I can definitely attest that these monitors are ticking time bombs just waiting to fail (probably right after the warranty expires!) They have caused me headaches to no end because they don't fail right away; rather, they take extended periods of time before they realize that a signal is being sent to them and remain powered off or in a sleep mode. Eventually, they will no longer come on at all. ViewSonic has definitely dropped the ball on this one and should be ashamed for allowing such a shoddy product to go out to their customers.

The story seems to be a major turning point in the relationship of Peter and Norman, but then it doesn't go anywhere. The promise of this being a truly climactic confrontation is never delivered upon. In the end, it feels like there wasn't really a story to tell here, just an attempt to include the villain that audiences would want to read about, after seeing him in the movie.This isn't the worst Spider-Man material in recent years. Later issues of Peter Parker would deliver that. It's just not up to the high standards of fun storytelling that Jenkins and Ramos had established in the earlier part of their run on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed","review":"Fantastically well told, this is not your typical Spidey-Goblin conflict. This particular duel is a psychological one, and really gets to the heart of both the individual characters, and the relationship Peter and Norman have.

Perhaps my favorite story arc in the Spider Anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I enjoyed the artwork in this comic more than I enjoyed the story.

This comes from several small disappointments game-wise. The game tokens are made of green, supposedly glow-in-the-dark plastic, not colored (they could've covered them with DIFFERENT glow-in-the-dark colors) so it's hard to make out their features. There are very few of the tokens themselves and they are not as humorous as I imagined them. Additional tokens may be purchased at an outrageous price and an even more so shipping-and-handling charge. Overall I do not think this game warrants the price asked for it. It is nowhere near as comical as it seems on the photos or in your head. If you want to play monopoly, get another addition like regular Simpsons, Electronic Banking, or the Here & Now editions. Don't spend your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Monopoly version is a blast for fans","review":"My fiance and I both enjoy the Simpsons, but we especially enjoy the Treehouse of Horrors episodes.

Secondly, to remove the stickers, just open the box from the bottom to expose the label, squirt with a bit of Windex, let sit for a few minutes and the labels rub right off. They seal nicely. My only gripe is that labeling the front of the jar doesn't work because of the curve. Avery makes label 22825 that fits PERFECTLY on the top of the jar, which worked well for me. I have my entire set of 48 displayed on a tiered shelf in my kitchen and they look amazing. In my opinion, these are the best I have ever found, and I have been looking a long, long time.

I tested this by filling both with water and shaking them upside down. The Libbey jar took at least 7-8 hard shakes before I got any water to leak out. Whereas the other jar began leaking after 1-2 mild shakes.+Cheaper price. Libbey is 12 for $20. The other jar is 10 for $19Con's for the Libbey Jar-Less volume. The other jar is a taller squarish construction. This gives it slightly more volume with a smaller footprint.

(4/17/2002) It's overall a very good game with impressive graphics. The actual gameplay takes about 15 minutes to get used to. Once you do you will notice it's easy to move around and fight. I was concerned how they would handle the actual webslinging but it is very well done. Some of the reflections on the buildings are just amazing.It is rated 'E' and has no objectionable content for younger players other then beating up on the bad guys. In typical Spiderman fashion, no one really dies but rather just disappears. There is also no blood splattering from what I can tell.I would suggest Spiderman to anyone that likes an action adventure game. It's a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If spidey himself played it, he would be disoriented","review":"This game is visually breathtaking, has the feeling and edge of Spider-Man, and makes sense based on its progression.

It's graphics really show off what it can do. You fight the toughest villains on earth like Green Goblin, and Scorpian. What I dislike, is about the camera view. The camera view is sometimes totally confusing, sometimes when you're walking, the camera view suddenly changes. Also, the contrlos are a bit frustrating, especially that if you want to do a web dome or a web ball for instance, you will have to press the triangle and a direction on the analog stick, if you don't press them at the same time, then spiderman will merrily moe in that direction.The game relates exactly to the movie and that's good. Overall, I'd give this a 9/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of hype!","review":"Well, I bought Spider-man: The Movie for X-box. I saw some previews in magazines and thought it looked pretty good. On the contrary, it withheld the long running chain of awful movie based games that are obviously just the company's excuse to score some cash off a big name. The camera angles are so annoying, it makes you want to throw up. There are glitches everywhere, like the fact that bosses get caught jumping of ledges and float in mid air while twitching spazmatically. The plot is so ugly, it feels like you are doing these missions for no apparent reason. Also, spider-man uses the same catch phrases over and over. It doesn't help that they're not funny, either. It's so short I beat it in one night, despite its tedious level design and boss fights. Overall, I'll give this game 2 stars because it has spider-man in it. Otherwise, it's the worst X-box game I've seen yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids new to video games","review":"Just purchased an Xbox and purchased Spiderman for my 8 year old grandson and it has a great tutoral to help you navigate.

I love a challenge... but this game just seemed like an impossibility. Definitely not a game for the younger crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT SHORT","review":"This game is really cool. It is packed with action and fighting. You have to fight Uncle Ben's Killer, Shocker, Vulture, Green Goblin, and Kraven. Plus the hundreds of guys you have to fight on the way to the boss. The game would be a five star but it is to short. If it had Venom, Rhino, Charnage, and other guys then it would be a five star game.

The camera controls are very hard to get used to. The gameplay is extremely repetitive, whenever you die you start at the beginning of the level, which gets frustrating very quickly. Even on the easiest level this game is ridiculously hard, and you'll spend hours waiting for the levels to load, and reload. There have been a couple of glitches, ranging from spiderman floating and shaking, to the xbox locking up, and having to be powered down. To wrap it up, a game should be fun, not an exercise in frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","review":"All of that hype for a piece of garbage like this is absolutely ridiculous.

This is not a game it's a graphic novel. Yes, you can make choices to achieve different ending but mostly you just read and watch changing screen shots. Which is fine if that's your thing but if you want action, adventure, roll playing you will be vary, very, vary disappointed. Also the language of the game is Japanese, I don't speak Japanese and no amount of art or story line can make up for having to spend all that time reading to the point you don't have time to watch the screen shots change. You can control the speed to the text, true enough, but you still can't enjoy an even moderately paced game doing so. Amazon should make it clear that games like this are in foreign languages and that they are not really games at all. I will be more careful of how I choose my games and spend my money with Amazon in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine this book was a movie in black and white.","review":"I kept thinking of all the old black and white movies.You know the ones you loved as a kid, but when you rent them again they areso boring, because there's so little action, and the characters spend all themovie just talking about things.This one is like that.

They plan how to plug town entrances and exits, take over police and fire stations, and control the town while they can rob every commercial enterprise within city limits. Things seem to be going according to plan until Edgars loses his mind.This is an excellent caper. The pressure cooker environment when the dozen or so robbers are trapped in a shed for several days shows real insight into group dynamics. If you're a Stark (aka Donald E. Westlake) fan, then you'll enjoy The Score."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Score","review":"Good stuff. The Score follows Parker, a career criminal, on yet another job. Parker ignores his gut instincts about the man setting up the job and agrees to come along. All is going smoothly when Parkers concerns come to fruition and all hell breaks loose.

If you like the genre, I'd definitely recommend The Score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"This is probably not the worst book written, but it is definitely the worst book I have spent the time reading. I don't often write reviews here, but I was so irritated last night when I finished, I had to vent. The ending totally sucks! I won't give it away to those that take the 5 star ratings and decide to read it. But it was slow moving, and finally at half way through the book when they actually got to the heist, I figured the action would take off, which it did for a few chapters. Then I was anxious to get to the ending, and boy was that a big let down!! There were loose ends that never got tied up. I questioned what happened to some of the people back in the town? I have never read any of the other Parker novels, but this one sure turned me off to trying anymore. It just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is the first Stark novel that I've read. Disappointing!

This makes about 15% of the book.The rest isn't that good as the other reviews states.

As an European, where GSM is widespread, this book doesn't add much information for me. It may be so that it is more geared towards people in the Americas where you're more exposed to CDMA/TDMA/IS-136 and it is more relevant for you, but Europeans is well advised to buy another book.A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply too simple ...","review":"Even though enjoyable to read, it does not get real insight on the topics of ineterest"},{"rating":"1","title":"GSM Made SIMply Ridiculous","review":"To any reader who wants to know something about GSM (and wants to find accurate, clear, concise information), LOOK TO ANOTHER SOURCE OF MATERIAL.

I can remember going to see them erected from a spot in Queens with my grandfather. So after 9/11 my interest in them was even greater. I approached this book as a possible insight giver on the construction and workings of these true landmarks. I was very wrong. Content was more towards the history of downtown NYC and the political as well as the private backroom dealings in getting them built. Little mention was spent on the building and maintaining them. The writing style was more of a thesis type, that resembled anger toward federal, state and local government and there policies.

It is a meticulous study that speaks volumes about contemporary affairs and the historical events that constituted a century of relentless urban renewal, from the real-estate fat-cats with their skycraping ambitions and the undemocratic politics that supported them, to the underdogs who suffer the inevitable consequences of profit at any cost. Mr.Darton uses the rise of New York's World Trade Center to illustrate a century of global development and industrialization that has sculpted and conditioned our way of life, wherever we may live. Injected with poetic phrasing, insight and a sensitive personal take that illustrates both the author's understanding of our times, and his love for the city where he lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL PRODUCT","review":"I was looking for an item that would keep my pups warm after they had a bath. these are perfect. they love them! they are the best purchase I have made. the company was great. i would buy from them again and probably will buy again! shipping was so fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Spiderman.

Second the storyline isnt close to being like the movie. The only common thing between the game and the movie is that they both have Spiderman in it. And third it was too short.

The controls are totally messed up because Spiderman might keep running when you try to make him stop, AND when you are web-swinging, you stick onto any wall you bump into. I'd also like to add that this game is very short. It is only a mere ten levels (four of which are very easy) and a few mini-games which quickly get old. The graphics are a small con, but still affect the game nonetheless. The only place where graphics are good are the movie sequences. Overall, do not get this game, rent it.

It has extra villins like the Shocker and the Vulture. It also fetures the scorpine but, he is kind of good. This game is harder then the one for N64. This game is also funner then the other one. You can find new moves and get enough points so you can get new things at the secrect store. There are also new things you can do for example save a person by picking them up and puting them in a special spot away from danger. For the people that only liked the other spiderman game for N64 as a one time game then you will probaly think the same for this one.

I mean, has anyone PLAYED the matrix?!?Spider-Man is a good game, both as a comic book and a movie game.The ability to web sling, which is much better than in it's ps1 and n64 days,is fun to do and is well implemented for the air battles. In fact, I'm glad that they added the Green Goblin as a playable character, because it forced them to rework the web slinging aspect of the game.The bosses are believable, and fun to fight. There are a few stealth missions, and well implemented at that.And the bonus features. 3 costumes for Spider-Man can be used, and the green goblin becomes a playable character as well. There is even a bowling mini-game to unlock.All in all, a very good game for a very good character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be your strating point if you are just starting this style.","review":"If you are just geting into jazz chord melody this is an excelent choice.

There is no drain (but SHOULD be), so water would sit, turn the sand a greenish color and probably hold some mosquito larvae in the standing water (I live in central FL). Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sandbox","review":"I bought this toybox for our 3 kids...ages 19mos, 5years, and 9years. They have all had so much fun with this that i dont mind all the sand that ends up on them. I look outside and find lots of neighborhood children now in our yard enjoy the fun that this sandbox has provided. I highly recommend this box to anyone plus it also looks nice and when they outgrow it I can use it as a planter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Durable!","review":"We bought this sand box for our son who is 2 1/2 and he plays in it every single day! He loves it and being in Florida you have to be really careful with the heat and rain and the lid is perfect and has kept all the rain out and has maintained its color and shape! Plus the box is larger than some of the other ones and gives him plenty of room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I purchased this sand box for my son's 1st birthday. He absolutely loves it. It is a perfect size so it fits great on our patio. I love the way it looks it blends in great with the rest of our landscaping. It is very durable and should last a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides hours of fun!!","review":"This has been, by far, one of the best purchases I have made for my kids. They play in it for hours and more importantly - TOGETHER (without fighting!!) :) I bought (4) 50 lb. bags of sand, but only ended up using 2 of them. The cover is great to keep some of the neighborhood cats from using it as a litterbox as well as from the sand getting too hot in the late afternoon. I would highly reccommend this sandbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of happy tots","review":"We love this sandbox. It's the perfect size for both my 5 and 2 yr olds to play together or to have their \\"separate corners,\\" and we've even had up to 4 kids using the sandbox simultaneously without problems during a playdate. The textured outer surface of the sandbox must somehow help to prevent the plastic from getting too hot to touch because my son has never had any issues with removing the lid or sitting on the stumps, (though I usually set up the beach umbrella to shield them from the sun during playtime.) The lid also does a great job of staying put on super windy days and of preventing water from entering the sand pit during storms. Also, the box is deep enough so that you can get a good amount of sand in the box for some really imaginative play. We'll definitely be taking this box with us on our next move. I would definitely recommend this sandbox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Great product. We use a ratchet strap to keep the lid on in case of thunderstorms. It is a great sandbox for our 20 month old and 5 year old. They love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sandbox","review":"Our 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this sandbox. We taught her to sit on one of the corners and she enjoys playing with various toys (pots, pans, jars etc.)The sandbox lid/cover is a good feature. However, the way we filled up the sandbox, one side was not very straight which prevents the lid from fitting snugly. As a result, the lawn sprinkler throws some water in the sandbox every morning...not the sandbox's fault entirely...but the flexible plastic bulged such that the lid isn't snug. All in all, a great value for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lid stays on! I'm impressed!","review":"We've had this sandbox for a year now and after our all-day wind advisory we had yesterday with crazy 60-70mph winds I just had to rave about this product. Yes, it looks very nice in the yard, and yes it is plenty big to fit my kids comfortably (unlike those little green turtle sandboxes), but I was sure that in our crazy Kansas winds we would be constantly loosing the lid. It has not blown off once through thunderstorms and all. I can't believe it. Very good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sandbox for toddlers","review":"We bought this sandbox for our grandson. We are happy with the size and amount of sand it holds. The lid is great but really strong winds can blow it off. It does not have a way to secure it. I do wish it was a little sturdier, maybe a thicker plastic. We are overall, very happy with this sandbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Big As You Would Hope!!","review":"Be warned, this sandbox is NOT any bigger than the Little Tykes Dinosaur or Step 2 Crabbie. It's rectangular, but skinny, and at the ends it's even narrower than in the middle. The interior measure is 44 1/2 X 31 at it's biggest point. The Dino and Crab is about 36 X 36 square. So, really no difference. It is attractive, yes, and durable. But if you're looking for a BIG sandbox, keep looking. And good luck!! I don't know WHY they can't make a LARGE sandbox with a cover. Very frustrating. If you really need a big one, I'd suggest a big pool with a cover. At least they're making larger pools these days. Also, the cover has no area on it where you can easily grab it and pick it up. It's a bit awkward trying to pick it up and hold onto it with no indentation or handle at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkids loved it","review":"We purchased this item about a week before eight of our grandchildren paid us a visit, and the younger ones loved it. It's not real big, but big enough, and the cover, which is easy to place, is a real plus. The price was right, and we're sure that this sandbox will see plenty of use for years to come. It's also not an eyesore like some of the bright green turtles and other cheaper sandboxes available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"I bought this sandbox for my nephew.

He absolutely loves it. The sides are the perfect height so he can go in and out on his own. The top has not blown off in strong winds, and I've never seen any water or bugs (thank goodness) in the sand! My sister's old sand used to be damp and have spider and ants in it. I was worried, since I know my son would play with them. No insects here!We only filled the box with half the sand limit. I think 100 lbs.. Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun sandbox","review":"We purchased this sandbox for our 2 yr old and she loves it! We live in a residential area with a small to medium-sized yard, and this is the perfect fit for her. It is the size I expected that it would be, and I think perfect for 1-2 children ages 1-4. The seats are sturdy enough for me to sit on (150 lbs). The cover is a bit flimsy compared to the construction of the rest of the box, but overall it is very well made and fits the box well. We are very pleased with the color and build of this sandbox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My twins like to play in it...","review":"My twins (3Years)like to play any time in the sandbox.

She just absolutely loves it and as hard as it is to get my older kids to spend a little time with her this did the trick, at times I even catch their friends playing in it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good sandbox for a child 5 years of age and under for a girl or boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves to play in her sandbox!","review":"My daughter is 21 months old. Her grandparents purchased her the matching playhouse along with this sandbox. The sandbox I had seen in the store and liked right away. It is very roomy. I did not like the idea of a \\"crab\\" in my backyard so this was very appealing. My daughter has so much fun playing in this sandbox. We purchased a few inexpensive sand toys for her and now she would spend hours playing outside if we let her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two 3 year old twins and neighbor have plenty of room","review":"I researched sandboxes for both size and a good lid. This was a clear winner. We have twin 3 year olds and an indoor/outdoor cat. Not a great combo for a sandbox. So, I needed something that fit everyone for play and has a tight lid when not in use. The kids have plenty of room to play and when they are done, I just throw the sand toys in the sand and put the lid on. The lid has not blown off during wind storms and it stays dry when you have rain showers. The sandbox allows for plenty of sand to play in and when it is not in use, it blends fairly well into the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this sand box for my son's 1st birthday.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Purchase","review":"After looking at many sandboxes, including more expensive wooden models, we opted for this and are very happy that we did. It is well sized for our toddler and his many toys. Plenty of room for a playmate or two to join in the fun. This sandbox was far sturdier than any of the other plastic models we looked at, blends better into our back yard and I don't need to worry about splinters. We couldn't be happier with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sanbox for kids!!","review":"I bought this sandbox for my son after reading a couple of the other reviews. They were right, this is a great sandbox, my 3 year old son just loves playing in it. The dome on the cover is nice because I can store his toys right in the sandbox so we don't have to haul them back and forth everytime he wants to play with it. He also loves the dome on the cover to walk on like he's king of the mountain, it is very durable and I don't worry about it breaking, the top doesn't even slightly cave in when he's standing right on top of it. I would recommend that anybody looking for a toybox buy this one, I'm almost positive you'll appreciate it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sandbox in the World","review":"My son got this for his 1st birthday this year and we just love it. Altough he still has no concept that the sand is to stay in the sandbox, he just loves it. It is really big and looks nice in the backyard. I am not fond of the turtle or ladybug sandbox in my backyard and this one is great. It also doubles has a flower planter when the sand days are gone. It is also nice that it comes with a lid to keep bugs and rain out. It is just one giant great sandbox. A+++++++++ Step2 for making a great looking sandbox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mom in Killeen,Texas","review":"My 2 year old son loves this sandbox! I chose it because of the natural color (we live in Texas and it seems the hot sun bleaches out most of his toys). Two children can easily play together in it because it's long rather than round or square. Also for the size, it's a really good value! We had his birthday party recently and had a bunch of one to four year old children really test it out - so I know it's very durable! The lid fits securly and the little bit of rain or sprinkler water that has fallen on it has not seeped in. Niether have any bugs or animals so far! My nieghbor's 7 year old son likes it also, so it's good for all ages. I highly reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great durability!","review":"Never gets wet, never leaks, cover stays on through the harshest of weather! I am still impressed.

The only drawback is the lid. This time of year the wind really blows hard some days and we experience a lot of stormy weather...therefore, it would be nice if the lid snapped on some way as not to come off so easily. We purchased a tarp strap to keep the lid on tight so it won't blow away in a storm.

The packaging says, \\"soft, flexible material\\" yet they are made of a hard plastic. It took one throw for the penguin's nose to fall off and after playing with them at the pool for one day a good amount of paint is scraped off the characters. Although two of the characters float, they took in a little bit of water, which cannot be removed. Leaving it in there will cause the eventual mold. Not to mention having two floating in a set of \\"DIVE\\" toys is a little ridiculous. In my opinion, the cute faces don't make up for the extra money. I should have bought the plain ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite low price, still a waste of money","review":"I agree with the previous post. I probably shouldn't have expected much for $5, but within 20 minutes of removing from the package (and before making it to the pool!) my 3 year old brought one of the rings to me and a huge piece had broken off of it - leaving an extremely dangerous pointy shard of plastic.

The 3-year old was not too impressed with this toy altough I suspect when she is five, we'll pull it out again and play with it. I (Grandma) did have a few rounds of the game and enjoyed it.

I guided them through playing with it a few times, but they did not like how easily the clown fell. The smallest bump would cause it to fall. When the pieces fall, they roll across the room, distracting my kids from the actual game. For them, the game looked more fun than it actually was. It was simply too frustrating to play, so we put it away. I brought it out again after a few months, with similar results. My kids never ask for it. The toy is sturdy and colorful. The potential is there for learning about weight and balance, if it stays up long enough.

Far too many important concepts and ideas were left out of the movie which made for a lack of empathy for certain characters. The flat out lack of characterization destroyed the quality of viewing for the movie.After 10 minutes i had already realized i would be dissapointed and tried to watch the film without relating it to the book. It was far to obvious though that there was major editing done that cut out sections of storyline. There were times i thought \\"hey, how did the characters get to this point from nowhere?\\" and there were scenes in the movie that merely wasted time.

The acting and scenery were the only good things that saved this movie from being total crap. If it had gotten nominated for an Oscar, it would only have proved that the other nominees had to be bad. Half of the story line and 2/3 of the characters have been sucked out of this 2 hour peice of trash.

The Potter films have been incredibly successful at leaving out certain elements while keeping the basic story the same. The filmmakers in the case of Eragon simply decided to write their own story and use the character names from the book. Further, they wrote a bad story with a bad script and bad actors, with the exception of Jeremy Irons. Irons is certainly in his element as the grizzled, creepy, old war hero and is the only redeeming quality to the movie. It is a shame because the book had so much big screen potential. I almost wish the production company would scrap any plans for a sequel, wait several years, and then restart with better personnel.

Ulrich. (Read that one.) I had such high hopes for the movie, since the book is a great read. Yes, it is very derivative of Star Wars as many reviewers have written, but still a good story.Obviously when the author sold the movie rights to his book, he did not maintain any veto power as to how much they could butcher his book, and the movie makers did just that. Yes, if they had tried to include everything that was in the book, in the movie, it would have been long. So why don't the movie producers just break a long movie up into two parts and release them 2-3 months apart? They could have made twice the money releasing a 2-part, 4-hour movie and most fans would have been thrilled. Not exactly rocket science.If you are really curious about this movie, then rent it first. Better to waste $4, than $22.79 (Two-Disc Special Edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kiddie Movie","review":"Unlike the recent fantasy master pieces, this plot is skewed and thin-thin, the only hope the movie had was in an excellent delivery. Special effect were nominal at best; action was less than that thanks to its PG or child audience. The dialogue might have been the worst. The characters delivered there lines all they were reading them off cue cards, often causing the audience to laugh. As I said, \\"A Kid's Movie.\\" If you won't notice the bad acting, won't notice the lack of plot, and won't notice the lack of action this is your movie!

My 12-year old and I read the book last summer. We both liked the book and were looking forward to seeing the movie. But the movie cut way too much out and sped events up to the point that I felt like we were watching the story with a controller in fast forward. Jeremy Irons gave the only decent performance. I did not like the actor they picked for Eragon at all. He was just a pretty face with zero talent. My 17-year old summed it up best...when we left the theater he said, \\"That was the cheesy version of Lord of the Rings\\".So skip the movie and buy the book. The book is no Lord of the Rings, either, but it is a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"it is so bad i could not even finish watching the DVD. this is just another of the tired hollywood underdog movies, change stars wars \\"the force\\" for a dragon and that is the movie. except this one makes no sense at all, is cliche filled and is terrible. a question i have is, why is the leader of the whatchamacallitsecretninjaguys black when there every other character in the movie is white? the typical pass the torch scene, or sword, is done no less than 3 times between eregon and jeremy irons character. so what is eragon? is it dragon with an e instead? i thought it may be a name of a place, castle or something but some dumb kid? give me a break. john malkovich is in this movie just to make some $ and is a clownish bad guy. why is the evil wizard so scared of some old bald dork king?this movie makes no sense, it has no story, the acting is bad, it is full of stupid cliche's and must have been written for the D&D; dork crowd that would find this drivel entertaining.yuck!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing!","review":"I loved these books, but 5 minutes into this movie I wanted to walk out of the theaters.

Boy(aka Luke Skywalker), with a dreams of being someone(Jedi), becomes the last of a breed of Dragon Riders(aka Jedi). He becomes under the teaching of a former Dragon Rider, Brom (aka Obi Won Kenobi). As he trains and outta nowhere learns magic, he finds out of a trapped princess(aka Leia). Disregarding his mentor, he goes to save her and in the process, one of the evil kings henchmen(aka Darth Vader) kills Brom. He goes for a final battle at the end. Sound all too familiar??

All the character and plot elements are plagiarized to a T, including Uncle Owen (no Aunt Beru), Obi-Wan, the Princess, Han Solo, etc. The second half is some LOTR, with elves, orcs, Saruman, etc. Pathetic.The dragon graphics are OK. The main character has an interesting look to him. The script is not very good.

I watched the movie, expecting it to follow it. It didn't. I was sorely disappointed with the movie. Don't buy it.********SPOILER*********It does well with unimportant pieces like how he found the egg, and Brom's story-telling. Those are kind of important, but not key points to the story. Brom and Eragon didn't go to any of the populated towns; they went from Carvahal to the dead town where Eragon found his magic, then they hiked across the forest line to the jail area and Eragon fought the urgals and Brom was mad and then they freed the elf and then they traveled a bit more and they found Murtag and Brom died and they traveled to the mountain and then they were barely accepted then there was the war and that's basically the entire movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF IS THIS??????????","review":"Having read ALL of the Eragon books by now, I love this series, just not the movie. I made the mistake of going to see and later buying the movie on DVD before reading the book. After I did read it, the movie was a sheer disappointment. THEY EVEN LEAVE OUT SOME OF THE CHARACTERS! And they don't even mention the prophecy about the Menoa Tree and the Vault Of Souls. For anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about, THE PROPHECY FORMS HALF THE STORY IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!

They totally butchered the storyline and made all sorts of stupid errors. The list goes on and on and on and on and on so I'm not even going to start being specific. If you ask me, the movie, even if it had been a lot longer, would have been excellent if they had stuck to the book. They must have known that their main audience would be people who have read the book! Why didn't they just stick to the book? NOTHING MAKES SENSE ANYMORE!!!

I would easily give this movie \\"0\\" stars if it was an option. These books are fun and it's inspiring that a teenager could write them. They are enjoyable to read and Mr. Paolini has quite the vision. But the movie just feels like, \\"quick! let's cash in on LOTR and be done with it\\". I know it's not fair to compare books and movies of those books but, come on! They dropped SO much plot and detail and it was all over sooooo fast! I couldn't even believe the ending! This belongs in the same realm as the debacle that was \\"The Beach\\", another horrific adaptation of a great book. And I certainly hope that one of the reviewers who said it was \\"every bit as good as LOTR\\" hasn't seen or read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If they have then, shame on you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray version","review":"Okay I will say straight up that I have never read the books so my view of the movie has not been tainted with the knowledge of how good they were and how the movie followed them or not.I enjoyed the movie, to me it was a cross between LOTR and Narnia. Definitely not on the same budget as those two movies but you get the idea. Lots of CGI used but it was done pretty well I thought.The video transfer is top notch and the audio transfer is also pretty darn good. I would place it as a Tier 1 Blu-Ray quality movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie...","review":"This was a pretty good movie, however, I expected more when I seen the previews.

It could have been a little longer though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I just saw the last five minutes of Eragon on TV and was instantly reminded of why I shut the DVD off after 5 minutes into the movie. The casting was terrible, the movie script was horrible and the acting was wooden. Christopher Paolini should have waited for a better funded offer before he sold the movie rights. Hopefully this is one movie they'll redo. It's a great book that deserves a much better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is sooo terrible","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much....but this is absolutely god awful. If you have read the books like I have and have high expectations for the movie to be able to mirror the genius of a 17 year old prodigy of an author then you are to be sorely mistaken....The main critical review hits the main points...Arya being an elf yet 15 dollars of silly putty to give her pointed ears was over budget and the acting being completely and utterly embarrassing to the human race...Honestly most of my views were voiced perfectly by most of the one star reviews I was just so utterly appalled at how bad this movie was that I felt I had to try to save the rest of mankind from attempting to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This movie was so disappointing and I was shocked that so much of the story was either changed or just left out. The raz-ak monsters were killed inside Helgrind; not the forest. There was so many facts changed I'm surprised permission was given to make this movie. The books are awesome. A LONG miniseries would be appropriate or at least 4 three hour long movies to include the MANY interesting and beautiful details of the books would have better captured the great story of Eragon. The Urgals in the movie looked like dirty, greasy body builders with crooked teeth. No horns, no monster-like appearance described in the book. Roran just walked off in the movie and he was a huge part of the actual story. Sorry, but do not waste your time with the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge the book based on this horrible movie!","review":"My husband said it all with these words: \\"If we had bought this movie, I'd throw it in the trash right now.\\" We are fans of the book. This movie slaughters it.It's like the writers/producer/director took all of the elements of the book, dropped them in a hat, and randomly pulled them out to make the movie. At the end of the movie, not all of the pieces are there, and they're completely out of order. This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. The worst part is it is left open at the end for a sequel--that would be a travesty.One review suggested that they scrap this movie and start over. That's the only way to do it. Some may say that the book is too complex to translate into a movie, but it can be done--look at Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. I say that if you can't do the book justice, just leave it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie","review":"I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the book","review":"I read and liked the books okay but they weren't edited enough and become boring and the ending of Eragon was disappointing and rather anticlamatic to me. So I wasn't expecting much from the movie and was pleasantly surprised. It is rather short and I do see why people complain about the changes, but had I not read the book I would have liked the movie even more. It is full of action and was entertaining and the ending was much more exciting than the book. If you have read the book and loved it don't expect this movie to follow the story faithfully, but if you enjoy sci fi movies forget the book and enjoy the movie for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to an amazing book.","review":"This movie made me very sad, it could have been amazing, but it was horribly distorted. This is not the book that Christopher Paolini wrote.I am aware that the WHOLE book cannot be made into a movie, due to time issues, but they could have done a MUCH better job than this. Everything about it (except for Jeremy Iron's performance, he is AWESOME) was utterly horrid. I hardly think that a second movie would be possible, due to how much they cut out.Also, it does not annoy me that they cut things out as much as it annoys me that they changed things that they did not need to! For instance, Saphira's appearance, Arya's hair color, the color of the jewel in the sword that Brom gave to Eragon, etc.Do not buy this movie, even when I don't compare it to the book it is still pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good movie","review":"I'm not sure why people are giving this movie such negative reviews. Personally, I thought that it was pretty good. It left out a lot of the detail from the book while keeping the main themes/events intact. I felt that it could have been some longer as it felt a little rushed. Also, a little more character development might have helped if they make movies based on future books in the series. I thought that the acting was also very good for the most part, particularly from Edward Speleers, Sienna Guillory, and Jeremy Irons. The dragon was well animated and looked realistic while Rachel Weisz did a great job with the voice. Overall, a very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad could it really be?","review":"I read the book before seeing the movie. All the reviews I've read said how that was a mistake, but The Lord of the Rings movies weren't entirely faithful to the books, but they were still great movies; so, I thought how bad could this movie really be with such good source material.All I can say is that the screenwriter must have just flipped through the novel, stuck their finger down and said \\"Here - let's write about this scene\\".After watching the movie, I listened to the beginning of the Director's Commentary - I got as far as Saphira's growth spurt where he said \\"look at the dragon's expression, even she is surprised at how fast she has grown\\". He could have concluded that sentence with \\"...and doesn't know what is going on.\\", I think that would have captured the spirit of this movie.I feel sorry for Jeremy Irons - once again he gives a stellar performance in a truly crappy movie (re. Dungeons & Dragons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I loved the book. When I saw the movie I felt like crying. The effects for the dragon was the only plus.

I had loved the book and found that the movie completely botched the story. The producers added things that were rediculous and removed characters and scenes that are vital for the book. I know that they were just trying to make it more view friendly (such as adding the love interest between Arya and Eragon) but the book sold well without this and I felt that it drastically diminished Arya's character. Even if I had not read the book, I would still be disappointed with this movie. A lot of questions are not answered and the flow was very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I read the book and thought is was pretty good. I was exited when the movie came out. I watched it on tv and it is absolutely HORRIBLE. Arya does NOT look like an elf at all. Many of the characters are not even in the movie. Saphira looks weird. She has fur... What kind of dragon has fur anyway? Her wings are just weird, they look like bird wings. Its also really strange when she's flying along as a little baby, then all of a sudden, she's huge. In the book she grows over time. If you have read the book don't watch this movie, you will be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was entertaining... not bad!","review":"Although \\"Eragon\\" is palpably derivative of a number of fantasy franchises (\\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Lord Of The Rings,\\" \\"Wizard Of Earthsea,\\" et. al.) it is still quite enjoyable, if a bit on the lightweight side. I have not read the original book, but coming into this blind, the film was about what I'd expected. Obviously it's been streamlined and no doubt dumbed-down a bit, but the special effects are good (the dragon, mostly, looks cool) and the story clops along at a decent pace. Nothing here will surprise you, but it's hardly the dismal filmic disaster other reviews have implied... It's just a goofy, no-brainer Hollywood action film, good if you want something light.And the dragon looks cool.(Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disney Touch Destroyed the Movie.","review":"Somehow the producers made out of a great book just another Disney movie.

I am aware that there is a lot that the movie doesn't cover.So to me, this is a total win-win situation: the movie was wonderful and enjoyable; and it makes me want to read the book to see what the movie left out.I hope people realize that the bad reviews for this movie are primarily coming from people who had already read the book and were disappointed.

The farm boy's uncle is killed. A older mentor shows up (Brom, Ben Kenobi), who teaches the boy about (magic, the force). There's even a princess and a rebel base waiting for a final attack. Continue this with the rest of the plot and you will see that this story mirrors Star Wars. Amazing that this kind of derivative book/movie made it past any respectable publisher/producer.

That said, the portions of the book that were in the movie were fairly good and I enjoyed them - however a 1 1/2 hour movie just does not cover a novel of this length. It would have been very easy to make this into a 2 - 2 1/2 hour movie, I know I would have watched it.

The plot was all wrong, the characters were wrong (Arya having blonde hair), the fighting was cheesy, and it was a complete remake of the book. Why did durza have a shadow dragon in the movie? The fact that Brom kills the Ra'Zac eliminates most of the plot of Eldest! This movie was really bad so read the BOOK but don't watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I've seen this before","review":"I have not read the books, but it may be just me but this seemed like a cheap rip off of Star wars. Only set in some mid evil dragon land. A poor peasant boy finds he has some strange power with the help of his mentor who trains him to use the force I mean dragon riding power, He goes to the death start, I mean evil persons castle to save the princess, The mentor dies blah blah blah, they join the rebel alliance to fight the evil empire in one big last battle and win in the end. Save your money and watch you copy of Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming pile of dragon dung...","review":"After watching this ridiculous, plodding and boring movie, you'll feel a compelling urge to wipe and flush. And I thought Narnia was a second-rate Lord of the Rings, but sadly, it puts Eragon to shame. Aside from the stellar CG work, you have top tier actors like John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons reciting third rate, cornball lines and acting like medieval hams from a Monty Python movie, scenes that rapidly jerk to and fro like a bad Goth music video, and young unknown actors that recite lines mechanically as if they graduated from the George Lucas school of acting. There is no continuity and no emotional build up to scenes, and worse, there is little direction in trying to tell even the least semblance of a semi-cohesive story. Stay far away from this vapid nugget of juvenile Fantasy tripe and check out Dragonheart if you're looking for a decent Fantasy movie about dragons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strays too far from the book..........A real let-down.","review":"I really had high hopes for Eragon back in December. It's one of my favorite books (Very good, read it). But, much to my dismay, Eragon left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean, it wasn't unwatchable-I could sit through it again-but too many things weren't served justice (Ask any book fan, having the dragon grow within a few seconds-as apposed to a chapter or two in the book-was really disappointing). If you must, rent it, but please take my word for it: this movie does not belong in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm easy to please and this didn't","review":"Okay, I pretty much will go along with most movies for one reason or another, whether it be effects, plot line, or great casting. The true jewels of movie making are those that contain all the above.The only reason I even own this movie is because I like the effects. It at least has a discernable plot line even though it's inaccurate in comparison to the book. Much of the acting was poor (especially Galbatorix. Yikes!) and the scenery was not what one would expect from a Middle Earth film. LOTR puts it to shame.This film was clearly low budget, though not as bad as it could have been I suppose. It's worth having around for giggles, but don't pay more than 6 bucks for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing!!!","review":"I have been counting down the days to this movie. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a long time. How sad I was when the movie was over. Not because it ended but because how much they marred it from the book. I really loved the book and I understand that the movie will cut bits from the book to squeeze it all in but what was the reasoning for making it totally different??? It left out so many important issues, people and places. I do not see how they can make a second movie when they totally screwed up the first. I gave it two stars because my kids (who didn't read the book) did enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I just saw this movie.","review":"I'm not going to say much that hasn't already been stated before. This is a good movie...for a child between the ages of 8-13. Even then, my 9 year old brother said it was stupid. This movie is bad. The book was average but the movie is just bad. I will never compare it to LOTR or Star Wars because those are amazing movies. I have heard people here mention the CGs being \\"par\\" with LOTR. Please do not insult LOTR that way. The CGs are on \\"par\\" with the movie's terrible acting. I found the characters completely unbelievable and uninspiring. There is very little plot in this movie, and it is very rushed. Yes, I know this is a 2 hour movie, but come on. There is absolutely no depth to the movie. That's all I can say"},{"rating":"2","title":"We loved this movie","review":"I don't know how anyone could give this a negative review.

I understand that some changes have to be made when a book is made into a movie, but this was way too much. From little details (Arya's hair colour) to the actual ENDING, changes were made. The movie would be good, but i couldn't enjoy it because i loved the book too much.

I strongly believe that whoever made this movie did not take time to develop each character. It reminds me of stories my mother used to tell me when I was little which were badly told because my mother is not a writer, but that is understandable. At least she didn't try to make her stories into lame movies with empty characters and a poor dialog.I got to say that the only good thing was the boy flying on the dragon and the dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"poo","review":"OK i am a huge fan of all the books and have already preordered the last one so when i saw this movie it made me want to throw the tv out the window. this movie isnt even based on the novel.

I love the books but avoided the movie due to bad reviews. However, I hoped that maybe it was just a case of \\"it's not EXACTLY like the books\\" (like people who complain about the Harry Potter series). At first I was going with some of the changes since there is no way they could fit all of the detail into a 2 hour movie. By the end, however, I was mortified. I have never seen a book that badly mangled by a movie. I am surprised that the author allowed it since the movie changed the ending so badly that Eragon's character itself is changed. Dissapointing (although, if you have no intention of ever reading the books, then you may enjoy the movie as is, which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than the 1 it deserves)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie fails to live upto the book","review":"Its so sad that the movie is not even slightly close to the story in the book. I wish Chistopher Paolini had a bigger hand in the say that the character portrayal and the sequence of events in the movie should be very close to the book.

It's hard to believe that this movie got such bad reviews considering the other movies that hollywood puts out.

My son can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie when they announced it after becoming a fan of the novels but it was a terrible let down. The whole movie is a complete mess, it rushes so fast you're just sitting there wondering if they accidentally cut out parts in the editing room. The beginning of the movie was the worst; rush, rush rush! Can't believe they released it like this, no character developement, important parts in the book completely left out of the movie, you don't care about any of the characters.The only thing I enjoyed a tiny bit was the Eragon/Shade battle, I LOVED the Shade character, but like everything else, it just flew right by leaving you wanting so much more.Give me a 3 hour movie, break up book one into two films, either way is fine with me...but please, NEVER rush through a movie like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this enhances the book, how?","review":"I bought the DVD, intending to play it on my laptop. What a mistake.The sound is either DTS, DD, Spanish, or French. No stereo. If you like echoes, they are there.To the director, when you read the book (you did read it, didn't you?}, the information is presented in a logical order, building credability as the story progresses. NOT as you did it: showing a brief history at the beginning of the movie in an effort to fill in the backstory. This just made the move moot.Where is the continuity? Where is the wonder? Are those manniquins really dwarves? I thought elves had pointed ears (like Mr. Spock, you friggin' idiot!). Where is the bonding between Brom and Eragon? Why does Saphira grow to adulthood in a few seconds? How improbable is that? Is this your first film? If so, quit now. As a director you lost the entire story.My advice? Read the books. DON'T buy the DVD. Especially if you don't have a home theater.I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient Script-writing, Breaks Believability.","review":"Believability is everything in science fiction. The magic has no consistent workings by consistent limits. For instance, a person cannot be killed in one scene by certain magic, but can be by the same magic in a later scene. The hero uses Elf language to invoke the help of the trees against an opponent, but facing another opponent in the same forest, is at a loss for what to do. Convenient to write, unbelievable to watch. Making the characters work within limits, makes it believable, but then the writer must work within those limits, the writer now cannot just do anything, and if a power is given in one scene, then it must be available always in later scenes. Technically proficient in special effects. The same convenience is in the dialogue, easy to write, empty to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I have the movie on HD but I wanted it on Blu-ray, it was well worth the extra dollars as there is some excellent special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down!","review":"I am a huge fan of Eragon, it's my #1 favorite book, and I was thrilled when I heard that they were going to make a movie. I was disappointed with it. The animation was great and all, but they messed the story up big time. They skipped out a ton of stuff important to the story! Like Orik and Joed (I think thats how you spell it.)! Also the acting wasn't to great. Except for Jeremy Irons. I would rate this movie as half a star, but unfortunately Amazon won't let you. Somebody needs to totally remake this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"My son loves this movie so I got it for him for Christmas. I was under the impression that it was a 'new' dvd. It has a scratch on it so the movie has a long spot in the middle that is really messed up. My son didn't tell me about it until it was too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Far Short of the Book","review":"As a movie, it's fine and enjoyable. As a movie based on the fantastic book Eragon, it falls far short. This movie had the potential to be epic - in the league of Lord of the Rings - but instead we are handed just another dragon movie. It is the kind of movie you expect to find on TV on a quiet Sunday afternoon. It is very enjoyable as long as you don't expect it to be epic, as it should be based on the book.I was disappointed in all that was left out. One of the impressive things about the book was the development of characters and their relationships, but this is entirely lacking in the film. If you watch this movie, set your hopes for it low. It is an enjoyable dragon movie as long as you expect it to be just another dragon movie, but it does not live up to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon Wanabe","review":"I have read this book and part of Eldest, the sequel, and the only reason I understood the movie was becuase I had read the books. The acting was pretty good and it was actually a good film for children who aren't allowed to whatch gory moveis. The goriest part of the movie was when a carchter inserted his poisened fingernail into sombody's body, and another character's forehead.

Might as well say that right off. However, the film is entertaining on its own, though they had to revise things to fit within the time limits on the screenplay. My 16 year old son was a little disappointed that there were parts of the book left out, or even changed, but it was still a good adaptation.

Well once again, i think it is Sony sucking money out of customers. I was debating on the Blu-ray or the special edition version and made a poor decision as far as assuming the special features were included with the blu-ray. Don't get me wrong. The movie is fantastic (5 star) but the media was a 1 star.

One word: LAME. I've read Anne Bishop, Eddings, David Drake, all the Pern novels, and more books in Sci Fi/Futuristic than I can remember.Eragon reminded me of Star Wars for kindergarten. Pern-gone-to-Thread-and-back-again.The movie was a bust.

I read the books, and they were really good. The movie completely destroyed the story. I expected it to be much better. They left out lots of important parts of the book out. The characters were nothing like they described in the book. The 103 minutes they used were NOT WELL USED. They spent to much time on certain parts of the movie. Definitely read the books first. The special effects were the best part. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the special effects. Saphira and the Shade were definitely the best characters. Eragon and Roran looked too much alike! They also revealed things too early and changed the entire story. They didn't explain many things that were explained in the book, making it confusing for people who haven't read the book. My friend was reading the book, but after watching the movie she didn't want to keep reading because she was afraid the book would be too much like the movie. IT'S NOT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"If one hasn't read the books, this movie is a nice stand-alone. Great scenery and good acting. Had it not been associated with Eragon the book, I would have thought differently about the movie. However, Eragon the movie sadly disappoints when a faithful reader compares it to the way the Harry Potter movies and Lord of the Ring movies clung to the essences and details of their relative book series. Eragon the movie is beautiful but holds practically none of the feeling of the books and, worse, doesn't even really correspond to the story line or the characters and their developing relationships. The details of the movie just don't match up with the books. I can hardly wait to read the final book in the series, but I really regret having wasted my time and expectations on the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"If you read the books, and you thought the movie might be pretty cool, you are wrong. Characters have been poorly casted. Majority of acting is poor, except for a few actors, but their dialogue is very cheesy. The story has been completely and utterly destroyed. Usually some of the story is simply left out of the movies. In this movie, the story has been changed to a completely different story. The special effects are very low budget. This film was so low budget in fact, that an entire race of people were changed so it could be done easier. The Urgals are a ram-like creature with horns and all that. In the movie they are just fat guys with tattoos. If you want to be simultaneously humored and disappointed, then watch this movie. I suggest staying away.

Ed Speelers & Jeremy Irons were fantastic! Also, Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira was perfect! It was a fun tale of a farm boy, learning of a destiny he could never have imagined & grabbing hold of that destiny and embracing it. I do wish they would have kept to how the Raz'Zac & Durza were trying to capture Eragon (as in the book), not kill him, plus had he been captured (as in the book) it would have made it all the more exciting.

I advise all those who haven't read \\"Eragon\\", GET THE BOOK! Don't rely on the movie to amaze you. So much is missing in this movie. I am a huge fan of Jeremy Irons and his acting if fine, but he does not embody the character of Brom. And what's up with Arya?

Believe me, your time and money will be better spent reading the book instead of going to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Many people have already said this but I will say it again, this movie is a cheap remake of a book that deserved the Peter Jackson style of dedication to the story line. Eragon is a great story and has so many opportunities at being a great motion picture trilogy, this just halted the trilogy at one. If you liked this movie don't read the books because they are very different and far better. I really understand when they can't put every detail from the book into the movie but in this translation the story was changed so much that I was lost and did not even know where the story was going to end and I have read the book at least 3 times.

I don't know if it is because I read the books first so I knew what was going to happen or if the movie really wasn't all that great.The movie did have its ups though. i found some parts exiting and the world around them was pretty cool but the coolest part was how they made the dragon and other creatures look so real.If you enjoyed the books I recommend this to you .

This is the kind of movie which works fully only in movie theatre - you need big screen to fully enjoy the effects. DVD is decidedly second best but if you want to spend an afternoon watching a kid movie (with your kids, preferably), it is still a fairly decent choice.The story is slow to develop (approximately as slow as the hatching of a dragon egg) but once it starts you will get a share of spilled blood, monsters and trolls (which seem very closely related to those you know from Lord movies...) fighting against the very small and select band of the good.Camera loves Ed Speelers so if you have a soft spot for cute blonds you will have one on the screen basically all the time (I know it's a spoiler but he does take his shirt off!) even though he should learn some more about acting before embarking upon another leading role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another ruined book-to-movie!","review":"Where to begin?

Man, there are TONS of AWESOME dragons styles around (especially Dragonlance D&D; world), but what they do: a monkey with chicken wings (no scales, only fur).Them we have master yoda/obi-wan Brom and luke skywalker Eragon.... \\"you not ready, you may not use the force\\"... ops... magic. Also uncle owen death.Dont forget the Legolas in the bad specter fortress...Beside... where are the elves, the dwarf or better, WHERE IS THE VALDAN (if it so written) Fortress??Waste of money, and i hope it wont turn down the hype of the upcomming dragonlance movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutting floor debris from Lord of the Rings","review":"How could Jeremy Irons sink to this level? How could John Malkovich perform in this piece of dreck? In fact Malkovich overacts to the point you begin to wonder if he wasn't trying to turn this into a comedy. The lead character -- Eragon -- is a simpleton played by an actor whose only claim to fame must be his relationship with the director because it certainly isn't his acting. He merely poses and looks handsome throughout the film. Jeremy Irons does try to act but then to act you must have a script, which is sorely lacking here. Like most current films the personal hygiene is subpar and seems to be used as a gauge for evil. There are hordes of bad guys all of whom are suitably ugly and look like what's left over from Middle Earth. There was a Dragon in this film which seemed to be the only point of making the film. This is a film that should come with a warning label for bad acting and writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over The Top...And Still Sub-Par.","review":"I was completely unprepared for just how bad this movie was. I believe it is the first time a movie has made me want to NOT read the book. If the dialogue was taken ver batim from the book then woe betide the poor reader who has to wallow through such grisly tripe.As for the story line....think of every fantasy you've ever read....now put it in a blender and hit puree. The story is a cliche even of itself.Let's cover the acting...ok on second thought let's not...except to say that Malchovich hit the melodramatic \\"high C\\".Finally my children both fell asleep watching this movie, and they were the one's responsible for putting it in the DVD player to begin with. I shan't forgive them anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark!","review":"Eragon is a great book, and apparently just that. I had eagerly been awaiting the relase of the film and was sorely disapointed in it. There is way too much information in the book to shove into a 2 hour movie and too many key aspects of the book are missing. What should have evolved over months appeared to have taken maybe a week. Key elements in the history and growth of the characters were entirely omitted and the lack of character development left me feeling very little for these characters. In the end I walked out with thoughts that mostly consisted of \\"who was he and what just heppened?\\".Its too bad because the book is great and had a lot of promise to be a really great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars for this movie; Four Stars for the Dragon Animation","review":"I'll give the CGI team Four Stars for the Dragon Effects, especially the flight scenes through the river valley and the final aerial battle at the end, but the movie and story are the worst. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are seminal stories which succeed as tales because they stand as archetypes; so both stories are nothing new (Star Wars and LOTR), just retold Jungian/Campbell tales done in a superb, fresh manner. Thus you might argue what's the difference if Eragon does the same thing? Star Wars and LOTR are STILL AROUND! With parallels in Eragon SO CLOSE to these two stories and films, I really can't believe there's no intellectual copyright infringement lawsuit pending...bottom line: the movie is boring: I literally pressed fastforward from 56 minutes to the end and the aerial battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"This movie had the possiblity of being another Lord of the Rings and then threw it away. This bares little resemblance to the book. There is NO character development..you really do not care what happens to these people, the director and writers of the script left out everything that made these characters important and endearing. The only one they manage to leave alone is the dragon. There are no elves, what did they do to the Urgals? And who cares about the Varden? The only interesting character beside the dragon is the shade..and what happened to him? His makeup suddenly changed and you are left wondering if this is the same bad guy? This movie butchers what was a fantastic book and makes it into a mockery. Lets just pray they do not go ahead with the sequels. So please read the book and ignore the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon The Movie (NOT THE BOOK)","review":"There are so many movies that have been made from book, sorry to say that this isn't one of them.

Sometimes. Other times they looked like PS1 graphics.The costumes and set design were so cheesy and the acting was pretty bad. Especially the villains who ham it up every step of the way. And the actors were all wrong for their roles. None of them looked the part. Especially the lead who looked like he should be standing outside an Abercrombie and Fitch store in the mall.And a lot of scenes seemed very...umm...Brokeback Dragon to me.

The reader does a terrific job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"The book Eragon is one of my favorites, and I was expecting a very good movie. I was dissapointed when I saw it, though. In comparison to the book, the characters were badly done, and the plot was way off. If you haven't read the book, this may very well be a good movie. But if you have read it, I strongly suggest skipping it.... you will not be very happy if you do see it. The plot was so far off, I'm not sure they will be able to get a second movie out because there will be no way to continue along with Eldest with everything they changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with everyone else","review":"Take it from someone who read the book and enjoyed it very much, this movie stinks. I didn't want to believe it either, so I bought it. This story is so far from the original, it made me almost hate it. The cast is fine, but the story is the complete opposite.

And yeah, kids and poeple who have absolutely no concept of what a solid and seamless story is will like this film. In my opinion, this movie was a joke, absolutely horrible. The script and story are just terrible. I wanted to pull my hair out as I was watching. This concept had so much potential. It could have been amazing had the screenplay been written well. The director doesn't have a clue either. There is no way he has directed any films before this one.

I have to admit that they did Saphira well, they could've have done a tad better but that's hollywood.This is just a warning for all those fans of the book that got severely dissapointed or who didn't see it. If you're a fan of the book then you're wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoony film, bad acting","review":"I have never read Eragon, but I was attracted by the advert with the beautiful dragons and epic scenary. I was really, really, disappointed to find myself sitting through another re-hash of Star Wars- but with dragons. I might even have been able to take the storyline, if the lines were good. But all the lines were so bland, so utterly immature I found myself yawning within the first 15 minutes. I've seen more mature dialog in a saturday morning cartoon.The costuming was pretty good, particularly the dragon-rider regalia. I also liked the dragon when she was a baby! So cute!But overall, this was a limp insipid film, dumbed down for the kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is the same.

Since when do elves not have pointy ears and when did dwarves get so tall? In no way does the movie follow the book. You will be wondering if the director read the book. The worst part is the beginning 200 pages smashed into 10 minutes. If the book didnt have an action scene in a chapter it was skipped. The worst part about the making of this movie is that its so terrible people who see it and havent read the book will think that the book must be just as bad. A weak adaptation of a brilliant young minds work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... could have been SO much better","review":"This flick could have been SO much better. It almost seemed like the producers were rushing into production.

If you are a fan of the book you will hate the movie.They left so much important information and changed so much else. Rohan is not leaving just to leave. Sphira did not name herself. Where was the dwarf that meat Eragon at the door of the Varden and road off with him and so much else.Although I read the book my husband was completely lost and asked a ton of questions.This was like watching Lord of the rings and not telling you about Bilbo's impute or the back ground on the ring you would of been lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"To quote Eragon: \\"I expected more\\"","review":"Great actors, great marketing, great special effects. This film is not so bad, but it pretends to be so much more than it is. When we got to the talking dragon I understood why.We're spoiled with good children's movies which are fun for the grown ups as well, but this movie is a kid's movie for kids. Would have loved it when i was 12. But then I even loved the \\"Narnia\\" TV-series. Actually, the Narnia movie (2005) was kind of like this one, in my opinion. I didn't like that film either.Fantasy freaks might enjoy it as well.

If you have read the book it stinks. They cut out so much from the book.They did a horrible job at developing the characters. The author writes very detailed descriptions of the characters. Could the directors at least try to stick to it?! In a hope to keep it a PG movie they cut out all the action also.Instead it looks like they threw everything together just to make a quick buck leaving out the heart of the story.I would easily watch a 2-3 hour movie! Instead you end up with a cheesy movie, bad lines, and nothing to make it original. If they make a second they'll be hard-pressed to make it work since they cut out everything essential for the next.BOTTOM LINE:DON'T GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series of books but a horrible adaptation to film","review":"Great series of books but a horrible adaptation to film.

The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garret Hedlund (the guy who plays Mertock). He did a good job despite all the annoying preachy dialogue, and being a tool of the special effects department. Otherwise the movie just drags on forever in your typical good and evil magical conflict. He's wonderful eye candy no matter where he is to me, but that was this one saving grace in my eyes. Otherwise it could have been much more than it was, moving quicker and trimming the fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I felt so very sad when i saw this movie. I loved the books, and the movie ruined the whole spirit of the book, the spesial relationship between Eragon and Saphira, and that was totaly wrong in the movie.

He was way to lucky, i keept hoping he would die, so he at least had to suffer the consiquenses of his actoins, but noo, he keept living and learnd nothing.

I thought this movie was very enjoyable and well done. The animation of the dragon was flawless, and you could really see the attention to detail the creators had with Saphira. Just look at her breathe fire or see the water bounce off her as she enters the cave through the waterfall. Seamless effects and a good storyline that draws you right in. The psychic connection Saphira had with Eragon was a nice touch, and that if a dragon rider dies, his/her dragon dies too, which makes it even more important for the dragon to protect the rider. Often movies adapted from books disappoint the readers, and this may be no different, but I did not read Eragon (which is rather long), I just enjoyed the movie. It is rated PG and is appropriate for older kids and beyond. I bought it, and have no complaints. If you like dragons and fantasy, give this movie a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This was a good movie, and I just don't understand the rest of the reviewers... I just hate to compare one movie with another with similar plot...

Apparently John decided it would be a good idea to sing this song with the \\"cher vocal effects thingie\\"... my god, is it not enough that this makes most people want to kill when they hear it?I've been a die-hard TMBG fan for years, and thought it was the end with the Mink Car album, but this is far superior is it's lack of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new TMBG *EP*","review":"I'd rate the music on this CD about 4 stars but they lose 2 stars for putting out what appears to be a normal full-length CD that clocks in at a mere 36 minutes.

The episodes feature many new characters such as Peekablue (my favorite), Flutterina, Netossa, Spinnerella, Sweet Bee, and a very brief appearance by the Star sisters. The Horde's new addition is Entrapta, seen in several episodes. There are a few guest appearances by He-Han, Orko, & Man-At-Arms.The special features include another short documentary on some of the artists' & directors' favorite episodes. There are profiles on each of the new characters seen in the episodes, an image gallery of promotional pictures for The Secret Of The Sword, and a gallery of Horde character drawings.The two new art cards are extremely well done, though I'm disappointed that some of my favorite characters have been left out of the series.I'm so glad to finally have the entire series.

I would not buy this product again because of how much it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a Different Brand","review":"I was really excited to get my Halex Lasso Golf set. I had played it at a company party and had a lot of fun. Unfortunately, this item by Halex is of VERY POOR QUALITY. The plastic fittings hardly fit together without some muscle, and once put together the threads on the T connectors were shot. I cracked two tee connectors just trying to fit the poles into the slots. I also scratched my hand when the top pole slipped out of the connector while working on assembling the other side.You certainly wouldn't take these stands apart to put the pieces in the bag that accompanies the set. First, it would never go back together. Second, the party would be over by the time you were done.I would try Sportcraft or another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This is a fun game but the Halex is junk it did not make it through one day of play. I returned it for a refund and made my own out of PVC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Set, but doesn't hold up","review":"This is a great game, and a ton of fun to play, but the durability on this is very very poor. The first day you'll play it the balls were fall of the string, but this is easily fixed by just tying a larger knot. The problem is that over time the plastic balls actually rip where the strings attach, making them useless.I definitely plan on buying another set because I really enjoy it, but will look for another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Beach Game!","review":"This is the ultimate beach game. The set up is easy and quick. Our 6 year old likes to set it up by himself when we go to the beach. The game is simple and fun for adults and kids. We hot glued the rope knot for the balls and have not had a problem with them. We also like the fact that it breaks down quickly and fits in its own carrying bag. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game, just buy a different brand.","review":"Our whole family loved this game, it's a lot of fun for all ages. Unfortunately the tubes fall apart so easily, that you have to constantly put them back together during play. So we glued them together, then they started breaking. In general the tubes were to weak and would not stay together. I highly recommend buying Lasso Golf, just NOT this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality of product.....","review":"This product has been more a problem, than enjoyment. The product is made of cheap plastic materials, and as the balls hit it, the plastic breaks. Haven't had the product long, and have asked for new poles for it.....As you throw the balls, they are suppose to wrapped around the pole(s), well, they do, but the balls smash the poles. One pole, as I write this, is held together with duct tape.Very poor quality. Sending us new poles of the same quality doesn't help the situation.Very disappointed in product....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed with the quality","review":"The game is a ton of fun. That is not the issue here. The quality of this version of the game is terrible. Buy a better version or make it yourself. It begins to not be fun when you have to reattach the posts every other time someone throws it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this in the hopes of not having to make my own out of PVC. That was a huge mistake. The quality of the set is very poor. One of the horizontal poles was smaller on one end and did not stay in the corner piece. I contacted Halex for a replacement, which they sent, but the new part was even smaller than the one I had.I was able to use an o-ring to get the original pole in place but even then, when using the set, it tended to come apart during use.I ended up building my own out of 1\\" PVC from designs I found on the web and it works much better. It was simple to make, much sturdier and the bollos actually have more \\"action\\" on the sturdier design. By action I mean things like spinning around on the lowest pole several times and then hopping up to the middle pole. Much more fun.Use your money to make your own. All it takes is a tape measure, a rubber mallet or hammer, and a hack saw (a Workmate is nice for holding the pipe while sawing but not required.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halex Lasso Golf Review","review":"My father was trying to find this item and they were all sold out; so I found it and bought it for him for Father's Day.

I saw this set for sale hear and ordered it. Upon assembling at next cookout some of the poles had some trouble properly fitting into joints. Once assembled it seemed fine. Once we started playing thats when things went south. The upper arms kept falling down when it was lassoed. We spent more time putting this back together than actually playing.

Panda is soft, and there is no hollow center. Is it better this way?For the health of your teeth, yeah. Panda won't pull out your fillings, because it is a softer texture. In terms of flavour?

You get no idea what the society or the life was like from it unless you are interested in sports or popular culture. I wanted a BOOK with summaries of important news events, trends in politics, economy, science, the arts, demographics, etc. It is nothing at all like that.

Not to mention hearing Tobey Magwire narrating throughout the game gets me irritated. Like I said, this is one of the best comic based video games for one of the best superheroes, but I leave my praise as THE best to Wolverine and X2 Wolverines revenge. That being the best game for a comic superhero for more advanced video game players to appreciate. I expect the younger and less mature crowd to appreciate Spiderman and child oriented spidey games, leave Wolverine for the older players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic super-hero game.","review":"No other video game I've played conveys the sense of playing the character in question than this game. You get to swing wildly from rooftops, jump off of people's heads, throw full-sized vans, the works. If Spider-Man can do it in the comic, you can do it in this game. My only complaint would be that the game is rather short, but the amount of depth in each level and the amazing variety of moves Spidey can do will probably have you coming back for a while to explore the nuances of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome game","review":"ive been waiting for this game ever since i saw the movie. it was almost nothing like the movie, except for maybe 6 or seven missions. the graphics are great, the controls are easy, and its just plain fun! it is a little easy. i beat it in 2 weeks. but sometimes u just dont feel like playing it. and the shocker wasnt that strong in the comics... it is a very good game and i highly recomend it, but it has a few flaws"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Paced Exiting Game","review":"Spider Man is one of the best Xbox, PS2, and Gamecube games I've ever played!

The continual storyline and constant action of the game keep you playing. But I was disappointed when I completed the game a day after I rented it.

It's a fun game and I do recommend buying it despite it's length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, no frustration","review":"Spiderman good.It's fun and its pretty easy so you don't get frustrated.Spiderman's voice by Tobey Maguire is great. The inside jokes are pretty funny. The game is a little messed up though. They kinda mixed up the environments and the time so its not exactly like the movie. But all this just makes the game better and also gives the game a happy ending. Sort of. The controls are really easy to learn and the combos are so kool. Web the badguys up and jump onto their shoulders are ride on them while you pound their head or just to finish them, perform a reverse snap suplex.

The way they have Spider-Man move in this game is just so......great. I was speechless when I played this game for the first time. The combos are great and my favorite levels are the ones where you are swinging out in the wide open in the city. The costume design was on point, the FMV's are great, especially the opening one, that's the best one. A lot of reviews mention how the camera angle is not so good, if you've played the other two Spider-Man Games then you should expect the same kind of camera movement. You'll get use to it and you'll master moving Spidey in one direction with having to wait for the camera angle to change. My favorite webswing feature in this game is the Webswing kick, that's hot. Oh and when fighting the Goblin you can land on his glider with him and beat the snot out of the side of his head. All in all this game is a must-have, Spider-Man rulz all. Get it while it's hot!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but camera & controls ruin the game","review":"I liked the game for the most part but I got so irritated with the controls and the camera angles in the game that i just eventually gave up on it. I was getting into it but I would just get to frustrated. Ex: If you are pushing right to run with a side view and the view changes to behind, you would expect to rotate the control to forward to keep going straight (like in Mario 64) but doing that will cause you to run right until you let go and push forward again. This is majorilly irritating when being ganged up on by multiple people. The camera angle will almost never stay constant even when locked on and you just lose control of everything. I also wish you could be more sneeky and spider-like attacking villians. Once you hit someone, everyone in the area will come running. Also, give the villians a few more things to say or make them talk less. I REALLY wanted to like the game but had to many bugs. The Movie was great but the game needed a little more work"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is alright","review":"This game is cool for awhile if you like to swing around the city and save people but the graphics are a little crappy and you do the same bull over and over again like save people and hear people scream spiderman help me over and over again.

When fighting the Green Goblin I found myself constantly fiddling with the shoulder buttons and analog sticks in order to get a decent camera angle. Also, there were not enough bad guys to populate the large environments. Its not much fun when a building or train station contains only two or three guys to fight. If you're a big spidey fan, consider renting it. Don't buy it. You'd be better off spending 20$ on a PSone Spidey game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things aren't real and some are","review":"The game is cool and Spiderman's flexibility is awsome. Gameplay is good but the story is kinda short. You can also see the city below you. The thing that really ticks me of about this game isthe web sling to the sky, I don't know why it's so hard for Activision to atcually ake Spidey to sling on the buildings. I think it would make the game more speedy in gameplay. And another thing that [irritates me] is the fact that you can see the city below you and when you try to go down there you die. But the has great graphics and a great tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's cool...","review":"I like this game a lot because the moves and graphics are awesome...but It is a little hard to get past about the fourth level :D but maybe that's just because of how bad I am at video games.

It's a lot of fun.. but I guess I do get bored from time to time considering how I can't get past a certain level.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and frustrating from the start","review":"Spiderman is sooo whimpy in this game. I wonder if the people who made this game know that in the comics Spiderman can bench press TEN TONS!!! You have to beat on a simple crook several times to get him to go down. That is so unlike Spiderman that it's absurd. What's worse, the bad guys often come at you in large groups, making them almost impossible to defeat.Each level gets progressivly more difficult, and more frustrating. I finally reached one level that had tons of traps and robots...I can't get any farther. That was the first day I had the game.

Over all its a great game and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"be the hero","review":"First of all for those who want to buy the game , make sure you have a good video card. Chaeck the activision website to make sure yours is compatable. The game wouldnt play on my 3.0ghz gaming computer because of the built in video card even though it was 128mb, However to my surprise it played on my older computer, a 1.4 ghz but with a radeon 64mb card.The graphics are pretty smooth but I used lower details because of the machine speed. There are elements of the movie here and some new stuff to keep you interested incase you dont want to play exactly the movie role.The controls are easy to learn after a few blunders and the fun factor is quite high.As for the in game playing, The Older spiderman game has a slightly more virtual city effect to it than this one.

The appealing LisaRaye stars as a struggling college student who abandons her part-time shoe salesman job to begin a life of a stripper. Along the way, she befriends another stripper and gets into all sorts of drama. The film's script is clumsy and never rises above the predictable and stereotypical. There's also a very unpleasant rape scene that's unnecessary as it is vile. Cube, I'm sure, wanted to \\"keep it real\\" by making this film as raw as possible, but in doing so, he forgot to \\"keep it right\\" by making a decent and believable film. \\"The Player's Club\\" isn't the worst film I've seen, but unlike \\"Showgirls,\\" it isn't bad enough to qualify as camp. It's just simply bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, Ice Cube","review":"Ice Cube really stayed within the storyline. I think his view on the strip game and overall money making was straight.

I do not jest! This is simply ignorant of the nuance and complexity of this disorder. While there are certainly certain kinds of thinking problems, what is interesting about aspergers is their specificity and their nature.

I bought a number of books on this topic, and the Asperger's Answer Book was the one I read first. Big mistake. The author has such a negative tone throughout the book. Most chapters conclude with all the difficulties the child/adult will experience, why he will never fit in, etc. There is not even a glimmer of hope until the last paragraph, which is a half-hearted attempt at best. I recommend the book \\"Quirky Kids\\" by pediatricians Perri Klass and Eileen Costello. This is the book I read second, and while it contains similar factual information, is written in a way that every parent can relate to and benefit from. Clearly these physicians did their research and can write effectively. As for the Asperger's Answer Book, don't waste your money.

These are highlighted especially in their speakers. Their principle of direct-reflection, while novel in 1969 is now incredibally antiquated and is far surpassed by high and mid-end manufacturers whose products outperform Bose.

What you won't find in Stereophile, AA etc are articles on Bose, ads from Bose etc. They just aren't taken seriously in the audio industry except as a huge vendor of mediocre quality gear.

They sounded good to me, and quieted ambient noise when on my ears, even with no sound playing.But the headpiece connecting the two headphones has cracked in FOUR different places (and flown apart in three) in about four months. One crack appeared smack in the middle of the left headband, nowhere near a stress point--the rest of the breaks happened at the tops and bottoms of the headband.

I guarantee you that the display model will be broken.The people that give these headphones a high rating, 4 or 5 out of 5, simply have not owned these headphones long enough or used them enough to see a problem. If you own these headphones for a few weeks they will break just like mine, and believe me, you will want a refund.Just as a last point of advise; If you do buy these headphones, buy them from a physical chain store, not an online store.

I merely placed them on my head and snap. The plastic used snapped. I agree with many of the reviewer. The sound quality is great, but what good does sound quality do if the phones break with no fault but putting them on and off. I take care of my phones, I don't drop them. Bose needs to make this wrong right and reconstruct the head bridge on these phones. These phones should be taken off the market until Bose corrects this problem. Just count the review on this site alow and 1/3 complain of cheap construction because the headset breaks. It just a matter of time for the others usally a little over a year and the phones self destruct. Just long enough for the warranty to end.

I ended up being quite happy with the sound quality and have had no major issues until today.Now, as I wait on hold for the Bose service department to answer my call, I write this review. Too bad, the left headset snapped off while I pulled the unit onto my ears...I didn't drop them or pull very hard... it just snapped the sheer pin clean off.

I did and the second pair did the same thing. A little scotch tape and they worked fine for over a year. Now I just snapped off the left ear piece.

For the price I paid for them, I expected them to feel sturdier. The double cord is very annoying.

You can get much better headphones in the same price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"They seemed nice...until they broke...twice...","review":"When I first recieved these headphones as a gift, I thought they were wonderful. The sound quality was incredible, and they were very lightweight and comfortable. After five months, the headband above one of the ears snapped. When I still tried to wear it, it would occasionally pop out and hurt my ear. I've read other reviews of others who had the same problem. I sent mine back through customer service, and got a free replacement (it was still under warranty), however I was very disappointed. For $150, most people expect quality headphones that will last longer than five months. Two months after I recieved my replacement, they broke AGAIN! I finally asked for a refund, and I'm awaiting their response. Sure, there are plenty of good reviews here, but why risk having the headphones break, and waste $150? Trust me, these aren't worth $150, or anywhere near that insane value."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST HEADPHONES EVER","review":"I finally had enough buy these headphones and when I did it was one of the best buys ever. There a HUGE switch from the cheep 20 dollar headphones that many people are accustomed to. First of all, they are VERY comfortable, they padding feels so good, the most important this is the SOUND. Even though it recomends that you do not turn on the bass boost on your cd player or iPod, I do anyway and it still sounds great, there is no distortion. I don't know what all the complaints about the head band are about, because it's made out of medal, so it's not easy to break and I've never had a problem with it and I take it everywhere I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-destructing headpiece","review":"Add me to the list of people who broke the flimsy, fragile headpiece. Bose should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is Fantastic / Build Quality is Bad","review":"I bought these headphones long before most knew about them. The quality of the sound from the headphones is just amazing. The clarity and depth of the sound from these headphones makes me want to keep the headphones on all day.The biggest and perhaps the only problem with these headphones is plastic that holds the headband together. There is a huge design flaw that causes these things to eventually break due to excessive fatigue on a certain region. I've gone down to the Bose store and have had a goodwill replacement on-site. I thought it could be the way I was handling the headphones, so I stopped taking them out with me. A month later, they broke again at the exact same spot. I called Bose about it. Over the phone, the Bose representative tells me that the design flaw has been fixed. She sends a replacement, which I just got today. It looks EXACTLY the same as my previous two sets. I would suggest waiting until this is redesigned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Fragile","review":"I bought these headphones after hearing them at a Bose store in a shopping mall. I hadn't had anything much to compare them to except earphones that come with portable players and they sound much better than that. However, you can get the same or better sound from headphones that cost far less. I recently bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 headphones to take to the gym... They are also more comfortable. The Bose Triports have a flimsy plastic headband which has broken three times in nine months. Bose cheerfully replaced them each time but I now must use the headphones gingerly and after hearing the Sennheiser PX 100 I prefer to use the Sennheiser. The Bose sound nice but you can get better value for your money elsewhere. Bose did, however, introduce me to better sounding headphones. I just wish I had done some comparison shopping before I plopped down my money for the Bose headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rate as -10: Handle with EXTREME care.","review":"I am very careful with all my belongings and have had my headphones at the office, have never dropped them and only put them on at the most 10 times, and they broke in 3 places (impossible to tape back together because the left earpiece fell off!). I'd rate these as a -10 for quality and construction. The sound, however, I would rate as a +5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Triport are Junk","review":"My experience is POOR! I purchased the product for quality sound and I do love the sound, however the Engineers at Bose Corp. should be fired! I loved the sound of my first pair so much that I purchased my second set of head phones - shortly after this my nightmare began. In a year and a half, I have had to send both pairs of Triport headphones back to Bose Corp. and not just once but twice! This product is JUNK, but it does sound good. I urge anyone who has purchased a pair, to send them back if they can because eventually they will break. I also urge anyone who has a pair that is broken to send them back. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for the serious German collector.","review":"An absolutely essential book for collector of Third Reich militaria, and the fakes that abound from the internet auction houses.

Third Reich Militaria is a very vast field. A detailed handbook would probably be more like the Oxford English Dictionary than a 'handbook.' Still, much of the information about values seems somewhat outdated based on my research. I guess overall it's not a bad book, just FAR too small to be very useful to a collecter. You will definately need other material to supplement this book, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddball and Fun","review":"Though this quirky animation might not appeal to all viewers, I found it hilarious and refreshing with its oddball humor and crazy cast of characters. Focusing on Bob, burger shop owner, and his family, this is a show that I hope will last, if not just so I can have a few laughs on my Sundays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Fun on FOX","review":"FOX committed an ultra-crime with the horrible Allan Gregory, an ultra-unfunny comedy about horribly despicable characters that were impossible to tolerate, much less love. Bob's Burgers is the utter flipside of Allan Gregory -- Bob Belcher, his whacky and wonderful family, and the fantastically unique growing cast of quality co-characters (Mort and Teddy, Ollie and Andy, and so many more) are so lovable and complex and riveting that FOX has hit upon their best formula for irreverent-without-being-dirty comedy longevity since the Simpsons themselves.Due to Bob's Burgers being the talk of the town amongst dedicated Simpsons fans who would love to see tales of the Belchers last as long as America's #1 family, it's almost assured FOX will cancel the show any day now; but not to worry, fans, Comedy Central is surely already planning a timeslot for it right after Futurama!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only for the commentary and bonus features - BUY IT!","review":"I love, love, love Bob's Burgers - especially the short season 2. This DVD set is great - it has the pilot and history of the show's development. That was insightful and entertaining. The only bummer which is a risk with any standard DVD is that there is some artifacting on the shows when watching on an HD TV. This is to be expected, but after watching the shows in HD on Netflix and Hulu, it was jarring to say the least, but not unwatchable. The commentary and bonus features make this a must have for any fan of the show, but if it is available on BluRay, it would be worth the difference. Even though it sounds snobbish, seeing the lines as crisp as the artists intended is a treat and joy to watch! Support the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show on FOX","review":"This is my favorite show on FOX. I don't care about the live-action ones or much care about the other animated ones. When I first watched a trailer for this show, I didn't think it was going to suck or be good but I was kind of looking forward to it. The show got mixed reviews from critics but is currently airing it's second season (Sundays at 8:30/7:30pm). It's a great show and I highly recommend it, even if you think it looks ugly (Hey South Park is VERY ugly but it still has a strong fanbase). It's kind of like Family Guy and The Simpsons together, it has it's vulgarity (like Family Guy) but doesn't go overboard with it (like The Simpsons). It's a TV-14-DLSV show still though. The best episodes this season are probably \\"Bed & Breakfast\\", \\"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\\", \\"Spaghetti Western and Meatballs\\" and \\"Burger Wars\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"this is just another bad show to fill up a spot on fox i mean the story line is horrible and the character are just bad.

Jon Benjamin can do Better...","review":"...oh wait, it's called Archer! Seriously though, I only watched this thinking \\"yay! a new prime time cartoon to try out besides the Simpsons and Family Guy.\\" Welp, it sucked. Every episode I tried watching just sucked and was very dry on the humor. Besides the main attraction here, voices are really bad, especially the wife's. Animation is equally terrible too with it looking just plain ugly. I mean there was nothing creative or quirky here to keep my interest till I change the channel every time it came on. After you watch Archer where H. Jon Benjamin truly shines as great and humorous voice actor, Bob's Burgers becomes a very stale left over McDonald's burger left on the warmer all day.I would rather watch the live action Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode over Bob's Burgers any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarity and Value","review":"The excellent dvd quality with extras is amazing.

This machine is over 10 years old and still cleans better than most other vacuums, including my highly rated Bissell model which recently broke. But, the primary reason I bought a Kirby was that I was sick and tired of replacing my vacuum cleaner every 2-4 years due to wear and tear. There is no other vacuum cleaner which lasts a lifetime. 99% of those produced these days (like many consumer products) are made primarily of plastic components. Kirby is the only brand, that I know of, which has consistent after-market of 10, 20, and even 30 year-old machines because it is made of metal and designed specifically to endure. It is definitely worth the $1000+ pricetag for a new one, but I avoid this expense by simply buying an older version which cleans as good as a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Machine on the planet!","review":"This is the best machine I have ever owned.

Katt Duff sheds a beautiful, gentle and insightful light on this question in her beautifully written account of the nature of illness. It is more than this though, it is a spellbindingly familliar (to those of us who are ill) account of the EXPERIENCE of being ill. In short I wept for myself when I read this book but was also profoundly relieved to, at last, make sense of an experience for which we are so little prepared, is profoundly affecting, and yet which is likely to come to us all one day - namely - being ill. A beautiful book.

The lenses are photochromic which is something I'm not used to but honestly I never notice or think about it. Living near the coast we get our share of haze and fog and these brighten up the mid-tones nicely and work admirably in full sun. I still have the Revos they replaced and although I like color and detail of the Revo H20 lens a bit more, these aren't really much different. The spring hinges make for a comfortable fit and they have a decent wrap angle with really no light leeks on my giant bucket of a head."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for something culturally innovative","review":"I agree that this book appeared targeted at a specific group of people.

I was hoping for a book with insights into how to get to this \\"T\\" zone in some manner other that \\"ten visits\\" to a healer. Mesher's books claims to be \\"a book about inner growth\\", but it is a book about his observations and insights based on his work with \\"clients\\". Unfortunately you can't get to this \\"T Zone\\" without the 'healing' touch, and touch, and touch, and touch...This may bring luck to those people who work with him.

The book's title \\"Side by Side\\" describes exactly what you can expect to find inside this book - a comparison of the three programs. I can't see where having this book would be useful since it really doesn't describe techniques or provide useful information, or do anything more than cite differences between the programs, which any user would already be aware of anyways.

The section on wild mushrooms alone demonstrates the refinement of Basque cuisine. The recipes are excellent (although they can be quite difficult), but I was most impressed by the author's prose apart from the recipes. This is one of the few cookbooks I've read that qualifies as good literature, and it deserves to be reviewed and appreciated as such. Moments of lyrical excellence shine through even in translation, and Sevilla should be commmended for crafting such a unique work.

The buttons are WAY to far apart the triggers feel unatural to hold and are hard to hit and worst of all is the HORRIFIC placement of the cord! It also has various other problems including a hyper sensitive and very fragile analog stick and the utter lack of buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junker","review":"What was Sega thinking when they designed this awkward, cheap and not very thought out Junker. I found myself trying to hold the controller in different positions to make it comfortable,did not work. The Dreamcast is the most high-tech gaming system I ever played, too bad it comes with this awful controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good controler","review":"The Dreamcast controler is cool, on most games, but not on games like Soul Calibur,Marvel v.s Capcom, and most of all the other fighting games.For these games I would recomend the Dreamcast's Arcade Stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only comfortable for a short while","review":"This controller is well-made and solid. But...the textured thumbpad on the analog controller will make your finger sore after a few minutes of play. If you have owned a N64, its thumbpad produces the same effect. This controller needs a soft, rubber thumbpad like the PS2 analog controllers have."},{"rating":"1","title":"What!","review":"This controller is the worst I have encountered on any system, ever. The wide design makes it close to impossible to reach the start button, and the cheap, fruity colored buttons get stuck ferquently. When I was playing Crazy Taxi, my fingers and wrists hurt so much I though I had carpal tunnel syndrome or something. I am giving this 2 stars because of the innovation of the VMU, but I hated this controller so much I went out and bought a dremstation, which converts the DC so that you can use PS controllers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sega Dreamcast Controller","review":"I'm so happy these are still available brand new, in the box and at a great price!

I thought it was a pretty unique controller in its own form. Kind of big, yes it is but it still has a great feel to it. Like the VMU slot to, the opening in the middle so you can see the screen. Great controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"Dreamcast controller looks ugly.

And I have to say that the controller is the worst. First of all i'ts horrible for racing games when a tight turn, you have to look at the controller to see where the button is. The same thing for action games etc... In other words don't buy it. And if you own a DC go get the Dream Station port which will let you play your DC with a Playstation Controller.:("},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the controller, but i still have some questions","review":"I love this controller. The buttons are all easy to reach. It only takes a split second to switch from the d-pad to the joystick. The triggers are at just the right spot, easy to use but hard to accidently hit. The start button is just a little hard to reach, but when you push the start button you usually intend to sit the controller down anyways. The problem is the cord comes out of the bottom, not the top. This feels very akward to me. I am aware that there is the little notch to put the cord in, but why put it there when it would have been just as easy to put the cord where the notch is. But, the 2 easy to use slots for a memory card and a jump pack at the same time is great. This controller is light, durable, and easy to use. As for extra controllers, you only need to buy one, if any. I have yet to find a game that is compatible for more that 2 players. But overall, the controller has to be the best yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far","review":"At first it looks a little aqward but once you start playing it feels like a sixth sense. The buttons are perfectly placed for fast gameplay. My only problem with it is if you have been playing with it for an hour it is kind of hard to write or play with another console."},{"rating":"2","title":"The controller is mad nice!","review":"Designed to ergonomic perfection, the Dreamcast Controller nestles comfortably in the hand yet offers blazingly fast response.

I loved the commentary. There are some reviewer for this book that said that the humor was low-brow; but to be honest, their reviews are somewhat coarse and harsh. Some of them are are offended by the fun being poked at the past. This is one of a many books out now that lets us have fun with the past.And, yes, someone will make fun of things we do now 30 years from now. I'll buy those books, too. If you can't laugh at yourself, then you need to reexamine the life you're living and try not to take things too seriously!

I am SO GLAD that I didn't have it shipped directly to her! I do not use foul language, I make an effort to avoid buying merchandise that contains profanity, and I certainly don't give off-color gifts to people.I do appreciate the author's dry wit and sarcastic humor, but I don't think using four-letter words enhances the experience. As soon as I noticed the S-word at the 8th recipe, I knew I'd be seeking a refund for this item. In addition to the multiple occurrences of offensive words, the book contains quite a few references to drug use, being stoned, dropping acid, etc.All in all, thoroughly inappropriate for my purposes. What a shame, really, because the premise, the photos, and most of the commets are otherwise hilarious. But the profanity is a deal-breaker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mackerel Pudding and Frankfurter Crown Roast","review":"Ms. McClure has discovered a teasure trove of revolting recipes all developed to help people lose weight. I thought the photographs were a hoot and her descriptions witty. I too could have done without the foul language in a few of the commentaries. Not necessary at all. I think my biggest disappointment is that there are NO recipes for any of this nasty looking food. Some of the best haha's in old recipes are found in ingredients and preparation. Just pictures of the WW cards and comments was ok but not very satisfying. Even one or two recipes would have assuaged me. Was there a copyright issue with Weight Watcher's? Who knows.

I was really enjoying the book until I started running into f___ and s___ and other language that was even worse! Even more mysterious, the bad language was completely unnecessary and even took away from the humor of the material. I am a loss to understand what was going through the mind of the author when she decided that such foul, shocking language was appropriate in a book that otherwise could have been a great book for kids.

A lot of people complain about the drawer, but I think the drawer is realistic, maybe the problem is the change. The problem with the change is, real money has different weight and feel so we recognize them to the touch, wheras this money is equal weight plastic. I would have put another slot for the 20 dollar bills also. We laminated our money.

My son was so excited to receive this cash register for Christmas, but it didn't make past installation of the batteries. Display says Welcome, and speaker says \\"let's play\\" and that is that. THe drawer was hard to open, then got stuck upon closing. Nothing works, and you can't even shut it off (supposedly shuts off automatically -- but that didn't happen either). One serious piece of cr*p. Never been so disappointed. The price I see this listed for is insane. Don't buy it.

Hopefully we can find something else for my daughter, except she really just wanted this specific cash register."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT LEARNING TOOL","review":"After researching many different learning cash registers, we chose this one for our daughter last Christmas. This is an excellent toy/learning resource. Now that she is in 1st grade, she is actually using it more. When friends come to play, it works great as a scanner cash register..and she likes to \\"weigh\\" the produce. As a mom, I like that the toy turns itself off..battery saving and it has the math games in different levels as well. This is an excellent product and well worth the money. You will get years out of this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Pass On This Item","review":"I returned the first Teaching Cash Register because most of the working parts, the sounds, games, etc. did not work after the first 24 hours.

This \\"Learning Resources Teaching\\" register is awesome! The size and materials are good, and it has great features. The electronic voice can't be turned off, but the volume can be controlled, and the voice is not annoying. I advise purchasers, upon receiving the register, to glue the yellow scale to its stand and pseudo-shellac the paper money by covering both sides with clear packing tape and then trimming off any excess with scissors. It works perfectly to preserve the money. I wasn't sure whether my son would like the built-in scanner (over the hand-held scanners included with some other registers), but he loves sliding household items across the button. The \\"prices\\" that show up for the scanned items are random, but this hasn't turned out to be a problem. Best toy cash register on the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy, but can be picky","review":"My two young daughters really enjoy this register. It has some great features like the credit card and coupon discount card, which are lots of fun for the kids.

So it sort of has to be handled with care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory but defective","review":"I searched for a cash register for my daughter that would facilitate creative play but also teach her about purchasing and paying for items. This one seemed like the best option, so despite all of the negative reviews I took a leap of faith and bought it. The first one arrived completely unusable. Even with batteries nothing worked. I returned it and asked for a replacement. The replacement worked, but was clearly refurbished because three of the keys were upside down- a problem when your toddler is learning number recognition. I was tempted to test my luck and get a third, but my husband talked me out of it. Still haven't gotten a cash register and am so disappointed that this one was of such poor quality. After so many negative reviews, you'd think Learning Resources would address the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of money!","review":"I thought this was an awesome toy, but it only lasted a week!

Sometimes it just goes \\"weird\\" where it won't talk or say the numbers and will just beep when you push any button. But once you get it working right, it's a lot of fun for the kids.

She opened it this morning for Christmas and is very disappointed because it does not work properly. The cash drawer seems to think that it is open all the time and will not perform any of the other functions/games unless you hold it closed. Also, a small metal piece was found inside the cash drawer.Upon logging onto amazon to return it for a new one, they will not exchange it, only offer me amazon credit. It is still available through another seller for much more than I paid for it. Not sure what I'm going to do as I'm sure the price will drop/availability increase in a few weeks, but that's hard to explain to my four year-old.So yes, I know this is only partially a review of the actual item, but I will think again before ordering electronics from amazon during the Christmas season again. I would have been better off if I had gone to an actual store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for fun and learning!","review":"I got this for my 6-year-old and my 3-year-old, and they are really enjoying it!

And there are different buttons to push to select different games, only one of them works, coin quiz. On level 2 of that game, it gives you an amount and you have to put various coins in to equal that amount. You'd think it would acknowledge when you got to that amount, but it does nothing. You press enter and it does nothing. If you put more in it tells you that you are wrong, but then it's too late.

I happened to log on and see this one and let me tell you, as a parent I am impressed. It has so many features, yet not too complicated for a 4 year old. When you swipe the credit card it makes a dialing sound that checks to see if the credit card is good, so cool. Beware the cash register does open really fast at first, in fact the money flew out several times. But after about 10 uses it slowed down and is perfect now. That's the one conern I had because a lot of the more expensive/less expensive cash registers number one complaint was the door sticking and not opening-you do not have to worry about that with this one!

Very educational and promotes imaginative play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good experience","review":"This toy only comes w/coins and paper bills - nothing to scan w/the scanner, and nothing to weigh on the scale. I went to the company's website to see if a separate purchase was required, and nothing was listed. The directions were no help - they seem to imply that the items to scan come w/the unit. To top it off, the toy wouldn't respond to the buttons pressed. The instructions say to press the reset button when the unit acts up, which was strangely not installed anywhere on this toy. After fiddling w/it for awhile, we got the math games to work, but inconsistently, and the toy leaves no room for open ended, imaginative play if a child can't use the scanner or scale. The kids got bored really quickly w/just the number identification and math games. We were really looking for a toy w/more creative options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"My child loves to play with the toy at a friend's house. Unfortunately, the cash drawer stuck on the first one we received. Amazon exchanged it - no problem. The second one arrived and I played with the coin recognition feature before giving it to my child. I noticed it was not 100% accurate in naming the coin I inserted. I went very slowly to give it time to answer before putting in the next coin. So I returned the 2nd one. I'm not sure if we just had bad luck and got 2 bad ones; I was unwilling to try a 3rd. This product has great features and my child loves it, but I wasn't willing to risk confusing her.

Put batteries in and only got CB Open message. None of the buttons worked and resetting didn't help. I'd actually saw one out in a local toy store and played with it a bit and also noticed what others are saying about the coin counter counting the coins incorrectly, like saying that a penny was a dime.

It was improperly teaching him the coins by confusing a nickel and a quarter. It took me a while but the company allowed me to ship it back for a new one. We had a friend over and the friend knocked it off a shelf (about 2 feet from the ground) and it broke. All of the lights are lit up and it won't do anything. It's a hassle to ship it to the company to keep having it replaced. And I have to pay the shipping. It's unfortunate because it was a great toy when it did work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash Register","review":"Purchased for a 2 1/2 year old little girl. She is having a great time playing with it. She now knows about credit cards and plays with the money. She is putting her real change in the register.

My one problem was that I tried to order it myself and wasn't able to. So my son ordered one for more. Lo and behold a second cash register arrived. I thought his was double shipped. No! Without any confirmation of my order, I received the second register charged to my account. I then had to return it to the manufacturer. I still do not know whether I received my refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would pass on this toy register....","review":"Okay, so I saw the overall good ratings this toy register has received and decided to get one for me 3 and 2 year old sons. Well, the first one arrived and it was missing parts so I sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement. The replacement was shipped to me with a UPS sticker on the actual toy register's box, rather than being enclosed in another shipping box as the first one was. I understand this with some 'tough' items, but this was just sloppy and lazy on some Amazon worker's part. The box was decently beat up when I received it and this item should not have been shipped this way. So, then after opening it up, all the parts are there and it looks okay! Yea! Well, after putting in batteries, the thing thinks the drawer is always open even when it is closed. So... back it goes.

So basically I threw $40 out the window.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children under 6","review":"Frustrated with this product. The age recommendation says for 3 and up. My 3 year old can't run it. She gets frustrated and just doesn't play with it. My 5 year old does a little better with it but not great. To me it is not intuitive. I think it could have been built with a little more simplicity so children of the recommended age could actually figure it out.Also, ours is broken. Sure it has been dropped off the bed but with a recommended age of 3, that should be expected. The reset button does not reset it anymore. Will be sending it back for a replacement or refund.For the price of this product, I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fun toy!","review":"I was even having fun with this toy. My kids were fighting over it. I would recommend laminating the money like a lot of others have. It's fun to just play with, but it has several math games with three levels of difficulty each. Perfect for maybe k-3 rd grade.The scanner scans anything you touch on it, and brings up a random price. It also has a coupon that you can scan, and you can pay with either cash or credit card. Fun toy, and very educational once your kids are old enough to use it correctly. And before then, it is just great for pretend play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine","review":"This has been so great.

The CDs include avi files of nearly all of the exercises from the books, and a test engine with a variety of formats, as well as simulations. The Professional book was very helpful for the exam. I haven't taken the Directory Services exam yet, but the DS book is extremely well-written. Hopefully it maps well to the exam. The DS book seemed a bit thin for the price, although I guess the CD contents made up for it.

I took the reader and books back to Toys R Us and a very competent sales clerk, a manager, and I tried other readers and books. Sadly, all of the readers were having the same problem, they would only read the books included with the reader.

But I was just searching for the accessory pack and came across a deal at Walmart that includes 4 books and the reader for only $23.00... so I'm alittle disappointed since I paid another $20 for the extra books. But it's already wrapped and it's too much of a hassle now. I haven't given the gift to my 41/2 year old daughter yet, but she'll love it. It is so simplistic and the sound quality is great. The stories are 20 pages or so and there is a small chip embedded into the paper pages so that the reader can determine which page you are on. It's pretty neat, I had fun just flipping the pages!

I figured my three-year-old daughter was old enough and responsible enough, and at first she did really well and played with it for hours each day. But even though she rarely ever throws her toys, she threw this one and broke it. Ah well. Someday I might buy a replacement, but I do not think I will bother until she is almost four. By that time she will almost certainly be able to read the books herself anyway so I am a little torn as to whether I will buy a new one.

None of the advertisements tell you that the accessory pack is required. Why not include it in the toy, and charge the extra $10 so buyers understand the real value proposition. Publications International marketing group should be sued for misleading advertising. What a bunch of low life scam artists. A toy should be functional out of the box.

Mr. Kendall also seems to have a suttle fascination with turn of the century French literature, especially when it comes to eggs.Ayn Rand once said, \\"A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others\\". Kendall should take these words to heart.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good guide to FS98."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic, and written in a rather patronizing format.","review":"I cannot say this is the best investment I have made; I bought this book on the assumption that, since it was a product of Microsoft Press, it would have a high-quality writer. I have not found this to be true. Ben Chiu's style is repetitive and some of the language is not very ideal for a book like this. Ben tries to add some humor to his work, but unsucessfully. Maybe if Alan Bramson had been the author it would have been better- he has a fresh wit, and provides entertainment. Think of another book, or put the money towards a flying lesson in a Cessna."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MEMORIES! GREAT CD!","review":"With the exception of a couple tracks on this 60's CD, this was well worth adding to my collection. I could have done without \\"The Clapping Song\\" and \\"Peter Rabbit\\", for instance. But to find a compilation that had \\"Things I'd Like to Say\\", \\"Love is All Around\\", and \\"Society's Child\\" all included on it made the purchase a must have for me. This is highly recommended for those who get nostalgic when they hear some of these great tunes from the 60's. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dick Bartley stands for quality","review":"The sound quality on this disc is so clean, it will re-introduce you to some classic songs that are a whole lot different without the tape hiss. Nothing short of amazing, and worth every penny since a lot of work was obviously put into this. Forget those sloppy \\"oldies\\" collections where the tracks don't keep up with technology. Every track on this disc replaces a now unlistenable version I have on another compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic 60's tunes compilation","review":"There are couple of clunkers in the mix (\\"Peter Rabbit\\" and \\"You Wouldn't Listen\\") but otherwise \\"Classic Oldies 1965-1969\\" is a superb collection. I have not heard the slow dance tune \\"Things I'd Like to Say\\" since 1969 and this is a clean original stereo rendition. For me it was worth the price of the entire CD, so the other great songs (e.g., \\"Soul and Inspiration,\\" \\"Israelites,\\" and \\"Society's Child\\") are a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope to read more from Ms. Fobes soon!","review":"What a wonderful story! With a long legacy to overcome, the hero and heroine of this book work together to surmount the odds. The book has it all: love, intrigue, murder, lies, and redemption. I found it very difficult to put this book down, and it was only after my husband threatened to turn the light off himself, that I actually had to stop (though I finished it the next day). Nicolas and Catherine drew me into their story and kept me there.

This book has let me down many times, I'm at the point now where if I have a question about SQL Server, I use online resources rather than wasting my time with this book.I suppose if I were a DBA I would enjoy the book more? Not Sure. With ASP and SQL Server both being Microsoft Products, coupled with the fact that the 2 often go hand in hand in complex projects, I wonder why they barely touched on how ASP relates to SQL Server.This book is certainly not aimed towards developers. Things like Views and Stored Procedures are not written very well at all which leaves me to look towards other resources and to leave this book collection on the shelf.I supposed I got this becasue the Mastering ASP 3 book is such a gem, a true art work of knowededge.

The discussions are mostly a swing lovefest. This for me is a huge distraction. Patterns are a big enough challenge in addition to learning java client programming, which I have no interest in. Events and listeners, in my view, are very specialized and leave me wondering where these patterns may fit into the type of programming I do (xml/xsl, ejb, servlets).The Windows format, glaring for the rmi example(fortunately already did it on unix), was only a minor short comming in comparison.However, I found \\"design patterns explained\\" to be one of the best programming books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books","review":"I needed this book for a class. It was one of the worst books I have read. The first big problem is that every example is about fireworks. I found myself often struggling with firework concepts to understand the book. The second problem is that the book continually has questions/problems with the answer in the book. Before the concept seems to be fully explained, it is asking you to complete a diagram. I want the book to show me example, explain it and then test me, not test me beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time and money","review":"There is no point to buy this book if you already have the book of Gang of Four. Good help to understand all the patterns is using simpler examples than what Gang of Four used. Unfortunately, this book was unable to take the advantage of Java language to use simple examples to illustrate the point and concept of each design patten.One star might be too mean. However, if we are saying what someone already did, it would be better to use simple examples and make it easy to understand. Otherwise, what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like the approach...","review":"This book is well written but it asks too many questions. I was hoping for a book that gave examples of the patterns and discussed how to use them. It does a nice job of describing the concepts, but it always stops short of giving a good example of the pattern currently under discussion.It also does something that drives me nuts...it makes me work really hard to understand a concept and then explains that is the wrong way to handle the problem and that you should do it another way. I understand why authors do this, but I don't like technique because I think it creates confusion.All in all I am disappointed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a homework of a university student.","review":"It is basically to understand Java Swing framework.Does not add anything to an avarage experienced programmer.Looks like a double spaced University homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful and teaches many anti-patterns","review":"I would recommend buying Joshua Blochs' \\"Effective Java...\\" and you will notice that there are many concepts that Bloch advises against and such concepts are recommended in this book.I think it is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"content is very loose","review":"Content is too short.

The challenges are also a great way to keep you on your toes.This is, hands down, the best design patterns book for java developers that I've come across so far and now sits right next to GoF in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"good companion to Gang of Four","review":"I found this book to be more readable but less in-depth than Design Patterns (the Gang of Four book). The Java examples were generally understandable but I felt like the attempt to relate each pattern to fireworks was more distracting than helpful and more forced than natural. In contrast, Design Patterns provided realistic examples of where each pattern naturally fits, and included much more information to guide the decision of when to apply a particular pattern.I found this to be an excellent companion to Design Patterns. It was much easier to read, but I always read the similar section of Design Patterns after each chapter to get a full description. On its own, this book would be good if your goal is to learn the 23 Gang of Four patterns by friendly Java examples, without expecting much explanation regarding the application or common usage of the patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"this is a visual feast book.large pix-A4 or A5- that are mostly new/ not seen elsewhere. subjects are all types of AFV in all theatres over all years. the only reason i dont give 5 stars is the captions: they are all brief sentences, not the longer detail-packed paragraphs that the latest Concord or RZM publications excell at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Powers","review":"Grandma once said, \\"I don't know how you boys are doing it, but you are bringing back ways that were lost--ways that I only heard about as a child.\\" This book tells about ways that were lost, be they the making of little clay Indians and buffalo that the medicine man then animates to run around the lodge, or fantastic healings, this book is an in-depth look into what our ancestors use to be able to do.

Some of the acting is abysmal and the fight scenes are mediocre. The story feels forced. I found myself fast-forwarding through the movie just to see the fight scenes, but each was more of the same. You get the feeling of been there done that from other films. The lead may be good at martial arts, but the choreography was more like street fighting. I like a good fight scene, but none of theme were memorable. I was surprised to see a few actors in this film that recently had decent roles in major films. Marina Sirtis was unexpected. Brian Thompson is a much better actor than this. I wasted about a half hour of my life on this film.

One thing I like about this game is that the face of the character you're playing changes whenever you're spinning out or gaining a boost of speed. That makes it different.There are many tracks to choose from such as the Eds' neighborhood and Courage's farm. There's even some cool power-ups ranging from wiener missiles to cream pies. There's even a special power-up called a \\"Sidekick\\" power-up where you become invincible and impervious to the various hazards on the race tracks like oil slicks and traffic cones. You can also link up to two players and go head to head with each other.This is one racing game you don't want to pass up on.

I'm not breaking my neck to get an XBOX or Cube, not while I'm having fun with this system.As for games, you have tons to choose from, and no one is left out. Jet Grind Radio, Shemue, Crazy Taxi, Quake III, and I can go on and on. Most games are in the (...) range, so you can get a nice selection of games for what you would pay for one XBOX or Ps2. The controller, while it is big, is easy to use.So if you don't have the money to drop on a \\"next-gen\\" system, get yourself a Dreamcast while they are still available.You don't have to be left out of the gaming party due to low funds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best System!!","review":"I am an avid PSX Gamer but I remembered the good old days with the Genesis, so I bought the Dreamcast, on a hunch...and I can say that I am extremely impressed.

The specs looks like a pc you can pickup from dell. 733 celeron processor, nvidia video chip, 64mb memory, dvd rom, sound chip, and a 8 gig hard drive.

Oh and the so-called online play [is awful]. Sega has been overhyping this for the past year yet there are only 2 games for it. On top of that you can only play with a 56K modem, which any PC gamer will laugh at. When I was playing NFL2K1, it was like playing a slide show. I haven't seen any extension port or anything in the back of the system that will make it compatible with broadband so we may just be stuck with dial-up. Another problem is that the controller desing is awful. Its too big and unresponsive (a fighting fan's worst nightmare).

Sure, the Dreamcast hooks up to the 'net, but who cares? It can't handle Java and it doesn't have a printer hookup. Plus the Dreamcast's peripherals are too expensive, plus the Dreamcast can't play DVDs...Basically, there are a zillion positive reviews on this site for the Dreamcast, but as time goes on watch the reviews slowly start to get worse, as users learn to embrace reality - come the end of Summer 2000, the Sega Dreamcast will be obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics aren't everything!","review":"I own a dreamcast and i can say i'm very dissapointed. sure the graphics rule, but thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAMING SYSTEM EVER","review":"This product is good and arrived in the condition described by the seller.Good job and keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal to PS2","review":"This system is great.

But I do say it does have good graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Outta Here","review":"I dont understand why people are still buying Dreamcast.There is a reason why Sega will stop making games and systems.They know they won't be as good as the upcoming consoles.Hands down,Playstation 2 is way better,and it has only been out one year.Dreamcast has only been out about 3 years,and they are already giving up.Just because it has online play doesn't mean anything... PS2 already has a bunch of games and a whole lot more are coming.Dreamcast was the best system before PS2,but it didn't have any competition.It was up against Playstation and N64.People just have to face the facts:Dreamcast is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiplayer not a big factor","review":"Gee! All you people bashing Playstation2 for only having 2 controller ports while Dreamcast has 4. Well, a well known fact is that 99 percent of the video game market plays 1 or 2 player games. The only reason this is an issue is because that 1 percent is a very vocal group. And cost of the new Playstation won't be 125 smackers more than this dreamcast, because 1. You're working with the current Japanese price and exchange rates and 2. Sony has yet to announce a U.S. price. Say what you must, but if it would hurt you the slightest, wait for PS2. Who needs Internet on a game machine? If you want it so bad, get a PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faded Out...","review":"This is crazy. Dreamcast came out, what, a couple yars ago???? And now there stopping production??? Typical Sega. Look at the 64 and the Playstation one. Both of these have been out for about 5 years now and they're still doing great. So what happen to Dreamcast? It just faded out like the rest of their consoles. I was debating on whether to get a PS2 or a DC about a couple months ago. Good thing I bought the PS2. I believed all of those DC fanatics who said the DC was \\"here to stay\\" and was the \\"best console to date.\\" Good thing I didn't buy any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ps2 blew this system out of the water","review":"I'd just like to say if this system is so good how come Ps2 beat it out of the console race?

It should focus more on games for the Ps2, then Sega will have finally done something right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmmmmmm","review":"Look, here's the deal. If you like Dreamcast, great, if your not sure what console to buy right now, save for the PS2.

That's all for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"ok, to tell you the truth I have a Dreamcast. I've played a PS2 and it's lots o fun. The games are great and there will be more out.

Dreamcast is good, I just like Ps2 better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End for Dreamcast","review":"The Dreamcast is a waste of money. Why spend $100 on a console that they are going to stop making games for soon. The only reason why it got 2 stars is because it has nice graphics and about 5 games that are good.

To give you an idea: one Japanese Dreamcast magazine has this top-10 best selling Dreamcast game ranking. Well, this one issue had the top game selling something like 8000 copies in a month. Well, when Final Fantasy VII (for Playstation only) came out in Japan, they sold over a million copies in 2 weeks. PlayStation 2 will be compatible with Playstation 1 games, so you'd be able to play them all. Plus, it's based on DVD, not CD-ROM like the Dreamcast. The Dreamcast is undoubtably the best hardware in town right now, but that's going to change in a matter of months, and then you'll feel burned again by Sega.I just don't think Sega has what it takes to battle Sony and Nintendo. Plus, Playstation 2 will have much, much, much better graphics capability than Dreamcast (70 million polygons/sec on Playstation 2 vs. 5 million polygons/sec on Dreamcast...that's some difference!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system","review":"The dreamcast is the best console ever.

Theconsole itself is very powerful and fast, capable of astounding framerates, 3d graphics and cool sounds. However, there is one thing lacking, which Sega forgot: gameplay.What's the point in paying $200 for a machine with no games? When it was released on 9/9/99, Sega had about a dozen games. 4 months later there are only 30-35 games. I've had the pleasure and displeasure of playing most of them, and in my honest opinion, 95% of them are not worth paying $40-50. For every great game like Soul Calibur, there are duds like Fighting Force 2, Armada, Dynamite Cop and Slave Zero. Sure the games look good, but where's the gameplay? How long did it take you to finish Dynamite Cop or grow tired of Soul Fighter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Gaming System!","review":"Dazzling graphics and sound capability.

It's nice to know that PS2000 and Dolphin will be able to do more than DC, but what do you play until these two come out? The software lineup for DC is just great!

You can also choose how many hours you want it to stay on. The settings' window lights up when you touch any of the buttons. A good feature for night time setting or overriding. Resetting outdoor timers at the change of seasons doesn't seem like much work, unless you've mounted it in a hard to reach location. With this timer just set it, mount it, and forget it.

The Airport Express DOES NOT work right outside of the box. You cannot plug it into the wall and have it work. You must configure it first which takes a minumum of 20 minutes. Also once it is working, the wireless signal drops once every 5-10 minutes. My AIM would get disconnected in these outages and I would have to sign back online constantly. Also if you want to use it as a print server, be advised it only works with an approved list of printers. It DOES NOT work with every printer. I think this product works better with Macs.

I am using it as a wireless router and to stream iTunes. I have an optical connection to my stereo.Sound quality is good and performance has been very reliable. I have a large collection of music on my hard drive, so this is a much better option than plugging the iPod into the stereo.I was originally experiencing intermittent sound cut-outs, but I just had to re-set the router and it has worked flawlessly ever since.The one gripe is that it does not come with the required cables to connect to your stereo. But these are easily found and purchased online. (mini to optical or mini to analog cable).

I'll second that analysis, but a methodical approach utilizing the few hard and fast rules within the directions should get a user up and running.The real drawback to the AirPort Express appears to be its potential for early mortality. Please read the discussion at this URL:[...]I purchased four AirPort Express units within sixty days. Two of those four have failed with 16 to 18 months of the purchase date. Apple's warranty covers the product for 12 months. Apple will not admit that this problem exists or offer a solution to AirPort Express owners.I'm a loyal customer of Apple. Over the past twenty years, their customer service has been either excellent or poor with NO mediocre service in the middle. Apple's response to the premature mortality of many AirPort Express units falls into the poor category, and because of that, I won't take my chances with this particular unit in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fanastic product from Apple!","review":"This product is easy to install and use.

It took me two frustrating days to get it working.If you have XP2 on your computer, make sure you download the firmware and airport express assistant updates from Apple. These are required if you want wireless security(WEP). After I applied these updates my setup went through smoothly. The airport express works perfectly now.Radioshack has the optical Y-cable for $7.I initially had problems with music skipping. Turning on an option called \\"Enable Interference Robustness\\" solved the problem nicely and I have not had skips in the music ever since.I had given this product one star in a very frustrated moment"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOSLINK","review":"One of the things most people don't know about (or don't care about, I suppose) is that this thing has an optical digital output on the mini headphone jack (at the tip).

Very nice feature for that tiny minority who care about such things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware that you need Mac OS X v10.3 to configure it","review":"This is yet another trick Apple has found to force Mac users to upgrade to their latest OS. If you don't have \\"Mac OS X v10.3 or later\\" (i.e. your Mac is more than 6 month old), you won't be able to install the AirPort Express Assistant utility and configure the AirPort Express. My PowerBook is only a year and a half old. It runs Mac OS X v10.2.8, and I'm very happy with it. It has a wireless card from Cisco and works fine in most of wireless networks, including those based on Apple technology. In other words I can use my PowerBook with the AirPort Express, but I first need to configure the AirPort Express. For that, I must have my PowerBook run Mac OS v10.3 (Panther), and that's a $129 upgrade. Bottom line: the cost of the AirPort Express is $258 if your Mac is more than 6 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"One bad apple","review":"WARNING TO iTUNES USERS: This product may serve very well as a short-range wireless router, but as a device to deliver iTunes to your stereo, it falls flat. The problem is interference from 2.4Ghz digital phones. If you have one in your home, this product is all but guaranteed to fail. (It took me three returns, countless computer hours, and four long phone calls to Apple help before this was confessed to me.) Once unplugging my phone, it seemed to work fine for a while, but then the pauses started. While a split second pause may go unnoticed if you are surfing the web, if you are playing music it is impossibly annoying. It seems baby monitors and fluorescent lights also cause problems, though not as severe as 2.4Ghz phones.

I wish that I had thought this purchase through more carefully, given the extremes in the reviews. I got it to work after a lot of research and frustration, and after all that the streaming music cuts out every few seconds, and it unit dies completely every few minutes. I spent hours tweaking the settings before I came to my senses and realized I'd be a lot happier with my dough back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother ordering this item","review":"If you absolutely must have one for a gift, don't buy it her at Amazon. First problem, the success rate for prompt delivery on this item is poor. Don't believe what is advertised. They will charge your card and simply not ship. Two to Three weeks is insane anytime of year, but during the Christmas season it is unacceptable. There is no one to contact, no one to call, no one to email. In short, no one cares. As you might guess, this is not the way to win customers but as an individual, we just don't matter to these big companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk on Windows","review":"I spent nine hours trying to set up the Airport Express with four calls to Apple and one trip to the Apple store after all of that it is still not connected. By comparison it took me 30 minutes to set up and configure my wireless Linksys on XP Pro SP2 network. The four people at Apple support and the two People in the Apple store insisted I was the only one that had ever had a problem with set up. If you are a Mac user this might be a great product but if you use Windows I would stay away from the Airport Express. I will not buy an Apple product again. I learned my lesson the hard way and will stick with Windows compatable equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy installation method!!!!!!","review":"This product came highly recommended for the single use I had for it: playing itunes off my stereo. I followed the instructions in the booklet, and on the apple support site, and read every exchange on that site from other unhappy customers--but I could not get it to work, even though I have an existing wireless network that operates beautifully on my three PCs. Eventually, after becoming incredibly frustrated, I hit upon a novel solution that I highly recommend to anyone else who purchases the AirPort Express. I took the product outside and rested it on a brick. I took a sledgehammer, raised it high, and smashed it down on the device. Little white splinters flew everywhere. The product still no longer works, but at least I feel satisfied. The $124 I paid was well worth it; I learned an important lesson: never, ever again buy anything made by Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for AirTunes","review":"I bought the Airport Express merely to add to my existing wireless network (using an Airport Extreme Base Station) so I could stream music wirelessly to my home stereo directly through iTunes. It works great - so far there hasn't been even the slightest breakup of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!! (Windows User)","review":"I was looking for a wireless connection to my Home Theater receiver with digital output. This product is excellent. The directions for installing on Windows are not the best, but I still give it 5 stars because this product is really good. It can act as a router, providing wireless access to a wired network or internet connection, but can also act as a host on an existing network.TIP: I couldn't restore factory settings (I bought an open box item) unless I plugged the unit WHILE pushing the reset button and keeping it pushed for 5 seconds. The manual only says push it for 5 secs, but didn't work for me.ANOTHER TIP: Windows users, as the prev. review explained, configure the unit by connecting to with a cable, then go wireless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"Great product!

Just want to add that they've also added WAP2 support, and you can now play your pc speakers and your airtunes remote speakers at the same time!nice work apple, just make it easier next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and reliable once installed","review":"I have a multi-platform, WPA2-encrypted network on a Linksys WRT54GL router running the DD-WRT firmware, and this piece of hardware works great once installed properly.Beware that the \\"wireless repeater\\" functionality that extends your wireless network was only intended for use with Airport Extreme, but... with a little googling you can find detailed instructions on how to set it up to extend a Linksys 54G network. It's just a bit more complicated than most would wish, but that's the price to pay for not getting the overpriced Airport Extreme base station.If you're not really tech-savvy and just want to pipe your music to remote speakers, it works fine and the setup isn't really that complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, brings you into the future without wires.","review":"i own a iBook G4 so i naturally went to go buy an apple product that offered wireless solutions. this one does just that.i plugged it in in my office and i get wireless internet throughout my house, i plug my printer directly into the airport express and that allows me to wireless print and plugging in speakers allows me to play music from my computer, so it's a nice option.i havent purchased multiple airports to play music in several rooms but it's a nice option if you really care.-when i can't figure out how to make the airport express work, i just call apple support and they are always helpful and always get the thing to work whenever i move or bring the unit on vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for Mac and Windows","review":"True plug and play setup. Plug it in, bring up Mac airport setup and within a minute you are ready to go. Use it to support two mac minis, one powerbook G4 and two windows machines. Works like a charm.

The device works flawlessly, the only hiccup being that the wizard would not configure it and I had to go into the setup software and set it up - and how to do this was quite obvious.

Unfortunately this device appears to lose the wireless connection and will reset far too often to be considered a viable means of sending music from one room to another. Also the installation documentation is not as clear as possible. I had to scour the Internet to find out that regardless of your wireless configuration, the airport MUST initially be hooked up to your router via ethernet cable. If this step is missed, a wireless connection will never happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Windows XP users","review":"It takes a network expert to make it work with Windows XP (check out Apple forums about it). Music is automatically turned off on your PC when you want to stream music (and there is no way you can change that). Impossible to stream to 2 differents airports at the same time. Very disapointing, sending two of those back to the shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Microsoft really make this thing?","review":"I bought it to just stream music from a PC via a wifi-g network to the home stereo. Install was a mess. It wouldn't work with any SSID name other than the factory default no matter what. We'd get it up & working, change the SSID and for all it knew, it was at the bottom of the Pacific. It also won't work with the WEP enabled. If you're worried about security & have a Cisco Linksys WRT54G, this is not for you. The MAC address system at least works.Further, the wirelss network crashes every couple weeks now, something it never used to do. I don't know why, so I can't say for sure it's the AirPort's fault, but it never did this prior to its install, and it started doing it right after we put it on.Would I buy it knowing what I know now? No. When it does want to work, it does an okay job. But given what Apple charges, I'm not longer in a hurry to shift to one of their computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously messed up my router configuration","review":"I tried to install this thing and it messed up my router configuration.

Do you feel lucky ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Simply' great little device","review":"Works wonderfully with my PC and home wireless network (SMC wireless router). Set up was easy once I figured out:1. It can be either a client or an access point (either create a network or join one) but not both if you're not using Airport Extreme, and that2. The name of the network to join is the SSID of the access pointWorks great a both a connection point, and then as a client to play music. Integration with iTunes was seamless, it just \\"shows up\\" on the bottom bar.Would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to have it simultaneously be a client on the PC Wireless network and also extend it, like it does with Airport Extreme.I know others have dinged it because of the lack of bells and whistles, but I gladly traded that for quick setup time, PC compatability and the fact that I had music on the back porch in less than hour (with powered speakers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mine's dead---just like many, many others","review":"Mine was great while it lasted.

This one is supposed to be the best. Well, maybe it is, but I couldn't get it to work at all. I am running 32 bit Windows 7. I suspect if you are 100% Apple, it works great. I tried to follow the instructions, but I never saw a green light once. In addition, when you get most of the way through the set up. it messes up your current wireless connection to the point where the only solution I found was to remove the network from my list of preferred networks, and rejoin as a new user, which requires you to re key your security password. Not a big deal, but after the 3rd time, I gave up. I'll take a lesser extender if I can get it to set up. this one is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and fun to share tunes","review":"I got this just so we could have our playlists going wirelessy through the entertaiment system in our living room.

I have an Airport Network at home and am running all the latest software, and just wanted to extend the range of my network a little bit for convenience. No matter what I did, the Airport Express unit would not connect to the Airport Network I already had up and running and none of the utility applications would work either. I sent the Airport Express back for a refund. I'm sure they work for most people, but they sure don't work for everyone all the time. Your experience could be better, but mine was not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took a little work","review":"I had to call Apple tech support a couple of times. The first time, I was trying to connect my MacBook to the AirPort Express.

The trick was to use the 26-character password for the base station and the name of the base station during the installation of the wireless network card for the PC.

But this thing was definatly a good choice. the internet security stuff on it for setting passwords on it work great. The Software plays a big part in that. Also besides just being a wireless router the wireless print server funtion works great. I can be anywhere on the wireless internet and print with a click, which is nice cause normally with a laptop youwould have to set it down and plug in the USB for the printer. this just saves alot of trouble. The wireless itunes is also very nice. right now i have it hook up through my stereo system making it very convienent to play music through it and use the nicer speaker then the little ones built into my laptop.

Yea, Right.","review":"I have an Apple Powerbook 17' -- the top of the line Mac notebook. I purchased Airport Express along with it looking for a fully integrated, plug-and-play wireless system. I've had 2 Cisco certified network engineers (both friends), try to help me get connected using this thing. It has become something of a running joke among us at this point. I ended up buying a wireless router designed for Windows and now have sort of a Rube Goldberg configuration that works fairly well. The fault is either with my new $3,000-plus computer, all three of the Airport Express models I've tried, or both. Or me and two newtork professionals. Who knows.This is a great product in theory, but as noted below it is clearly first-generation. Be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine just died","review":"Had one of these for about 3 years. During that time I was mostly pleased with it. Generally it would stream my music without problems, although sometimes it would lose the stream intermittently. This was enough of a problem sometimes that I would move the computer to the stereo and bypass the Airport Express altogether.But my biggest complaint is that it died a few days ago. The light will not turn on, can't get it to respond. I'm starting to doubt the staying power of Mac accessories - I would think something like this would last until it's obsolete.I am also not sure why the price is so high now, when I bought mine several years ago it was about 40% cheaper than the price I'm seeing now, with apparently the same functionality.Can't really recommend this product. It would be great if it worked better and lasted longer. As it is, I'd call it overpriced and undermanufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airport Express buyer beware","review":"Make sure you fully understand wirelss connections if you plan to purchase this product. I intended to use the Airport strictly to stream music to my home stereo via iTunes and was unable to complete the connection successfully.

Instead of having the music from itunes come out from the speakers in the computer, it comes out through the speakers of your stero so you really get the full effect.

Also, you can plug and share your printer.Its so small, you can carry around and it saves profiles, yeah, you can set it up to your home, save it. Then you go to your friends house and wants to share his non-wireless network than you can make a new setup and save it with another name.

In his arms she learns things that totally disprove Katherine of Aragon's training. On the less sensual side, Phillipa's involvement in intrigue has the potential to stop a plot against her liege.**** Bertrice Small continues to win readers, even those not enarmored of historical romance.

Those are just a few of the classic episodes in this volume.Devoid of extras once again, however there was a flyer for The Adventures of the Gummi Bears on DVD in the case, but that is all. Still the price is right for many solid episodes and I suggest to any fan of the series or Chip \\"N\\" Dale fan to buy this one right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatttt","review":"One of my favorite's ones chip and dale's rescue rangers.

I made it about 1/4 of the way through this book, hoping to find a glimmer of inspiration to trudge forward. No such luck. Instead, I feel like I need to shower ... fully clothed. I agree with another 1-star commenter who found the book to be \\"a turn off.\\" The horrors of the holocaust are undeniably ghastly, but a sexual encounter between the ghost of an old man with half his head blown to pieces and a young girl (13 or 14, the book says) who is dying of TB? My stomach is still turning. I found nothing \\"enlivening\\" about this account, certainly nothing beautiful, and I can't bring myself to read further in effort discover the value others found in this book. My one star goes to the crow who embodies the spirit of a dead rabbi. I mean, who doesn't love the idea of a philosophical corvid? But if you want a talking crow AND a better storyline, try Brian Doyle'sMink River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me be honest with you.","review":"Let me be completely honest with you.This was a TERRIBLE book. I think that the author doesn't even understand the holocaust, and what it did to people's minds.In fact, Here's the summary. A guy called Chaim dies. His Rabbi is a crow now. Chaim and Rabbi go to the rest of the jews who were killed. WHEEE.Oh no! Where's the world to come?Hey, look, it's jesus!LUXURY HOTEL FOR THE JEWS YAYTHE MOON IS GONE! WE MUST FIND IT!Nothing makes the slightest bit of sense. The author, additionally, has the attention span of a squirrel. No consistent PROBLEM.

I got the impression I was reading a play that had been converted to a novella. The characters are two-dimensional, the dialog stiff and the setting vague. The book should be made into a screenplay--that way we could see what the author has failed to describe. An important message but the wrong medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth Was Disturbing Enough","review":"Magical Fiction about the Holocaust, how will this instruct us when the truth was more unsettling than anything that can be imagined? This novel was well-written, yes, disturbing and painful to read, as any fiction with such subject matter must be, but I found myself wondering why I went on this journey and what the young American author felt he could tell me that survivor fiction and non-fiction had not already. I felt the Holocaust exploited and regretted having read this book. I'm going back to my Primo Levi, my Paul Celan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Turn Off","review":"The book begins with a mass execution of Jews in a Polish village during World War II. Immediately you enter a world of bizarre fantasy that depicts the experience of the book's dead hero Chaim. His spirit returns to his former home only to find it occupied by a greedy and cold hearted Catholic family. The members of this Polish family are so self occupied that they pay little notice of their daughter/sister dying from TB in an upstairs bedroom. Chaim pities the child and befriends her. Then the book takes a sick turn and our hero, who is the ghost of an old man has sex with this young girl. After that I could no longer read this book, into the trash it went. Reading about a Pedophile's sexual encounter with a child is not my idea of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a fable on the Holocaust, the book reaches many levels of","review":"As a fable on the Holocaust, the book reaches many levels of meaning. The living murdered Jews in the book, and the main character Chaim Skibelsky are testimony to the fact that we can die many deaths. Their wandering in the forest, frequently a symbol of confusion, their one night rescue in a fantasy hotel, and their ultimate redemption are powerful reminders that reality is not the only sense of life.With the return of the lost moon, the sacred cycles of life for Jews can resume.The details of the murder are devastating, and the life of the dead are told with great humor. For any one familiar with Hasidic tales, A Blessing on the Moon will be a contemporary masterful addition to that literature. For those uninitiated to its magic realism, you are in for a treat.I recommend reading The Far Euphrates in conjunction with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Unleashed","review":"Book arived in the condition stated and in the time period stated.

Take it from me (someone who has passed this exam) this book is a must have to pass the exam. Cisco has not revised this exam in a number of years and the amount of legacy technolgies on the exam will really trip you up. Robert Padjen does a very complete job of covering these technologies.

You did a great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart without passion","review":"What's not to love about Alison Hagley's Susanna? But I have to say that Gerald Finley's Figaro seemed to me rather uninspired. In addition there appeared to be little chemistry between the two lovers. Okay performance, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart Opera Lover from Falls Church, VA","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I heard this opera as the sound was horrible and I have a 32 inch SONY Trinton TV and a SONY DVD!!! The sound gets worse after the overture when you hear the singers because it sounds so far away and distant. I bought this version because of the raving reviews I found here. I think the production was poor and the singers were not all that great especially Cherubino. Even though Finley and Fleming make a wonderful pair together, I've heard them sing Mozart far better than in this production. Hagley as Susanna in the JEG/Paris recording is delightful through and through compared to this one. Also, the tempi was very slow as well as the singing--there's so much going on at the same time in the opera, it should move more quickly!! I find the version with JEG conducting and Byrn Terfel singing far more superior!!! DO NOT BUY! You will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Achieves the impossible","review":"You would think it would be impossible to make Mozart look and sound cheap and boring. From the start you get the feeling of emptiness and general lack of ideas. The settings and costumes are uninspired and just plain cheap. The tempo of the orchestra is slow and sounds tired. The voices are good but the ensembles just don't sound right. The Count sounds good but looks more like a country boor than an aristocrat, Susanna looks way too modern and I believe that this must be one of the least attractive Cherubinos on record. I was not able to finish watching the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not greatest","review":"This performance of Figaro was musically superb, however the stage being slanted bothered some action. There were unfortunately no stage sets to speak of at all, or meager, nor varied costumes. Fleming was somewhat plump, but gorgeous just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for listening","review":"I wish I had credited Mr Schenbeck's review more highly. There is no PCM layer, so there is no hifi sound. To make matters worse, the balancing is extremely artificial (e.g. Count on right channel only when he standing 3 feet to the right of Countess who is on left channel only). The time is 190 minutes (!), 17 minutes more than Boehm's complete account on DG 1968--and no one I know has accused Boehm of being a speed freak. The sets are strictly Walmart. The acting is quite good given that the pace set by Haitink essentially eliminates any comedy. The singing also seems quite good, but this is impossible to judge given the Dolby sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad disappointment!","review":"My favorite opera. The greatest music. Excellent singing and orchestra and conduction. I already have the superb Böhm / Fischer-Dieskau / Janowitz / Mathis / Prey / Troyanos recording if that is all I want. But opera is also a VISUAL medium. This production: the scenography dull, the wardrobe prosaic, and the fourth act a total turn off. It is supposed to take place in a garden, not in what looks like a bunch of falling pier supports. Might as well have filmed it on a garbage dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've given it a 0 stars, if I could","review":"Please do not waste your money on this one. The sound is tourchuring. We could not even listen through the first act! It was complete waste of money for us! Poor Mozart, and I always thought that you can't go wrong with Mozart's pieces, what a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Quality","review":"I was thinking of buying this DVD but was able to borrow a copy from the library this week to test it out first. I was disappointed with the sound. Most of the time, the orchestra overwhelmed the soloists. This performance was originally broadcast in 1994 on English televison and was made for the old style TVs (4:3). This DVD did not do justice to Gerald Finley's wonderful voice. I also found the sets too modern looking and skimpy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD of Le Nozze Di Figaro Ever!","review":"There has been a lot of talk of how attractive Opera Singers are today and its true . Singers in this performance (1994) are even more attractive . Allison Hagley who plays Susanna reminds me of Jane Powell , but sings better. Unfortunately she does not seem to have had a long career. Also this is a tradtional production. No Chi-Chi.And the Conductor , Bernard Haitnick who seems very sympathique keeps things moving right along. Mozart would have enjoyed this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful production of my favorite opera","review":"I'm not sure how many times I've watched this DVD, but it's been many since my purchase. What originally drew me to it was the fact that Renee Fleming was in it. She is certainly very strong, but I greatly enjoyed all the performances.The orchestra and sets are very enjoyable as the singers simply carry you away. I didn't care too much for the candy stripes on the stage floor, but found that to be no more than a mild irritant that can be quickly forgotten.If you are a fan of this opera, I think it's well worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple sets allow the music and singing to stand out","review":"A traditional staging, with simple yet attractive sets, allow the singers to shine in this production which innaugurated the Glyndebourne Festival's renovated opera house. The music was appropriately light and airy, EXCEPT, and this is why I did not give this version a fifth star, in Figaro's marriage scene. I feel that Maestro Haitink could have brought the volume up and sustained it a little longer on a celebratory tone. I couldn't help but compare it with the same scene in the movie \\"Amadeus\\", which to me, is the way it should look and sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing audio track","review":"This would have been a great production except that the audio is very very poor...almost like is was recorded with a portable cassette tape player in the lap of someone in the audience. We have other DVDs of Glyndebourne Festival Opera performances and they are wonderful. This one should not have ever been released for sale with its poor audio quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"For what its worth","review":"I purchased this DVD with some trepidation given the disparity of opinions among the reviewers. I was disappointed. I would characterize this as an unoffensive but completely uninspired production. I have no beef with the quality of the singing, but the staging, acting, and direction show a mimimum of effort, imagination or emotion. This is a humorless, lifeless production of Figaro. Scenes that have moved me to tears or to guffaws in other productions were rushed through or dismissed as though they weren't worth bothering with in this production. I am by no means an audiophile, but even I was bothered by the poor quality of the sound. Singers literally cannot be heard when they stand at certain areas of the stage (a glaring problem in the ensemble pieces). I'm continuing my search for a great production of Figaro on VHS/DVD. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Sound Quality","review":"I can't believe the positive reviews of this DVD refer to the product I purchased. The sound quality is so poor as to be almost unintelligible, as if it were recorded illegally and then mass produced in someone's basement. I can't even comment on the quality of the singing because it is so muffled. The set is uninspired and the costumes look like they were done for a high school production. I think it's fair to say there is no nuance or creativity in the visual aspect of this production. I bought this DVD after reading through the reviews of several productions and deciding this one might be the best. I'm teaching this opera soon, but will have to continue looking for at least a passable version of it. I don't want to show this to students who are not familiar with the art form as it may put them off opera for the rest o their lives. Yes, I'm sorry to say it's that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varsity show","review":"Since this was a gift, I have not seen the movie, but I do enjoy those movies that Dick Powell have played in and have not found any dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This is an unauthorized amateur documentary that is POOR in every way except the jacket cover photo!This is a quasi-professional documentary with random interviews from the local radio station jocks and some kids that grew up in Christina's hometown that don't even really know her. It is the WORST documentary I have ever paid for! There is NO Music and the documentary keeps playing a scene divider with the same six or eight images over and over and over again in between interview bites!!!!! The sound quality is terrible, the subjects interviewed are BORING and I am only taking my time to write this to purge my anger for having ever asked for this as a gift. I can assure you that Christina is sad for her fans who have spent good money on this.

I'd like to see a story on Nick. It would be great to see how her father, grandfather and uncles would deal with her love interest.

Unfortunately, all (most?!!) of her heros don't hold up quality-wise, and this Chance is one of the worst. He *uses* Sunny as bait, without her knowledge or consent, sets her up for attack. Unfortunately, I have come to realize that this is a formula Howard often employees. (See also Dream Man and others.) Not only is this NOT the embodiment of everywoman's dream, I don't think (HOPE it ISN'T) legal, even in the world of espionage and terrorism. After you read a few of Howard's books, you come to realize how the formula works: If the HEROINE is under suspicion (Loving Evangeline, Game of Chance, etc.), the hero tricks her, investigates her, then uses her/ sets her up as BAIT. If the HERO is under suspicion (Mackenzie's Mountain, Shades of Twilight), the heroine believes in him and stands by him against all odds. YUCK!!!

Gary owned the dogs since he was a toddler to a fully grown adult.One of the dogs Gary owned was a Great Dane called Caesar,he was gentle and gigantic.As you'll read this you will understand why these dogs became so special to him in many ways.This book also has funny moments like when Dirk,the tiny watchdog,Gary owned when he was a child bit someone's pants off because Gary was being bullied.Emotional moments are also very common in this book like when some dogs Gary found were missing,abandon,and lost.Reading this book will be easy for the young ones because they will understand how Gary feels about his dogs.An Audience older than 14 wouldn't be as interested.Overall this book has some short stories, were a reader can't get lost.I would recommend this book for an audience under 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"In this book Gary Paulson tells about all of the dogs in his life. There is Cookie-who saved him from falling through the ice. what I liked best is when Ceaser (Garys great dane) jumped through the drive through window at Dairy Queen (an ice cream stand) Read this book to find out more.I think people who love dogs would like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For many ages.","review":"My one boy skipped reading as much as he could.

It is funny, sad, joyful and will give you goosebumps at times. My favorite chapter is on Cookie, the sled dog who save's Paulsen's life. It is a great book for all age groups and especially meaningful to dog lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quick Read","review":"This book is half auto-biography and half dog-story book. The two are combined when Gary Paulsen writes about the dogs that have shared his life.Each story proves the importance of these furry friends in his life, and they also provide a glance into Gary's rough childhood and difficult adult years.Overall, I thought the book was inspiring and heartwarming, though there were many details of the author's early life that alternately made me angry and sad.Good book. Quick read. I laughed, I sighed. I was reminded of how wonderful dogs of all sorts are.Pam T~mom/blogger"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved each & every one of these dogs stories","review":"This was a very unique book. I enjoyed every chapter, as I learned about each new dog that passed through Gary Paulsen's life. All of them true stories, of course.

Gary Paulsen has an extremely different way of writing from other authors. I have read a couple of his other books. This was probably not his best, but it was well written. I would highly recommend it for any dog lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs! Dogs! Dogs!","review":"My Life In Dog Years by Gary Paulsen is a collection of short stories of the many dogs the author had owned. Each chapter expounds a single dog whose memory graces Paulsens mind.I would recommend this book to both Gary Paulsen fans and dog lovers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nit-picking, indeed","review":"The long and thoughtful comment below may, in fact, be accurate. Mistakes do creep into the publishing process, unfortunately. But as someone who has been involved in the professional science community for many years, I feel these small errors should be overlooked in the interest of the greater whole. This is a major, highly readable work by one of the most important scientists and journalists of our time. Beautifully illustrated, each of the chapters is compelling in its own right and can be read by anyone with a keen sense of curiosity about the scientific discovery process. To see it as anything less is quibbling indeed. Fans of \\"Uncle Tungsten\\" by my neighbor Dr Oliver Sacks and the current popular hit \\"Tuxedo Park\\" will love this beautifully packaged book and find it every bit as accessible and riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to A reader","review":"In his review below, A reader suggests we overlook the \\"small errors\\" in this book \\"in the interest of the greater whole.\\"First, if an error of 50 MILLION percent is small, I'm curious to know what he would consider a significant error.Second, I challenge his notion that it is in the interest of the greater good to ignore these errors. It is my understanding that the primary purpose of science is to dismantle misconceptions, not to dispense them... too better our understanding of the world not to worsen it. If we value science, we must value the social necessity of challenging what is presented as scientific fact. We must shine a light on these errors as errors, not turn a blind eye to them. (By the way, no one has challenged the accuracy of my initial review below.)Personnally, I feel the value of this book can only be enhanced by correcting these errors and eagerly await the next edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The watches arrived on time.

IF you've ever played any of the of the other harvest moon games this one is a bit simalar. You plant crops, take care of animals, marry a girl, AND EVEN HAVE A KID! You can only marry 3 girls Ceila, Nami, and Muffy. the only hard thing is you have to capture their heart by giving them flowers and other things. You can rase animals like goats, chickens, sheep, cows and a horse. The point of the game is to live \\"A wonderful life\\".This is one of the very few and unice games that you don't have to solve your problems with violence. It teaches you how to be responsible, caring for others, and how to have friends.

This game is a combination of a lot of genres...RPG, simulation, and strategy. You are basically put in charge of running a farm and turning it into a successful business enterprise. Along the way you acquire a wife and a child. You wouldn't think planting crops and milking cows would have much appeal but the way the game is designed, it really gets quite engrossing! Also, it's one of the few games out where you don't have to use violence to solve your problems.The graphics, while cartoonish in appearance, are very nicely done with lovely lighting, seasonal, and weather effects. The sunrises and sunsets are very pretty.This is a game for kids that I think adults would enjoy as well. This adult certainly does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest Moon; it IS a wonderful life!","review":"Harvest Moon: A wonderful life, is a great game and my personal favorite. You start off as a city-slicker kid who knows more about artichokes than farming. But when his Dad dies he inheirits the family farm he never knew about. His Dad's partner/best friend is there to help you along the way but it's mostly up to you. You start out with only one animal; a cow. You make money off the milk it makes until you have enough saved to buy another animal, either a hen or rooster, another cow, or a sheep. After a while in the game you become lonely and begin your search for a wife. You have three choices; a shy farm-girl, a dumb-blonde flirt, or a mysterious tomboy traveler. To propose though you must find the rare Blue Feather (in your town it's a sign of engagement). However no sure answer if they will say yes. I love this game because it's challenging, is a game with no ending, and down-right fun! Try your luck today at this addictive game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game ROCKS!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is a new version of the harvest moon series. The graphics have never been this good and even though there are only 3 girls to marry in this one, they all have a different baby. there are all new animals such as goats and ducks! a brand new way to plant crops and get married. The worst part of this game was the wait leading up to it. I am a HUGE fan of the Harvest Moon games, and they ar getting better every time a new game comes out.Even though i know the rest of the games are pretty old games, they aren't EVER going to get better then a wonderfull life.

You'd think that a game about farming that's rated E wouldn't be that enjoyable, but you're wrong. This game is better than all those little Call of Duty games, and all that.

Muffy, Nami, and Celena.You rase a farm, buy animals, sell animals, win over (or at least try) a girls heart, ect.Now, I could give lots of info on this game (really it's basic, but fun) but this is one you have to rent to see if it's too slow paced for you, or if it's your dream game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Impressed!","review":"I have read at least 10 reviews on this game, and watched about 5 movie clips, seen about 50 screenshots, and i can safely say, I WANT THIS GAME! 40$ sounds like a good offer on this game!

There are some minor things that really should have been fixed that weren't that really detract from gameplay. Mostly, the controls are too sensitive especially when you are doing anything with your crops. Also, when you sell something other than milk it takes forever. After you are done selling one item, instead of asking if you have anything else to sell, you have to start the conversation over again for every new item. It gets old fast. Little things like that are the only minuses I have found in about 10 hours of game play.

Yet, with each new book I find she can indeed surpass herself and bring me a new \\"favorite.\\"Ellie and Caleb's story kept me turning the pages ong after my bedtime -- admiring their strength, crying for their pain and longing for their happily ever after. When I reached the last page, my only regret was that the story was over. Whether you're a new reader, or a long-time fan, this is a St. John book you won't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Great but is missing something","review":"i love this game when i first got it i played it for 12 hours strait. It starts out slow but once you get into it you cant stop playing. The only problem is that you do the same thing almost every day that is required. You can start a family, raise crops and animals and upgrade your house+ more. This is one of the best real time stategy games ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but few flaws","review":"I enjoy(ed) this game, its one of those childhood games that I enjoyed soo much I had to get it for my GBA. I was having so much fun with this version, spent soo much time playing, making money, building my farm, had my girlfriends heart level to red... But one morning I stick the game caterage in my GBA and found that everything had ereased.

It is tons of fun to play. You get to fix up an old farm, farm, date, marry, fish, mine, raise animals, and tons of other stuff. Once you start playing you get hooked. You can spend hundreds of hours playing. Also to fix a statement in someones past review there are many more than 2 tools....there are over 10...you can only hold a few at a time in your pack though.....I recommend this game to all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I got this game after playing Harvest Moon; A Wonderful Life on GameCube.

All you do every day is check the television, gather the honey, fish, and farm. If you're lucky you can get around to the city before you get too tired or all the shops are closed after you get done farming.The same thing, day in, day out. Even the hints and help I found around the Internet about this game didn't make it more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another harvest moon game","review":"This is basically a regular harvest moon game. You are a guy that inherits a run down farm. You can grow crops, raise animals,mine,fish,get married and raise a family. This game is full of typos, and it also seems that the typos depend on what game you have. In my cousin's game Zach talks in Japanese, but in my game he talks in English. Both of us married Elli and both of us asked her to call us 'honey.' but in my game she just calls me',' while she calls my cousin honey.If you're a harvest moon fan then you probably won't mind all the typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BE FOOLED!!!!","review":"This game is a lie. It is not the happy game it claims to be. I have had a horrible experience while playing this game. Yes, it is very popular, and therefore I bought it for my daughter who enjoyed it for two days. During gameplay, she was forced into making her chicken die, a task unsettling for her, misrepresented by the jovial packaging of the game. This upset her so much that she no longer plays the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be the best!","review":"Do not listen to the \\"Only get this game if you need your veggies...\\" reviewer, he/she obviously does not know what he/she is talking about.

It basically is Harvest Moon Back to Nature (Is on PS1), same town, same characters, but all new features, events, minigames, locations, and tons, tons more! The graphics as well can be comparable to HM BTN, which of course is a good thing.I would like to tell you more about this wonderful game, but that would be spoiling it for you! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest Moon: fomt","review":"This game is great; the graphics are practically as good as the ones for harvest moon 64 and there are just as much things to do and there are tons of cool animations. also, the world is pretty big; theres even two mines. there are some new crops and you can have a ton of animals after expanding the chicken coup and the barn. you can actually read the books in the library too and there are toooons of recipes you can make with the kitchen. i think its a great game and i cant wait for harvest moon AWL to come out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks!","review":"We really like this game because you can get married, raise animals like cows, chickens, sheep and you get a horse for free and a dog.

Douglas isn't for the faint of heart; the deaths are described in very gruesome detail, even for a horror novel. Just warning you.Anyway, this is a pretty good \\"nature gone mad\\" book. The various inhabitants of the island of Yalkie are drawn pretty realistically and no one really feels like a stock character or archetype. Suspense sequences are done nicely. There's a sex sequence (well, sort of) that seems a bit random, but otherwise, everything flows well.This book is a bit of an odd hybrid of a 50's giant monster movie (the general pace and narrative flow) and an 80's slasher film (sexual content, gruesome deaths, even a killer-isn't-quite-dead-yet scare). Also, there seems to be a slight right-wing spin, a mild conservative twist, but not enough to really bother me (who's about as left-wing as you can get)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Review on New Encyclopedia of the Cat","review":"I thought the book was very good.

There is so much more to this book. My only disappointmentwas in the lack of material on the Big Cats. There are some beautiful photographs of them though.

More fuel for some type of cult book, but ultimately a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serendipitous!","review":"The Man Who Grew Young is beautifully crafted, and unveils more splendid \\"Quinn-isms.\\" And Tim Eldred illustrated it gorgeously!

He wanted to write a novel that went backward in time. \\"Impossible\\" he was told. Impossible to write, impossible to sell. He wanted to write it as a screenplay. Same reaction. Finally he wrote it as an adult comic book, illustrated by Tim Eldred. Does it work? Pretty much. Satisfying? Surprisingly, yes, up to the ending. It's filled with Quinn's usual concerns about the environment and our place in the scheme of things. And there's a bonus.

BIG MISTAKE, every track on the CD sounds just like \\"California\\" just with different cheezeball vocals. If you like \\"California\\", buy the single, though there were 2 different versions of the song on the album, and only one was anygood.

Why Hove would publish a book in broken English is the question one is left with after even a cursory examination. Compare to their beautifully executed text and illustrations in their book on Rollei collecting.Princelle's book is still great, and unless someone publishes an English edition of the Isaak S.

Sure it can be used to play little mini-games, but do we really want to play these when we can play games in full color on television? The memory card itself only holds 200 blocks (128KB). It might sound like a lot, but games like NFL2K1 take up 163 blocks of memory! For a next-generation system this is basically a storage device from 1970.

The battery life is short, but honestly, who's going to be taking that with them anywhere, without a dreamcast nearby anyway. The only use for the battery is to use it without the Dreamcast, so it's not really necessary anyway.

Sometimes one game takes up almost all 200 blocks of memory. There are only a few VMU games to download and the only one I really liked was Tetris. A VMU costs ... dollars when a normal memory card costs about [price].Still I think all Dreamcast owners should have at least one VMU and maybe some normal memory cards or an 800 block memory card.

It is nearly impossible to shave while wet, even if you put plenty of shaving lotion on. I was not able to shave all my facial hairs. I came out of the shower with hairs sticking out here and there, and even though I went back in 3 times I had to go over with a manual shaver afterwards. I tried it the next day on dry skin and oh boy did I burn my skin. I'm all red and blotchy now, and still the same problem.

This razor gives a nice smooth and quiet shave. The lotion dispenser works well.My two issues with the razor are:* Portability - The recharge holster is a modern looking gadget which looks cool but is too bulky for light traveling. In addition it needs a flat surface to sit on making it difficult to recharge at the nearest outlet to your suitcase in a hotel room.* Detached trimmer - My biggest disappointment with the razor is that the trimmer is a separate attachment that requires you to remove the shave blades and push in a different top. I prefer the all-in-one units with the flip-up trimmer. When I'm shaving (either in shower, bathroom sink, or car on the way to work) I don't really want to fumble with different attachments just to trim the side burns.Overall, nice shave but a bit clumsy on the usability. For me it's not worth the upgrade cost - I will probably return this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Electric Shaver I have ever used","review":"The Norelco advantage model shaver has given me the best shave I have ever experienced with electric razors. My razor is not completely waterproof, however, as I have been plagued by water leaking in through the push button switch and causing the razor to stop working until it is thoroughly dried out. I have also found that the shaving gel cartridges that Norelco sells are inconvenient to use and expensive, so I use almost any kind of skin lotion instead, which also has the advantage of leaving my face with no irritation and a noticeable feeling of comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Well I don't play this anymore but I played for 1 year and I played it so much I couldnt go anyhigher on the levels.

I like the fact that the tray included is just flat plastic, it's much easier to clean than the old one with fabric inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fit, looks good too","review":"Bought a used Hyundai with a horrible factory system - and needed this for the aftermarket radio/mp3 deck. It fit perfectly, and was easy to install. I like the little pocket for extra bits/bobs, and it makes the whole installation look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"Purchase this item to install my stereo, couldn't ask for better, fits just perfect to my hyundai dash board.. I very happy with all this products that i had bought. O by the way delivery was on time.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebuttal","review":"I've had this game before and due to circumstances unforeseen, I'm now looking to get it again. I feel that it is a really good game for what it is, based on a T.V. show. I had no problem with the targeting, It's based on your SKILL not on auto-targeting, thou there is some of that. But NOT enough to make a bad player good. As far as camera angle, You can adjust it on the fly to give you the most advantageous view point. The only thing I can really say negative about it is that it seems very closed. I wanted to explore the area around Taru-Taru Land. I liked the Vs. mode, where two players can build their own bot and fight them I would highly suggest that You have two memory cards to do it right. If you like Medabots get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy girls Beauty Salon","review":"This is the toy you need if you love groovy girls. It even comes with little magazines. It's amazing. It would be even more amazing if they even opened because the headlines look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, not tight enough","review":"First off the quality of these is amazing. These things are hefty and definitely add some weight to the hood but the build quality is top notch.I'd give them 5-stars but the band portion is not as strong as I'd hoped. My purpose in buying these was two-fold: 1) add a quality hood latch with a nice look - CHECK and 2) prevent my Jeep's hood from bumping up and down on the highway - FAILThere's a little flexibility in the install so I plan to tweak it a little bit to help fix the hood bump, but right now it looks like I'll still have the problem. At least my latches look good now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing debut release","review":"This is a very well produced first effort from an unknown band. An interesting mix of pop ballads, instrumentals, and heavy stuff. The lead singer takes charge from the opening track and we are drawn to each subsequent track. The beauty and simplicity of her talent is best showcased on the track \\"Open Ends\\". They never allow themselves to become overly serious. I especially enjoy their sense of humor(listen to Halloween). I look forward to hearing more from this fresh new talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not have the light-ups at the end. . .misleading","review":"We have a copy of this book with the light-ups on the last page. This is our second time trying to get a second copy for a baby gift. The reviews for this book talked about the light-ups, so we were sure we were getting the correct book. This is the second time that when the book arrived, it was smaller than the copy we have - and there are NO light-ups. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and disasterous","review":"We purchased this for our trip to South Africa. Unfortunately, it promptly issued copious amounts of smoke and tried to melt within the first 5 minutes of being plugged in. Thankfully, we had not yet connected any of our items. We borrowed converters from other travelers in our group for the rest of the trip. I lugged this damn thing in limited luggage, and completely regret it. Of course, we bought before the trip, and the Amazon warranty was over before we returned. All the manufacturer will do is allow you to pay $8 to ship to back to them, so they can \\"examine\\" it and return it repaired. Too late! The trip is over!Wish I had read the other reviews - Don't buy this under any circumstances, periodMy rating is a 0 out of 5 if I could post a 0 on the rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good - Requested for refund","review":"This is THE worst piece of item I have ever purchased. Followed all instructions, but still blowed up (started smooking) on first use. The worst part is, it damaged my son's much needed nebulizer machine which I had to replace from out of pocket. Thank goodness I had a hand-held inhaler which my son used while abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked OK - Once!","review":"Bought this because it was nicely self-contained and had a higher power rating than most units. Then we took it on a trip to Europe. My wife used it once on the \\"high\\" setting with her hair dryer. She said it worked fine, but we were unable to get it to work on any setting after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this Review BEFORE Purchasing","review":"I purchased this for my upcoming trip to Asia. Unfortunately, two of the three adapters that are used in China are NOT included in this kit. Also, the converter portion of this is only good for appliances such as blow dryers and curling irons. If you have electronic devices such as laptops, MP3 players, cell phones, you need a step down or up transformer NOT a converter.Today, our chargers are universal and can be used without the transformer. Check your charger to see if it goes to 220 or 240 Volts. If it does you only need the adapter for the country you are visiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not appropriate for travel","review":"I have bought this adaptor to go travelling with a suitcase, and supposed it would be small and light. When I've recieved it, it turned out to be pretty big and heavy. I would not recomend to use it as portable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploded","review":"I used the coverter and adapter and it exploded; causing my hotel room and surrounding rooms to lose power. The power converter was also very heavy but since this was my first, I'm not certain if this is typically the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent travel helper","review":"This was purchased because my spouse is frequently deployed (military) on short trips throughout the year, and needed to have a good, reliable converter for whatever part of the world he was in. This set has worked wonderfully. We've also lent it out to others in his squadron when they deploy and they love it as well. It's nice to not have to fumble for loose parts in a fabric bag. Everything here clicks in nice and securely and there's no need to worry about it opening and falling apart all over your suitcase. If you have anyone in your life that travels often to foreign countries, this would make a very thoughtful and well used gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"Was a great little kit. Took it to India with me and it survived the trip. There's only two little issues; 1) Sometimes it's too heavy and won't stay in the socket 2) The case doesn't stay shut real well. Those were just two minor things though, other than that I was very happy with it's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel adapter","review":"We just came back from a trip to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. This global power travel kit is everything you need to convert your 110 products such as cell phone chargers, hair dryers, etc. to 240. It's compact and easily fits in your carry on bag. I would highly recommend to anyone traveling to Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless transformer","review":"The adaptors work fine. The transformer melted the 1st time we tried to use it. Also the hinge on the case broke very quickly. Sooo, we are on our trip in Europe and cannot use curling irons, etc. for fear that we will fry them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I would not recommend this product at all. We bought it new for a trip to New Zealand just to have an extra for my husband's laptop. The 3rd time he plugged it in, we went out for a bite to eat and came back to find our hotel room smoky and smelling like an electrical fire. The converter literally melted; we had to use the ice tongs to pick it up. Imagine if we'd stayed out with friends! I'm buying another Franz. Had mine for years and never had a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"used in Germany...room started to smell, then heard a pop and converter smoked. Threw away. Be careful. read reviews and buy another brand"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY, WILL MELT!!!","review":"I purchased this product in July 2008. One trip to London was successful with this product using various items - following the directions.December 2008, my second trip to London, I awoke in the middle of the night to the smell of burning plastic. The device was melting as it was plugged into the wall. The plastic smell was overwhelming and caused a stir at the hotel. I had to remove the unit with a towel, and once removed, I realzed it was so hot the thick plastic was very pliable. The wall and outlet were hot.Needless to say I strongly advise you to NOT purchase this product - spend a little more money and buy something reliable - protect yourself and your property. THIS IS NOT SAFE.Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fry your hair with this.","review":"Bought this based on another review. What a mistake! First the storage box did not stay closed from the begaining. It worked fine for charging the cell phone and camera batteries. It made my wife's flat iron so.... hot it fryed her hair and blew up her $100.00 flat iron. The box says for curling irons. My wife has used another brand and never had a problem. The only reason we bought a new one is she dropped the old one and it broke.Think twice before buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Converter fire!!!!!","review":"DANGER!!!!Mine too smoked after getting too hot in a few minutes and tripped all the fuses in my room in the UK...Throw it away if you have one and get something that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"foreign electrical plug adaptors","review":"The main one doesn't project far enough to fit into european sockets.

I am glad that we stayed in the room. I fear the circumstance would have been worse had we wondered out to look around. I have no plans to return it. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down Again","review":"The power travel kit is entirely too heavy. I would not want to include it in my baggage weight. And I probably can't put it in my carry on. Also, the lid does not stay closed, causing the adapters to fall out. I will not be taking it on this trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I remembered!!!!","review":"I bought this so my children could watch a good cartoon, and this is one both my husband and I just love. We have a hd tv, and an hd blueray/dvd combo player. Its looks great.

I think it looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome enough said","review":"LOve this show since i was a kid an many many more shows that were going on tv at the time now i should tell u that living in sweden during my childhood and loving this type of cartoon was hard not only did they dub this to language they also did not show every episode.Now I want to have the rest of dvds of gummi bears vol. 2 season 4-6. im 30 to day and still in love with the cartoon shows from the 80's and 90's the are the best but ofc there are a few from 2000 an up 08 that are good.But really the cartoons today shown on tv my god they suck so hard i will never let my child see any of that im only gonna show the classics from my time, i mean even my father loves gummi bears an can still watch them today"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Gummi Bears, Horrible quality","review":"I'm not going to say much about the Gummi Bears that hasn't been said before. It's a great show and a lot of fun for the kids (and adults too). However the quality of these DVD's is terrible. More accurately it is completely unacceptable and if I had known it was this bad, I would never have bought the pack.The content has been massively compressed in order to squeeze 47 episodes onto 3 discs. With the low cost of DVD's I think 5 or 6 discs would have been in order.The compression is far worse than what you might see from your cable or satellite provider. I have never complained about the compression on a set of DVD's so this should be an indication of how bad it is. I still don't believe this is from Disney!Buy this if you're desperate, but if you don't enjoy watching shows with horrible, distracting artifacts in the picture, avoid this at all costs.Come on Disney, do the right thing and fix this set up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Cartoon","review":"My kids love this cartoon. So glad that they can watch a cartoon that my husband and I grew up watching! Package came all sealed up and in perfect condition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitement over the release","review":"I have to admit that I was very excited the second I saw the DVDs. I had originally been looking for some Care Bears movies for my two daughters (age 2 and 1) because I had remembered enjoying them. But the second I saw the Gummi Bears DVD, all looking for the Care Bears stopped. I had always enjoyed the Gummi Bears more than the Care Bears when I was little. And it appears that my daughters enjoy the Gummi Bears greatly, as does my husband (who didn't see it when it was on TV) with the subtle adult humor of Duke Igthorn.I really hope that Disney puts out the last three seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This was just as wonderful as I remembered from when I was a kid.

The fact that you get 3 seasons in a little set is also great. Very good quality picture considering it is from the 80's. I have been waiting for years for Disney to put these out, no fan fair like they give there movie releases but I am happy. Nice hearing my kids singing the theme song."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Video Quality Stinks to an otherwise Great Cartoon","review":"I was very excited that Disney finally released an 80s cartoon treasure.
