Ohh how the mighty have fallen. The songs sound like they were thrown together over a weekend, and the lack of any new material is frustrating to say the least.Of course, most people who bought it on the shelves probably didn't even realize that the original members of the band are long gone. James Young, the last \\"original\\" member of the band is all that is left. Dennis DeYoung is gone, the Panazzo brothers (one has passed away, the other is only a \\"sometimes\\" member) are missing, and the member Tommy Shaw replaced (yes, he was NOT an original member) John Curlewski passed away a long time ago.

I can't decide if Styx is turning into just a poor covers band or really need money. The musicianship is good, but the vocals and arrangements are poor.

How hard up are these guys now that Dennis DeYoung is out of the band? Unlike the previous poster, I have actually listened to Big Bang Theory and if you like listening to poor imitations of the real thing, this is your CD. It is painfully obvious that these guys have no creative juice left in them - I mean they have now put out a half dozen live albums, 4-5 re-released packages, and now they put out an album of cover tunes - including covering one of their own (the much overrated \\"Blue Collar Man\\" which these guys refuse to let die - even though it didn't even crack the top 20 when it was out in 1978. If you doubt this, look how many times it appears on \\"Arch Allies\\" with REO Speedwagon).

Lawrence Gowan sings the songs of Dennis, but he doesn't sings good at all. But now about this album: it sucks big time. It is a cover album, that could be nice sometimes, but they really played bad here. I guess I was right, Styx is nothing without Dennis. They don't have any originality anymore. Don't buy this!

Instead, there's a short interview with every member of IM talking about their past performance at Donnington and how excited they are about playing in '92. You won't learn anything new or interesting.There are also interviews with some other participants in Donnington '92, such as Megadeth, Dio, WASP, a couple more. There are also a couple of videos.

For example, the formula that it gives for calculating the number of permutations of a set of objects (which it strongly suggests that you memorize!) is just plain incorrect. There are also errors in a number of the sample math problems; for example, in a sample problem concerning standard deviations, the demonstration of solving the problem starts off by saying \\"since you know that there are 100 fish...\\", but nowhere was that stated in the problem.If you're a math whiz already, and can spot and work around these errors, this is a great book for giving you an overall test strategy. If you're trying to learn the math from this book, though, beware... If it weren't for the math errors, I would give this book 4 or 5 stars; however, such errors in a test prep book are unforgiveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but with some disappointment","review":"I bought this set of audio CD's for my wife so that we could listen to them while traveling in the car.

Outside of her face, there was not one redeeming quality about Lucy. Percey, while homely, is a very nice man, who Lucy ends up caring for but why would he care for her? There was not one scene in the book where they have any interaction that would lend itself to love. The book is is not a plus for women if all they need to be is beautiful.

These songs along with \\"You Say You Love Me\\" and \\"Am I The Kind Of Man\\" are the strongest songs on this release.

You get to know every one of the players."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mess Continues","review":"With such a horrible first book in the trilogy, the Dawning of a New Age, my expectations for the second, Day of the Tempest were very close to as low as you can go. In that, I wasn't disappointed.Why read the second if the first was so bad, you ask? I had bought Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's 2001 return to Krynn, The War of Souls Trilogy, this past summer. I noticed that events and characters from other Dragonlance franchise books were making an appearance in Weis and Hickman's new trilogy. So, after a 17 year absence, I travelled back to the world of Krynn to explore.Even as a simple rest stop on the roads of Krynn's history, The Day of the Tempest is something that could be skipped for the next exit farther down the highway. There is no improvement in the awful, nearly nonsensical plot, characters, and descriptions. And it won't get any better in the third book of the trilogy, The Eve of the Maelstrom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair, But Fun","review":"I was excited that new DragonLance books were coming out, so I instantly bought the new books.

I can get behind Malystryx, destroy things. not much else about it. Khellendros is a little more complex, not much though, and I think the heroesare pitiful. They have no real backround, and the backround they give is always contridicting the ones revealed. This book shows no comparrison, what so ever to other dragonlance novels, like The Legend Of Huma (5 Stars). The best part of the novel was the dragons but I cant even say they were too well thought up or portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt at a Dragonlance book","review":"This book was a little better than the first in the series. However, it was awful. Its too far fetched even for a fantasy, and especially for trying to be a Dragonlance fantasy. I dont see how Palin can teleport himself or others so easily when his uncle Rastlin was the greatist sorcerer of all time and it nearly killed him when he did it.... that is so lame. Palin seems to be this super powerful mage even though he lost his magic. Also, they keep reffering to the lance Rig carries as \\"Sturm's Lance\\" and we all know Sturm never used a lance, he used his fathers sword and NEVER learned to use a lance (read chronicles vol. 2, Jean Rabe). These errors and other make this book hard to read.I would not reccomend this book to those who just want a fantasy adventure to read, but us die-hard dragonlancers have to read it because it is part of the overall series of books in the Dragonlance timeline, which is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Very, very disappointing. Admittedly, I hadn't expected much after the first book. But in this volume the characters are poor, the story weak and the style lacking. Jean Rabe abuses Margaret Weis' and Tracy Hickman's once near-perfect characters to the point where Palin, Goldmoon and Gilthanas are changed beyond recognition. There is no flow to events, everything is told matter-of-factedly without and time spent on those little details that are so crucial. Emotion is lacking and all the characters' personalities are somehow the same. Factor in an unrealistic and unconvincing plot and this ends up a very disappointing Dragonlance novel. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman COME BACK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"i thought after the first book that this would be a very bad book to read, but i urged myself on, i picked it up and withing 2 sentances i was hooked, i didnt put it down for about 23 hours, got an hour of sleep and started up again, i think Jean Rabe rights Palin the best, and then with the addition of Dhamon, i think this to be the best book in the Fifth Age. ThE series itself is awesome, but this books ties it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still awful.","review":"The characters are still two-dimensional, the plot is still go-to-sleep material, and the Great Dragons still seem as dumb as ever. One would wonder how they ever got beyond hatchlings with intelligence levels like that. Rabe just doesn't hit it at all. There's no sense of tragedy or loss, and the heroes don't really seem to have a place in the world. Rabe seems to concentrate on the 'Great Cosmic Struggle' rather than what motivates the characters who're making the story. There's also too much focus on the Evil characters (the dragons). Entire sections of the plot, which could have been artfully hidden and hinted at until finally being revealed, are thrown at the reader from the outset, and all that's left to see is how the heroes are going to thwart their foes. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isnt good","review":"Jean Rabe just does not hit it off. Margaret Weis is superior to Jean Rabe. Her characters have no personality what so ever.

Apparently there must be a lot of variance in the degree of heat treatment if any as some claim it cuts 1 inch trees.

I have registered to send it back for the handle recall, but really don't use it as my \\"go to\\" camp saw, so wasn't in the target recall group. The tang situation is distressing though. I cannot see how they would be so concerned about handle slippage and not take the opportunity to address the ridiculous lever stress point they have created in the front of the handle. The Gerber recall hotline says replacement has a modified handle, lanyard addition, \\"and other safety modifications\\". Has anyone received their replacement Gator and disassembled? You can buy a full tang machete on Amazon for $7.99 today, so Gerber deserves the reputation hit if they dont lengthen the tang while they have the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sharp at all","review":"I've seen $5 machetes that were far sharper than this. I've bought many items from Gerber and I've been happy with all of them. I was extremely disappointed with this one. It's a joke in fact. It wouldn't cut weeds consistently much less brush. I have a cheap machete that I've been using for years to keep my ATV trails clear around my property. I was hoping for a machete that would hold an edge longer. I got one that won't take an edge at all. Don't waste your money here.

It's just too long. I've used it to chop down a 1ft in diameter tree without too much time or effort spent. It does everything you want a machete to do, at a great price, with an excellent grip and a good scabbard. What more could you ask for? Even with its long size it's not unwieldy, I just should have gotten the Jr. I should mention that the saw-back works well, but you really shouldn't need it; the blade excels at chopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd movies","review":"Timely delivery.

My personal favorite in here (originally the sole reason why I got this CD) was so I could listen to \\"Lady Marmalade\\"...each one has their own opinions..likes and dislikes, yet I don't think it's fair to hammer them down to the ground in any instant. The All Saints have undeniably got talent. They are not just pretty girls. They do come up with good stuff and they are well orchestrated, and have a musical notion, unlike many bands out there. Let's hope to God they don't turn out to be a second coming of the Spice Girls and finish up like their predecessors did. All Saints is a commercial band, of that there is no doubt. Let's just hope that their success doesn't go up to their heads and boost their egos.

Unless you're a fan of mindless, corporate product pop drivel deviod of heart (in which case you can disregard most of this review), if you own this you probably bought this for the same reason I did---the soulful single \\"Never Ever.\\" If you haven't bought it yet, save your money and just get the single. The rest of the album really isn't worth mentioning. At all. What really gets me about this whole thing though, is that these girls really do have talent, and when given the right sort of songs, can sing with a lot of heart and soul. It's a tragic waste.

I like the songs \\"I Know Where Its At\\" and \\"Under the Bridge\\". My biggest problem is when the group tries to insert rap into their songs. Rap is OK if its done right but in this case it isn't. The album as a whole sounds as if the group is trying to imitate a musical sound that isn't theirs. This gives most of the songs a sense of psedo rhythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure pleasure","review":"You can argue about whether this is truly a \\"best of\\" but to my ears that's nitpicking. The music on this collection is fabulous; sheer guitar-pop brilliance. Effervescent tunes that put you in a good mood and remind you of blissful days gone by.

Another 80s band that deserved to be much, much bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on Visual FoxPro - it covers everything!","review":"I've recently taken on a project to maintain and enhance an existing FoxPro application. After buying and reading many different books on FoxPro, I have to say this is the best and most comprehensive. Even though the current version of FoxPro is version 9 and this book applies to version 6, it is still relevant. If you are learning FoxPro and are somewhat skilled in other development tools this is the only book you will need. I wish I knew that up front. Unfortunately, the book is out of print and the price for a used copy is quite high. But it is worth it!I like Whil Hentzen's writing style. His books are very readable compared to some technical authors. For me as someone new to FoxPro, this book just plain works and provided the information I needed. The title is accurate; this book covers the fundamentals and does it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst programming book I read","review":"I had experience in many different computer languages and I would like to learn Foxpro since job's need. I bought this book and felt very disappointment. Computer language and programmin is a skill and does not have very deep theory with it.

Most of them are no useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Big Bird shut up please?","review":"This movie is alright as far as the story goes. I never saw the week long video that another reviewer spoke of so I didn't miss anything. I also liked that they talk rationally of things that happen in a hurricane and hurricane preparedness given that we live in a hurricane prone area.However, listening to Big Bird whine through the whole movie is unbelievably annoying. I don't really like Big Bird usually because all he ever does is whine, but I can usually ignore him. But this movie takes place around Big Birds experience during the hurricane, so it's kind of hard to ignore him.I think there are plenty of other Sesame Street movies that I would buy over this one. In fact, I would buy ANY OTHER Sesame Street video over this one because of Big Birds whining.

I have to admit that the whole time I was reading it I kept thinking to myself I bet Bob Dylan read this book. A lot of the names and imagery was reminiscent of the lyrics of Dylan. Since Patchen came first it stands to reason that he bore an influence on Bob Dylan. It is a very enjoyable read for anyone that likes surrealic prose. Patchen was always an outstanding poet and this book more than reveals his gift for writing prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smut","review":"OK, I want to be the first to review this book with the cavaet that I haven't read it in twenty years because it has probably been out of print about that long, and I lost my copy, and I haven't been able to find another. This book is a wonderful satire on the odious subject of literary censorship. Patchen's technique was to blank out about every fourth word of the story line. Whether we admit it or not, we all have dirty minds and are perfectly capable of filling in the blanks. Patchen's marvelous evocation of the human sexual imagination makes this one of the funniest and filthiest books I have ever read.

The Chilton 1994-1998 Manual is far more precise, the pictures are much, much, better, the Exploded View drawings (missing from the Haynes manual) are great.

It states that \\"the Founding Father's of America were terrorists in the same vein as Bin Laden.\\" My professor wanted us to write that on a test, I stood up to him because I had friends over in Iraq and Afghanistan at the time who were being shot at, he failed me and killed my dreams of going to Stanford, all because of this stupid book. So much for the American Dream. I seldom leave reviews but with this particular book it is definitely warranted, the above good reviews were probably written by teachers themselves or friends of the authors, in which case they should be fully disregarded. I read it, don't waste your one cent it's going for on Amazon. It's ridiculous extremist propaganda, like 9/11 Truth conspiracies. Go read a real book written by an actual war correspondent or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primary book on Israel","review":"This book was bought along with another one, Countries of the World, Israel. That one is just by Fisher who co-authored this book, Welcome to My Country, Israel. I felt like this should have additional information since it was published in 2001 and there have been recent disturbances in Israel which began last fall. Unfortunately, it does not. The writing is larger and in simpler text. The material covered is less than half which was very disappointing. The photos in both are the same for the articles included. The only differences were the glossary, more books to read, videos and web sites listed. It might be a good book to use as a text for second graders, but I felt it to be deficient in comparison to the other book which is only a few dollars different in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Met Fan Should Read This Book...","review":"An excellent overview of the 1986 World Series champion New York Mets baseball team by first baseman and first-time author Keith Hernandez. He describes in detail the entire season, breaking it down game by game, citing the intricacies of each contest, leading to either victory or defeat. Hernandez also tells of personal happenings of his teammates, (i.e: young pitching phenom Dwight Gooden, and how he was able to manhandle each team he faced, and how he handled his newfound success emotionally.)and how Keith corrected himself during slumps. He also writes of how his good friend, Ed Lynch was traded away from the playoff contention Mets to the dismal Chicago Cubs. (which was especially traumatic for Lynch.) Information like this makes \\"If at First...\\" an excellent look at the grueling physical and emotional taxes pro athletes must endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about another Keith","review":"I have to preface this review by saying I am a HUGE Keith Hernandez fan, so this will be biased.My only issue with this book is that it is about the 85 season and not the 86. I thought the book was informative, and written in a diary format. I believe Hernandez said that his goal was to make the book from the onset of the season, so it makes sense that it goes on from the daily grind of a baseball season. It is a nice look at what a superstar goes through during a season and i am sure he would have liked not having to go before the grand jury about the cocaine use. I would have liked to hear more about the partying and rock star lifestyle of those Mets.It's a shame they didn't bring home more titles. But, if you're a fan of Keith, or baseball in general this is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable & attractive, but stretches out quickly","review":"I bought these shoes a year ago, in two different colors. They were very comfortable and they...looked...HOT. The only problem was that the leather upper quickly stretched out, on both pair, allowing my feet to slide forward and over the end of the shoe by an inch! That doesn't look good, I can tell you. I'm not sure if I bought a 1/2 size smaller that it would have even made a difference.Overall, it was wasted money because I cannot wear either pair now."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful movie!","review":"I think what's most marvelous about Tulpan is how it communicates hope, even when life is hard and disappointing. This is one of those movies that's not about any one thing so much as it is about our human condition. The canvas feels big because what is small is taken seriously. The movie is a bit of a soup: pastoral comedy with a light seasoning of tragedy as well as some hints of epic. In my personal top ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerogarden kit","review":"Ipurchased the kit on line and it took three weeks plus to receive it. After completely assembling and getting it ready to go, I plugged it in and the one grow bulb burned out. Thinking well I have everything ready to go - so I have to get it started. I called the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store and fortunately they had the replacement bulbs. After returning from the store, I tried to insert the bulbs but they did not fit securely into the sockets. The next day after multiple attempts to reach customer service, I received no assistance from them at all. They were not only not helpful but rude. So I packaged everything up and returned the unit.

The first thing that struck me is just how funky Letters from Chutney is. Featuring many bottom-heavy riffs so much a part of Finger 11's later sound, there is a surprising number of wah-pedals and syncopated rhythms. The formula works really well, making for songs that are just as danceable as they are moshable. The performance is solid and stands as a testament to just how talented a band they are.Think of it as party Finger 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really like the concept..........","review":"This dvd has 3 workouts each based on the doshas (pitta, vata, kapha). Since everyone is a bit different and your energy fluctuates, the idea of having different workouts to fit is great. I bought this dvd because of the concept. I viewed it and have never done it. The biggest reason for this was that the editing and cueing were flawed and I have so many wonderful yoga dvd's I just couldn't waste my time with this one. I didn't find the workouts to be as comprehensive as I like either. Also I can't really recommend this for real beginner's as the instruction is not adequate.The setting is nice with beautiful colors, but is diminished by the home movie feel which is mostly due to the editing. On the plus side there are some unusual postures not found on other dvd's that may be a good change of pace. She also incorporates some chanting which is nice. I would recommend checking this one out at the library first to see if you like it before paying for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite Yoga DVD","review":"I have been using this DVD for years and I LOVE it! There are four different workouts, about 20 minutes each. You can do one or any combination of them. It is beautifully recorded, the music is great, and the actual yoga is not dumbed down , nor is it so complicated that a normal human cannot do it. It is challenging, yet accessible. The combination of yoga and aryuveda is phenomenal! Go online and find out your dosha before you workout for the best personal balance. The section of the dvd on aryuvedic living is truly informative and inspired me to try new beneficial therapies.

However, if your sermon is interesting and funny and speaks to the world people see and understand, then people listening to it (or reading your fables) will not mind a little preaching. Aesop understood this, as did Jesus. I'm not so certain Arnold Lobel does. While he has a nice idea, the stories in this collection are dry and preachy and the only truly great part of the book is the wonderful illustrations, which are humorous and interesting, everything his fables aren't.

I noticed that the quality of the prints were very inferior to those taken by my friend's Nikkon Coolpix 3.2 mega pixel model. In addition, it was very hard to find a place to develop pictures, as most novice camera stores (and even some professional ones!) did not have machines that were compatible with the XD card (which by the way, costs almost double what any other memory card would cost).I accidentally dropped the camera once, and the LCD screen broke, and it no longer displayed images. Soon thereafter, the zoom broke, and the lens got stuck on the exterior of the camera. I threw it out, and got a Kodak EasyShare CX6330, which while not as aesthetically pleasing, takes much better pictures, and is far sturdier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera For The Price!","review":"I bought this camera after researching for a good digital camera that was inexpensive.

It kept re-checking itself. If there was a connection, it would only last for three minutes to be exact. The desktop would not work when the laptop was in use during the three minutes.

It is highly unreliable. Technical support is terrible. Documentation is worse.If you plan on using any laptops that have been built in the last year, forget about it.

Specifically, the playing was lackluster as the band flamed out. After all, Steve Windwood was brought in (Blind Faith) to instill new life. Jack Bruce would have none of it and so that was the end of Cream. THis was still a band that on an off night was still redefining the sound of guitar rock along with Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and the Who, and shortly Led Zeppelin.

Jack Bruce is truly a lead guitar player who can play bass like a guitar. It's amazing! And, what can you say about a drummer like Ginger Baker.

The weird shape makes it hard to grip and if you aren't using the flash youre pictures get fuzzy. The worst part about this camera is the software. It takes up a chunk of your hard drive but bassically only crops your photos. I suggest getting Adobe Photoshop for digital cameras, you can download it off of Kazaa. The memory card is cool but it only comes with a 16 MB card which only stores about 8 photos. This camera EATS batteries for breakfast, I had to get rechargables. After all of the accessories you need to buy are added on to the total price it comes out to around $ dolars. Get a canon or olympus, they're much better quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability","review":"I had this camera for less than 2 years and used it only on rare occasions - you know, holidays and special events - so it has pretty low usage. Yet it has decided not to work. It turns on foe a second or two (with brand new batteries) then shuts itself off. Rearranging batteries and resetting factory default settings no help.

Like many things that seem too good to be true, it was. Almost exactly a year after purchase, in which it was used sparingly, the camera went dead - it just would not turn on. By the time I got it to a repair center, the 1 year warranty period was over. The estimated repair cost including tax is $150 - I can get a decent new 3.2 MP camera for that price these days.While it lasted, it took decent photos. The 6x zoom which was a big selling point of the camera was fairly useful. Focusing in low light was difficult. Overall it felt too light and plasticky. With the breakdown, I'll never buy a Fuji again."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe I am just too amature but I think this camera stinks","review":"I love to take pictures. But after buying this camera I find it to be a big hassel. All my pictures turn out dark, whether I am indoors and I am using the flash, or if I am outdoors on a sunny day. I have to edit all my pictures and make them brighter. Another problem I found is it takes the picture too slow. I have several pictures of my dog that are blurred because of movement. I even went out to dinner with a bunch of friends and was so frustated with the quality of picture it was taking that I stopped taking pictures (which is odd for me since I normally and the picture taking freak of the group). I had previously purchased a Kodak Easyshare 4 MP Digital Camera and returned it so that I could buy a camera with a better optical zoom. I wish I would of kept that camera it worked so much better then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great camera.","review":"First of all the camera is extremely easy to use. I think I spent about 5 minutes with the directions before I was off taking pictures. You will need to get a larger memory card if you plan on taking this on trips. I am using a 128mb card right now and I have yet to fill it up! Battery life is great. The only downside has been mentioned in other reviews. The electronic viewfinder goes black in low light conditions. So if you are taking flash photos in the dark you have to wing it. For 99% of the pictures you take this will not be a problem. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get into digital photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't turn on after 2 1/2 years.","review":"I wish I had access to the more recent reviews on this camera.

However, if you are like most folks who often take pictures on overcast days or need to use a flash in low-light conditions - forget this camera! On overcast days, the camera often indicates that there is too little light for hand-held pictures. And when it is dark enough to warrent using the flash, the camera's auto-focus can't operate, resulting in brighly illuminated out-of-focus photos. A call to Fuji technical support about this problem was a waste of time.

Either you use the flash or you have broad daylight. Anything less and the camera refuses to focus.The shutter speed is slow. The Sony digital I have used has a quick and responsive shutter. This thing takes the picture at least a second or two after you press the button. You also have to wait a couple of seconds before you can take another. If you want to take a picture quickly or something not posed and the target is holding absolutly still, then this is not the camera for you.Since the shutter speed is so low, you have to hold it absolutly still. If not, you will get blurry pictures. (Even more so in low light.)If you are taking pictures outdoors with subjects that don't move, then this is the camera for you. Otherwise look at something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks dont buy this junk","review":"Even after telling my brother about the issues i had with 2800 my brother bought this 3800 for me.

However, after using it for a time, it has been very possibly a nearly useless camera. The autofocus is poor at best, the movie is only 320x240 max, and less than 30fps.There is also a considerable delay in taking pictures, as the autofocus has a meeting someplace inside the camera to discuss if there is any point in focusing on anything in particular!There are many better choices, not to mention the Finepix S7000!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the camera! Not the packaging.","review":"This camera is great. I got it for closeups of tiny items like beads. Works great. Lightweight too.

I'm surprised that it arrived in one piece. Other than that, I am extremely happy with the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I got this camera a couple of years ago for my birthday. It worked great for about two years and then it just went dead! It wouldn't power on at all no matter what we did (fresh batteries, etc.) I took it to a camera repair shop and they said that it would cost more to fix it (if they could even do that) than to buy a new one.

Now I will DEFINATELY NOT be buying another like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Finepix just died too","review":"The same as the above posters, our camera just died...I think fujifilm should recall this camera due to it just stopping to work.

I liked the audio with video feature, design, ease of use and reasonable quality of pictures, though it was always super sensitive to movement and many pictures blurred. During this time, I easily shot over 4000 pictures. It began to flake out sometime last summer or autumn with the black screen described by many others and now it just refuses to turn on.I don't think that I will purchase a Fuji again, for a while at least, but purchase a Canon next.Note that I still have a Pentax SLR 35-mm camera that I bought in the 1970s, which cost about $400 at the time. It has travelled / backpacked through Europe, Africa, Tibet and China as well as the US Sierras and Rockies and it still works great, when I want to use a film-camera.Will digital cameras ever last as long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fujifilm Finepix 3880 has a short life cycle","review":"I purchased this camera in 2003. It has been stored in a climate controlled environment, within a protective case. It has been used very little - perhaps 100 pictures.

After 18 months the screws backed out of the lens ring inside the camera, shorting out interior circuits. This is a common problem for this camera. Fuji says they will fix it for $118.25.

I was advised that the cost of repair wasn't worth it and in the long run it's more cost effective just to buy a new camera.Call me crazy but, I think a camera in the price range of $300 and up, should last more that 26 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"it just stopped working","review":"It just stopped working after like 2 years. My previous camera was my father's, that he used for like 20 years. No problems for him or me.I don't believe cameras should just stop working after 2 years.

The Fuji 2600 I bought earlier broke in 3 weeks and the one Fuji replaced it with -guess what??? broke again in a week.Anyways, I just love this camera. The 6 optical zoom and 3.2 MPis matchless with the price tag it carries. Plus the pictures turn out as sharp as any other 3.2 camera's.But...It seems to me that for some lighting conditions the auto function has problems focusing on objects indoors. Even though you use the \\"focus-click\\" (that is pressing the button halfway while pointing at the object to secure it is the center of focus)pictures sometimes turn out blurry.One other inconvenience is that the camera is cumbersome.

We just watched it all at home tonight. Fantastic! I was never 'into' Orbison in my youth when he was first popular, but after watching this cd I have to recognize him as one of the greatest. What an amazing, unusual, voice. You feel as if it is going to 'crack' at any moment from those long, high notes, but never does--it's always perfectly controlled. As if Orbison doing Orbison's great repertoire wasn't enough, the \\"Friends\\" doing backup for Orbison doing all his great songs are, among others: a young Bruce Springsteen [looking star struck the whole night b/c he was playing with Orbison], Jackson Brown, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, with Bonnie Raitt, k.d. Laing, and Jennifer Warnes doing the female backup vocals. The Orbison/Springseen duo on \\"Sweet Dreams\\" alone would be worth the price of the album but all the songs are great. Play it in SurroundSound if you have it--can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master Writer,Performer, and Vocalist","review":"I confess to having the CD soundtrack to this most special of performances and it laid around for more than a few years, like a stored piece of jewelery-which it is.The LEGENDARY Roy Orbison - live at the Cocoanut Grove in 1987 with big name music stars supposedly helping the man who didn't need any.When one views the DVD you are mesmerized by Roy's voice and ease of performance.The full on string section and six person vocalist backups( all music stars)add such splendor to this wonderful salute to Roy's life and music career.Springsteen et al seem to be admiring the MASTER rather than contributing to an already perfect base nucleus of Orbison sound.Only The Lonely, Crying, Blue Bayou, Oh Pretty Woman and the deliriously rich rendition of DOWN THE LINE just draw out such emotion from one's soul that evoke pure bittersweet memories of life and love.Roy Orbison spoke very little in this concert- but his aura was at full volume.He still is THE BEST..."},{"rating":"2","title":"hypnotic at times","review":"Wonderful collaboration of musicians and singers. All his hits are here, 'only the lonely', 'dream baby', 'blue bayou', 'running scared', 'in dreams', 'crying', 'it's over', 'pretty woman' etc. You can see the admiration from the crowd and people on stage for this legend. This dvd was a beautiful gift to his fans before his death. The black and white was a nice touch as it gives the concert a nostalgia look. The performers contribute nicely to the concert but allow Orbison to be centre stage. Roy's music timing is flawless. Thought I might get sick of hearing 'pretty woman' after so many times but I was wrong, this live version gave it life. The only problem I had was I found the dvd a little expensive ($34. Cdn), but shop around. This dvd is still worth it. The sound is unbelievable. Get this dvd and let the violins, his words and voice melt your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give it six stars if I could","review":"Try as I may to be original I find myself wanting to repeat all the same things that have already been said in other five star reviews. I won't waste your time doing that except to say they got it right. This is my absolute favorite and most watched dvd of a rather extensive collection. In the last week alone, four different guests have bought this dvd the day after watching it in my home the previous evening. Roy Orbison is timeless and so is this dvd. This is a must own dvd if ever there was one. It even made me appreciate Bruce Springsteen as a musician (no small accomplishment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video, but....","review":"DVD set was as advertised.

Any help would be appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACK AND WHITE SEEMS LIKE COLOR....","review":"The black and white effect in the video is cool, but to me it is still a colorful performance by Roy and his great band that includes several other superstars such as Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, and Elvis Costello. Roy is in great voice and the band plays excellently. Roy's music may seem old to some people and this performance caught live is nearly 20 years old, too. I never got a chance to see a live Orbison show so I think this DVD is about as good as it's going to get for replacing an actual show. It shows why Roy is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy's last among his best","review":"Roy Orbison's Black and White Night is simply one of the best live concert DVD's anywhere.

Not only did Roy shine throughout the show but, he also shed a big spotlight on his guest musicians. His closing number,\\"Oh Pretty Woman\\", was a complete knockout. He let Bruce Springsteen, James Burton, Elvis Costello and all the rest have a first class jam session on this number. My family and I loved every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this...","review":"I grew up listening to Roy Orbison as a teenager. I know why digital big screens and DTS and Dolby were created - for movies yes - but also for live concerts that you could not possibly attend. The video transfer, although in black & white is superb. The audio portion will test your home theater system as no other, whether you choose DD-5.1 or DTS. Personally, I prefer the DTS version, nonetheless an outstanding audio/video composition. Roy Orbison is the man, he will always be the man.

Another strong case for DTS vs THX or any other format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is unequivocally the best concert DVD ever produced and I was not a huge fan of Orbison to begin with.

Buy at least two of these and stash one away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing audio experience","review":"I must say this is one of the best sounding recordings I have ever listened to on my system. The SACD mix sounds very natural and open, with the crowd in the rear along with some of the instruments and background vocals, you have the feeling of sitting in the middle of the crowd listening to this performance. This is how a live recording should sound. If the record companies would start producing more surround releases on BluRay that sound this good the surround and physical disc formats could have a huge breath of new life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy Orbison black & white night","review":"The video is great but the sound really knocked me out.

It was truly a great concert.Thanks Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed (slightly) masterpiece","review":"Roy Orbison was wonderful, as usual. One of the greatest voices in Rock n' Roll and Elvis Presley's favorite singer. I did think, however, that Bruce Springsteen hammed it up too much in his portion of the concert and ruined the experience. He seems to crave the spotlight so much he wouldn't let the light shine on Roy. Bruce is a good performer, but I don't think he is in the same league as Roy. I'm sure others would disagree. Wish he had sat this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight for eyes and ears","review":"I first saw this on PBS and loved it. It's even better when not interrupted by fund-raising appeals.This \\"concert\\" is recorded raw and blemished giving you the feeling of being there; people walk in front of the camera and stage hands are busy in plain view. It is produced in black and white, which enhances the smoke-filled-room atmosphere. The music and the experience is extraordinary.I haven't yet found out how to listen the the Audio DVD that comes with this package -- it doesn't play on anything I own. But this show needs to be witnessed to be best enjoyed, so the Video DVD is worth the price.Mine is truly a five star recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROY ORBISON, A BLACK AND WHITE NIGHT","review":"A TRULY MAGNIFICENT CONCERT.

I was lucky enough to see him live in concert at a smaller venue (Westbury Music Fair) not too long before he died. I have been to hundreds of concerts, and while I enjoyed them all, this was the only one where I stood after EVERY song to show my admiration. Standing O's are all too common--but each song literally brought me to tears with it's presentation. This DVD literally re-creates the concert I saw, and has the added benefit of an all-star band worthy of Roy's greatness. It is the best and most cherished in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy Orbison-Black & White Night","review":"This is a great DVD filmed the year before Roy Orbison died.

The music and musicianship is absolutely amazing.He was already a legend when he recorded this concert, and I wondered how passionate he could be about music he's probably sung a thousand times. No worries, he still felt it. I dare you not to be moved when he starts singing \\"Crying\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy The Boy","review":"In another entry in this space I have reviewed Roy Orbison's In Dreams that is a more \`talking heads' approach to his life and music. And that too has its merits. However, when we talk of Roy Orbison then the music is what we really want to deal with. And here one gets all the Roy the Boy one wants, and more. Backed by the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Jackson Browne Roy goes through a litany of his greatest hits from Claudette to Pretty Woman.But wait, what about the back up singers that were mandatory to late 1950's rock music. Well, how about k.d. Lang, Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Warnes. Well, not bad for backup, right? That tells you exactly what you are getting here. The best. Plus a bonus, bonus in some very, very fine licks by T-bone Burnett. Outstanding here are Sweet Dreams, Baby (with Springsteen on lead vocals along with Roy) and the finale Pretty Woman (with an incredible series of riffs by all the guitarists). Yes, Sweet Dreams Baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very best concert","review":"I'll be 70 in two weeks and this is,without a doubt, the BEST show I've ever seen !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VERY BEST OF ROY ORBISON","review":"THIS ALBUM IS I FEEL THE \\"BEST OF ROY ORBISON\\".

My memories of Orbison go back to when I was 6 or 7 I can remember my dad sitting in his favorite recliner, rocking me to sleep listening to Elvis and Orbison. They have become 2 of my favorite artists of all time. Sure I still enjoy music today, but one would be hard pressed to find a talen like Orbison. My fiancee bought me the DVD for Christmas and I turn it on every night before I go to bed and listen to \\"only the Lonely\\" and \\"Crying\\" Even my fiancee, who is one of the many at her age, who listen to rap adn alternative music mostly commented to me that she really liked it. Finally to make it complete, is the fact that the DVD has DTS enabled sound. It sounds great in just stereo, but when you turn it to DTS sound on a surround sound system. It is just amazing.

Now, of course, with that line up one would hardly think that there would be a mistake. So we might not know what happened during the filming, afterwards or, in this case, how much happened afterwards.Yes, the sound was great but all films go in for a mix and one would hope that the director and music producer would take the time needed to make this one sound good.So yes it was/is a historic film but it does, at least for me, raise a few questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one music DVD this year","review":"If you only buy one music DVD this year, this is <b>the</b> one to buy.

It was in the top 5 I've seen in a lifetime (with my range of interests there have been others, such as a Mahlar's Symphony of a Thousand, The Highwaymen, Jazz at the Philharmonic, etc. that reached a peak of their own form).

This is in black and white and it never looked better than on this blu ray. THe dvd had more extras but this one sound and picture quality trump that hands down. The songs are ultra classics and roy died way too soon. After all he was in the travelling wilburys\\" right before his death too and that had the late great George Harrison in it.

Roy Orbison and this incredible band and chorus of singing legends and musicians, created a concert to be enjoyed for generatrions to come.Music lovers of today's generation may not get it or even like it, but for me, it will always be a favorite.The HDDVD version for me, gives me widescreen version not before available, and that makes it all the better. I'm not sure that the actual video in black and white, plus the fact that many scenes are filmed to make it look old, are improved that much for HD. That being said, just being widescreen makes it worth owning this concert..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Tissues Nearby","review":"I never expected Soaring Eagle to be better than Walks the Fire, but it was! I was totally caught up in the physical and spiritual journey of Soaring Eagle. His struggle to admit his connection to not only white people, but also to Christians, was enthralling. To add even more drama, Whitson has Soaring Eagle interact with Lisbeth's husband in a secondary plotline that will keep you spellbound. Normally I am not an emotional person, and I was actually sobbing out loud by the time that I read the last word of Soaring Eagle. I am a prolific reader of Christian fiction, and Whitson far outclasses her more well-known counterpart Lori Wick. The Prairie Winds and Keepsake Legacies series are likewise far above anything that I have read by Oke, Wick, Glover, or Peart (and I have read them all). My only complaint is that Whitson is not writing them fast enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with incredibly moving and uplifting occurences!","review":"Wow! It's hard to believe that one book of less than 400 pages can have so many great moments with so many of it's characters,and believable ones at that,but the author did an amazing job of doing just that in Soaring Eagle.After suffering so much angst in the first book of this series, 'Walks The Fire',I wasn't even sure if I would be able to get through this series,and I started Soaring Eagle with trepidation,and ended it uplifted and very glad that I had read it.It is amazing how much happens in this book and yet loses absolutely no feeling of connection between all the characters.I believe I will always be in awe of what the author accomplished here.For those who felt the first book(Walks The Fire) had too much sadness to continue with this series,as I almost did.I hope you will give this second book your time. You will be so very glad that you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, ew.","review":"This lip balm is awful. Smells bad, like medicine or something. The consistency is really thick and awful as well.

With some wiggling I could get sound to flow through the device, but cables were too loose to maintain the signal if it were bumped or even after switching to another input.

Now in August, after buying a new cable like the other ones I bought and the switch worked with, the new cable didn't work either and the switch wouldn't hold it, and the ones previously working stopped working.

Technically speaking...","review":"The copy editing on this book is nothing short of stellar, which is not an easy feat these days. In our technologically evolving world, we are so eager to communicate our message that grammar and spelling get overlooked. The rules are barely even considered anymore (use a semicolon? or a period?). And then when the question of a simple rule comes up, we cannot even remember the answer! For example, did you know you are supposed to use \\"me\\"--not \\"I\\"--after a preposition?Ex. He gave the gift to you and me.Substituting \\"I\\" for \\"me\\" violates the rules of grammar. Don't do it.

Obviously the guy put his heart and soul into the book. Also have to give the book credit for presenting alot of theory on chords, progressions, etc. A rhythm guitar book with a CD though should be about the cool grooves themselves. These tracks are definitely NOT that cool. Not worth the money in my opinion (and yes, I have it).

You will pick up some chord theory and ideas. Some chord progressions will stick with you. The playing examples are a bit boring for intermediate and up players - there is a lot more spicy blues rhythm guitar out there. Even a few sharp turnarounds would have breathed some more life into the book. More emphasis on timing and fills would have been great too.This book could have been an astonishing, must have book. I hope he goes back with some help and redoes this book into the masterpiece it could be.I also had tons of ordering problems with this book.

This book will enlarge your arsenal of rhythm playing substantially in the fields of rhythm patterns, chords and voicings. It is nicely demanding and this book will make you a better and more self-confident player when you play with others or for yourself.

When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn't happened since we've owned a power brush. Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health. Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing).

It's so light, that you don't feel it on your neck, and you can \\"click\\" to the next song, so it doesn't matter that it's in an opaque pouch.

All parties involved should have pooled their resources, bought up the rights to it, and made sure this utterly misbegotten project never saw the light of day again.Words fail us in describing the wretchedness of this cynically-conceived, loathesome processed cheese-food music product. \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" destroyed a number of careers; Peter Frampton is still scarcely detectable on radar, and the Bee Gees haven't exactly made a roaring comeback. Aerosmith was probably going through the worst of their druggie fog, and thus inadvertently provided the lone highlight of this album. But there's no excuse that can possibly make George Burns' singing \\"Fixing a Hole\\" right. None."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia isnt what it used to be...","review":"It boggles the mind that people are giving this dog positive reviews. The two best songs( Aerosmith's version of Come Together and Earth, Wind and Fire's remake of Got to Get You into my Life) are certainly available on those group's best of collections. The rest ranges from decent to embarassing.Unless you want a musical record of the film that more or less brought Peter Frampton's career to a skidding halt, you may want to avoid this one. (Side note: the film is even worse than the soundtrack....a disjointed series of sketches to allow the cast to sing the above Beatles numbers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Whoever thought Beatles songs could sound so bad. Ringo has modestly said that Lennon/McCarteny songs were what made the Beatles great. But when you listen to those same songs sound so bad here, you know it was the way they were played by the Beatles that made the great. Don't be so modest, Ringo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming from a thirteen year old daughter","review":"My mom got this CD from my uncle for Christmas about two years ago.

Sure, it's stupid and cheesy, but it's supposed to be. The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton play some really good music. I love the music to this movie, it's really pretty interesting if you listen to it closely.. just listen to the bass in most of the songs, that's pretty cool. Overall I give it 4 stars only because it's not a musical I can listen to THAT much, but it's still great to put on in the car or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget This Ripoff, Buy The Original!","review":"If anybody says this is better than the Beatles' songs, you know they're lying. More tolerable moments include Aeroesmith's rendition of \\"Come Together\\" and Billy Preston's \\"Get Back\\". You feel sorry for Peter Frampton being dragged into this mess, and hearing the disco kings the Bee Gees warble their way through is torture! Barry Gibb singing \\"A Day In The Life\\" is total blasphemy! For your sakes, stay away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I remember when this first came out. I hated it then and upon hearing it again that feeling is reenforced. The only tracks of any merit whatsoever are Aerosmith's rendition of \\"Come Together\\" and EW&F's cover of \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\". This hurt the Bee Gees career and finished off what was left of Frampton's, but by that point both artists had become irrelevant so nobody really paid that much attention anyway. They must have given Sir George Martin and Geoff Emerick a huge chunk of change to try to make this album sound passable. When it comes right down to it, the only way to hear Beatles music is from The Beatles themselves. Covers of their music will, 99% of the time, always sound second rate, at best. So, in short, skip this one and get the real stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as magical as it was in the 70s","review":"this was my introduction to beatles music. it is a product of its day, and was magical at the time it was released, but it certainly didn't hold up well. i guess the bee gees are not the gold standard they once were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band","review":"This CD is wonderful.

I was in the 8th grade, and my music range was very narrow. At the time it consisted of Aerosmith, Nugent, and Styx. I put my 8track player on repeat, and listened to the 4th track over and over again. I loved Aerosmith doing \\"Come Together\\". One day my Uncle came over and asked me who the heck was that doing the Beatles' songs. I said \\"Whose songs?\\". He said ,\\"You've never heard of the Beatles?\\" \\"Should I?\\" He then said, \\"Come spend the weekend with me, your education is about to begin.\\" For the next 3 days, I listened to this group I had barely heard of before, and my world changed. It was like I was in a 10x10 room and somebody opened a window and I noticed for the first time there was a whole universe out there.So, yes, it is very bad, both the album and the movie. But without it, I might not have discovered the greatest music ever produced by anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm fuzzy memories.","review":"I loved the movie and I loved the soundtrack, and always hoped I could replace my 8-Track Version :).

The version of \\"Strawberry Fields \\" by Sandy Farina is hauntingly beautiful, the only other cover version that comes close is that on the 1985 John Denver bootleg \\" Plummet Airlines\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Kill Many Careers In One Bold Stroke","review":"Rarely has there been one album released that was so important. This album is important in the same way that Hiroshima, Jonestown, and Lockerbie are important. The sheer carnage from a tragedy this bad is staggering. Before this album and film, the careers of Peter Frampton, The Bee Gees, and impresario Robert Stigwood were on such a high, they could do no wrong. Then, they did this. Frampton and Stigwood disappeared, and The Bee Gees have never really gotten the magic back. It wasn't punk rock that killed disco... it was this project. Do not buy this CD unless you are giving it as a gift to someone you hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Disc one would not play all the songs without skipping. No visible scratches on disc but recording quality was not acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musical","review":"If you love musicals this is a must have! This is one of the best musical movies ever made, and I don't give this kind of praise lightly. The Bee Gees sing Beatles songs better than The Beatles themselves (forgive me, even though The Beatles were musical geniuses, it is true). Even my youngest (at four years old) is fascinated by this movie and regularly requests to watch it. George Burns narrates and takes you on a pleasant nostalgic trip back in time. With the great array of singers (The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton, Earth Wind and Fire and so many more) you will be singing and dancing along with the whole movie. Then you have the opportunity to try to name all the famous people in the closing song. I bet you can't name them all! Amazing and Highly Recommended.

If you are a Beatles fan avoid this travesty at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true memento from the 70's","review":"This album was a gift to my dad's from my mother on their wedding anniversary way back when it first came out. Then, in 1983, I did damaged it, I recorded music on top of it. My dad's was hurting a lot, he really liked the album. From that year on I always looked for a way to replace it. I asked many friendsto see if I could recorded from them with no luck. Just a couple of months ago I found it here and I am soo glad i did. My dad's keeps playing this CD every saturday and when I ask him why he likes it soo much, he answered: I just like to remember my youth and the times back when my generation was on top. Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better on Vinyl","review":"This recording is so bad it's brilliant! Sorry to use the cliche but it's true. Some of the songs are ear cringingly awful (I think particularly of Frenkie Howard's contribution).

Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees are great. Back in the 70's, we didn't have CD's, so the whole album had to be great, because there was no way to easily skip to the next song.

I decided on four because while the really good performances do not outnumber the mediocre ones, the good songs are REALLY good.Case in point: Barry Gibb's performance of \\"A Day In the Life.\\" It is worth the price of the album (or the download). Second case in point: Earth, Wind & Fire's take on \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\" Terrific. Peter Frampton does not turn in a bad performance on any song.The mediocre performances, and they are there, aren't \\"bad,\\" just unmemorable. George Martin does not deserve any special praise for the arrangements, either. He's not at his best here. But the album is still worthwhile.P.S.: I haven't seen the film yet, but I intend to. What the world needs now is cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"The single worst record of all time","review":"It is unbelievable that this abomination is once again available.

And I will never buy this product from here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oral-B; Price- TooGood To Be True","review":"I had the same results as others who reviewed this product.

The brush assembly comes loose after a short, pinches your cheeks. On one unit the the metal piece that holds the brush to the stem protruded, didn' realize that until I saw blood. AMAZON; you should stop selling these brushes until the SELLER proves that these units are actually made by ORAL-B. I'm suspect because on another ocassion I bought a \\"SANDISK\\" memory stick (on eBay) that didn't seem to work right. I called SANDISK, and after giving them the serial number per their request, I learned that the item was not made by SANDISK! Yet, everything about the item appeard normal, including the packaging (which I compared with a store-bought unit). These brush units may likewise be knockoffs, and the SELLER might not even realize this. I call upon the SELLER and AMAZON to investigate. Don't sell these anywmore, these brushes are dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the originals!!!","review":"It's hard to pass up this product because of the great price so I tried them anyway. Well I've learned my lesson that if over 30% of customers are giving 1 or 2 stars to a product then it is best to stay away!!This replacement brush makes a lot of noise and the brush head doesn't spin as strong as the original one I had. Also I seem to get a lot more saliva/water from my mouth dripping down the side of brush onto the toothbrush handle and onto my hand.I have gone back read other reviews on the product and I'm not waiting to see what other disasters will happen with these brushes. I hardly ever return items but for this product it's just best to return it as these brushes definitely do not work anything like the originals!! I've noticed that almost all the negative reviews for this product have come within the past 12 months.(NB: I got mine through Mr. Bargain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap replacements","review":"These are not even worth the effort. They do not last more than a week before the heads start to get loose and are unable to spin with any pressure. AVOID at any cost and go for something in the normal price range. The warning that came with the order should have been my first sign of what was to follow. It said that some have been found to be defective and to return them if it happened. ALL 4 were bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it the Real Thing?","review":"I was sure these were the same replacement heads that came with my original Braun toothbrush, but evidently not. The brush mechanism is SO loose that I am not really sure if my teeth are getting the same good brushing. The loose space between the brush and stem actually pinches the inside of my mouth as I brush. I certainly would never repeat the purchase. I will look for genuine replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oral B Brushheads from Germany","review":"I purchased these brushheads from Health Beauty and Beyond. The first day the first brush head fell apart. The merchant contacted the manufacter and advised that they would send a new brushhead and a return label to send the fauly merchantise back. I recieved a new single replacement brushhead but no return label to send the rest of the brushheads back for replacements. The merchant did the right thing but the manufacturer is not the greatest. I am still stuck with nine useless brushheads.

They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores. The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base. Pinching lips is another wonderful feature. Some prices are too good to be true. This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally. Avoid this rip-off.

There are two major problems with this product. 1. The brush heads don't fit on the tooth brush properly and must be pushed down very hard. 2. The brush head doesn't rotate back and forth properly. It rotates when you turn it on, but the minute you apply pressure against your teeth, the brush head just vibrates vigorously but doesn't actually move back and forth like it is supposed to. I'll probably contact Braun, but haven't had a moment to do so yet. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"Perfect replacements and the price was right.

I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price. They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd. The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months. That's a real laugh. Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them. So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation? Beware!","review":"Thought I'd add my vote to the many reviewers before me: this product did NOT perform as well as the original heads that came with the brush. While these do seem to brush my teeth well enough, every one of them (am now on # three out of a 4 pack) have regularly pinched my lips and tongue while in use. And the last brush wobbled and fell apart while in use. Will not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are knock-offs","review":"The brush that came with the Braun device looks different from these. The headspin part gets loose after a week's use. One even gripped my tounge, causing pain for a whole week. Avoid these at all cost. Don't tell me I didn't warn you. They're dirt cheap for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard brush heads","review":"These Braun brushheads look and feel like the real thing but simply do not perform the same.

I would never purchase these again even though they are cheaper, you get what you pay for here, cheap substandard brusheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit Oral-B Replacement Brushes","review":"It is highly likely that Amazon sold me a counterfeit package of Oral-B replacement brushes for my Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush. I would like to post a picture of the original brush and the one Amazon sold me, but I cannot upload a picture (or do not know how to) and cannot be bothered to make and upload a video. I understand that I can return the item (not convenient as I am now travelling outside the US) which is a good policy, but the whole point is that Amazon sells counterfeit goods (in my case highly likely) which is a huge black mark for me ever considering another on-line purchase with them. Sorry Amazon, but your customer service feedback is so poor that I have resorted to sending this review. Very poor on you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great purchace","review":"These are supposed to be the correct replacement heads for my toothbrush. They have the same name and look EXACTLY like they should. But when I attached one of them, I noticed that the fit was not right- it was on there, but it was way too loose. And that was after a good 5 min of hurting my fingers, trying to squeeze the color ring onto the bottom of the head... I got it on there but not without difficulty. I am still using the head on my toothbrush... only because I can't afford another one right now. It came halfway off the base while brushing yesterday... and the piece with bristles is starting to detach from the stem. Don't think it'll last much longer.

After a few more weeks, the heads flop around so much its hard to see how they stay together. The packaging and such looks authentic but I can't believe it. They pinch your cheeks when they wobble even when you are very careful. I'm going to find a store where they cost more because in this case the deal is not a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"I've ordered replacement heads from various stores for years and never had a problem. But these heads are faulty. You are lucky if you get a weeks use out of each head. I've had metal pins come out in my mouth and broken bits of plastic while brushing. Not too mention the horrible pinches it does on your lip because it is so loose and wobbly.I don't know if this is a problem with Oral B quality control or just this vendor but I've never had this issue before and now I'm seeing it from many many people besides myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Oral B brushes","review":"I have so far used 2 of the 4 brushes.

My thoughtswere confirmed when I broke all four heads within about 3 monthsof using them. The small rotating piece on the back of the headbroke off while brushing. I somehow found the first three but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today. The small piece makes thebrush head rotate in a uniform patten. When it breaks you can stilluse the toothbrush but, with lesses results; what's the point in that?If your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.

When the brush heads are loose, they don't rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brush head against your teeth; they can pinch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth. And they can even come apart in your mouth. I've used a Braun/Oral-B since before Proctor and Gamble took over and the quality was never this poor. A bad brush head now and then but not whole packages. I've seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality. I've checked with Procter & Gamble (Oral-B has been owned by P&G since 2006) to determine whether these are counterfeit and am convinced that they are genuine Oral-B product, just terribly poor quality Oral-B product. Perhaps when P&G took over Oral-B, they found ways to cut costs and quality has suffered as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great price!!!!","review":"I love Oral-B products and I found the brush heads on Amazon for a great price ~ I could not resist!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OEM","review":"The are the originals and I trust the quality of Oral-B.

Seriously. Best money I've spent in a long time - no one likes pain in a dentist's chair, and my exams are always great now.[...]. Unfortunately, though the head LOOKS like an Oral-B head and is branded identically, it is not the same product.Luckily I have not had the destructive, painful experiences of some of the one-star raters, but was clear from the first use that it's not the same product. The plastic bristles aren't very flexible so they don't really get around a tooth; the texture is different, too -- like it should be squeaking in protest.

Nice smooth oscillations, no wiggling, etc. My teeth feel amazing, and my gums are thoroughly cleaned, yet not sore. Great brush heads. These were slightly cheaper than my local CVS, and came with 4 rather than the 3 brush CVS pack. I would expect this better price when not in a \\"brick and mortar\\" store, so I feel that I got a good price on the real thing.

It works fine for me but is a bit tougher on the teeth then the ones I have used in the past. It tends to cause more of a beating on the teeth due to the design of the bristles, some long and some short, instead of all one length. The mechanics work well. My biggest concern is the price. It's five times more expensive then the generics. So many reviewers had problems with the generics that I decided to spend the ridiculous price for the Oral-B originals.

But 3 month ago I couldn't find it in any supermarket then I bought this one. Shipped pretty fast, looked good. But then, having used it for about 2 month, the tip became very loose and I have to be very careful as I brush my teeth, for it could pinch my tongue or mouth!! I even bled for a few time. Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one. But after about 3 months, the color on this one was not lost at all (my husband is using it too, so neither was his). I seriously doubt whether it is real oral B. Be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower quality","review":"These replacements are formerly known as flexiSoft, which have white center bristles instead of the original green bristles. I believe this so called improved design (Precision Clean Brush Head) is much more inferior, in terms of the quality of the bristles, than its predecessor. The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine. Unfortunately my latest order came with the white center bristles, the kind that you should be avoiding.

I decided to try the Amazon brush replacements to save money -- $4 brushes for $12. A good deal - right? Wrong! I purchased the brushes on 12/1/09. I am already on my 3rd brush! The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush. As it wobbled, it pinched my tongue & gums -- my tongue actually had bleeding cuts from it! Both of the first two heads are defective, & of poor quality. This never happened with the expensive heads -- I never had a problem, I used them until the color faded, & then threw them away. I am totally disappointed in these Amazon heads.

It was getting expensive, buying brush head replacements at a local drugstore, so I checked Amazon and was happy to find these reasonably priced ones. They fit my Braun Oral-B \\"3D Action Plaque Remover\\" model, and they also fit my husband's Braun Oral-B \\"Professional Care\\" model.Over a couple of years, neither of us have had a single problem with these brush heads. We replace them when the blue indicator bristles signal that the brush head needs replacing (when the bristles have turned to half-white, half-blue). This is usually about 5-6 months after the brush head is installed.When you order these ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL PRECISION CLEAN replacement brush heads, you get a tall, slender, sealed retail package with the Oral-B brand on it. The package contains 4 replacement brush heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"REPLACEMENT ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH HEADS","review":"Arrived when expected in excellent condition.Same great quality.

They are the same as the ones sold here at discounted prices. They are of very low quality. I tried Targets. They do not fit properly, the connector part is slightly bigger. They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough. Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B=26, offbrand=18. So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid. Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them. Note: there should be \\"Oral B\\" inscribed on the arm of the replacement brush heads. If it is not there, it is definitely not theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"I was disappointed with this product. It was cheaper than any replacement heads I've found, but it was more expensive in the long run. They did not last as long as the products I've purchased in the grocery store or in Walgreen's. The heads did not fit well on my Oral-B battery-operated toothbrush, they wore out faster and finally one ejected a piece of metal from it while in operation. Fortunatley, no one got hurt, but I wouldn't risk using them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush head become loose after short period of time","review":"I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head, I highly doubt if this is original Oral-B product.

I am on the 3rd brush head now (out of the 4 pack I bought), they all broke the same way.I remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive.

They said they have not experienced this problem before. As long as the second shipment is fine, I'm okay with this purchase. I do appreciate the personal phone call from the Amazon.com tech.Rick Brandt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"The first brush head started making excess noise and suddenly lost its little metal pin within four uses. I chalked it up to one bad product and put the second one on. Within days that one did the same thing and was pinching the inside of my mouth. So I tried the third brush head. This one actually came apart into two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses. When the fourth brush head started sounding like the first two had before their pins fell out, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and asked for instructions to return them. The seller has said I will receive a refund but I just sent them back a few days ago. I now assume these were factory rejects and I was not made aware of that before my purchase. I will not buy these online again. I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart at 2 months of use","review":"The head on the replacement brush became loose and wobbly after exactly 2 months of use on the first head that I've just replaced again.

This was an honest take on what it must feel like for a man to have two loves in his life. One being the family and the other his passion for his work. The sad thing is sometimes these two loves can not coexist, as seen in this case. I was deeply moved by the father's pain over leaving his family to pursue his dreams despite his anguish over the decision. But I felt more deeply for the daughter (Makeba) who did not ask to be brought in to this world but had to endure the sadness brought on by her parents decisions. I applaud the author for showing an accurate display of how decisions we make in life need to be thought out seriously for the consequences can be life changing for everyone involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time Around is Even Better","review":"I read this book over a year ago, put it away, then went back and read it again. Not being carried away with the excitement of finding the book as I was last year, I spent more time reading it. I'm glad I did. The second read was even better than the first and equally hard to put down. Though I am a retired Army Counterintelligence Agent myself, I found that since retirement I have had no interest or desire at all to collect and read books on subjects similar to this book. I have made exceptions for only three books of this type over the past 13 years... Stu Herrington's being one of them. I'm glad I picked Stu's book as one of the exceptions.

While the book gives an accurate and detailed view of events, I was surprised to note how little the FBI's participation was documented.One gets the opinion that the investigation was conducted solely by the Army. I spent countless hours with Bob Watson interviewing witnesses and reviewing documents. The bureau momitored hundreds of hours of tapes relating to Hall's phone conversations, including the intial one which linked Hall with Yildirim. I prepared numerous subpoenas in order to obtain crucial inmformation concerning Hall's finances and travel.The FBI's search of Hall's residence obtained valuable evidence which greatly helped in establishing Hall's guilt.

It's fast and eficient, but if you have more than 5 lb.of meat to grind and you don't want smoke coming out from the motor, You might want to give it a break in between.

I would recommend this grinder to anyone for home use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts cannot be dishwashed!","review":"Initially I thought the machine was great, and the first two uses I had the time to handwash. The third use, I threw the parts in the dishwasher, not thinking anything of it since they looked like stainless metal, well, big mistake. The shiny finish washed off, underneath is a horrible lead-like metal that leaves a black residue on your hands, towel, anything it touches, it smells like iron. All the parts turned grey like this and furthmore, the discs all started rusting. I am so angry, what a waste of money. I wanted to grind my own meat so I could buy various cuts of meat to make specialty dishes. I particularly needed the course grind. It's destroyed, rusty all over. I don't even want to touch it, let alone grind meat with it. I don't know what the warranty is, I'll post and update when I hear back from the manfacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grinder","review":"I just was looking for something simple.

I read it on the way to their house and it captivated their attention, both of them (ages 3 & 5). They listened to every single word intently and quietly. They loved the story of the boy and riding his bike up and down the worry hill. It is quite long though and my voice got a litte sore reading aloud for so long. At the end of the book, my son asked, \\"mommy who's book is that?\\" and I said \\"It's yours\\". He asked if he could write in it. The pages are black and white pictures like a coloring book. I told him he could color the pictures but not to color over the words so that I would be able to keep reading it to them. Unfortunately at Nana & Papa's house there was an accident involving water and the book so only half the book made it back. The cover was torn off and everything. I was so mad!

I left it on the table and my son picked it up and read it - his initial reaction was \\"do you think I have OCD\\", I replied by telling him that I was interested in the subject as I didn't want to label his condition.

We sat down and started reading and I was asking him questions pertaining to what we were learning. At one point, he said to me \\"I have OCD.\\" It was like a relief. He didn't feel bad and I think it helped him to actually put a name to what had been an ongoing struggle.

There are 953 pages. And the table of contents is only 2 pages. It would fit even on one page if you removed Benjamin Franklin's epitaph that takes up half of the first page.

They had to put the main points in it. Felicity did become more mature in the book towards the end of the series. Her mother even admitted it in Changes for Felicity.

Everything is great, EVERYTHING! I'm a horse-lover myself. Then that's when Felicity shows her kindness and loyalness. She rescued her bestfriend's father from jail through her father.

The acting was great, the actors looked the part and it was lovely seeing all of the houses and such from that time period. What I didin't like is that they totally changed the order of more than 10 different scenes. They were all scrambled up and not anywhere near the order of the books. Also some quotes were also totally scrambled and were moved to different characters than who originally said them in the book. They also totally changed the ending with Jiggy Nye and it was really over done. All in all I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 stars.

Living in Williamsburg, Virginia at the time when the colonies are aching for their freedom from England -- and Felicity is growing up, with a strong spirit and sense of right and wrong.

However I was disappointed with the 'look' of the film. With Colonial Williamsburg in all its restored glory as a reference,most of the sets looked NOTHING like the Williamsburg I have visited many times. Curved Streets?

Or better yet,why not film in Williamsburg to begin with.Its been done before."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie, ideal for all girls!!","review":"You may have seen the felicity movie on television, but it's so nice to own it on DVD once you get it, especially without the commercials! For the people who have never seen the movie, felicity is a spunky girl, who lives during the colonial times. She encounters trouble among local townspeople, but she always manages to get through her troubles. This would be a great gift for any girl who likes dolls or owns an american girl doll. The best part of the DVD is behind the scenes. It's really fun to look at what the actors are doing when they're not in front of the camera, and what mistakes may have happened during the shooting. This is an ideal gift for any girl!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad little film","review":"I watched this film with both my 11 and 9 yr. old daughters and they loved it! Absolutely nothing was inappropriate along the lines of clothing (not an exposed bosom in site). I found the horse's owner to be scary and mean, but in the end (surprise) he turns out to be a nice guy. Regarding Felicity and disobeying her parents - it's just a story! Most kids over 8 know the difference between right and wrong. This is much friendlier than other movies being offered today. A great alternative for kids that are too old for Disney cartoons but too young for Harry Potter and the likes. I'm surprised it's being torn apart by some reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show for the Whole Family","review":"Our entire family enjoyed this dvd. It is a wholesome movie that includes the importance of family and the importance of sticking up for those unable to do so for themselves. It brings to light many great discussions, such as the wrongdoing of the man in the movie who abused his horse and how being honest and honoring a contract is a sign of integrity. There is nothing objectionable in this film and I applaud the directors for creating a movie void of violence, sexuality, and bad language. I would highly recommend this movie and have added it to my Mom-Approved movie listing on my blog."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was that","review":"I hope to save you from watching this.

There seemed to be issues with converters so we tried a USB 4Port hub. It works without a hitch as a great inexpensive ($13) option instead of USB-PS2.Consumers also need to be aware that the keyboard does not come with the necessary software disc for Windows 98. It needs to be requested, at no additional price, by phone. It arrived in about a week by mail.The only thing I don't like about the keyboard is the ENTER key is a further stretch than common keyboards, it has a /\\\\ key between the apostrophe key and ENTER.

I contacted the company who said it could be the USB connection --I tested, it is not. Their take: Tough luck. It is out of warranty. I have NEVER had a keyboard with such a short lifespan (7 MONTHS!!!) I think this is outrageous! I had shown it to my ophthalmologist who posted info on it in his office but I intend to warn him about its shoddy construction! Another caution is that it does not work with all systems (a small warning buried in the packaging) due to power differences.

Also, sometimes he would have to press a key several times before it would actually type the letter/number. Maybe we got a dud keyboard and the springs/sensors for some of the keys were shot. If you usually touch-type and only sometimes need to look at the keys, I dont' know if I would buy this keyboard. There are other large print keyboards available from other manufacturers that might have better feedback, although they are not as inexpensive as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard for vision impaired","review":"The keys have extremely large high contrast lettering that is easy to see in just about any lighting condition.The keys have a fairly long travel and reward methodical typing. A touch typist might be frustrated with both the key noise and the length of the keystrokes required to type at speed.The keystrokes appear to be designed to help avoid bad or inadvertent key hits, which makes it a very good keyboard for the purpose.It installs easily on XP and appears able to use a generic Microsoft driver even for the volume controls and extra function keys.Is solidly made, not a cheap piece of flexoplastic on it.This is a specialty keyboard for those wih poor vision. Although it does make it easy to see in extremely poor light, an illuminated model would probably be more satisfying to someone who just needs poor light capability and types fast.Hopefully I can find someone locally to donate mine to, as it is a tad slow for even 50 wpm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large Print Keyboard - excellent","review":"Great purchase with great yellow letters.

Unfortunately, while the sound is fine for the headset portion, others on my calls consistently report that I sound very quiet and am hard to hear. I like a phone headset that doesn't require me to speak up much more than I would if holding a phone handset, and with this headset I have to speak forcefully for others to hear me well.

I spent half of yesterday and a few hours today trying to figure out why my music wasn't playing.

The cat Whittington is the namesake of Dick Whittington, a London merchant and advocate for the poor during the mid 1300's. As Whittington tells the barnyard menagerie of his ancestor who was the companion of Dick Whittington we also find that Ben is struggling from the embarrassment and problems of dyslexia. Ben's struggles are interwoven with Whittington's storytelling. While this is a good story which imparts history and science through the words of the animals, the transition from real time to storytelling does not always flow well. The accounts of the merchant trade slows the story down at times and seems rather textbook-like. Until the very end, the characters lack the three-dimensionality that allows the reader to empathize with them. An enjoyable read nontheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Retelling of a Classic Story","review":"This is a marvelous retelling of a classic children's story, as told to a group of farm animals and children by--of course--a cat.

Thabion's words are wise, the solstice ceremony shown in the video is inspiring and the silent eucharist celebration is meditative and thought provoking. The music, although magical and true, gets a bit tedious to the viewer (although I'm sure it adds well to the actual ritual events depicted).The beauty of Mr. Runyon's video offerings is that they allow students and practioners alike, insight into a well established and practicing magical temple.

When It Rains is a fun, 2-steppy country shuffle that will make you tap your feet. However, Here For The Party and Homewrecker should have stayed in the her personal songbook.

She gets a little sentimental on \\"Pochahontas Proud\\" and shows a lack of confidence on \\"When I Think About Cheatin\\", something that shows Gretchen has got more to her than a one dimensional persona.\\"Here For The Party\\" leaves me thinking Gretchen's gonna be here for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gretchen made Pocahontas Proud!","review":"When Gretchen came out with the single \\"Here for the Party\\" I fell in love with it immediately.

Poor Patsy Cline is rolling in her grave. Someone said this cd made them a real country fan, what a joke. Country music is about heart, it's not about adding to the stereotypical southern image of getting drunk and partying.

I enjoy all the songs on this CD, although at 10 songs, she's 1-2 short of what many CD's contain. I would welcome a couple more songs to this CD!And like another reviewer mentioned, I too would love to see her in concert! I'm sure she puts on a great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT COUNTRY MAMA!","review":"She ain't a 'high class broad' and she's proud of it! Gretchen may not be 'high class,' but her talent is through the roof!!Great set of pipes - powerful, sturdy and versitile (versitile enough, I say, that Gretchen could be a country or pop singer). Anyone concerned about a possible pop crossover in the future, though, need not worry - this girl is hardcore country and I think she's staying that way. My only complaint: the cd itself is under 40 minutes, which is a little too short. I want more Gretchen, dammit!! For more listening pleasure, buy the Redneck Woman cd single from Australia. It has 2 bonus non-album tracks called Rebel Child and It Ain't Easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW CAN THEY CALL THIS COUNTRY??? LOOK AT THE COVER!!","review":"All one has to do is look at the cover to realize that what is selling these days is 'trashy sex'. All one has to do is give the samples a listen to realize this is not country music! I'll stick to buying old classic vinyls and listening to them on my turntable when country was Real and talent and especially class acts ruled the roost with legends like Cash, Wynette, Ray Price, Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton......heck...even bring back Crystal Gayle...she'd make these country/pop wannabes look like gum stuck under an old shoe. Forget this CD.....unless you're one of the masses that likes this low class garbage, like all of the what is supposedly called 'country' (and I use the term loosely) these days!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt care for this one much","review":"to me know song country or not should ever have cursing in it being a Christian I would not Recommend Gretchen Wilson to anyone because there should never be cursing in any song it just isnt right very distasteful"},{"rating":"1","title":"**ryan**","review":"this cd is not worth buying she trys to hard to sound like someone else i would not buy this cd today or even the next one ihated this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Escape from Walmart","review":"I cannot believe that anyone thinks this album is good or that Gretchen Wilson has one ounce of talent...The lyrics are unimaginative and cliche...to give her any serious consideration with talented country musicians and songwriters is harmful to the industry. Those who think she is hot have been drinkin while they've been watchin her videos. She looks like one of those chunky trailer park vixens who you run into at Walmart (wearin daisy dukes, a wife beater, and slippers) at 11pm.

But they were still good nevertheless, just not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break","review":"Mary Gauthier,Iris Dement, Lucinda Williams, Maggie Brown, Allison Moorer, Stacey Earle, Jenny Whitely, Audrey Auld, Kasey Chambers; these are the real ladies of outlaw, and authentic country/roots music, not this fabricated 'bad' girl. Country music is in rough shape and the excec's are just tryin'to get it back on track by giving mainstream a rougher version of these other tarts infesting the airwaves. I give her credit for doing her thing, but don't even try to call this music anything other than what it is, plastic country/pop. If music producers really wanted authentic 'country' they wouldn't have to look at this lady, there's plenty of the above mentioned that have been around for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Made for TV Act","review":"Country is no different than ,Pop,R&B,Rap in Making up certain acts that truly have no business being taking as recording artists let alone One Hit wonders.Gretchen Wilson is riding the same Road of country that has spunned alot of Hit Acts but at the same time alot of modern acts short on any real Musical Substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore???","review":"Gretchen Wilson is quite possibly the worst thing that could happen to country music right now. She is a joke and the punchline is that she is hardcore. Seriously people, Loretta Lynn has a song about life in a women's prision. Allison Moorer has a song that opens \\"In this cemetary mist/stands a new born atheist/even if you do exist/you're far from almighty.\\" Remember, a couple of strippers and a smigde of nudity in a video does not make an ALBUM hardcore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album by the \\"Original Redneck Woman\\" - \\"Outstanding\\"!!!!","review":"I like Gretchen, because, she's a \\"real\\" woman, not one of those \\"painted-up\\" \\"barbie-doll types!!!

We were completely and utterly disappointed with this book! It took over 2/3 of the book for the author to develop the characters and then in the last 40 pages or so, everything was rushed. The book was never proofread, they didn't even use spell check! All in all, it was an annoying read! Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Doom","review":"Mariah's vocal powress has once and again been proven to be tops here, but the single isnt gonna help her much. It's another typically pedestrain Mariah ballad. The lyrics are also pretty mundane, talking about how she could ride through the rain and emerge victorious blah blah blah.....Mariah's high and lows accompany the song while the music plays on without much panache. The remixes are probably ok, just some dance beats to drown the original sentimental track with Mariah's vocals taking a backseat.With TTR and Charmbracelet, Mariah has not realized that her formulae for power ballads and hip-hop funk have worn thin with the influx of younger wannabes like Christina Aguilera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best o' Frankenstein","review":"Hands down, this is the *best* material I've heard from Electric Frankenstein, esp. the intro track (BOY does it rock!).

There have been some days that didn't hit it for me, but I've noticed how some of those messages may be relevant at a different point in my life.

I rarely read this book now - instead of it uplifting my spirits it appears to preach at you. I know how important scripture is - and the scripture at the top of the page is great, but instead of writing insightfulness throughout the page, this author just quotes scripture, anyone can do go through the bible and pick out scripture. I truly disappointed. A much better book is written by Doreen Virtue, her Daily Guidance from your Angels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it 0","review":"Worthless - a complete waste of money.

The part is titled Cats Alone. It is sooooo funny! The owners leave the cats alone at home. The thieves come to rob the house and the cats are fighting with them. It is like the movie Home Alone, except that it is more funny. I loved it.I hope to get Book 3 for ChristmasBoB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic ancient needlework from Nasca, Peru","review":"Alan Sawyer has a beautifully presented book here. It's not heavy on text, but that is partly due to the fact that as the author states, there have been virtually no proper excavations of Nasca burials to base information on.What you get here is litrely pages of gorgeous photographs of existing early nasca needlework that the author was able to locate in various collections. He has concentrated on pieces with a provence in the nasca or ica valleys.This book is illuminating, but to get the most out if it you should look at a book that has been written on the earlier, related Paracas style in order to really see the differences between the two styles, as they are often confused in non-specialist books.Beautiful, colorful, inspiring and educational. This book is a must for anybody interested in ancient peruvian textiles or arts or who just wants to see rare textiles that are as good as anything else produced anywhere in the world over the last 2000 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressure feature is great!","review":"I have had this toothbrush for over two years, and it works as great now as the day I got it. In my opinion, the pressure feature is the best part about this brush. I was recommended this brush by my dentist, after it became apparent that I was wearing holes in my enamel by brushing too hard (not helped by having 'soft' teeth, either).This toothbrush 'trains' you to brush with the right pressure (believe me, a very hard habit to break). It also has a 2 minute timer, with automatic shut off, so you know how long to brush. Talk about proper toothbrushing for dummies! :) Now I no longer need to use this brush to make sure that I don't brush so hard, but I love how clean my teeth feel with this toothbrush, and the brush replacements are so cheap (and easy to get at Target or Walmart) why stop using it? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE-Do not buy!!!","review":"This toothbrush never worked from day one. The on/off button never worked and it would instantly start going off as soon as you removed it from the charger.

Some of the color reproductions are good, but then buy the Claude Roy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile","review":"if there is one consistant theme in this ponderous book it's the author's unrelenting obsession with exposing Balthus' alleged Jewishness. With access to so many of the great man's intimates as well as being a guest in the artist's home each page is full of missed opportunites to shed real insight into his personality. A life such as Balthus deserved better than this dishonorable treatment by a bottom feeding journalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Balthus Fans, Obviously","review":"It's certainly the definitive biography of Balthus, although -- as others have noted -- the author becomes too annoyed at the stories Balthus weaves in and out of their conversations. I believe the author is at first seduced by Balthus, and then feels betrayed as he discoves the \\"truth\\". Balthus is still right though. It matters not what he says; the only thing that matters is his art. If you are anxious to learn about the person this is an excellent book to read. Balthus and Lucien Freud are the two greatest living 20th century painters. That alone makes any scholarly work (and this is one) interesting. Even with the author somewhat in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a wonderful book to have around the house.

The editor, Miguel Leon-Portilla, packaged a small amount of content from the Aztec's original accounts of the conquests and has seemed to try to package it for sale. His introductions of all the Aztec accounts are so saucy and sensational that the reader loses a sense of historical objectivity from the Aztecs. The accounts themselves are mainly name-calling of the Spaniards. Sometimes the Aztec accounts of the Spanish Conquestors as \\"Barbarians\\" seems to be the only repeated chime of cultural relativity offered by the slow-reading book. This fellow absolutely spoiled the book by trying to pad the lack of content from a small collection of Aztec narratives. What a let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important work","review":"This book is important because it is scholarly, yet written for the average person interested in history of this period. It is very important in that it is the only contemporary book I know of which specifically and consciously attempts to present the native side of the story. It is not a work of pandering, left-wing revisionism. It is a compilation of native historical sources: the Tlaxcala, and the Mexica themselves--often through Spanish priests who recorded their words, including poetry. The thing to remember is that it is the Aztec/Mexica point of view, and we usually get the Euro-centric version--there is a difference. Both are useful and needed to make a complete picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cortez Conquers Mexico . . . again!","review":"Ever wondered what it looked like from the other side?

Then I had it exchanged for a different one but over a month of using it the toothbrush itself would automatically turn itself on when I take it out of the charger.

But I count on my guides to lead me to interesting things that I would never see if I didn't have one - the out of the way spots. This book definitely didn't help me with that and most of the things that it includes I could have figured out for myself in about the first 20 minutes of arriving in my hotel.The Frommer's guide on the other hand inspired me to venture into the unknown and see some really wonderful things that I wouldn't have otherwise.

What the marketplace needs is a clear, concise guide to instrument structure and valuation, and Mr. Arditti writes in circles. As an example, his chapter on option pricing refers to \\"using the methods used previously in this chapter\\" without referring to how to apply these to the method just introduced. The method just introduced was explained using numbers that were presumably fabricated, but lord only knows, because the author can't be bothered to specify how his example was structured.In trying to explain things simply, the author fails to explain anything clearly. \\"Derivatives\\" is an extreme disappointment.

It has some very rare tracks, and if you're a Ministry of Sound or Euphoria fan, you'll be a bit interested in hearing where some of the DJ's inspiration seems to come from. For example, the track by \\"Chant\\" was redone and made countless times and is probably more commonly known because of the DJ \\"Chicane\\", who sampled the track in \\"Saltwater\\". If you've heard that track, Chicane's version, and enjoyed the ambient version of it, you'll more than appreciate the original of the song. It's fantastic and far superior.But that's the sort of cd that this is. More along the lines of a \\"Euphoria Chilled Out\\" meets \\"Break N Bossa\\" sort of thing with a hint of Arabic and Indie ambiance in between.

I also needed to carry my bike all the way back to my tiny apartment. Now I need to buy a new lock. It is really frustrated since I have just used this lock for only ONE month! Maybe Krptonite just cannot handle its 'high security disc-style cylinder' technology.

I broke the dang thing trying to open it after it had been on the shelf for a couple months, never used, nor weathered. All I can say is the key sucks, the locking mechanism locks, and dont be suprised if this happens to you. & if it does, dont be suprised if their customer support never replies to your emails. Kryptonite == FAILS. Do not buy this lock, look for another manufacturer as I will never buy from these blokes again. They ripped me off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finicky Lock Cylinder","review":"It's true, you can snap off your key in this lock. I bought this as a Replacement to an OnGuard Bulldog, which decided never to unlock itself (fortunately while not in use). The locking mechanism on this is slightly off, and sometimes you put the key in and can't get the lock to work. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to get to work if you have some patience. The tumbler at the bottom of the lock sometimes gets out of sync with the rest so you have to rotate your key until it matches the bottom tumbler. I've noticed this happens more frequently when the lock is in a vertical position (and harder to unstick). So if you can, try to keep the lock as horizontal as possible.Length of the lock is fine, you can easily lock 2 bikes to a post. It is a bit heavy, which should deter some potential thieves on the prowl. I'm fairly happy with it even if it is a bit finicky at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction.... fails quickly","review":"My wife bought me this lock for my birthday in October 2011.I have probably ridden my bicycle 12 times since then.The lock has seen very gentle use.Today, I rode my bike to the store to get a sandwich.When I went to lock my bike, the key spun freely in the key holeand does not engage or disengage the locking mechanism.Given the premium price paid for this lock, I am pretty upset.The construction of this lock is very poor!!!!Larry ScottWalnut Creek, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Key Gets Stuck -- Extreme Frustration","review":"This is the worst lock I ever used.

Oh, to be sure, we had a couple years of relatively predictable locking-unlocking cycles (and I was mindful to be gentle with the cr*p pot-metal key as the product brochure recommends). But today we've had our last argument over whether the lock would let the key unlock it. This wretched, flawed bicycle lock is being sawed from my bike even as I write.DO NOT BUY THIS LOCK IF YOU EXPECT TO UNLOCK IT REGULARLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy and fast to break with a power tool","review":"After reading the other reviews I was sure that this was the right U-Lock for my bike, but I was wrong. This tough looking lock might stop the beginners but it's easy to break for the experienced bike thief.Any bike lock is as good as its weakest part. This Kryptonite U-Lock can be cut with a portable power tool (for example:[...]). And it doesn't take long to do it since my bike was stolen at noon, in a well light busy campus intersection where it was parked for an hour and twenty minutes.So, this could be a decent U-Lock if you live in a low-level bike theft area, but won't do it if you live in Chicago or New York. Also, if you buy this, send the insurance paperwork immediately since you have only 15 days from the day of the purchase to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key mechanism sucks","review":"I've been having some serious troubles inserting the key and getting the lock to open.

Let me tell you, this lock in as they say, \\"intimidating\\"! The only reason for the missing star is the weight, but then again, no worries about where I leave it. I would suggest getting the extra cable to tie around other wheels, other bikes, or in case you wanted to lock it around a tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable but heavy","review":"I've had this lock for over a year and it's still working great. Love how there's a cover to protect the keyhole from the rain. Very strong and durable, but it's a bit on the heavy side. But, all good locks are heavy though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great secure lock!","review":"I've had this lock for 4 months now, and the key still opens/closes it just like new! (unlike my cheaper Bully lock).It just fits perfectly through my bike's front tire and the frame and the item I lock it through. Kryptonite is known as the best for security, so I feel plenty safe using it.I also use my cheaper Bully U-lock on the back tire for double security. Kryptonite's quality is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bicycle security","review":"This is a great, heavy-duty bike lock. I had some trouble at first mounting it on the bike's frame because it's a hard-tail with an acute geometry... so there is not much space between the top tube and the bottom tube. But I was able to get it on eventually with the very tip of the lock not within the frame's triangle. That's ok, though. I highly recommend this lock over the weaker, less-secure locks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Lock","review":"This lock adds some heft to the bike, which you can really tell when you lift and carry the bike.The included bracket to attach the lock to the bike frame, itself has some size. Do to my bikes frame, Trek 3 Series, with water bottle, you are very limited in where you can attach the lock and not have it get in the way of your legs. I ended up attaching it to the seat post and moving the reflector, it is off to the one side but its out of the way.If you can try out the various sizes; MINI, STD, LG this will help you see what fits the bike and remember to include what you'll able to secure the bike to.One thing, I am hope does not become an issue it the plastic slot where the Lock (silver part) slides into. With the jarring it takes its seems that the lock already has more wiggle room than it started with. Will have to see after a few months and years if it holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lock!","review":"I've had this lock for about a month now and it is working out great. It comes with a piece that you put on your bike and then you can clip the lock on to when you are riding. But since I have a womens mountain bike, there isn't enough space to attach it, but for a buys bike, it should work out fine. So when I'm riding, I either throw the lock into my backpack or if its just a short ride, I loop it through my handlebars and just let it sit there.The lock has done a good job standing up to the rain, since I keep my bike locked up outside at all times. But sometimes you have to pull it off really hard if it got wet inside. But once you rub off the bars, it pulls out fine again.I live in the city, and this lock is definitely secure enough to scare off any bike thieves. Also, this is a great price compared to buying it at a bike shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kryptonite Evolution Saved My Bike","review":"After much consideration, I opted to spend the extra $ to purchase this lock with a Kryptonite cable. I recently purchased a bike for $900 and didn't want to lose it. I locked my bike next to a friend's bike that used a cable and padlock. His bike was stolen, even though it's value was considerably less than mine.

The album has a doomy gothic touch to it, which makes it's so cool to listen to. I think the first 4 Cult albums were great, because the reason why they sound all different, is because their all progressive. This is a classic for early 80's goth music. Favorite track off this album is \\"Spiritwalker\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Dreamy!","review":"I picked this up for the first time since I have always liked the Cult and \\"loved\\" their LOVE album. Billy Duffy's guitar sound is great; the ambience is incredible and I miss the Gothic style chords and playing. Ian Astbury's vocals are great, too. These guys obviously had talent from the get go. The rest of the lineup is adequate, too. I think this and Love to me embody the classic sound of the Cult. If you listen to later albums, particularly Electric, they stripped down and overproduced their sound so much that a lot was lost of their true talents. Like some of the other reviewers, I think they should have retained the gothic elements of their sound, but I guess they were headed for commercial success instead. The mysticism of the lyrics and the gothic elements make the listening experience a true Dreamtime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the movie, but poor quality","review":"I had to return the movie because of the poor quality.

Flags of our Fathers does NOT join that rank. There is no memorable music from Eastwood's too simplistic score. It sounds nice on the trailer but on film, well, all you remember is the same melody played over and over then back and forth among the ensemble. The weak trumpet piece is nice but gets trying after the two hours of film. There's little score in the film and on the album hence the era filler music.The score does support some parts of the film but it falls short during the flag rising. That should have contained music that would make one's arm hair rise. Didn't happen. On album, the music is a tired listen. Three stars for effort. One star for boring original score.

I haven't heard some of these songs in 30 years, and I was surprised how great and current they still sound. Nothing cheezy or dated about this album: it rocks. And as far as albums go, all but two of the songs are worth listening to multiple times. That is a great track record for any album. If you own anything by Tom Cochrane or Red Rider, you should own this album as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Beginners","review":"I have had this book for about a year and when I was a beginner this was an excellent resource for learning Elements.

I would recommend this book to any beginner not familar with PSE 3.0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Easy to understand, with pictures and step-by-step guidance.

Worth the money and time.I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite computer book ever","review":"Nowhere on the cover does it say that this book is for Windows only. Whole chapters do not apply to Macintosh, and what few suggestions there are for compensating are really lame. But what I REALLY can't stand is the way the book is written. Its author apparently thinks he's the funniest guy on the planet. Nearly every sentence has some stupid joke or smarmy comment. If you want quick information about how to do things in PS Elements 3, this is not your book. In its favor, it's well organized and has lots of good tips, but you have to be willing to slog through way too much self-indulgent and annoying posturing by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating; not for Mac","review":"The author said that with a few translations of keystrokes one could use Mac and this book. Not so easy...This is frustrating, because I'm not sure what other book might actually teach the Mac version of version 3. There are a lot of very specific techniques in this book, and it's not a bad reference, but it certainly left this Mac user very frustrated and looking for another source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money if you have version 2 of this book","review":"This book is functionally identical to the one the author put out for version 2 of Photoshop Elements. They changed the example photos, but little else except for a new section on using the Organizer, which is NOT available in the Mac version. Unlike his Photoshop books, where new info and techniques are included in each version, this is just a rehash of the earlier version. Normally, I'm pretty excited to see new books by Kelby, but this experience will cause me to check twice before buying.If you don't have a good Photoshop Elements book already, this is as good a place to start as any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you are new or fairly new at this software program.","review":"When you're a beginner, this is NOT..NOT..NOT the book you want to learn from. Every document I have picked up so far refers to \\"Layers\\" and how important they are and in this book you will find nothing. All the information in here is for advanced changes and corrections to pictures. So if you are new at this software, you will accomplish nothing using this reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Next or companion Book","review":"If you have a basic working knowledge of Elements 3 or have a book like Barbara Brundage \\"The Missing Manual\\" this a good companion book to step you through some more advance step's.

Plenty of examples and detailed how-to's.Easy to pick up and leaf through. Not necessary to read from start to finish. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photoshop Elements 3 - A Great Resource","review":"I have found Scott Kelby's Photoshop Elements 3 book to be a great help in learning how to use the program. As a new user, I have found at times the book lacks a few of the basics, but perhaps for someone a little more computer literate this would not be a problem. The book gives very straight forward directions on how to perform most tasks and he includes enough humor to keep one from being bored with the text. I would definitely recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book--Mac user","review":"Even though I use a Mac and this book was written for Windows users, most of it can be applied to the Mac platform also. Mac users can skip the Organizer section; we have iPhoto and don't need the Elements Organizer anyway. We Mac users also must make a few adjustments; for example when told to use the Control key, we use the Apple Command key.I'd already taught myself how to use several of the features in Elements 3, but since buying this book, I've become amazed at the many marvels of this program that I hadn't yet discovered. Kelby gives specific easy to follow instructions.Still, it would be great if more was written for the Mac. There are many of us loyal Mac users out there, who aren't about to give up our wonderful Macs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photoshop Elements 3 Book For Digital Photographers (Voices)","review":"This has been very helpful in learning how to use the PSE3 program...

It takes you step by step through common photo improvement techniques, and adds a dose of humor along the way. Scott Kelby anticipates the problems of those of us who can find a way to mess up no matter what and tells us how to proceed. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPOINTED","review":"This is the worst \\"How To\\" book for computer use I have ever read. Too much information is left out. Too many questions are unanswered. It makes things look much easier than they are. Save your money! There is no explanation of all the Tools, for example. It did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"I don't understand the great ratings on this. It won't keep the book open ... only works for a book that already lies flat. I have about two lie-flat cookbooks as opposed to the 40-plus other cookbooks I have that need a holder to keep them open.It does fold up. And it's stored in the box to go to the Salvation Army. I should have returned it but didn't. Am pretty disgusted and feel taken advantage of.I have one ancient cookbook holder that both holds the book open and doesn't tip over in the process and that's a clear acrylic one called Aspenglas that isn't made anymore ... at least, I can't find it anywhere.So, the hunt for a second useful cookbook holder goes on. The problem with the acrylic ones I've found is the tipping factor ... the base needs to be at least 5 inches deep, I think, or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the adjustability","review":"This stand fit everything I was looking for. It folds flat for easy storage on the shelf right next to my cookbooks. It has three slots that allow you to adjust for the thickness of the book. It is simple and functional and inexpensive. I was amazed at how much some of the cookbook stands out there cost! And it has a splashguard to prevent splatter stains on your pages.I have nothing bad to say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbok stand","review":"Space is an issue in my kitchen - and this cookbook holder helps conserve it.

I do have an interest in the ancient goddess mythos and had looked forward to learning more. Unfortunately, this book is filled with inaccuracies, half truths, uncited sources and unfounded theories which are presented as facts.The author skips around a lot drawing bits from the history and mythology of several cultures during many eras. From this she pieces together an unsupported construct, using only those facts which relate to her theory and ignoring all the rest.I would encourage anyone interested in the history of goddess mythology to learn more, just not with this book. It is a sad misrepresentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Better Humidifier","review":"Drawbacks:1. The fan is loud, even on \\"low.\\"2. The filters get moldy in about a month.

Runs 18-24 hours on a tank of water.My advice is to spend a few bucks more and get a warm air humidifier that doesn't use filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Product","review":"This humidifier is poorly designed on several levels. First, it is VERY loud - in fact so loud that I could not sleep with it on. Second, after I took it apart to do the weekly cleaning, I had problems getting the filter back in place. The instructions are poorly written and diagrammed as well. And if I had known that this unit requires weekly maintenance, I would never have bought it. It is just too much work.Just a few days later I went to my local Walgreen's and they had a cool mist humidifier on display and running. It was so quiet that I bought one and threw away the Honeywell. My new Walgreen's model is so much better and was also cheaper. I will never buy a Honeywell model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed","review":"Be warned, this is a very poorly designed product.1) The handle for the tank is on the bottom. That means you need to set it down to fill it, or hold it by the side of the slippery plastic. I dropped my tank 2 days after purchasing the unit because of this. It shattered and I had to order another for $20.2) The filter only works if it's wet. That means if you turn the unit off during the day, you need to soak the filter before turning the unit on again. What a pain.I'm returning mine as soon as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"hcm890","review":"I am happy with this product. It is compact, inexpensive, easy to use, and good for a small to medium sized home.Excellent for people with allergies, sinus congestion, and dry eyes or skin.I haven't had any issues handling the water tank, as noted in another review. Also, as soon as the filled water tank is set into place, the water is allowed to drain into the filter housing where the filter can automatically suck up the water. Therefore it does not seem necessary to wet the filter beforehand. My item did not come with the manufacture's instructions so I am not sure if this is recommended.I recommend placing the humidifier in the desired location before filling the water tank because water may seep out if held at an angle. I also recommend carrying from the base because the water tank and filter housing are on separate, removable sides.The replacement filters cost about $10 each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeywell Cool Moisture Humidifier HCM-890","review":"Horrible product.

This technology is proven and dependable ==> not much can go wrong here as long as you have water low in impurities/solutes. However small capacity of the tank will work well for small rooms only. The biggest drawback of my particular unit was a VERY loud fan, even at the lowest speed setting most would find it hard to fall asleep with this thing running. To summarize ==> as long as it is not used in a bedroom it may fill the bill for studio apartments to small living spaces. Not suitable for any sleeping quarters due to cheap electric motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balraj","review":"This is really a bad product from honey well. It spilt lot of water and make too noise.

In fact I think he's a better hero than Batman (who by the way I adore). No gadgets, no side kicks. Just his smarts and his pistols. Also The Phantom knows how to have a family life. I remember fondly waiting each Friday afternoon for the paper so that I could get my Phantom fix.However this treatment by Ben Raab doesn't bring back much nostalgia. It is absolutely is atrocious and does nothing for the character. The dialogue is awful and the story silly...since when did the Phantom talk like a California surfer?I hope Moostone replaces him as a scribe. And replaces him with someone who actually understands the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murfreesboro & Chicamauga. Ist Impressions","review":"As this was the first of the Battleground series that I acquired, I was impressed with the ease at which you could enter into the ambience of the Civil War and move to the business end of the game. The videos and music were initially welcome and the graphics clean and quick to refresh. The toolbars are excellent and everything about the game made the length that I spent playing it most enjoyable. The only drawback is that Battleground 9 is so good it made 'Antietam' and 'Shiloh ' both very feeble is comparison. This is especially true for changing formations and artillery positions and the use of all enveloping red X's for visual targetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if you have hours to waste...","review":"This game takes around an hour and a half to complete. It is VERY slow, boring, and any child under 7 will be bored to pieces after the first scenario of trying to get out of Charlie Brown's house. The narration is too long, you can't speed it up, and once you think you've solved the game and it's over, it continues on and on again.The only way I can recommend this is for young kids 3-5, who just want to see the Peanuts characters interact on screen and the opportunity to click on things and see what they do. Once you have finished the game once, it remembers this and you can now play any one of the game/puzzle sections of it again, but if you take it out of your hard drive completely, you will be back to square one. Other than that, it is very frustrating to play the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"Buy the Freddi Fish or Pajama Sam games if you are looking for good kids games where you must solve a puzzle and have fun interaction with some whacky characters and interesting situations.

There is nothing intuitive about this software. You have to read the help file in order to advance to each step. A 4 and 6 year old definitely cannot read the help directions by themselves, so I ended up having to help with this tedious game. My 6 year old got bored. The 4 year old kept wanting to play, but I had to do most of the work until he got to a puzzle or activity. These he could do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Frustrating, and Negative for young kids","review":"I bought this game when my son was 4, because he had mastered most of the preschool games but wasn't ready for games that required reading, math, or quick fingers. I thought it would be a good problem-solving mystery game featuring some of his favorite Peanuts characters. After several attempts to help him get Charlie Brown out of the house, I finally got frustrated myself and put the game away so he wouldn't keep pestering me to figure it out (I was stumped, and didn't realize there was a \\"help\\" file). He finally dug it out months later and figured it out himself, but I forbid him from playing as Lucy because of the negative language she used towards the other characters. We finally pitched the game and moved on to Putt-Putt, Freddy Fish, and Pajama Sam. Much more positive role models, challenging but not frustrating problem solving games, fun music, and a more kid-friendly pace. Don't waste your money.

Many tracks crackle subtly, but it gets worse. The included version of \\"Beating My Head\\" has bad pitch control, due to Cherry Red's screwups. \\"Monkey's On Juice\\" literally revs up at the beginning because they didn't prime the record(!?!) right.

It was instantly the hit of the neighborhood and kids would line up to take a turn to ride this green machine and spin out of control, even some of the moms hopped on and took a ride! It has so far taken a beating from all the kids on the street and hasn't broke or came apart. Very happy with this purchase and shipping was incredibly fast. This can be ridden by kids even older because my 10 year old daughter also rides it.

DO NOT BUY","review":"Yes, this toy is fun. Yes, this toy can take abuse. No, this toy is not safe. My son is 8 yrs. old. He is a slim average size boy. This machine goes tooo fast. He wiped out going down a hill and it is a wonder he didn't end up in the hospital. He had terrible road rash up his back and damaged his knee terribly. He still has scars on his knee. It was a traumatic experience for us all. My best friend's son did the same thing on his green machine and so did her neighbor's child. My best friend's husband is a pediatrician and he says they should be outlawed. He won't allow his boys to ride it again.

The speed is no joke you might even reach 15+ that is if your strong enough.It is very manuverable with spin outs and lots of other tricks, be creative. It is very durable and will stand up through heavy abuse but there is still times when you need to repair it which is where huffy hit a few minor flaws. Like to pump up the front tire you might even have to cut the hole a little bigger to fit the nozzle but that didnt happen on my friends green machine 2. Also the brakes might need some adjustment through time which isnt a problem if you know what your doing. Overall this a great buy if your a 7 year old wanting something faster and more manuverable then the the old big wheeler or a 13 year old thrill junkie looking for something fast, manuverable, and durable this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas so he hasn't gotten it yet.

I might have enjoyed the stories when I was a child but rereading them I question my interest in them back then.

Basically its about 2 ex-best friends going to South Beach as a last resort because plans with their BFF's didn't work out. And the trip was for the better although they don't realize it until the end of the trip. Every event comes back to haunt them but in a good way. In the end every event changes them into a better stronger person. And its seems like the story was told in more then 7 days. The part is how even though they go through a few major fights and such, and then they get to be good friends but the way it sounds is they don't go back to school as best friends. Just freinds which is better then what they were after they \\"grew apart\\". A good summer read. Short and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Beach","review":"I am an English teacher and I took this book from one of my sixth grade girls. I am shocked that anyone would view this book as anything more than a teen trash novel. It is the adolescent's Daniel Steele. The two main characters in this book, Holly and Alexa are sixteen years old, yet there are numerous instances of them getting drunk on alcohol and engaging in sexual acts. The consumption of alcohol by minors is illegal! This book is encouraging it and condoning it. I do not see any redeeming value in this book.

If you like this genre then you're better off the a Vince Flynn or Nelson DeMille novel. The main disappointment with this book was the HUNDREDS of typos, misspellings and left out or incorrect words. At times it actually made it hard to follow the plot.

After reading the first few pages, I found myself not being able to put the book down. The characters John Striker and Deborah made such a great team in the story. I can't even begin to describe the story without ruining the book; however, I can say that to have the C.I.A. investigating American citizen's here in this country to stop drug cartels, and to think how effective their equipment is and how well a team should work together, it was truly unbelievable. It's been a while since I've had this much excitement about a book.

This pedal requires a lot of pressure to get any sustain out of my casio keyboard. If I have shoes on and \\"stand\\" on the pedal, it will sustain the notes I play. It is far from the lighter touch I am used to on a real piano. On a real piano, I can let my heel rest on the floor and with light pressure on the pedal it will depress fully. It would be nice if they made the tension adjustable. Also, it is just an on-off switch. In other words, the degree of sustain does not vary (as it does with a piano), making it even more unrealistic. I would recommend shopping around if you want a piano-like pedal, or if you want a pedal that does not require a lot of pressure to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable.","review":"I bought this sustain pedal for the price -- it was a big mistake. You will need to wear shoes to use the pedal comfortably as it is very boxy and the \\"grip\\" grooves are very uncomfortable. I had some difficulty keeping the pedal in place while playing.

It explains exactly how a tube amp works; the signal chain and its components. It explores different well-known amplifiers and what makes them distinct. At the same time, it dispells a lot of myths and brings the complicated (yet simple) world of the thermionic valve's place in musical amplification in an approchable text.This book answered a lot of questions that I had, plus some that I hadn't even thought of yet, but doubtlessly would."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Impressions","review":"I haven't read this cover to cover. And I guess most people might not want to do that.If you are a tech head and know a fair bit about electronics and valves then you may be disappointed by this book. However even though I would put myself in that class I am glad I have it in my kit of information. There is a lot of redundant stuff for people like me but some memory joggers in there too and some stuff that makes me question my own mindsets.If you are starting out and want to understand why things work the way they do then this is good. A very easy read for those who wear those shoes.There is a lot of information on why the old amps were built the way they were and a lot of fact versus myth covered. A lot of schematics with explanations, talk about what different valves sound like etc.If you are tinkering, trying to make something unique, or just want to learn more I don't think the book would disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hobbyist DIY","review":"Great for the entry level hobbyist.

Not only was the book not what I was expecting, but the writing itself was dry. I found the characters unappealing and couldn't sympathize with them at all.

I almost gave up about two-thirds of the way through, but hung in there for the ending. One thing that was kind of odd was that the writer seemed completely obsessed with describing the main characters [physical attributes]! They are mentioned continually! It got really aggravating after a while. Oh, you've gone half a page without mentioning her huge heaving chest. Really weird.

Charming, endearing Lydia with her low expectations and bad luck with men was someone I could (sadly) relate to. I was really rooting for her on her vacation with boring old Abe.

One of them is aware of this; the other is oblivious until she begins to see horrific images in the basement. The novel belabors this situation for about three quarters of the way, after which the plot takes a serious left turn that everyone but the protagonist can see coming. Girón throws in a lot of weirdness for weirdness' sake, such as a man who can remove his skin to feed his company of wolves, but none of it is ever justified. It all leads up to a climax where the ultimate villain of the book is defeated by someone throwing a stick at it. Really.The prose is terrible, as is the dialogue. Nobody uses contractions so they all sound like robots at one time or another. Where was the editor? Perhaps he or she didn't think it worth the trouble.Leisure has published some great work that you won't want to miss. This isn't one of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of Pain","review":"This book will serve as an inspiration to all aspiring writers. The fact that someone actually published this thing means that there is hope for us all. House of Pain is awful on just about every level. The characters are unrealistic; the motives silly and juvenile; the dialog clunky and downright stupid. Trite and superificial all come to mind when I think of this book (which I try not to do). At the end of the day this book is an insult. Giron is a phoney... she wants to be a writer but doesn't write. I think the fact that the plot (if you could call it that) lent itself to creepy cover art and an interesting blurb are the only reasons this thing was published. Anyone who praises this book -- anyone -- is lying out of some ulterior motive, such as: they are the writer's friend or they know their own work is just as bad and hope somebody will reciprocate by being merciful on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad.","review":"WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS.This book looked great--I'm always up for an \\"evil house\\" book, cliched as they may be. However, as other reviewers here have pointed out, the cover image, plot summary, and even the title of this atrocity are misleading. The multiple grammatical and proofreading errors are annoying, but not nearly as dismal as the story itself. The plot ends with a cult, in an underground cave, summoning their goddess to receive her human sacrifices. The goddess has feathers and a beak...in my mind, a giant chicken. She sucks people's brains out of their heads, which apparently makes a popping noise and causes their skulls to deflate. Really. This sounds delightfully cheesy, but unfortunately it's not even laughable. Really, really painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"Despite the eye catching cover photo and the info I received from the back cover I was real disappointed in this book. I came on amazon to read other reviews about it to see maybe it was just me that had a problem with it. But I was surprised to see a lot of negative things about it. I think this book had potential to be better. There was only one part that lasted about 2 chapters that really had my interest. The book was choppy and sometimes the flashbacks kind of got to be too much. I still give it one star, whether or not I could give 0. I only wish I could give 0 stars to those that I really hate and don't even finish. So the 1 star is for actually finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"Interesting if not terribly original idea badly executed.Other people have commented on the larger issues of plot and characterization, so I'll settle for a pet peeve: the writer has NO ear for dialogue. In particular, she doesn't contract \\"to be\\" verbs in dialogue. Over and over she wrote things like, \\"If it is not too much trouble,\\" or \\"I heard you are a witch.\\" Who talks like that? It's a little thing, but it threw me out of the story every time. That's an amatuerish mistake, and it almost made me wonder if English isn't her first language.

The plot is cliche from the get-go, and the characters seem not to realize this. They act childish, and needlessly go through the motions of people who suffer from their own stupidity. The house seems to be haunted (the author never really explains this), athough she takes the time to explain how handsome some of the men are. In one scene, we have the characters 'muttering' through most of the dialogue. Sorry, I can't recommend this book. It's poorly written, and the plot has been through the wringer a hundred times. There's plot elements that don't make sense. Why does Buddy have the ability to speak with wolves? Does the house make him do this? And the ending? Well, no spoilers here, but you'll know what's coming on about page ten. Buy it for laughs only."},{"rating":"1","title":"This plot has been done better.","review":"Yet another young-couple-in-a-haunted-house story, but Giron adds one too many twists. A secret cult is an interesting idea, but poorly explained and badly used. The ghosts of the house aren't important to the story, which is a disappointment. And Lydia wins the prize for guillible wife of the year, she ignores the truth despite many warning signs. The characterization is sloppy, one of the bad guys turns over a new leaf for no real reason despite a lifetime of plotting. The ending is horrible, and Giron's prose style actually makes me embarassed for her. She describes a river as, \\"darkly hoarding secrets beneath its glimmering veneer.\\" I am not joking.

The two Balkan Wars of the 1912-1913 were bloody affairs, and it is a shock to see a writer of the British aristocracy treat them with contempt. Joyce seems to more concerned with what he is eating, and his fellow countrymen's particular personalities than with reporting the bloody conflict. Only in the later part of the book do we get a view of some of the conflict's results. Perhaps this was strictly a personal journal of the writer's own feelings and was not meant for publication. If that is so, it shows the disdain this author had for the victims of the Balkan Wars.There is not much info in this book. If one likes his novels, then this may be a book to read.

I think Garth Nix should make Tal the Emperor, since he's now very powerful and all with the Violet Keystone in his hands. It also has a cliffhanger.

Then I realized that the latter refered to nueral nets. Assuming that the nets referred to are analog, there is no contradiction. Godel's Theorom proved the incompleteness of formal language systems, a.k.a. digital systems, which constitute a smaller information set than analog systems. Mathematically, analog systems do not meet the neccessary conditions for Godel's Proof to apply. However, the claim to 'completeness', if it be made, is ungrounded. Analog systems simply represent a higher information dimension, not an infinite information dimension."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rhyming dictionary for songwriters.","review":"I have many rhyming dictionaries and I use online rhyming dictionaries.This one is the best.

In the expansions to previous Total War games, the developers focused exclusively on one area of the main game's campaign map. In this expansion, each primary area of the map has its own unique campaign.Each unique campaign has its own set of new elements added to both game play and unit builds.The Kingdoms expansion is very much a value added product. And, as with all the games in this franchise, there is even more potential for extended replayability and enhanced enjoyment once the modders have their go at tweeking and mutating it to fit their own wants and ideas. The Total War franchise has a very strong and dedicated modder base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expansion? Or expensive mods? You be the judge.","review":"Firstly, I love Medieval.

Bauhaus were a good live band but that simply doesn't come through on this album. On most of the songs Peter Murphy sounds like he is out of breath as he keeps cutting words short. The bonus tracks though are simply the worst. They sound like an undiscernable wall of noise, and then 'Waiting for My Man' is the finale of terribleness, as Peter's and Lou Reed's voices don't jel in any way whatsoever. It is ruined by the feeling that they are both singing blindly over the top of each other. Sigh.

I read it in fits and starts I kept on putting it down and not bothering to pick it up again. Characters could have been developed to a much greater degree. The historical/plot explanations where skimpy to say the least. All that I could have put up with and not bothered to express my dissent in a forum that generally deals with positive recommendations. No what's got me typing a negative review is the proselytizing that is threaded throughout the book, I really resent being preached at.

Unfortunetly, that doesn'y make up for the fact that half the time i don't know what is going because the characters will switch so abruptly and the setting is sometimes hard to follow/understand. it kind of frightens me to think that this book will soon become a series, because frankly (sorry Catherine Jinks) this book is boring. the begining was funny and understandable enough, but too bad the rest of the novel just isn't like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Calvins out there with sass:","review":"Is it just me or are there very few teen series out there in a guy's perspective?

I have not been disappointed.The first book is pure Crusade stuff, with dates and smelly old lepers and annoying tourists. It gives you a day-in-the-life perspective with Pagan's cutting (yet observant) remarks.

Set in Jeruselem when it was under Christian rule in the 12th century, Pagan is a half Arab, therefore a half enemy for the suspicious minded, a fact that can cause him trouble from time to time. Previously enrolled with the city garrison (and involved with some of the city's low-life), Pagan owes money and is therefore forced to enroll elsewhere. He went to the Knights of the Templar, or Knights of God. Hillariously told through his eyes, Pagan must learn about being the page for the knight Lord Roland deBram. As time and events wear on, these two build their friendship, and as the Turks threaten the holy city, Pagan is faced with losing that friendship, and so pushes his luck one more time in an effort to save it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for an excellent product.","review":"I love this watch.

Basically these tracks take those grooves and add on what really is so annoying about most others in the field, namely the typical pitfalls of drum and bass: loud artificial drum machines and casio-like atmospherics. Even the good tracks like \\"Empty Words\\" suffer.If you're a fan of the genre in general, this is nice double-cd to pick up.

Quite dissimilar to any of later works, each of the 5 tracks on this 'compilation' (I believe it's actually two EPs previously released, put on one LP) acts more of a 'piece' than a song, as one would expect from a musician whose origins are with classical piano, rather than Pop.

I know it was not Amazons fault this product is not being made anymore but by posting it maybe someone with knowledge can explain to me why. Why do you get rid of a money maker.

I thought the circles were cool and maybe helpful for baking, but I'd rather have a product that sealed to the counter better and wasn't so heavy. There's a seam down the middle (you can even see it on the product image if you look really close) that is super annoying considering you're using it to roll baked goods flat.

His 1967 paper on bankruptcy was the first to estimate a multivariate default prediction model. THAT'S 35 YEARS AGO. Things like computers and more data make both his estimation algorithm and parameter estimates relics of little significance, and his inability to recognize this is symptomatic of a more cluelessness exhibited in his discussion of other matters (he doesn't simply reference the old model; it's now irrelevant structure is examined and built upon throughout the book).Very little of what is here is new, and what's new isn't that good either. Freshmen looking for succinct references to someone their professor has heard of but not read will appreciate this volume.

I thought it contained a good amount of background and history of the island, as well as pointing out interesting, non-touristy places to go and things to do. It has a lively, engaging tone and is never dry or boring. I enjoyed just reading it to learn about Puerto Rico, aside from using it as a guide to the island.A more recent edition has been published, so therefore not all of the info in this edition is totally up to date (but of course, it is impossible to have a totally up-to-date travel book because by the time these books are published, some things will inevitably have changed).

Unreal to believe a person could be in these situations and squeeze off any coherent photos at all. Brief descriptions before certain sections as to the appropriate time period and context of said photos. The depth of emotion captured by these photos has to be seen. For those who were alive during this conflict and witnessed the daily tv coverage of this war, this book is a must. This was before the days of the \\"embedded\\" photojournalists and the censored views of the current conflicts we are allowed to view. Perhaps if we had people like Burrows, who were allowed to photograph the actual hostilities we are currently involved in we would have less public support for our incursions. Powerful book.

Althought the author has done a creditable job of collecting photos (mostly B&W), and reprinting vintage advertisements, no additional information, which might have added perspective or insight, is provided. How can you date a Parker Vacumatic? What years are indicated by three bands versus one? Which colors or model variations are most common or rarest? These are the types of information that would have made this book useful to both beginning and experienced collectors. Unfortunately, the author provides none of this, and what results is a virtually useless hodgepodge of recycled advertisements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 1988 Prices Only!","review":"Unlike most books on this subect, this edition has very few color photos and print quality is that of a copy machine.

The book is one of a series of Syngress books that the Shinders have written that cover the entire range of MCSE 2003 exams. I recommend all of those books, and they are, in fact, the books that I used to successfully pass all of the MCSE 2003 tests.

I secured large cup hooks to the ceiling, about an inch from the wall, and hung the speakers from them. They angle down at about 15 degrees, with their lower edges resting against the wall. I was planning on adding padding where they touch the wall, but the they're heavy enough so I didn't need it.I'm giving these 5 stars, not because I'm claiming they're high quality speakers, but because they are exactly what they were advertised to be. I had a couple of difficult-to-tune dead spots in the weirdly shaped room where my 7.1 system is living. They don't come anywhere near the presence of the system's MC1 Magnepans, but not 1 person in 100 will be able to pick up on the difference (including me).

Others had warned these didn't ship well. The one that worked sounded pretty good, seemed to deliver a full range and decent sound.

Up towards $100 now, but they should stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound, Bad Quality","review":"Each speaker sounds great (for the price), but one of the two has something rattling around inside. Normally, I would just open up the enclosure, but that seems to be impossible to do as the speaker grill is glued on and won't pry off. Because of this, 2/5. Bad quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sounding speakers... but read...","review":"I had the idea to use these speakers with my 200 watt Logitech speaker system, which I connect my ipod to at work. The original speakers were damaged and I tried these as replacements with the subwoofer. The sound is absolutely horrible. Cloudy and distorted. There is no treble or highs whatsoever, and the mid-bass is crazy loud. I believe the speakers are getting 25 watts per, which is considerably less than what theyre rated, so this probably contributes to the horrible performance. This is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because I am not quite using them right. But I cannot imagine them sounding very good in any situation. I put them in the trash and chalked it up as a loss.

The second one had what sounded like shards of plastic rattling around. The outer (Amazon) packaging was not damaged at all, so i conclude that the mounting of some heavy component inside the plastic cabinet is not very robust. I did get to play some classical music with the one functioning speaker, but, i wouldn't call it hi fi. It will serve the purpose, namely as a pair of under cabinet speakers in the kitchen for a Rocketfish wireless setup, but I certainly wouldn't bother to use these in my 5.1 surround setup. I asked for an exchange from Amazon, and will return the broken ones shortly, but, after reading similar experience reported by another reviewer, i am not too confident that the results will be much different.

The producers have done a credible job in presenting interviews with a dozen or so comedians and wanna-be's. But there's not many laughs in what seems to be a very cut-throat business. Yes, Dave Chappelle is one of the interviewees, sans humor.

Open Mic is mesmerizing, funny and enlightening, a great first work from a young director. It's a true accounting on Stand-up Comedy from some of the nation's best comics like the brilliant Richard Jeni who gives you an awesome inspiring lesson. Open Mic is so real and interesting.

It had everything I want in a book: wonderful writing (this was of the prose so clear I'm not aware of it variety), complex, interesting characters, and a feeling that there is a sensibility at work that is interested in things beyond the thrills of the story itself. In this case, the \\"something beyond\\" seemed to be illuminating a particular moment in U.S. history and of relationships--between whites and Native Americans--that ended in terrible tragedy.Cheryl Reavis is a wonderful writer, honest and wise, with a deceptive elegance to her prose.

My class is wonderful, but this book is very dry. I understand that the subject of cognitive psychology involves a lot of research and data and all this information is important to the study of this subject, but this book is very dry and personally boring. The whole book is a review of past research and analyzations of the subject and the author gives no thought of his own to the subject. If I wanted to know every little detail of every cognitive experiment I would look that exact experiment up. There is no basis of the book and it does not help me in the least little bit in my studies. The content is very dry and not attention holding.

However, I can describe the product and why I purchased this speaker system. After visiting Best Buy and hearing these speakers, I was blown away by the amount of sound that comes out of such tiny speakers. Sure other speakers may offer a small improvement in sound but do not come in such a small size. All the facts mentioned me to buy this speaker set. You can not even see them where I placed them and it sounds 1000 times better than just my tv speakers. If i had those other huge speakers, the room would be full of sound equipment.

The surround sound is excellent. However, it is lacking in the upper frequencies. Voices sound flat, almost muffled.

It is broken (produces no sound).I have heard similar Bose systems (I think the AM 5) and it produced a very thin sound where male voices sounded muffled.

I still own my origanal 301's bought in 1980 and have a set of 501's added later. I expected similar quality and sound with the Accoustimass series. I was badly mistaken. As mentioned in previous reviews, for $200-$300, these might be a good additional for a small start-up home theater. But for this price, just unacceptable. Sound quality is horrible.

I applied them to both front and back (to prevent punctures when leaping from leather furniture).

I ordered this product and it saved my sanity and my kitties digits! they were used to being clipped, so they sat fairly patiently while I glued the tips on. I pre-filled them with glue (according to directions)and just popped them on one at a time. I was really surprised at how quickly my kitties \\"forgot\\" about them. There are so many tips in the package and you only need to do the front paws, so if you lose one or two in the first few days it is no problem. They seem to lose about one a week with natural shedding, but I just replace it in a second. They are inexpensive and fun looking! Interesting outcome is that since they can't \\"get a grip\\" on my chairs they have completely lost interest in them.

The plusses are, the cat didn't notice them, they looked great on him, and while they lasted, they worked okay.

I was able to put them on my docile cat by myself very easily. The blue tips are great in that you can find them if they come off.

I trim my cat's claws, but I forget sometimes, so I liked this idea. Also, it gives me a visual reminder when claws need attention, since they are colored. They are expensive, $15, but I splurged on them anyway. I'm not quite sure why other reviewers are complaining about them not sticking, the adhesive acts like superglue! I had a hard time getting the glue in the cap, but I did get it on my pants (my pants are ruined), hands (I had to unstick a couple fingers) and near (almost in) my eye.

As usual, Scott interjects his own brand of humor, which occasionally is actually funny and often is just extraneous to the subject. Scott, however is straight forward and very clear with regard to step by step instruction on using channels in photoshop. He covers many different ways in which channels can be used to enhance photo's as well as masking and some special effects. This book will be very helpful to both beginning and intermediate photoshop users, it is easy to read and you can follow along with the example photos you can download from Scott's web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, an excellent book","review":"I'm an amateur digital photographer who deals with noise (used to be called grain in the film days), glare, sharpness (formerly focus), and other foibles. Photoshop CS2 has ways to address many of them, but using channels is a superb and subtle method for those difficult tasks that keep an image from being perfect. Using Scott Kelby's book has heightened my awareness of what is possible to quickly use in channels. His examples are excellent, and it is easy to explore the range of any given setting he suggests. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who desires to improve his/her digital imaging techniques. This is not a fix-all book but is a book to add to your library. It is an easy read and a very good reference book. It is NOT the definitive technical dissertation on the theory of channels. Many other books cover that esoteric knowledge.

I made sure there weren't any chunks in the chocolate and tried it again and once again it wouldn't turn at all. All the teenagers at my daughter's 16th birthday party had been really excited about the fountain, and everyone was sad when it stopped working.

I purchased it after the salesman discouraged me from a Dyson due to price, stating this works just as well. My hose comes unattached for no reason while vacuuming, allowing everything being swept in, to come straight out and me having to do the whole thing again. It does not do stairs well and the attachments do not have much suction. Emptying the canister is a real mess since the filter is in the canister.

The smell of burning rubber 5 minutes after turning it on really permeates the air.

Unfortunately, in my location I frequently have to change antennas to get usable reception when I change stations.The 2 alarms are a nice feature: each one can be set for weekdays/weekends/all days, so you can have a wakeup time/station on work days which is different from your weekend alarm choice.Bottom line: the radio died today after 10 months in service.

It lights up a room more than a child's night-light -- you can almost read by the light! Further, there's no brightness control (automatic or manual). There is a contrast control, but it's not a substitute. For all its brightness, the words on the display are also completely illegible if viewed from an extreme angle (like if the clock is on top of the headboard above a bed). You have to sit up in bed to read the clock.Bottom line, if the brightness of the display were adjustable, I give it 5 stars. Minus at least 3 stars (if not all 5) for the brightness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound and reception","review":"This is the richest sounding of the HD tabletop radio offerings, and I have found the HD reception to be excellent.

This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading.

I highly recommend that parents read this book and cite the gist of the book to your prospectice college student over time- Too much reality can demotivate/demoralize your child. Other books that were recommended by counselors,school, etc., placed the colleges on a pedestal as if they are altrusitic without a profit motive in mind.

Also, when I am in a store, sometimes, I accidently press too hard against my purse and the alarm goes off. But I deal with it because just holding it when I walk to my car in the dark is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough.","review":"I bought these as stocking stuffers for my three adult daughters, hoping they would help to keep them safe when alone, but they are basically just toys.

The novel-within-a-novel concept can work under certain circumstances but this is not one of them. The excerpt from the character Garcia's novel added nothing and were an irritating distraction from the main event. Alfau would have benefitted from having a good editor.

Compared with so much of what's out there, Emily Rodda's writing is a cut above. The stories in this series are gentle and familiar fantasy material -- but it's engagingly told, and suspenseful without being *too* scary for younger readers.This book, \\"The Third Wish\\", I very much liked for the twist Rodda puts on a classic fairy tale/fantasy trope.

It's all tight, rhythmic drive, where everything - drums, vocals, guitars, bass - are inseperable from the general, homogenous, grey effect. This setting is perhaps appropriate for some squirmingly honest lyrics, whose very precision in charting quick-switch moods point to the Go-Between's future.There are four songs that make the album worth listening to - 'One thing can hold us', the nearest thing to a tune; 'Midnight to neon', with its violent saxophone explosion; the proto-Pulp epic 'Eight Pictures', an uncomfortably comic story of voyeurism and violation; and 'Careless', with a guitar solo that lights up the album like a flare in the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent cd","review":"I've really enjoyed this karaoke cd, very good list of songs and well-done.

The frother is okay- but not like the professional series. I do not think it makes enough in one setting. THis product is good for one person but not for entertaining guests as you would spend your whole time in the kitchen. I plan on upgrading very soon. Overall the product is worth the price but if you are looking for a Starbucks version you may want to spend the extra money. The brand itself is great- and the DVD that comes with the product was very informative. I hate reading through instructions so I watched the video and was able to start using the product right away.

It's fast to boil water and has perfect ratio for steam pressure, so it holds enough pressure to froth even coarser grinds. In the past year i forgot to clean it with vinegar, so the steam spout got plugged, however it was really easy to disassemble and clean the insides. When disassembled, it revealed well made components that were cleverly put together. The unit is assembled in Portugal (which in my experience makes some of the best coffee in the world) and the metal assembly seems to be German (Blockmann?). After all these years the seals are still holding up great (these are made of thick rubber, unlike some other makes).

Making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions (I didn't watch the video). The frother even works well. The problem I had was with the flavor. The manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time, but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing.

The price is right, and it's simple to use. The DVD quickly gets you up to speed on how to use it. Makes about 4 shots of espresso at a time. No tamping is needed when putting the espresso in. You only get about 60 seconds of steam when you're steaming your milk.

I do not think the machine gets to a high enough temperature, but i was willing to let that go... since it was only $59.99. I was going to keep it, but then, less than a week into use (one cup a day), the rubber ring in the water resevoir came off... and when brewed the next cup, it did not provide a sufficient seal... and now it's kaput!Now I have to go through the hassle of returning and researching another coffee maker!

Continuing: \\"Perhaps you are confusing this machine with a true pump machine. This machine uses the old-fashion steam method; the steam gets hotter and hotter.... You should only brew 2 shots at a time if you do not like the taste of the second two shots.\\"I returned the machine because the \\"hotter\\" steam begins to burn the coffee grounds as the brew proceeds to the third shot. The resultant smell and coffee taste is badly fouled-burnt. Apparently, this is part of the design, which the people at Capresso describe as \\"the normal operation of the machine.\\" When the machine is returned to me, I will be discarding it.FYI, at the time of this writing, Capresso's website was down. I'm wondering if they are actually in business. Just be wary of this company, their products, and their product support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little machine","review":"First of all, this tiny appliance is extremely light and hardly occupies any counter space. Very compact.2. Hooking it up is very straightforward.3. Brewing starts in about 30 seconds and in less than a couple of minutes, there is enough steam built up to steam the milk.4. The tiny machine produces enough steam to really heat up the milk, without having to use the microwave. This is one thing that my other cheaper machine could never do. I always had to heat up the milk in the MW before frothing. Kudos for that.5. I even tried using the steamed milk directly with instant coffee and it just tastes amazing. :)My one complaint - steaming is a little noisy, as if it is going to blow up any minute. A little unnerving in a quiet house."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"I bought this machine after a friend told me my old krupps wasn't working properly.

The Capresso is a little more compact than the Krupps, but still makes a great cup of espresso.

We just like a hot fresh cup of espresso with some cream and milk.Update 7/6/2008:After a couple years of daily use (up three batches a day, every day), the unit gave out. Not sure exactly happened, it just doesn't turn on any more. We decided to try a similarly priced DeLonghi, but are very unhappy with it, and have decided to return it.

I like that it operates cleanly enough to sit on the counter of the built-ins in my dining room. There is good clearance overhead there and this works out perfectly since the Capresso Mini-S works with steam. And it is an attractive addition to my decor. This little machine has allowed me to make my very own in-house cafe. The Mini-S proves that bigger and more expensive isn't necessary to achieve marvelous Espresso and at, what I anticipate will be, a great savings. I'm over the moon happy with my purchase!

There were only around 500 printed. It was signed by Powers. Why on Earth would Amazon (or whoever it was) place a sticker on the back (very crookedly) with the ISBN number? Couldn't they have bagged it and placed the sticker on the bag? Personally, I don't care, but being in the business I've been in for 16 years, I know plenty of collectors who will. Bad move, sticker guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vignette","review":"Not complete enough to be a short story - more of a mood piece or sample of Tim Powers' storytelling. But if you want to check out Powers, go with something meatier like The Anubis Gate or Drawing of the Dark. The Bible Repairman is for people who would buy Powers' grocery list just because Tim Powers wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for parents of kids with retained reflexes!","review":"This book is like a bible for retained reflexes. It does an excellent job of showing how each retained reflex impacts the body and then explains the resulting cascade of symptoms that can be seen from each retained reflex. I had been searching for something to tie all of my daughters symptoms together, so instead of a dozen of seperate problems or diagnoses we could have one problem with many symptoms. This would allow me to focus on the best treatment plan for my daughter. This book was it!!! If you are at a loss as to why your child has the behaviors or deficits he or she does, you may be able to read the symptoms under each retained reflex and see if any is a close match for your child. If so you can request to have your child tested for that reflex for confirmation. It is simple, quick and non-invasive to have done. Parents or the child's care giver is a child's best advocate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful and informative","review":"It's written more for therapists than lay people, but the summaries of each reflex, how to test, symptoms of imbalance are very digestible and easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice look but poor quality","review":"This triangle looks real nice and has a long and strong leather strap to hang the triangle and the striker from. Too bad the paint chipped off after using it twice. The first time left several impact cracks along the striker and the second use is when the paint started to fly off. And before you say it, no I was going going to town with the striking force or speed. Just normal easy going clanging. If this is for decorative use, go for it, if you actually want to use it regularly or even occassionally go for another brand and preferably not something painted but in cast iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lodge Original Finish Chuckwagon Dinner Bell with Striker","review":"This dinner bell does its job and sounds good, but the paint on the triangle is chipping where struck by the striker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably terrible quality","review":"We have recently moved to the country side and had looked forward to purchasing a dinner bell to call the family in from outside. I opened the Lodge Original Finish Chuckwagon Dinner Bell tried it out right away. On the very first strike, bits of black coating flew off the triangle's surface. I tried several more strikes, and each time the striker hit the bell, bits of coating came off. We immediately returned the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and haunting tribute","review":"Kristy wrote this song after the tragedy on 9/11.Everytime i hear her tribute to all those lost souls, i am moved to tears.The premise of this song is summed up by its title - a housewife kisses her hubby goodbye on his way to work, not knowing he would be both a victim and a hero not much later that day over a field near Philadelphia.Kristy performs this song at many functions that raise funds for 9/11 charities. In fact, she donates some or all of the royalties derived from sales of the single to the same charities.Check out Kristy's other songs/albums - theyre a mix of country/pop/ballad/blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome way to clear the cobwebs out of your mind...","review":"I've been searching and seeking truth's... I knew there was more to life than the insanity of my self destructive thoughts and all the other mental garbage I've been carrying around. If you're seeking positivity, look no further. So simple, and Louise's voice so calming, if you seek awareness - here it is. The suggestion is to listen to it daily for a month. I've owned it for months now and sometimes when I'm feeling out of balance by uncontrollable factors (work) - I find my head racing with negative thoughts, I pop in my 101 Power Thoughts and listen to daily until I feel my life realign and the peacefulness returns. Change your thoughts, change your life, it's in your hands, and it's possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cambia mi día para bien...","review":"Es Louise Hay... es lo máximo. La escucho en la mañana y me reconforta todo el día."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical but...........WOW!","review":"I couldn't imagine what to expect from this CD. I popped it in the player and out came a soft friendly voice telling me what I deserve out of life. It was great to hear that I deserve goodness in life and deserve to be loved because Im me. I sure hadn't told myself that before. These and a ton of other affirmations seemed more valid to me since they were coming from an unbiased third party. This started to get my brain going on the right track. Hopefully soon I can regularly implement (think them, say them and believe them) these power thoughts during the day especially if negative mind chatter pops up. I do highly recommend this CD. Each time after listening to it I feel so uplifted, positive, peace of mind, and relaxed. Ive started putting it in while doing household chores and while in the car. Like another review states its very soothing and relaxing to listen to....that surprised me. Thanks Louise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Only one improvement I feel is needed. The CD only has 2 tracks divided in half. So its kind of hard to use the repeat on your player if you want to hear the same affirmation over and over again.But, overall this is a great CD. Its a nice change of pace from talk radio. Louise Hay's voice is soothing, and loving and when listening to it you just feel at peace.I recommend this for anyone who wants to replace the constant mind chatter with something inspiring and something to help change your thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone that listens is surprised, inspired, and motivated","review":"Have used as an 'affirmations' tool to help people develop positive, affirmations related to their current situation and coping.

It doesn't start out very good. It reminds me a little of the urine cake in a men's urinal. HOWEVER, if you give it a minute or two, it has a nice floral smell that is good for Spring when things are in bloom and smells like lilacs or a little like night jasmine and also powdery.It also has good staying power. I recommend it as a body splash rather than just an after shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal","review":"I must agree with those that write that this product smells like urinal cakes. Immediately after removing the cap from the bottle, the aroma of a men's bathroom filled my nose. For those who like the scent, remember this, you may appreciate the scent, but the chances are quite good that someone in your company will think that you smell like the urinal at their favorite bar. Why take that chance when there are other products?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The classic formula seems to have been changed","review":"I have used Lilac Vegetal for about 40 years since I was in college and say their ad in Playboy, so I'm not new to the rodeo.Anyhow, the latest product seems to be a new formula with mych less \\"lilac\\" and more of a \\"paint thinner\\" fragrance."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to the reviews...","review":"I ordered this BEFORE reading the reviews, and having received it today I can agree with the whole \\"urinal cake\\" description. This stuff STINKS....It really does smell like a truck stop bathroom. It's not bad if you are into that, but I gave it away within minutes of having first tried it. I even poured some out and let it sit/breathe as somebody had suggested. That DID help, but it still was offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lilac Vegetal","review":"I've tried many aftershaves and found this one lacking. It has an aroma of cold medicine and flowers. The bottle was tossed after first use. This is a personal opinion of course and Clubman Pinaud makes many good products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Lot's of people love this; but to me it smelled like old people at a funeral parlor. I re-gifted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells really bad, actually.","review":"I wanted to like this stuff, but it doesn't smell good at all, not even in small quantities. I was drawn to it because it claims a subtle lilac smell, which is fairly unique in men's grooming and hygiene products. I love lilac. This smells less like lilac and exactly like the wipes my wife uses to clean out our hedgehog's cage, Nature's Miracle Deodorizing Cage Wipes (http://www.amazon.com/NMIR-ANI-CAGE-WIPES-35COUNT/dp/B0010OQGH6/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1333322065&sr;=1-1-catcorr).It's also very runny, just completely watery, no thickness to it at all. That's fine, I suppose, but when I hear the word \\"vegetal\\" I think of something more substantial than this. It's probably better than most of the goop on the shelves today, but it stinks. I recommend this instead: Nivea For Men Revitalizing Balm (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FPZAFC/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details); sometimes modern products really are improvements over the old timey ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the most god awful stuff i have ever put on, My wife told me it smells like douche and i am just trying to be honest. I won't be buying this anymore either."},{"rating":"1","title":"scent of urine","review":"This product enables the user to acquire the smell of urine. Should you desire to emanate such a rare fragrance, instead of urinating upon your clothing or even your skin, simply purchase and liberally apply this product. In addition to imparting such an unpleasant smell, this product has a long post-application life. Once I applied it after shaving, then took a shower and washed my face and the smell could still be detected. I then washed my face a second time with soap and went to bed; I could still smell the vegetal on my face in the morning.It is unfortunate that this awful product mars the otherwise excellent Pinaud line. I would highly recommend the \\"clubman\\" and \\"bay rum\\" products by the same company, both are excellent masculine aftershaves, without a hint of the scent of urine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid","review":"Don't buy this product because it has a rancid odor that you can't get rid of and you can't return the item because it is considered (Hazardous Waste)...\\"No pun intended\\" UPDATE FOR RANCID--So as to not make it a total waste, instead of using it on yourself just use it as a toilet bowl cleaner, that is what I am using it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible smell","review":"Just received it, opened it and poured it down the toilet. It smells that bad! There is a pungent and very offensive odor in this bottle and a urinal cake is perfumy compare to this aftershave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eau de Urinal","review":"I'm amazed at the positive reviews for this stuff. Due to its legendary status on a wet shaving board I frequent, I picked up some Lilac Vegetal over the weekend and tried it out for myself. It's definitely a love it or hate it fragrance. And I......HATE IT! Does it smell like lilac? Sure, if the lilac you're looking for is a lilac disinfectant cake covered in stale urine. You think I'm kidding? IT SMELLS LIKE STALE URINE. No really... it smells like an unkept public urinal. Well, that's how it smells in, and right out of, the bottle. After an hour or two on the skin, the urine scent finally gives way to a soft, flowery fragrance. But even that fragrance isn't pleasant, and you won't be able to wash it off fast enough!I'm not sure why HUMAN MEN would want to smell like this. Maybe men in 1840 wanted to smell like this. However, it's not 1840 anymore. Even though I love the other classic Pinaud fragrances, this one should've stayed buried in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like Wet Ones..AWFUL..","review":"This stuff is awful..I have 8 Clubman bottles of different type,,,but this stuff smells like the wipes you get to wipe yourself...this is going down the drain. All my other Clubman stuff I love..this one no way..Maybe I got a bad one but I doubt it. Some thought it smelled like damp diapers..sorry Clubman..but this one stinks... I didn't know what Lilacs smell like....but I know know..I will never pick them.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This fragrance reminds me of when I was a little kid in the 70's and I would go visit my grandmothers friends.

Who do I speak to about getting a credit or getting the product finally delievered?Six months later product finally was received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"Works as it should as an aftershave, but I don't care for the scent. It is not offensive, just not my 'style'. It has an aroma reminiscent of Johnson's baby powder, very mild, and, as I said, not offensive. I will stick with the original scent from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for me","review":"I had read all of the warnings that I would either \\"love it or hate it\\" and I definitely find myself loving it the more I use it. Similar to Lime Sec (which I previously reviewed) it smells very odd in the bottle. The first time I splashed it on I didn't know what to make of it. After using it for a few days I found myself reaching for \\"The Veg\\" instead of the Lime Sec on warm-weather days. When the weather is cool I prefer classic Clubman After Shave lotion or the Vanilla.Bottom line: don't rush to judgement on Lilac Vegetal. If you're a fan of classic manly scents, you'll want this in your arsenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Steak's effort","review":"The Swinging Steaks have another winner in their newest release. As with prior releases from this Boston band, vocal harmonies and fine musicianship combine to bring life and energy to songs ranging from mild country to pure Americana. \\"Good Day\\" opens the disc with a postive vibe that has been rummaging around in my mind since my first listen. Interesting lyrics, great guitar licks and bristling keyboard play lift this record. If you enjoy roots rock and roll, give this record a listen. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"This is great for any train fan.

I know how dedicated he is to something he loves doing, and it is evedent on this recording! \\"Forevever is Never Far Away\\" is a great uplifting song. \\"House of Dreams\\" has to be one of the best constructed songs I've heard in a long time.This record really captures the spirit of the indy rock scene in Atlanta during that time (early 90's)I really enjoy how raw this album's recording sound is...giving it a personal feel. To know Gerard is a real treat...and so is this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Dillon?","review":"One of the best songwriters of our time. It's a shame more people don't know about him. Listen to the words in this album. You'll be a better person for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyper-spritual and unbalanced","review":"Though I usually love to read brother Nee's works, though they are Brethren-influenced and dispensational, I found that Spiritual Man was especially unbalanced and hyper-spiritual.It is based on the shaky premise that man is a tri-partite being, and builds a whole spiritual theology from that foundation. It is taken to such an extreme, that the translators had to invent the terms, \\"soulical\\" and \\"soulish\\" to help explain brother Nee's ideas.This book will most likely appeal to Charismatics, Christians interested in mysticism, and emotional people on a spiritual quest, but will not likely interest or help people seeking a plain Biblical theology. And even though some of the operations of the Holy Spirit in the believers life are well explained by brother Nee, I feel that his \\"insights\\" would do more harm than good to those Christians who are unfamiliar with the precious Word of G-d."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallacious Appeals to Emotion","review":"I found this book to be riddled with gross numbers of logical fallacies that were unsupported by any degree of physical evidence. For anyone with a proper education this book is nothing but insulting to ones intellect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life (and Eternity) Changing!","review":"Watchman Nee taught in the manner of the Apostle Paul--great wisdom and authority tempered by the heart of a lamb. The Spiritual Man has been a regular part of my spiritual diet since 1988. Volume 2 contains the most enlightening material I have ever read or heard on the function of the conscience. I have used many of Nee's principles and truths in counseling over the years. Countless people have been blessed by Nee's insights. Becoming \\"The Spiritual Man\\" is my ultimate obsession in life. I have incorporated the truths about communion, conscience, and intuition into my life, and I have taught these same truths in pastoral ministry. If you are looking for keys to unlock the secrets of spiritual fellowship with the Lord, look no further. The Spiritual Man will fascinate and enlighten you from the day you begin studying it until you see your Lord face-to-face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Anointed Minister","review":"I have quite a collection of Minister Watchman Nee's teachings and I must say that I find all of them extremely helpful in my quest to be knowledgeable in the Word of God. No one is perfect, except Jesus Christ, and Jesus said that he would send the Comforter when He returned to the Father. I believe Minister Nee dedicated his life to Jesus Christ and my savior the Lord Jesus anointed him with the knowledge that he possessed and the Comforter led Minister Nee to write and teach as he did. The Spiritual Man is a must-read for those who need to learn more about how we as children of God should walk. Read it in addition to the Holy Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life","review":"I concur with all the previous reviewers of this book. It was the first of his books I read. I read it as a small boy not yet a teen, then a few years later as a teen in High school, then 10 years later as a young, but grown adult. 20 years later in my mid-life I read it and found that it tell me so many new things, because as I have grown older, the truths in it are more real to me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I missed the boat by not reading sooner...","review":"I am half way through this book and I can tell you I do not have the same relationship with the Father. I see myself in the illustrations, right down to the core. While I thought I had been serving G-d, I have been trying to impress man. No more...This book is repetitious but that is what drives the point home. Different ways to reach the same conclusion will offer the reader several ways to see what Brother Nee is saying.I cannot say enough, other than get this book and read it. If your not changed, then sow it into the life of a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"I am only one third through the book, but I have learned more about our human spirit and how it relates to God and the Holy Spirit, than all other theologians I have read.

We have been enjoying them ever since. It's funny how our dogs and cat enjoy laying in front of them also ... almost like they are mesmerized by the \\"flames.\\" I'm sure they enjoy the heat as well. We live in South Texas, so it's not like it gets THAT cold here ... but it does get cold enough where we use the for warmth, but when it's not cold, we like to use the fire feature without the heat because it's just so relaxing! :)The remote is an AWESOME feature ... you can be all comfy cozy in bed and turn it off and on without having to get up.We love them. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC IN EVERY WAY!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You will be DELIGHTED with this stove/heater!!!!!!It is perfect in every way!!!!

On the stove itself the damage was a dent in the cage that surrounds the heater. Dent is not noticable because it is located in the back of the unit. Heater itself seemed to work OK. However, I do notice a vibration that comes and goes after the unit has been running. This may or may not be a result of the impact that must have occurred to receive the dent. All that said, I really enjoy my faux stove. The fire is amazingly realistic and provides a nice atmosphere without the smoke and ash. The 1500W heater works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit / good value","review":"We like this unit a lot. If you buy a 1500 watt unit, remember that it is limited as to how much it can heat. Our house is old and it is cold where we live in the winters. We bought this unit to go into our old fireplace (which we don't use any more). It looks great, works like a charm, is cool to the touch, stable, & offers a quiet heater. Our one major complaint is the thermostat control knob. It has no reference marks for setting the thermostat and the knob is on the back. If the unit is in the fireplace (or tucked in somewhere), it makes it difficult to change the thermostat setting. Our house is small, so it was a thrill to find a smaller unit that was reasonably priced, looks great, offers a nice looking flame, works just like any decent 1500 watt heater works, is safe for kids and pets, and was shipped quickly, packed well, and had no defects when it arrived. Great value for the money! We liked it so well, that we bought another one for our back guest bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after only 4 months of use.","review":"I was very very happy with how the fireplace worked , it is bigger than I expected and looks really nice . I WAS very happy with my purchase ..UNTIL ... 4 months later, it broke down. The built in thermostat is not working , it heats only for about 5 minutes and then the heat shuts off, no its not the curcuit its on, its the fireplace. I have a cheaper model that was heating my attic now I am currently using it in place of this one now. I ordered a sightly larger model ( not a dimplex) a more expensive one , which I should have done in the first place. I Wasted my money on this one . I will pass this broken down fireplace on to an aunt who lives in a hot APT and doesn't need the heater, she will enjoy the flame effect. I don't recommend buying this disapointing product, it would have been wonderful if it just kept working, you get what you pay for I guess.

Flames are very realistic for a cheap fireplace and I like the remote and thermostat on this model. We're using this fireplace in a 500 square foot living/dining area, so the best I can say is that it took the chill out of the small section where it's located. If you stand a foot away it does warm your body, however because the fan is on the bottom and the legs are short, a lot of the heat seems to stay low and go into the carpet right in front of the door. This spot will be cat or dog heaven for napping.This would probably work better in a bedroom or office where it could be used when you turn down your home thermostat. For $150 this is pretty much what I expected and it does cast a warm glow, especially at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears to work quite well; NOT Dimplex or U.S.-made","review":"Though I haven't had a chance to use it on a consistent basis (not cold enough yet), the Electric Stove seems to work well.

The first time the stove was delivered, there was a million shards of glass inside of the box. It looked like someone had thrown the stove onto the ground. Amazon's return policy is so easy, that I was not upset. It was picked up from my doorstep two days later, and was replaced with a new one in its place. But the new one had the same problem, with also one of the walls falling off. The box, and the styrofoam was broken, from the shipping. Now the box, and the stove is sitting on my porch. The ups man would not pick up the package because the box was so damaged. I don't know what Amazon is going to do. But with two deliveries, I am going to give up on getting my stove through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimplex CS3311 Compact Electric Stove","review":"This Dimplex CS3311 electric stove is a great little unit for the price. At 1400 watts it's not going to break the bank on electricity useage nor is it going to blow your socks off with heat. 1400 watts is about all you're going to get in a heater like this as that's about all the average electrical outlet can handle.The flame action is really nice and as realistic as you'll find in a unit like this.I gave it 5 stars because this stove does exactly what it claims to do. With reasonable expectations you'll be very satisfied.If you need a lot of heat, need to heat a room quickly or you have a large room to heat you'll probably be disappointed in this portable heater (or any 1400 watt electric heater for that matter). For smaller rooms it will keep things nice and cozy.

It's a chilly room. One of the pleasures of the unit is that I can click it on from the bed and watch the pseudo-flames dance while the room heats up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy!","review":"Got a great deal and a great heater! This thing has been working 24/7 for the last couple weeks. Temps were down as low as 8 degrees here, but I stayed warm. The thermostat seems to work well, so set it and forget it.

[It was also priced $50.00 higher.] Our house isn't very big, but it takes a lot of oil to heat up the 1st floor. We use the older stove downstairs in the LR or DR. It's on most evenings, for about 6 hrs. Our electric bill seemed to rise by about $10/month. After some thought & our old furnace dying abruptly, we decided to purchase a second Electralog for the upstairs bedrooms. Even though our new furnace is energy efficient, keeping the thermostat turned down and using the stoves will cost us less than we've ever paid- to be warm! The furnace is set at 62*, it's in the low 50*s outside [damp and raw], and both of the little stoves are on. We're warm and comfortable. By the way- Dimplex is the manufacturer. I called them and was told they manufacture with different names, depending on what the retailer wants. Our new one came with 'Electralog' on the plate."},{"rating":"2","title":"electric stove","review":"I am very pleased with this product.

I like it so much it hasn't left my den so I have ordered a 2nd one. The flame is more realistic than one a bought at Wal-Mart a couple of years ago. It is sitting a cross the room from me and my toes are very harm. However, I have not used it as a sole heating source."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wonderful Product\\"","review":"I ordered this, hoping to lower my electric bill and to make our living room have a more cozy feeling.I have recieved my electric bill and it helped lower my bill by $70.00. Since, This product could really pay for itself over time. I am looking to purchase another for use in another part of our home. Once I turned this little heater on our central unit did not need to kick on anymore.I use it in my living / kitchen space which is 500 sq. ft. The rest of the doors in the house were left open, but it would need a 2nd heater to evenly heat the entire house of 1170 sq ft. The look is true to the photo and a very nice addition to the room. The flame effect is appealing. Love the fact that you can unplug it right after it being in operation and move it without the outside of the unit being hot.Very Happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.....","review":"Item died after not even two years.

After bringing it up from storage to use the next year it didn't work. The fan was no longer working, causing the unit to get hot and turn itself off. We called Dimplex/electrolag and they replaced a part as it was still under warranty. It sounded like a very common problem as they did not even ask for receipt of purchase or even wait for us to really explain the problem. This replacement part worked this winter. Now we are into year 2 and our 3rd winter. After bringing the unit up from storage it has the same problem, just as before. I bought this brand because I thought it was durable and this unit would last me a long time. Clearly it doesn't2. The heat blows from the bottom. However much of the heat gets trapped into warming the carpet and floor underneath the unit. I think the unit would be more effective if the heat was blown from the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this heater last year. It worked well for 1 winter (that's approximately 3 months of use) but gave out after a few days of use this winter. For the price I paid, I was hoping to use it for a much longer period than that. It looks really nice and the log flames were pretty but another brands (similiar model) looked more realistic. Another negative about this product is that the control panel are in the back and very limited in fuctionality. I have seen similiar brands with control panel in the front (with more options and functionality), hidden inside the door. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"crooked leg on back cute stove","review":"Crooked leg on fireplace. Looks great other than that it is a good few inches shorter the leg..

They are hard to buy for, so that alone means it's a great item to buy. They are enjoying the lovely flames at night with and without heat.

I shipped it through True Value and they were also great at customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compair with older models","review":"Expected dimplex quality and was disappointed. The product now has the name Electralog on it. Nowhere will you find Dimplex's name. Not sure if Electralog makes these for Dimplex. And they are made in China.The one shipped to me had some cosmetic flaws. But worst is I am afraid to use it because it gets very hot and makes my laminate flooring too hot to step on. I'm keeping my old one to use as a heater and am only using the electric fireplace and not the heater on this one.If you must have an electric stove buy the $100 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!! (worked well for a while)","review":"I bought this stove a couple of years ago and it worked great! We put it in our drafty kitchen and I LOVED it. Recently, it became tempermental. We never ran it unless we were in the room, and never ran it for extended periods of time. Finally, it completely stopped working. My husband was hoping maybe a fuse blew on it, so he opened it up and found that the wire inside that was the main power draw MELTED!!! The plastic coating around the wire was melted leaving a dangerously exposed power wire. Thank God nothing happened and that we were always careful with the stove, but this could easily have caught on fire. I won't purchase this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimplex CS3311 Stove","review":"I have found this to be a very nice little stove. So far it has done a very good job of heating a 330 square feet space that was consistently 10-15 colder than the rest of the house. I'll withhold final judgement until it gets really cold outside - but so far so good. One nice thing about this stove that I couldn't find in the other reviews is that the whole case is made of metal and not plastic or MDF like a lot of the other stoves I looked at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stove!","review":"I am so impressed with this electric stove! We needed heat for our sun room so that we can enjoy it year-round. We have a propane stove, but I wanted something safer for my toddler son to be around. After shopping around, I decided on this stove. It is perfect! The design is very nice and sturdy and the fire looks amazingly real! It puts out great heat -- I was able to heat our sun room in about 10 minutes. The design is small, but it works great in our sun room and can be easily put away in the summer. I would definitely recommend this stove to friends. It is a great alternative to gas or wood-burning stoves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, wow, wow","review":"What a great product at a great price. Flame looks great, puts out tons of heat. Remote works well.One thing this has that I did not realize is a thermostat. It will kick on the heating unit automatically once it detects that the room has cooled below your set point. Great feature.It is somewhat small, great for a smaller room, but don't expect this to dominate the room as a monster type fireplace.Free shipping was super fast. I ordered it on a Wednesday and got it on a Saturday.I love mine and recommend it to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fireplace glow, good heater","review":"I love the mellow glow of the logs, and the fire effect is realistic for this price range. I leave the \\"fire\\" on every evening just for the atmosphere.The heater (which has a separate switch from the fireplace) is powerful and very quiet. The thermostat takes some fiddling; the instructions tell you to listen for a click, but it's difficult to hear. But once it's set you're good to go.Aside from the thermostat, there's no setup at all. Just lift it out of the box, plug it in, and turn it on.The unit itself has a substantial feel, with a powder-coated finish and a bit of weight to it. I can still carry it easily from room to room.I'm very pleased with the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this unit and was truely excited to try it out for myself. I put it into our den where we watch the most TV and not only does it look realistic, but it heated up the entire room and we had to turn it down. The technology of the flame makes it look as real as can be expected. I've seen other units that look like the flame is on a mirror behind. This one looks like it is all around the logs. The heat comes from below, so the unit stays cool to the touch.The price paid is well worth the value you receive.

This is one of the lowest. Bland, anonymous studio musician rock with lyrics that are so over-the-top that they become unintentionally funny.

Really! Honest! Of course anyone who believed that would also want to invest in Lou's shares in the Brooklyn Bridge or his offering of great real estate in South Florida.The best thing about this album is the cover. Nothing else on here is worth bothering with. Most of Lou's output on Arista records showed him at his least interesting, and this one unfortunately is one of the worst (only surpassed by the truly abysmal \\"The Bells,\\" which no one should be forced to listen to).God bless Lou Reed, but give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literate but mainstream rock","review":"This is a very literate Lou Reed album, and not one of the critics' favourites.

Once satisfied by material possessions and career advancement, he finds himself longing for the simplicity and beauty of life in the small Mexican village. His ambition turns quickly towards realizing his new goal: leaving all of the constraints behind and enjoying life in La Paz. Life in La Paz moves on at its own pace, enveloping him and those like him who appreciate the beauty inherent in simple existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and insightful","review":"This is a good little (130 page) book.

The Sea of Cortez is a renowned diving area, and Ray Cannon's book, The Sea of Cortez, is an example of what can be done with such a book.This is a good first book for a young author who obviously loves diving.Joseph (Joe) Pierre"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grand Study of Character","review":"Many poetry collections are big on style and light on substance, but with TOWARD EVENING AND THE DAY FAR SPENT, poet Stephen Frech combines both with astounding beauty and depth. Interpreting the life of Christ is a daunting and risky task, but Mr. Frech is able to pull it off with a great deal of grace and humanity. These poems present us with a life that doesn't exclude us but includes us; a life, much like our own, that is touched with beauty, sadness, failure and redemption. The genius of Mr. Frech's poems is their ability to show us that we are not alone when it comes to pain, joy, wonder and disappointment. And for a brief moment, these 14 poems allow us to ponder the fact that a life so complicated and strange as that of Christ's, may not be so different from our own strange and complicated lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it!","review":"Encaustic is a truly amazing band.

But in the book Luke the plot was boring (he saves the helpless girl) and the chemistry was not intense enough for me. He loves her from page 1 (like a puppy/too sappy for me) and drops everything to follow her to a conference (when supposedly she despises him and she does not want his help). I guess it was too unrealistic for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this book!","review":"Luke has it all -- suspense, steam, and characters you can fall in love with.

As any performer can tell you, presentation is at least half if not most of performing. For example, just knowing the steps doesn't make you a dancer.True there are a (very) few full tricks included in the text, but this book would best be used as a companion book with some other that focused less on prestidigitation, and more on presentation, patter, and performance.That being said, the authors do a fantastic job explaining and displaying the sleights, and buying this book was money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Clear Illustrations","review":"This is a good instructional book with several close-up manipulation magic tricks.

If you are a beginner I would not recommend this book. It's books like this that will make people turn away from magic. The concepts are good in this book, but the drawings are difficult to match with the instructions. The drawings and the explanations can cause a great deal of frustration and make one want to pass on tricks all together. Most of the stuff in this book is covered in Mark Wilson's book (which has 10 times better pics and explainations), so if you want just a few more tricks then get it, but altogether I wish that I hadn't bought it.The only real good thing about this book is that it has some good cigarette vanishes and a good routine, but it may take you 10 hours o decipher what you are actually looking at. For beginners...not really...if you are a beginner...go to Mark Wilson.

Then this is the book for you. Tarr focuses on \\"sleight-of-hand\\" as shown in the title, which is to differentiate the practices depicted in this book from the more gear-intensive stuff you'll run into at magic shows. The advantage is obviously that it's low-tech and more skill-dependent, so you don't need too much equipment to wow friends and family. Techniques are taught pictorially so there's a minimum of sifting thru jargon and material that's tough to visualize. Best of all, you don't need any background in the field, making this the perfect beginner's item. A good way to nourish that magic-fancy you've always had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes on book","review":"This book is very detailed in its wording and illustrations.

Well...something like this release by Main. Definitely working toward a spacy/ambient direction, but employing crunchy and spiky loops of guitar distortion, feedback, and noise, \\"Motion Pool\\" is a pretty satisfying collection of sometimes-edgy drone psychedelia with a heavy dub angle to it. Vocals drift in and out, like they're being sung in the next room, and the only percussives one finds are the random metal noise or other noise-burst. Like the liner notes say, it's \\"Drumless space\\". Definitely a 'recommend' for those who like things along the line of My Bloody Valentine, or either of the above-mentioned groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet Down","review":"I got into Main post 2000's and while I greatly have come to embrace these works, motion pool just does not do it for me. Sure its got the subtle drones of most of their other works but I cannot get past the cheesey synth/guitar aspect of this album. I love the first two tracks but it goes downhill from there.

The vet clinic denied to declaw her back paws so I had to buy those soft claws. It would work if she would not bite it all... It takes two people to apply those soft claws and the process is easy. If you have a quiet cat that does not bite it, it might work for you. Unfortunately it did not work for my cat. I still insist on putting the soft paws on her, but she bites it, and it's gone. I find them all over the house. Waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"These are awesome, only took my a couple minutes to put them on her, they looks super cute! and she didn't mind at all and seems to have no discomfort with them. she licked them for a minute or two after I applied them but seems to be leaving them alone since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far -ok... 2 people should do it...","review":"I put them on a five month old kitten. It was traumatic for him until he stopped fighting me. He has tried to take them off. He was successful with a couple because the glue hadn't dried all the way. I gave him milk while they dried the second time. So far, he's had them on for an hour & has given up a little on taking them off. They are still on for now. It was definitely a 2 person job. I recommend these, but it's not easy at first. The instructions say it gets better with training. If I had help applying, there may have less upsetting for the kitty. I am currently cover in the super glue & fur, Kitty still stand-offish about coming to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Found","review":"I've been using them for about six months, i was going to have to get rid of the cat if she didn't stop scratching everything in the house. I put them on all her claws except thumbs and inside toes on her back feet so she can still use the cat tree. The only problem I've had was them getting stuck in the rug and the wire fencing on her outside play area when she tried to scratch something. I had to cut one rug up to get her out."},{"rating":"1","title":"use with caution","review":"While putting them on can be a challenge, I was very pleased with the initial results. However, my cats like to knead soft things and I found both of them stuck to items like pillows, blankets, curtains and stuffed animals. They struggled frantically to get them off, I'm sure twisting and pulling at their claws painfully. It happened repeatedly so the urge to knead is greater than any 'learning' from the bad experience.They may be OK for a cat that has been de-clawed in the front but not the back --to solve the issue with leather furniture launch damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but they don't last.","review":"We bought a couple varieties of these to protect our leather couches.

My only gripe is that they can pop off from time to time. First time I put them on, 2 popped off within 2 days. Just make sure hold on to your cat and let the glue set for 5 min (per the directions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute!","review":"These are really great!

Must-Have for Cat Owners","review":"We've all heard how inhumane it is to claw a cat. (Don't believe me? Google & you'll see.) So what's a cat owner to do when their expensive leather furniture is being destroyed by that precious little furball?Soft Claws, of course!I was apprehensive and perhaps more than a bit skeptical at first, but I read the reviews and figured I didn't have much to lose. Putting them on did take a bit of patience, but it really isn't difficult. Once you've done the first few claws, the rest seem much easier. They've stayed on really well thus far as well.Pros:*no shredded furniture*humane approach to clawing*they're quite cute!Cons:*none really; she didn't like them at first but within about ten minutes ignored them and went on about her businessSo now our little kitty prances around with her pretty pink nails and we're all happy. Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!!!","review":"I think this product is great! I have always cut my cat's nails since she was a little kitten so she is used to me handling her paws. I cut her nails, put about 2 drips of the glue in each cap and stuck it on, they dried very quickly and she only messed with them for about 10 minutes before she was comfortable with them. They have been on for a few weeks now and not only does she look adorable but playing with her and not getting scratched is awesome, and the furniture is not getting damaged! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all they are cracked up to be....","review":"I bought these for my kitten... I was pleased at first until they started falling off... it was a constant battle to keep them on all 10 of his front toes, and when they did fall off, he would damage the furniture, the thing I was trying to save. The deal breaker happened one day while I was at work... he had gotten the \\"lip\\" at the top of one of his soft paws caught in a loop of carpet- when I got home he was yowling and crying and by the time I got it loose, he had dislocated his toe. $250 for x-ray and diagnosis, and I still ended up declawing him, as that was the only way to \\"fix\\" his dislocated toe. I would not reccommend these if you have any sort of carpet in your house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I mean obviously my cat isn't in love with the idea of having me put these on her claws and it's defiantly a two person job, but i plan to continue going through the steps to prevent damage to my furniture and my roommates furniture. In the long run, I find this better solution then declawing because if my cat happens to get outside she can still fend for herself once the soft paws fall off, whereas if i had her declawed she would be screwed. Over all, my cat continues her everyday activities as if she didn't have them on, meaning she pretends to claw things as if she had exposed claws. She never tried chewing them off, she just likes to lick them a lot. Please be smart about this product though, my results will NOT be the same for everyone else!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rancho Springs are AWESEOME","review":"this kit was VERY easy to install and gives the correct support for my 87 Suburban!

Well, more fool me for trying to save money.This morning, we woke up to a flooded kitchen because the hose that connects the cold water supply to the faucet popped a leak in the night. More to my surprise, the hose is embedded pretty deeply into the faucet housing and only a complete dismantling of the entire faucet assembly would allow me to access it and change the hose. What a ridiculous design. Now its not a matter of going to the store for a new hose so that we can have water again, but instead either waiting for Kohler to send me a replacement, or going to buy a completely new faucet.Based on my experience, and the reviews of others, I would not buy Kohler again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, leaks allot","review":"Most important thing, keep your receipt!!!

The intrigue itself, of course, has been out in the open for quite a while---that Pnin, the stodgy and stumbling professor, was inspired by one of Vladimir Nabokov's colleagues at Cornell, Marc Szeftel.There's plenty of material on that in the book, but the real treat are the stories on university politics, the strange and shimmering links between art and the \\"real\\", the compassionate sketches of very odd characters (including Szeftel himself, as well as Nabokov's first biographer, a Kinbote-like figure), and some seriously funny endnotes. _Pnin_ ends triumphantly, and so does Diment's _Pniniad_, with the reader discovering the life-story of a man who would otherwise be an interesting side-note---what the reader gets is a sort of roman a clef written on the margins of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"First of all, the CD did not have all of the Practice Files I need to actually USE the book.

All in all I absolutely loved watching it with the kids and I even remembered the dialog verbatum.

There were no plot twists, the dullest storyline and weak thin characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book BITES -- and I used to like Grisham a lot!","review":"Save your money and buy Chrichton's book 'Timeline'! This book had a pointless plot that glamorized criminals, and an even worse collection of sub-plots. Grisham has gotten lazy in his old age, and he takes more from the front page of the newspaper than from his own imagination. This book doesn't even deserve a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointing","review":"SHAME SHAME SHAME on the publishers of this book for not sending the manuscript straight back to John Grisham so he could finish it - just too greedy - they couldn't wait to flog it as is.John Grisham should use a pen-name if he intends to keep writing PAP like this - it's a betrayal to the loyal fans who expect better quality.If you are a fan of John Grisham, don't waste your money buying this book, borrow it from the library and be prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to Grisham?","review":"While \\"The Brethren\\" is not as didactic as \\"Street Layer\\", it seems that Grisham is trying to push his social agenda harder with his more recent novels.

The story continues to develop and intrigue the reader until the very end. As I watched the story unravel, I could not wait to see what would happen next.

I found it to be very exciting and a book I couldn't put down. I am a very big Grisham fan, and I would have given this book 5 stars, but one would have to admit that Grisham is not one for explosive endings in his books (that's why I only give 4 stars).

He's lesser known, but the guy writes a fantastic finish.

The ending had no credibility, and I bet even the screenplay becomes more sardonic. I decided to read the entire book before buying it and it was the right decision. The person who wrote this book is not the same person who wrote The Firm. That book had attention to detail and character development that is just nonexistent in The Brethren.

I have been waiting for The Brethren since the day Amazon announced the new book. I went to my nearest bookstore in my county and bought The Brethren. When I went home, I immediately started reading it from 6:50 to 11:00. Let me tell you this. Borrow this book at your local library. This book is dull, the plot was exetremely weak compared to The Firm and The Pelican Brief, the ending was just too predictable and is hardly even interesting. This book makes The Partner and The Street Lawyer seem like the greatest book ever written. so trust me, borrow this book at the library because it is not worth the $+tax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the last 100 pages?","review":"I love Grisham and always buy his books the day they come out.

I guess the primary reason is that in this novel, we don't have one particular character who dominates the book. Characters in the past like Jake in A time to kill, Rudy from the Rainmaker, Danilo Silva the Partner, and most recently Nate from the Testament. It seems this book took a while to develop and did not get going until the final 100 pages. But who am I to critize this best selling author and I am sure this book will sell well. I guess my expectation was higher and did not get that satisfaction after reading it. I hope the next novel will make up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has \\"missed the boat\\" with this book!","review":"The reviews online tell it all. \\"The Brethren\\" was a disappointment to myself, and the majority of Grisham fans. It started out as a \\"page-turner,\\" if for no other reason, than to see just how The Brethren (three unsavory judges serving time in a prison), the CIA, and a presidential candidate, were all going to fuse together. The potential was there, but it fell apart very quickly, and was a disappoint to the end. I am glad my book was borrowed, and not purchased.

I must confess I have been disappointed to some extent by everything since The Partner. Nonetheless, I keep the faith. The Brethren, however, was a major disappointment because, what started like a a first-class thriller, ended as flat as can be. In fact, the surprise is that the book contains no surprises. In the end, we could say it is an intriguing narrative, but little else. Next Grisham novel, I will make sure to read the Amazon reviews and comments by other readers before buying it. Sorry John, this one was a major dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"It is a perfect book. A perfectly inaccurate book.

A government agency tries to control a Presidential election. With a man who they believe has no skeletons from his past.

It wasn't that good of a book in my opinion but it depends on the reader. This book was not a particularly good read to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"mind-numbingly dull","review":"i was highly dissapointed by this book. All of the characters are paper-thin stereotpyes and none of them are likeable. The plot goes way beyond far-fetched.

Theauthor rambled on with characters poorly described for instance Teddy the man in a lot of unexplained pain covered in a wheel chair, why they wanted arron Lake as president then there was the character mentionedjust once and no more who started to tail Trevor and never mentioned again and the ultimate death of Trevor, it would have better if Trevor met the Three Judges on some remote island but to have him killed was poor writing, I think John Grisham must have read some of David Baldaggi books that author uses the fbi and CIA a lot no I prefer for Mr. Grisham to use his usual lawyer characters from Mississippi my favorite was the partner suspense and the most unusual final ending in any of his books once again in the Brethren to many undescribed characters should have been more descriptive, how about Wes and Chap to just come in a take over very poor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham finally gets it right","review":"In the past when i have read books by John Grisham my loved ones have been witness to my reactions. Drumming of heels, hurling of articles, screams of \\"misogynistic dork\\" etc, and much rereading of my beloved Robert Tanenbaum's Butch Karp series. Ah well, tempestuous creature that I am. But finally, John Grisham has gotten his formula right. This time he left out romance and women. Don't write about what you don't understand. The plot centers around three crooked judges and their hell bound scam that is inside a prison and outside the law. In this election year, Grisham's jaundiced view of politics adds a delightfully sardonic touch. The Brethren is also funny, which I've only come up against once before in a Grisham book, the one about the millionaire with the Jerry Springer-esque family. Good read, if he keeps on like this, Robert Tanenbaum may have some competition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brethren review","review":"I have read all of John Grishams'novels and he has not has not disappointed me with his new release. With the Brethren he takes us down a new road this time, with an avenue of a political campaign. Inside into how the government can control an election was enlightening. Saw parallels to this years primary and current administration. The three judges activities are believable. John may as well be writing non-fiction. Each of his novels takes us down a new street. What next John? The Brethren is easy reading and can be finished in a 24 hour period. Enjoy, it's a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Search of More Poetic Prose in a Thriller.","review":"I am an author and I love thrillers. My biggest disappointment in today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic and living prose which allows me to feel the southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels in a Manhattan deli or wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance chasing in the hospital room of a critically injured patient. While a better yarner than Turow, Grisham's works lack the sort of living color which fiction demands."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham meets Tom Clancy!","review":"I just finished reading this book..and all I could say that this is Grisham's finest work yet! The plot turns I will admit does take some getting used to beacuse he is intermingling many plot lines(I counted five). He is introdcing new characters just when you get totally involved with one and it could get annoying. But overall, the whole book suspenseful in the tradition of Tom Clancy(eek)and John Le Carre or Robert Ludlum. I think he may have crossed over some territory well established by these authors, he is the new kid on the block and may not be welcome by all. Good Luck Grisham!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Grisham fan BUT....","review":"This was an extremely boring book. Grisham just phoned this one in. The plot line, such as it is, is telegraphed from a mile away and the only twist is the incredibly insipid ending. A truly disappointing entry by a writer who is capable of so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It seems like the fashionable thing to do is trash an author who has become very popular. Individuals who undoubtedly want to appear 'chic' have done this with Grisham's latest. I refuse to get caught up in this trend. The Brethren is a delightful read. The plots are interesting, but above all it is just plain fun. Ignore the literary snobs and enjoy the book. It is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Filler Than Thriller","review":"John Grisham's assembly line continues with The Bretheren. The plot, although over the top, is interesting. There is not one character you care for. All range from obnoxious to horrendous. Grisham still finds it difficult to end the book. The only tension during the last fifty pages is continuing to check the last page number, do the math and say, \\"God! Will this ever end?\\"The problem is filler. We repeatedly watch the first attorney get drunk or the judges walk around the track or the judges confering or the judges betting or . . . If you just pull scenes that were repeated three or more times, The Bretheren is a novelette.Jojn Grisham has more potential than this. Maybe some time off will help or perhaps a collection of short stories might yield great filler-less plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The story line had loads of potential, but it read like the author became bored and quit trying. There was so much potential for character development and also plot development. This is not a slam aganist Grisham, I've read all his books and have enjoyed most, but everyone makes mistakes. Let's keep our hopes up that the next one is not a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever Happened To The Author Of A Time To Kill?","review":"The Brethren is a perfect example of a book that becomes a megaseller just because of its author's mega reputation. While it moves along quickly (Thank God! ), The Brethren is weak in just about every quality you want in a thriller -- plot, characterizations, suspense, surprises, credibility, etc. This book is one more recent example of Grisham's spewing out books without caring enough about the quality on which he built his reputation. Since he's become a dynasty in the publishing world, he seems to have forgotten about the need to satisfy his readers. While it won't amount to a \\"spit in the ocean\\" to Grisham, his future fortunes are going to have to be made without any more contributions from me. This is likely to be my last John Grisham book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read every Grisham book the week it came out. His novels are usually filled with action or conviction. This one has neither. It is a boring, unethical story of greed, deception and the state of American politics. It's the only one that I won't keep in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was determined to reach the end of the book. Sheer determination won out over character and plot development. Never has a Grisham novel produced so many one-dimensional characters. The pre-publication hype was much more interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is John Getting Hungry?","review":"Like , Tom Clancy, I wonder if John is going hungry so that he has to publish novels that do not meet earlier standards. I eagerly awaited the book, having been a Grisham fan, but was very disappointed when I finished reading it. I thought the plot was weak, the ending easily figured out, and overall not up to the usual Grisham standards. I hope John gets his next book back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"Doubt it would be published if it didn't have Grisham's name on it.

How does this guy keep selling books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Sigh!","review":"This is the first time it ever took me more than a day...two at most to read a Grisham book. What the heck? Did he have a deadline to meet? I pre-ordered the book and checked my account daily when the release date arrived, ran down to my company mail room and clock-watched until quitting time. From the first chapter, I was not impressed. One month and two \\"in-between\\" books later, I finally made it through. I'm so bummed! Next time, I'll wait for the paperback or borrow it! Heavy sadness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Does it again!","review":"If you have never read any John Grisham books, read The Firm and A Time to Kill, and then STOP! Both of these books were inspired, non-stop reading. The Brethren was neither.Once again, Grisham has managed to write a story where the reader does not relate to any characters and couldn't care less what happens to them. The characters were for the most part \\"cookie cutter\\" and stereotypical. Sub plots started and stopped more than my drive to work on the L.A. Freeway system.One interesting note, however. Grisham must have re-signed with the Cayman Islands advertising counsel. Readers who have read all of his works have no doubt noticed that in many of his books the Caymens get at least an honorable mention.Suggestion: If you must read The Brethren, wait until someone you know has purchased it first, then borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring","review":"I've read and enjoyed Grisham's other books but this one was a bore. Shallow and unlikely were the two thoughts that kept cropping up. Sure , I read it through to its unsatisfying end.

This book has no redeeming features! There are too many characters with no characterization, minimal plotting, and no real resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham gets lazy","review":"I generally find it hard to put down a John Grisham book, but with The Brethren I had to force myself to pick it up.None of the charactors have any redeeming qualities. There is no one to root for, no one to care about, no one to like, no one to even pity. I just didn't give a hoot about what happened to anyone.The ending was unclimatic, but I was thrilled that it finally arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Flaw in Plot","review":"I love Grisham's books, usually, but this one I just couldn't get into and really enjoy it. It has a weak plot to begin with but then the plot is continued by several huge \\"coincidences\\" and a major flaw. The major flaw is that Lake is exposed to the Brethren by a letter that includes another letter to a campaign supporter. What Grisham forgot though is that the CIA was checking ALL the mail going into the prison and that letter would have NEVER got to the Brethren. This huge flaw and the weak plot make this book something to pass up. Not the usual Grisham masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The book started of great, but the end was just way tooeasy. He should've added another 100 pages and written another ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's how it ends?","review":"A TV movie. An awful ending. A quick read which required little effort and much too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"John Grisham books are hit or miss, this book being one of the misses. The weak plot centers around a mail scheme targeted at closeted gay men. The characters are terrible and the pacing slow...This is not the Grisham thriller his fans have come to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and not so sweet","review":"When I read \\"A Time to Kill\\", Grisham immediately became one of my favorite authors. \\"The Firm\\" was well done and fulfilling, as were one or two of his other early works.So after I read \\"The Testament\\" and this novel, I had to ask myself, \\"What happened? \\" It really seems like Mr. Grisham is now writing books just to get a book on the shelves. He spent little time developing the characters, and when the book was over I found myself not caring if every single person in the book dies. While the plot was interesting, the story around it was sparse.While not horrible, this was certainly not one of Grisham's better works. Perhaps for his next effort, he'll sit down at his word processor long enough to write something around 500 pages with a little more meat to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the previously written Grisham novels. Do yourself a favor. Wait for the next one and read the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this to be my least favorite of all of his work.

After the Testament, this book was a big letdown!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointing.","review":"I know that probably those of you who read these reviews are die-hard Grisham fans, as I am. I love his writing, and his style. But, this book was a major disappointment to me. First, the price is ridiculous to me. But, I bought it anyway, thinking that it would be a great read. Well, it wasn't! It was one of the worst books I have ever read. There was no suspense, no plot, and none of the usual legal techinicality which is so common with Grisham's other books. I reccomend highly against buying this book, but if you must read it, may I suggest your local public library? Then, you won't waste that wad of cash that you will have regretted spending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic John Grisham","review":"From the beginnings of two very different stories, a congressman about to run for president with the help of the CIA, and a federal prison in Florida where three disgraced judges hold court, John Grisham is able to weave an interesting and captivating story. Grisham draws the storylines closer and closer as the master storyteller he is. When they finally combine to the conclusion, the story is never dull. More engrossing and better flow than previous novels (The Chamber, The Street Lawyer). Still not the masterpiece of The Firm. A story made all the more interesting for its plausibility (almost). Set in the world of politics we can now watch unfold in national primaries. Well done and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this book is harder to get into than his others, its slow to start but it really quite fascinationg when its all over, nothing very significant happens which brings the climax factor down. but overall its another grisham great! he is a wonderful author! and this book like all his others is superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I read this book in two days - it is intrested and knowing author's earlier work I expected clear cut ending but it did not happen. The end of the book is neither bad nor good - simply there is no ending at all. Also, I like the message from this book - guys, blackmail others and make good life from it! I think it's a litle bit naive but if you have nothing else to do - read it. Grisham used to write better books then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"research your topic next time...","review":"Simply his worst book ever. I am not a lawyer so I can't speak to how authentic his other books are, but on this one he blew it big time. If the devil is in the details, he's on nearly every page in this one, because he's constantly wrong in the details of Washington and political life. If I hadn't gotten a copy of this book free, I would have returned it to the place of purchase asking for a refund. Mr. Grisham, please next time do a little research on your subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpardonable","review":"Grisham's worst!

Don't wait for the movie...nobody's dumb enough to make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Half Spirals Downward","review":"The lastest Grisham starts off with great prospect. I was really into the first half. Then, something happened - or rather didn't happen. The suspense just played out into a huge payoff and everyone goes home happy. Were we supposed to be rooting for any of the characters? I certainly didn't want any of them to be successful. This novel is comparable to a huge trial which settles 5 minutes before calling in the jury. All the promise of action fades and everyone just quietly goes away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Verdict is in...and it's not a winner!","review":"At one point, I would have described Grisham's writing as intense, devious and entertaining. This book is not impressive. I actually had to force myself to read it, while nodding off between sentences. The plot was ingenuous, however, the book missed it's point in the non-descript characters. In other Grisham novels, even if you hated the character or what they stood for, they were three dimemsional, well-written beings. The \\"Brethren\\" were three of the most tedious beings I've had the displeasure to encounter in a novel. The other characters in the storyline were equally as uninteresting as well. I have to admit, this was certainly a dissapointment. After such wonderful novels as A Time to Kill and The Client, both The Brethren and The Testement were a decline in work for Mr. Grisham, at least in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has lost his touch.","review":"Why would the CIA not blink an eye and let an entire embassy be destroyed with the people in it and yet be afraid to \\"terminate\\" three federal prisioners? A little inconsistent. This could have been a very good book, but the author seemed afraid to make the CIA look bad (CIA agents were even cleaning and dusting.) Come on John, you seem to get a little weaker with each book. Let's get back to the plots of \\"The Firm\\" and the characters of \\"A Time to Kill\\": Those were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I have read and liked several other Grisham novels, and I was sorely disappointed in this one. The characters were all shallow and poorly developed, and the plot was predictable from the first page. I found nothing enjoyable in this novel, from the greedy, corrupt and shallow characters to the easily predictable story line to the let down of an ending. There was no climax to this story, it just ended. ALthough not soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Again","review":"The Brethren started a little slow, but after a few chapters, it took charge of my mind until I finished it.

Now that I have just finished The Brethren, I'm already missing old Joe Roy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While this book was an easy and quick read, the ending was extremely disappointing.

This one was definitely a miss. There are two major story lines that converge towards the end of the novel. One of the story lines was somewhat intriguing, but the other was odd and a bit uncomfortable. The end was disappointing too. I would recommend passing on this and read \\"The Broker\\" or \\"King of Torts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I would hate to be the screen writer tasked with making this book into an interesting movie. Luckily I can't imagine that anyone will ever have to worry about that.John Grisham may not be the best at character development, or painting imaginative word pictures, but he has always been able to tell an interesting story. Until now. \\"The Brethren\\" contains not one likeable character and a story line that will leave you wondering if he spent more than 15 minutes trying to come up with a plot or if he just made it up as he went along.If this book were not written by John Grisham it would never have been published. Let's hope that Mr. Grisham takes a little more time in developing his next book and does not simply rely on his reputation to sell books."},{"rating":"1","title":"once again grish, you've managed to put me to sleep..","review":"i've bailed out on this piece of crap book. this book serves as good bedtime cure for insomnia. just like your last book grish, you started this one off at a nice quick pace. and unfortunately, also like the last book (testament), you forgot how to hit the brakes at the top of the mountain, then buckle us up for the exciting ride down the mountain. that's what's missing.. the ride down the mountain should be fast, precise and breathtaking. so, i've given up on this weak book (just like the testament), but don't feel bad grish, cause i still adore you. in the meantime, hang in there with my one star, and um, go take a cold shower. maybe, that'll snap you outta this mean streak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one and re-read The Chamber","review":"This is clearly one of Grisham's weakest books to date. The story is not at all exciting, and his plot and character development are both weak. I found the book to be dry, boring and about 250 pages too long. Skip this one, and pull out an old copy of the Chamber. It will be a better use of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing fare","review":"Only die hard Grisham fans like me can read through this book. The plot is very weak, the story telling, save for some occasional flashes of Grisham one is used to, is bland and the ending is boring. You can't identify with any of the characters. All are crooked. The pace is excruciatingly slow and the climax is weak. All in all - disappointing fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a JG fan since his first book. I always look forward to one of his new books coming out. Not this time. This book did not hold my interest at all. I was very disappointed in this book.

I will not be looking forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Grisham, Hate this Book","review":"Incredibly slow and boring. I had to force myself to stay in it.

I lean towards The Partner as one of his best. The Brethren had the makings of a good book. It got interesting when the two sub plots ran into one another. However, the ending was weak. However, I will still buy the next one. Keep them coming JOHN."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time \\"Grisham\\" reader!","review":"I just finished The Brethren, and I really enjoyed it! I have never read one of John Grisham's books before, and I have heard that this was definitely not one of his best. However, as much as I enjoyed this one, I look very forward to reading more of his books. It was interesting, and the plot was fascinating to me. You wanted to read to the end, to see what would happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"After reading novels written by Ed McBain, Richard North Patterson, I have become accustomed to superior prose and eloquent writing. Therefore, reading Grisham's latest drivel was a major letdown. The prose seemed to be directed for 4th graders, the much talked about humor was absent, and the characters were uninspiring, unexciting people I cared nothing about. In short what an absolutely dreadful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"John Grisham is as addictive as any other author out there...but his newest book, The Brethren, does not live up to his usual standards. It is still typical John Grisham style, but I wish he would go back to the style he perfected in A Time to Kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE TRY, BUT...","review":"I've read all of Grisham's novels and this one is by far the weakest. I guess he should be given some credit for trying to get away from the tired formula of some of his recent books like The Partner and The Street Lawyer, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In general, none of the characters are well developed or likeable: the whole lot is two dimensional and mean spirited. The constant jumping between the two story lines is very distracting, even though a second grader could see where things are headed. The ending is very abrupt and unsatisfying, like he saw this was a story not going anywhere and not worth saving. I would bet that if John Grisham's name was not on the jacket of this book, it would be on the express elevator to the 25 cent bargin bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good one","review":"I didn't like this book at all. It seemed to me nothing really happened. It is just about a guy whose secret might get loose and that is basically it. I usually learn things from Grisham books but not in this one. I big let down. He needs to settle down and take more time to develop better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book you can skim and not miss anything","review":"I agree with the review above. The Firm was an excellent book. In The Brethren, none of the characters were developed and the plot was not believable. I skimmed the book. Luckily, I borrowed it from the library. I'm glad I didn't buy it because it is not a book I'd recommend or loan to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"If the weather is cumberson and your stuck indoors and The Brethren happens to be the only novel within reach, grab an umbrella!Grisham sadly lacks in keeping the readers attention in this novel. Under contract, he is to write a yearly novel and this one lacks the Grisham style. Perhaps it's his deadline. But, readers, this is a one way dead-end street reading of 'just something to write' to satisfy his contract. Don't waste your time and let's hope Grisham comes back with a new knock down, on your seat suspense. Because this novel is not even close to his potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"A total waste of valuable reading time. Not a likeable character in the whole book, with each acting out a role in a positively outrageous plot. And then the book just ends, with all of these nasty people coming out winners. I wish I had read the amazon.com customer reviews before throwing my money away on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than street lawyer","review":"This was better than his last 2 books. The plot was interesting and he didn't preach as much as in Testament and Street Lawyer. However, as I neared the end of the book I kept wondering how he was going to tie all the plots together in an acceptable way. As it turned out, he didn't. The book just ends. I almost think he may be setting up a sequel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Standards","review":"This might not be a bad novel, unless you're John Grisham. The author set himself a very high standard with his previous work, so it was perhaps inevitable that he would eventually fail to live up to it. This book reads more like a cheap detective story than the well crafted, intricately plotted stories we have come to expect from this author. It will be interesting to see his next novel. Will he return to his former glory or churn out another example of pulp fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"This book has a pretty good story... but unfortuantely you'll have to wait for the sequel to find out how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"You had me 'till the end","review":"This was my first Grisham book, so my expectations were mixed. The judges were predictable, the CIA / Lake plot was o.k., but the ending was a fizzle! Come on! Either the judges get their due, or Lake is assasinated. Anything but this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THe Brethren","review":"I read this book on a plane ride to England. While it comforted me the entire flight, I found the plot predictable and couldn't wait to be done with it. At times I was intrigued by the intersection of the two story plots but by the middle of the book, it was not difficult to resolve what was going to happen. NOt one of his best works but an ok read to pass time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves you wondering \\"What was he THINKING?\\"","review":"_The Brethren_ is an untidy mess of a book, apparently written without any regard for reading pleasure. As others have pointed out, there is absolutely no admirable character drawn here. Worse, some of the least admirable characters (I won't say which) are richly rewarded at book's end.This book makes no sense, but it fulfilled its purpose in making quite a few dollars for Mr. Grisham (who has wisely given up writing \\"thrillers\\").The first few chapters are written with the old Grisham sense of humor and irony, but all that follows just plods on to a tedious conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, predictable, and terrible plot","review":"The start of the book was interesting, but once the story got going...it was boring and predictable. Half way through the book I considered stopping or at least flipping to the last chapter because it was terrible and I knew how it was going to end. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Grisham Yet","review":"I have seen this book described as a legal thriller. Nope! The law discussed is nothing but a twisted version of the law as dispensed by 3 convicted judges in a low security prison. And there was nothing that kept me on the edge of my seat, so I throw out the description as a \\"thriller\\" as well. This is, in my opinion, the worst Grisham book yet. The plot is sophmoric, character development non-existent, and overall a story that took an effort on my part to complete. Anyone who is looking for the Grisham style first displayed in \\"A Time To Kill\\" (his best book)will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I listened to this book on tape. There were 7 tapes in the unabridged set. By the forth tape, I was fed up. All Teddy had to do was tell Lake when he first found out about the correspondence with Ricky. Lake would have given up on it and the Brethren would never have known about him. Instead the CIA sends its own letters and ends up screwing everything up and spending millions of dollars. If Teddy's ideas of dealing with terrorists are anything like his ideas of dealing with the Brethren, Grisham's imaginary America is in big, big trouble. The characters in this book are so trashy and the plot so unbelievable, I couln't wait to bring the tape set back to the library. I was particularly sorry because, for the most part, I liked The Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard for Grisham","review":"I've pretty much read all the work Grisham has produced. As a fellow attorney, this genre generally appeals to me, and Grisham rarely disappoints. In this book, he has created an exception to the rule . . . there isn't a single likable character in this novel; no underdog who manages to come out ahead . . . The premise was so implausible as to be laughable. Grisham generally paints with broad strokes, but he perpetrates a straight (and very 70's) stereotype of gay men: \\"Let's name this one 'Percy', and lets let this one correspond on lavender stationary. . .\\" Geez!The book is typical Grisham in that it is very \\"readable\\" - but it lacks the wit, the depth, and the PLOT of his previous work. As I read it, I wasn't thinking about who would be cast in which role, but whether Hollywood would even bother to buy the rights to this book. I can't imagine they would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This may not be the best of reviews, as I never actually managed to finish reading the book; and the reason for no finishing it was because I didn't get much past the 5th chapter or so. Just couldn't get into the book, unlike other Grisham novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"the brethren","review":"The brethren was a really good book, it has alot of suspense throughout the whole book, I think most people would like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, finished already?","review":"Skeletons in the closet are what this story is all about. They're actually high-powered skeletons kept by no less than the most popular candidate for the American presidency. Skeletons that are being threatened to be exposed by conniving inmates in a federal prison. A threat that was put at bay by no less than the CIA.Everything was going nicely on all fronts: intriguing characters, exciting plot build up. I was telling myself this is why I like Grisham; then without warning, it suddenly ended! The complications presented in 99 percent of the book were resolved and concluded in the last one percent. The conclusion was not a surprise either, one could see it coming early on. So there I was, wondering where the other pages might have gone; but it was really the end already!Was it just me? Would I have reacted differently if I took less time to finish this book? I haven't seen the other reviews yet, but I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"This is definately not Grisham's best work. The story line dragged along slowly. The only other book by Grisham I have had trouble getting into was the The Chamber. The story line for this book was lacking. I kept expecting it to pick up and it never did. The ending only made me more disappointed. This is not a book that I would recommend with any enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Breathern","review":"Brilliant plot and character developement and accurate in depecting human reactions to stessfull situations but the story dies when Trevor the laywer/mule dies. Trevor, the least culpable and benign threat but proved most ethical is killed for being a drunk. He's the fool who just wanted enough money to be left alone. The convict breathern the designers of the extortion ring suffers no penalties and get eveything they wanted and remain unsatisfied. And what happen to Quincy? His charater develope and is forgotten as was the other victims of the scam.

There are no redeaming qualities in this book but such is life."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will he learn how to write an ending?","review":"After so many books, you would think he'd learn how to write an exciting ending. Every one of his books ends the same...anti-climatic. It's a good thing hollywood demands the right to re-write the scripts...."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's gone commercial","review":"I have read all his works. Up to now he's been great, but I think the plot of this one is weak, predictable and shallow. His characterization fails completely,unless he was trying to write comedy. Perhaps he has to grind stuff out to meet contractual obligations, but putting the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court in Federal prison with a couple of buffoons fails the test of credibility. As a retired attorney and a real Grisham fan, I was terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of my favorite author....","review":"John Grisham has done it again. Wow. What I loved about this book was the suspense. And the tension. The only book I've ever read that I thought had more suspense and tension than this one was \\"One of the Guys\\" by Robert Clark Young. But I would have to say this Grisham novel is right up there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"This book is absolutely marvelous. Very very funny, very very entertaining. As is usual for a Grisham book, no one is exactly the \\"good guy\\" in The Brethren, everyone is kind of their own bad guy, and you feel like cheering for all of them. I loved this- it's probably my favorite, right next to The Runaway Jury and The Painted House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad ending","review":"I liked this book up until the ending. I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book. Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot Twists, Bad Ending","review":"This book was completely predictable. Everything you think will happen does, and nothing happens that you didn't expect. Grisham shows no creativity in his thinking. There are many plot points that are unexplained, and possible conflicts that he introduces, but never develops. The ending is an embarrassment. It's like Grisham was in the middle of writing, and went over his page limit, forcing the publishers to leave the real, exciting ending out. Skip this one; it's a waste of time. My English teachers would never accept it, and I'm in high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethern","review":"I borrowed this book from our local library, and was very greatful I hadn't invested any money to read it. Thin plot. Little suspense. And a confusing tangle of \\"who cares\\" characters. Frankly, I couldn't have cared less how it turned out. In short, I felt duped into thinking that because I've enjoyed John Grisham's books in the past, this would be entertaining too. Boy, was I wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I enjoyed Grisham's recent novels particularly The Runaway Jury because they were a departure and/or an improvement on his formula. I looked forward to reading The Brethren and took it on vacation with me. I honestly thought the book was written by an underpaid ghost writter and couldn't wait to get back to read other reviews to see who really wrote it. Having scimmed the reviews, I realize not too many loved loved the book but nobody complained about the writing style. Is it possible that his previous books had such good plots that I never noticed the poor writing?

I commute by train over 2 hours a day and I read a lot during my commute. I just couldn't motivate myself to read more than 60 pages in this one. It's like Grisham was just trying to fulfill a contract. I even preordered it because I was so excited that a new Grisham book was about to be released. What a let down! I loaned it to a friend, also a Grisham fan, and he was very disappointed too. I was also going to loan it to another friend but she had already read it and she was disappointed too.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over!","review":"Yawn. I was full of eager anticipation when I began this book, only to become increasingly disappointed the further I read.

I understand Grisham may have been trying to go a different direction, but he failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and predictable","review":"I've come to expect much more from Grisham. The plot was thin and predictable with none of the twists and turns in his prior works. The characters lacked development and depth and the story was all in all quite predictable. This was certainly an example of an author resting on his laurels and delivering little in the way of compexity.Entertainment for an afternoon, marginally better than TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Grisham","review":"The book never reached the usual Grisham writing. The plot was predictable after the 2nd chapter and contained to much transition between ideas. It is as though Grisham wrote the book without preparation. My first thought after reading it was that he only did it to fulfill a timeline on a contract with his publisher. Overall - Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Worst Grisham","review":"Grisham will probably never write another book as bad as The Chamber, but this is the worst of the rest. As with most Grisham novels it has an interesting set-up, but in The Brethren you never really pull for the characters or care about the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"No value for your buck with this Grisham....","review":"Thin, slim and no meat in the 'Brethren'. I like John but he has to slow down a develop a deeper plot with more twists and turns. I think he is too busy trying to work his books into his tax deductible vacations, i.e. Monte Carlo.From now on when I read a Grisham it will have 'Property of the Canal Fulton Library' printed inside. Sorry John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost it","review":"I've read all of John Grisham's books and this is definitely his worse.

I wouldn't recommend this one. Wait for the paperback to appear in the used bookstores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing plot; boring execution","review":"The Grisham name once was synonymous with excellent writing and page turner plots. The Brethren has a great plot and sub plot, but they never really were well developed - no real suspense or excitement. The characters were ho hum but could have been very interesting and mysterious. As for the ending I still ask myself \\"Is this the end?\\" I feel like I should reread some parts because I must have missed something. So much meaty stuff left unfinished. I hope he isn't planning a sequel because I won't buy it. In the story voters ask frequently \\"Who's Aaron Lake?\\" including me who wants to ask what has happened to him? I would have really liked to have read about his bought Presidency and just how he handled the country's affairs and the other situations he was involved in.

The Brethren tells the story of three incarcerated judges in a federal prison who, in addition to dispensing justice in the prison, run scams on unsuspecting gay men on the outside.As we learn about the three, as engaging a group of rascals as Grisham has ever created, we also learn of the rise of a young congressman, hand picked by a leader in the intelligence community to become President. The would-be President and The Brethren end up crossing path and the usual Grisham complexities erupt.The book moves along at a thriller's pace, but with more humor and wit than we've seen in a while from the author. Hints of Carl Hiaasen creep into the prose. It's as good a 'caper' novel as he's written since the Firm.As always, Grisham's conclusion leaves a little something to be desired. However all in all, a very satisfying book from a master of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another typically awful Grisham ending","review":"Why do I keep reading his books? Grisham keeps writing stories that start off being extremely intriguing, as this one does. He really needs to figure out how to finish these stories, or get someone else to write his endings for him! This book had the potential for a really great wrap-up, but I had chilling memories of the horrible ending to The Firm when the Bretherens' lawyer has dreams of taking his money and sailing the Caribean. Great idea, lots of potential, then horrible finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mr. Grisham should stick with his tried and true writing style instead of trying to venture out.

It was an easy read, which as we know is not a compliment. There just didn't seem to be any depth in the story line, plot or characters. On top of that, it was predictable. The ending was even weak. What kind of Grisham is that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but quite a disappointing ending","review":"Highly complicated plot, yet easy to understand. Grisham is starting to be like Jeffrey Archer and all the other masterful story-tellers. I must say that I personally love the plot a lot, because it is not so much about the boring law stuff which he usually writes about. The ending was a bit disappointing because I would expect Alan Lake to go bust, butb he didn't and the resolution of his downfall was somewhat simplistic. Other than that, I would encourage all thriller-lovers to read this, I finished it in only 2.5 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flatliner of a book...","review":"Although the plot was interesting, Grisham did not develop the characters as well as he should (could) have.The story didn't have the surprises, twists and turns that other Grisham novels are built around.

The climax/ending was unremarkable.If you haven't bought it yet, take it out at the library or wait for the paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed!","review":"I once read that Grishom said he would never write anything that would embarrass his children or his mother. Well, I bet his whole family is red-faced now. The Brethren took us on such a twisted, depraved path that I stopped after 100 pages convinced I could find more edifying material to fill my mind! This was such a disappointment following The Testament which offered hope to the weary and worn-out. John, you must have had a terrible year. Don't leave us with this trash...you owe it to your self and to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethern","review":"Reading this book was like listening to Barry Manilow...... I ask, \\"Haven't I heard this song before?\\"....different title,but similar lyrics, and melody. It's a quick read and very, very disappointing finish after such a buildup. I feel like I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put The Bretren up there with Gone with the Wind","review":"Grisham has done it again! The man cannot miss! Yes! I loved this book, and I've read twice already. The thing is that it's so sad and upsetting but I am a tad bit sentimental. Anyway, you should read this book it is sooooooooo good. I think I'll write song about it. Something like: The Brethren Yeah! Brethren Yeah! You're a good book Yeah! Oh I love you as I do the flowers of spring time and crispy, fresh mountain air, oh Brethren I love thee."},{"rating":"2","title":"i was amazed!","review":"I couldn't believe this book. The words were quite breath taking. I saw the word \\"the\\" and shuttered. john grisham sure has a way with words such as \\"the\\" and \\"and\\" and \\"on\\". I recommend this book to anyone who likes to see such words over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair quality book, but certainly not a classic","review":"I saw this book in the store and I bought it because of John Grisham's reputation as a great writer of thrillers, particularly the courtroom variety. This book was a quick and easy read, and it wasn't bad, but I thought that it never really \\"took off\\" and got very exciting. It has an interesting premise (three disgruntled jailbird judges blackmail older closeted-gay men by posing as younger openly gay jail prisoners via letters) but it seemed gimmicky and not really all that well done in my opinion. It seems like something where the reader might simultaneously wish the novel were longer because he or she wants the plot/subplots developed more thoroughly, but also wish the story were shorter because it's just not really an exciting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst","review":"This book was really disappointing. Grisham deviated quite a bit from his other books to write The Brethren. Three judges are serving time in prison for various offenses. While in prison they a lot of devious things, such as blackmailing wealthy gay men through a magazine ad. By accident, the Brethren snag the wrong person in their scheme and become the CIA's worse nightmare. Suddenly their get rich quick idea has tossed them into deeper waters than they ever counted on. If you're looking for Grisham's typical lawyer/greed books, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistency","review":"John Grisham does a remarkable job in keeping his stories consistently believable and interesting. I've yet to read one of his books where I didn't have trouble putting it down. The Brethren takes you through the minds and schemes of people in jail looking to get back something they lost. Each has his personal agenda but must work with another convict to get what he wants. Trust is a necessary factor in a place full of untrustworthy characters. It's a whodunit that keeps you second guessing yourself right up until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"This book had me going for a while but towards the end it left a lot of loose ends and a weak ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has sold out!","review":"There's really nothing new to say that others have not already said. This is a really, really bad book! The characters are totally unlikable - there's not a redeeming individual in this farce. It takes at least 150 pages to see where this storyline is going and it's truly not going anywhere interesting or important. Can Mr. Grisham be so desperate for cash that he would actually pen his name to this piece of garbage. You're resting on your laurels, John. Soon you will lose the \\"bread and butter\\" of your supporting fans. Worse yet, you'll be nicknamed the male Danielle Steele. Woe is thee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad-dont read it!!!","review":"I am a big Grisham fan...I bought this book in hard cover b'cos the paper back edition was not available. It is nauseating-one of the woest of Grisham -it made me wonder where Grisham was going....Pl keep away from it and save ur time and money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fast Read","review":"This is my third Grisham book. This is my favorite of all the books of his I've read. The characters are fantastic and the plot is tight. Nearly impossible to put down. However, I felt a little empty after reading this book. It seemed to lose steam at the end. Nevertheless, the ending was appropriate. I just think perhaps it could have been a bit longer and more sophisticated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Plot With Nowhere To Go","review":"...Here, in The Brethren, the CIA Director decides to handpick the next president.

And, because of this \\"plot,\\" the book has nowhere to go and simply peters with an extremely ludicrous ending. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This is the first Grisham book I have read. I must say that I am impressed. I'm not a fan of legal thrillers, and I know that is what Grisham specializes in. However, after reading the back cover summary of this book at a book store, the story interested me.I finished this book in three days, all 366 pages. I was that captivated.I won't go on about what the story is, because you can read another review for that. My only disappointment with the book was the ending--I would have liked it to be more exciting. But all in all, very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing premise, lazy writing, unsatisfying finish","review":"Grisham sets up an intriguing premise, then lazily, sloppily follows through to an ending in which nothing happens, nothing is concluded, loose strings abound, characters learn nothing, and the reader feels cheated. Does he still write his own books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst","review":"Don't go looking for classic Grisham. You won't find it here. This book had an implausible plot, poor character development, and a lame ending. A waste of time and money as far as I am concerned. Do yourself a favor, reread, \\"A Time To Kill\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"pretty lame effort. grisham is not that great a writer to begin with, but this silly story never really gets going. the basic premise is pretty weak to begin with, and with the amateurish wrting, it's tough to get through the first hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorley abridged book","review":"I have been told that the book was good. I wouldn't know. The abridged audio version chopped so much out of the story that I don't know much moor than I did from reading the dust jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZ....","review":"Sorry John, the book is boring. I really tried to get through it, but it's just a slow, slow read. Characters are dull and there isn't any suspense. Hope your next one is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change","review":"Having read all of the earlier Grisham novels, I sat down prepared for a tense courtroom drama. Upon starting to read, and seeing the mockery of a jail house trial, I thought Grisham had stooped to writing a hardcover \\"People's Court\\".It turns out I was wrong on both accounts and the story and intrigue kept me turning page after page. The reading goes quickly and is entertaining throughout, right to the last word.There were hints of \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" in the story and it leaves you thinking about what really does go on behind prison walls and the walls of Langly. (And are they all that different?) This book is a must read for any Grisham fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Wait, Big Let Down!","review":"I am a very big Grisham fan and was waiting very unpatiently for the newest book. I found that I should have waited until it came out in paperback ( not to pay so much). I was very disappointed. It lost me from the first few chapters and was very hard to keep my attention, unlike previous novels.I kind of thought along the line that this might have been the first book he ever wrote and saved for a while but, it had great similarities to Clancy and other authors along the \\"Clancy\\" line. Although I didn't care for the book, I am waiting for the next to see if Grishiam can redeem himself and his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham and Frank Muller - WHAT A TEAM!","review":"Have listened to all the Grishams's but this one mesmorized me. Frank Muller brings the story to life. Had trouble turning off the tape when I arrived at my destination. The Unabridged edition is the only way to read it......With the upcoming election the book could not be more timely. DON'T MISS IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethern","review":"This is clearly John Grisham's weakest effort to date. The characters are not fully developed and those with the most to exploit, Aaron Lake, the presidential candidate, and Teddy Maynard, the reclusive CIA Director, drop off the face of the earth in the end. There is little suspense and none of the storytelling or intriguing characters that \\"Testamant\\" or \\"Runaway Jury\\" can claim. I am disappointed with this volume and will be careful when picking up the next Grisham installment. I can't imagine that this meets with the standards that avid Grisham readers have come to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS IT ABOUT GRISHAM?","review":"I swore I would never read another Grisham book. I'm sure Grisham doesn't care--he has plenty of fans and doesn't need me! But so many CAN'T be wrong and me right! So--I tried this book and gave Grisham another chance. In my opinion, he failed miserably! The beginning of the book is so boring I almost gave up during the first chapter. I'll give Grisham this, he does do a good job of weaving the two plot strands together and he is good at plotting. His plots, however, all turn out to be formulaic and anti-climactic. I think men would like Grisham's books a lot more than women--he has yet to create a good and believable female character. Understandable. Well, I hated the book, but I can't say Grisham is bad. He does, after all, enthrall millions of readers so he has to be doing something right. If you're a Grisham fan, buy this book. If not, skip it. It's not even Grisham's best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the video.","review":"The anticipation of reading another Grisham novel was there. However, after a 100 pages it was by sheer determination to never leave a book unread that sustained me. The characters, plot and scandal were all there to create a novel that would rival \\"The Firm\\". The story came to a close before you were ready to decide who won or last. In the end the author took the easy way out - everybody wins and lives happily ever after. Hollywood may be able to salvage the book, but I recommend waiting for it to come out on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"A great disappointment in my opinion. As an avid reader of John Grisham I found it lacking in suspense and drama. The characters were dull and boring. It is very unusual for me to fall asleep while reading Mr. Grishams books, but I often did just that. Maybe a little time off wouldn't be a bad idea, as suggested in another review. On his next book, I won't be so eager to order as early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham returns to form......mostly.","review":"After stumbling a little with THE TESTAMENT, Grisham returns toform with an excellent page-turner. The Brethren recounts the story ofthree imprisoned judges in a federal prison who, in addition to dispensing judgements in the prison, run scams on unsuspecting gay men on the Outside.As we learn about the three, as engaging a group of rascals as Grisham has created, we also learn of the rise of a young congressman, hand picked by a leader in the intelligence community to become President. The would-be President and The Brethren end up crossing path and theirein lies the tale.The book moves along at a thriller's pace, and with more humor and wit than we've seen in a while from the author. Hints of Carl Hiaasen creep into the prose. It's as good a 'caper' novel as he's written since the Firm.As always, Grisham's conclusion leaves a little something to be desired. However all in all, a very satisfying book from a master of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maximum Disappointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed with The Brethren. The plot was uninteresting, predictable, slow moving and the subject was distasteful and unbelievable. I had high hopes for this book and it is unlike any Grisham book I have read in the past. It is not very well written, has long tangents or descriptions that do not add anything to the book and was not worth the time it took to read it, let alone buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, rip off!","review":"this was entertaining enough. Not at all Grisham's best work. But here's the point of my review: it's a total rip-off!! A few months ago i found the original \\"Law & Order\\" on netflix and started watching old episodes from the beginning. I just wathed today and episode about a young up and coming new york congressman who was murdered because he was resisiting the blackmail attempts of a man in jail. The blackmail was being run on the outside by his lawyer. A few too many similarities. I should have known Grisham was a law and order fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no accounting for taste!","review":"I too have read all John's books. This one to me was the one with the most humor. I fell in love with the bumbling Trevor...and was sorta sad when he got blown away before even getting started on his dream existence. Perhaps what sets my view is that I take fiction books as just that...it didn't happen, and probably never will happen, but it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected ... or anticipated","review":"I didn't find the book full of suspense or intrigue. And fortunately, I was able to borrow the book instead of buying it.Yes, the plot was very different from his other books, and that in itself made me want to read it. And it was a good read - easy to keep track of who was doing what to whom. But the ending left more than just a little bit to be desired. Most of the events along the way were far too predictable.My personal favorite was A Time To Kill. This one is not in the same class as what I've come to expect from John Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good book by grisham","review":"Although the critics seem to have a field day anymore when Grisham comes out with a new book, once again they are wrong. As usual, Grisham has put together a fun and interesting read once again. I found his deviation from his normal writing style to be interesting and fresh. Can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected From Grisham","review":"I was very disappointed in John Grisham's latest novel. I have read all of his books and always look forward to the next release. This was a big disappointment. It is unlike his other novels, in that it lacks a real hero, or even a good lead character. When I read the book, I didn't enjoy it from the beginning, but I kept waiting for it to get better - it didn't! I should have listened to the reviews that I read on Amazon before I bought the book. I can only hope that Grisham's next book is more like his earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"What a disappointment! Threads were left hanging and NONE of the characters ever fleshed-out. I don't think I will rush out for his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have loved Grisham in the past. He's one of the few novelists today who can spin a yarn and really tell a story, and do so without including tons of offensive language and sexual depictions--which most writers use as crutches. But his last few books have disappointed. Take a couple of years off, John. All of your plots are sounding alike. Your writing has become predictable, formulaic. You probably just need a breather. This book isn't worth the time it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ooookay and then?","review":"What in the world was Grisham thinking when he wrote this book? Probably the same thing Thomas Harris was when he wrote \\"Hannibal\\". \\"Oh those crazy publishers will print and sell anything I write.\\" Good grief this was about as close to nothing as you can get. This is the person who wrote \\"The Chamber\\" a wonderfully affecting character study and also a social commentary on the death penalty. This book was a half baked idea that he pounded out just because he is John Grisham. If the writer of this novel had been anyone else we would have never read it because there is NO way this would have ever made it to print. Take a look at Dennis Lehane, and David Wiltse if you want a good read and leave this fluff alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"John, How Could You?","review":"Where was the hero? Who should I have been rooting for? What happened to the escapee? Was the world really in that much danger, or did Maynard have another agenda? Why would Lake do that? Why would two legitimate judges tolerate and work with a local yokel justice of the peace? Those are just a few of my questions, and none of them were answered. Compared to where started, with The Firm and A Time to Kill, we have lost touch and I don't really know what John is thinking anymore. Maybe the well has run dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read that let me down","review":"With a clever plot, interesting characters, sharp doses of humor, and a fast pace, I raved over this book as I read it. But the final chapters were disappointing, if not unsettling. I realized that there wasn't a single, likable character throughout the story. I didn't mind the cynical theme, but I really didn't see justice served to those that deserved it. Does crime really pay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly not Grisham's best - possibly his worst!","review":"I have been a huge fan of John Grisham, and have read every one of his books. \\"The Bretheren\\" does not have the fire, the plot, or the characters most of his other fine books have. It was slow and poorly developed. The ending appeared to come one day as Grisham said \\" I'm tired, I think I will end this\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"As a Grisham fan for years, this book is a major disappointment. I would have chucked it after first few chapters had I not been loyal to author. No character development, no plot twists, this book meanders without direction. I was truly hoping for a surprise ending, but was left totally unsatisfied. John, please give us something good, like Rainmaker II?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham continues to pound them out","review":"This was a typical Grisham book with enought twists and turns to keep your interest. As with most of his recent books it is not a hard read and the characters and plot is not deep. However, it makes for a very comfortable, non time consuming read for people who like Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed by this book","review":"If there was \\"No Star\\" listed, I would have chosen that option. I thought \\"The Testement\\" was bad, this is worse. There was no character development, no suspense, no twists and turns in the plot like his earlier books. I had no passion for nor could I have cared less about any character in the book. I even got the feeeling reading this book that someone else wrote it and stuck his name on it. It just didn't seem like a Grisham novel. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is an okay book","review":"The book was an easy read. But unlike his other books where there was at least one or two characters that you relate too in someone way. In this book, there is no such relationship built, between characters in the book or someone reading the book, just could not not relate. But I am still a Grisham fan with A Time to Kill, The Client are my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Grisham","review":"The Brethren reminded me of Grisham's earlier books. I have liked all his work, but this plot kept me reading, finished it on one day while traveling. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Brotherly Love","review":"I've always been a Grisham fan. But after the meandering of the Testament and now the unbelievability of the Brethren I'm beginning to think that maybe John has become just too hip or too Hollywood for his own good. What happended to the raw feelings of The Runaway Jury or the way he got us good and mad during A Time To Kill? John you've lost your edge!Take some time off now...really work on your next novel...be thoughtful...be suspenseful...Heck, just be the John Grisham of the late eighties and early nineties. We miss him and want him back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as his old stuff...","review":"I just couldn't speed through this.

The book moves along at a very quick pace since it lacks details.He should have taken more time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not a must read!","review":"John Girsham has put out a lot of excellent books, but lately they have not been gripping. The Brethren was a good book, but there were to many unanswered questions about the characters. We could have know a little more about Aaron Lake and some others. Also, I felt that John left the book opened for a sequel, I just didn't feel like it had a definite close to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I preorder the Brethren, couldn't wait to get my copy.

The Brethren are three funny, but ultimately unlikeable characters, who belong in jail. Teddy and Aaron are willful and gullible respectively, and ultimately both are unlikeable. You'll feel sorry for the victims and at this price (even less discounts) you'll feel like a victim yourself.However, Grisham's serialized \\"The Painted House\\" in the magazine Oxford American this month is very good reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked Focus","review":"The biggest problem I had with this book was there was no protagonist. The book was about too many characters and at the same time was not about them enough. I felt there was a lack of focus brought on by the lack of any character that you could follow and empathize with. The Bretheran were all in jail for good reason and I have difficulty empathizing with criminals.Lake was a one-dimensional character who was little more than a plot device and offered no personality or substance. Teddy was little more than a stereotypical military/spy buerocrat convinced the sky is falling. None of the people in the story had defined characters, they were all merely paper dolls to fill certain roles. I found that made the book lack any feeling or emotion whatsoever.The story is interesting, trying to figure out how the different strings come together and where they will end up, but the utter lack of character development and no central protagonist really made this a poor novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely passable","review":"It seems inescapable that Grisham's \\"The Firm\\" was his best story. After that, each book has gotten successively worse, roughly linearly, except for this one. \\"The Street Lawyer\\" was terrible; \\"The Brethren\\" just barely passes muster. It's not that it is unrealistic -- I work in a court and can suspend disbelief for most legal books (which, unfortunately, is invariably necessary) -- but that it is plain & simple a bad read. No real plot to speak of. No characters to which to become attached. No empathy with the story at all, in fact. Stale ideas, stale prose, awkwardly plotted and badly told. Skip this one unless you have absolutely nothing better to do; go back and read a much earlier Grisham or try Brad Meltzer's \\"The Tenth Justice\\". Or go for a brisk walk; anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham is back!","review":"Well, to be honest, after reading \\"The Testament\\" I swore myself to stay away from Grisham in the near future. But anyway - of course I bought his newest novel and was surprised. Grisham is back! The book is a real pageturner. Of course the characters are somewhat steril again. But combined with a great story, two plots and a good sense of humor it's his best novel since \\"A time to kill\\" and \\"The Rainmaker\\". So, dear John, let's forget \\"The Testament\\" and assume you had to pay some bills. Write more books like your latest and you've won a reader back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending?","review":"I am a great fan of Grisham's work; but, I was very disappointed with the ending of The Brethren. I always look forward to the trademark blockbuster endings but this book didn't seem to end...it just faded away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"When you read a John Grisham book, this is what usually happens: When you've reached pages 10 to 20, you become hooked, pages turn themselves, and you're done in a day or so. Not this time. I noted it took past page 100 or so for the \\"Grisham Effect\\" to take place. This is not a bad novel, but the high expectations never happen. You wait for a character with some redeeming quality (the 'hero') to appear, but it never happens. You wait for the plot twists, but it merely bends. And finally, you wait for the surprise ending that is not there. A good, but dissapointing, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Confused","review":"I am a huge Grisham fan, particularly because there are always characters that you are left admiring, as well as providing a measuring stick for one's own beliefs. This book has no such characters. I was so disappointed and confused at the end. I kept looking for the three judges to \\"get their due.\\" It never happens. Instead, it appears that all the bad guys win. Moreover, the homophobic undertones of the book surprised me, mainly because John Grisham has never shown any hint of prejudice in his books. Quite the contrary, if you think of the \\"Street Lawyer\\" and \\"Time to Kill.\\" I hope that there is a sequel coming, because it appears that the story is unfinished. The end just cannot be as Grisham left it, and still be a Grisham novel. Hopefully, the next book will take longer to write and give Grisham fans the excitement, the sense of justice, and the gritty characters that have excited us through all of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb!","review":"The title of my review says it all. This book had a ridiculous plot, uninteresting characters, and no ending. I kept waiting for the two worlds in the book to collide (as I knew they would), and when they did it was like \\"so what?\\" No suspense, no plot twists, no surprises, no nothing! Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another weak ending","review":"Last and certainly least! This is the weakest of all Grishams books. It took me about 80 pages before I was not forcing myself to continue reading. I usually grab the main character and root for him/her in Grisham's work. Not this time. They were all boring and none were clever. No character development and the plot was poor. Grisham never ends a book well. It is almost like he gets tired and wraps it up to get rid of the project but the ending did not detract from this. It was bad from beginning to end. I am only glad that I read it, so I can say I read it, when everyone that reads Grisham talks about it. Its an easy read. Try it. You may like it and think I am crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you SURE this is a Grisham?","review":"Wow...talk about pre-pub hype! I admit, I bought into it expected one of his best yet and all but tore open the box when it arrived. That moment was the most exciting part about my whole \\"Bretheren\\" experience. Is this really a Grisham book? What happened? It was a struggle to maintain interest and finish. The characters are underdeveloped, the storyline tedious and the ending a complete insult to those of us who've fallen in love with Grisham's earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL/The Brethren","review":"I am not easily pleased, but I absolutely loved this book. You are in on the workings of an extortion scam by three judges in federal prison. You are also in on a presidential campaign (master minded by the head of the CIA) to elect the \\"PERFECT\\" and \\"ELECTABLE\\" candidate Aaron Lake. A great lesson in power, money and honesty. I can see this coming soon to your nearest theater; much sooner that later I hope. I can't believe the negative reactions to this book, I WAS COMPLETELY DELIGHTED WITH THIS BOOK, and every friend that has read it agrees with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brethren doesn't bond","review":"This is the first time that a Grisham book disappointed me. The story line was not convincing and the ending was abysmal. None of the characters in this book were captivating. Better luck next time Mr. Grisham"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different approach","review":"Grisham is migrating. Read his first four books and compare to his last two. The Brethern is a two to one plot story that does have substance and some good laughs. The end was a bit flat, like he gave up and said it was finished. I liked the book because I like Grisham's style and I hope he keeps writing as he did. This is far better than The Chamber. Not his very best but if you're a fan, it's worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's reaching and coming up empty","review":"A Time to Kill is one of my favorite books of all time and I read it long before Grisham was famous. I see a lot of reviews here with readers who drink Grisham Kool-Aid. This was not a good book, but I'm not going to write Grisham off my reading list forever just because of one or two bad reads. It just seems that Grisham may be writing too much. This book stretches into the realms of science fiction...three judges in prison?...an omnipotent CIA director who is crippled?...a ubiquitous force of agents who make Big Brother seem benevolent?...A politician who listens to better judgement? Grisham bends reality to create a story...that's known as science fiction, not a legal/political thriller. I guess he has already run through all the standard struggling good lawyer vs. nemesis stories ever thought of and now he is reaching for premises that he can create a story from."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and flakey","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and this one is definately one of the worst ones. It was inadequatly developed and just plain trash. I'd usually put Grisham above Michael Crichton, but not this time. It was a fast read, but not stimulating in the least. If you're just looking to waste a few hours, pick up this book. If you're looking for something more stimulating, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome......zzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"First of all, I love John Grisham's books (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Testament, etc..)...most of the time.

Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best......but a good read anyway!","review":"Comparing this to Grisham's earlier work, The Brethren fails to stack up. Written a bit too simple, and lacking the punch & suspense I've come to appreciate from him, this is not his best work. But, I will continue to buy any new Grisham novel and give him the benefit of the doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a tv movie, or what?","review":"Anticipating a new Grisham novel is almost as much fun as racing through one. Until The Brethren.The plot of The Brethren is still full of Grisham's clever twists, quirky (Southern, mostly) characters, money and high stakes. The differences with this book are that there is no hero, no likable character at all, and it is just too, too timely. Grisham is entitled to his political opinions--and entitled to his success as a novelist. But I felt after reading this one that it had been designed to fulfill--probably successfully--three purposes:1) to make more money, 2) to make still more money as a movie, and 3) to grind Grisham's ax about the government and the 2000 presidential race.I felt there should have been a dustcover warning: What you are about to read is a political statement; entertainment is solely secondary. Proceed at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham at his weakest","review":"I've read every Grisham and this is the worst since \\"The Chamber.\\" If this had been his second novel instead of \\"The Firm,\\" he'd still be practicing law. This book is pointless, full of holes and has no suspense. Unlike the best of Grisham there's no one to root for. I'll keep reading Grisham but I start waiting for the paperbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No end in sight","review":"I enjoyed the plot but agree with most everyone else..there was no end. It is amazing to me that such a gifted storyteller can end a book in this manner and not realize that he has not completed the story. I did not understand the ending and I don't understand how he can just drop a period at the end of a sentence with no closure to the plot. Doesn't he realize what he has done and that readers would be critical of this apparent abrupt disregard for bringing his plot to an exciting and thought provoking ending? He, as an acclaimed author, must surely be aware of what he was doing. What was going through his mind when the decision was made to end the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham delivers again","review":"The Brethern is certainly different from Grisham's earlier works. There is a role for a lawyer in the story, but only a minimum one. The strength of the book, besides Grisham's fine writing, is in the plot (or plots), building around various conspiracies or scams concocted by the characters in the story, including a top US government official. I found the book a little slow to begin with, and I guess that's because there are so many characters involved in the story. Half way through, I still did not know who the real heroes are. But, typical of Grisham, he keeps us in suspense all the way and the outcome is full of surprises. Yes, Grisham has delivered the goods once again. His fans would not be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worthy of one star","review":"I only gave it one because this review wouldn't post without one. I feel that this book was simply words on paper. I had little or no regard for any of the characters and consequently couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of them. There were also many logistical flaws in this book and I really doubt Grisham bothered to do any research at all in order to write The Brethren. I felt it was a huge waste of time and I'm very disappointed with this used-to-be-great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shy of excellent","review":"While I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Grisham's books in the past, I found that this book didn't match up to his previous excellence. A compelling read, I was not dissappointed in the book, but was not astounded by its brilliance either. If you really want a story that makes for an in-depth study of character development, read his previous novel, and one of my favorites, \\"The Firm\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy only in Paper back.Hard Cover not worth the extra money.","review":"The book starts out with good characters, does nothing with them and has an extremely weak endding. You will feel like you do when you go to a movie theater and walk out feeling like you should have waited and rented it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Let Down","review":"Have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed only for it to have such a bad ending that it ruins the whole thing?That's what happens in the Brethren.The book starts off with two separate storylines; one is about three judges who have wound up in a federal jail in Florida and the mail scam they run, the other about a politician who has been designated the next President by the CIA.You know somehow that the two plot lines will merge, it's just a question of how. Unfortunately, by the end there is no real resolution to the story the book just ends...a real disappointment to an otherwise better than average book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Recommend This One","review":"I've read and enjoyed most of John Grisham's novels, but this one bored me to tears. The premise was a good one, but the plotting and the writing dulled all hope of an interesting story. The fact that there was not one single likable character just added to the depressing trend of the tale. Like a few other reviewers here, I struggled through 400 plus pages hoping for a satisfying conclusion. It didn't happen. I just can't find anything good in this book to recommend it to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL!!","review":"For those of you who rated this one highly, here's one of ....We have a bent lawyer who unknowingly has 2 CIA agents posing in his office. There are a multitude of hidden cameras filming the lawyer day and night and yet when he goes to the prison the CIA only put a mic in his briefcase which ... is supposed to be as big as a golf ball in this day and age. All the time reading it I was thinking, why haven't they wired him all over? A team of crack CIA operatives are watching this pathetic drunk and yet he eludes him - but still ... for some unfathomable reason. while the real 'crooks' somehow don't get knocked off by the CIA and in the bargain get 2 million dollars each. It's bloody rubbish!!! And childish. In fact, the plot would insult a 12 year old.No star. Dreadful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward spiral and one step away from a crash","review":"I have read all his works. Up to the Testament he was producing some great material. In the Testament the plot and characters started to descend and in the Brethren he continues the dive. Does he have a quota for producing quantity instead of quality? I was hoping the Testament was an anomoly but the Brethren proves the streak is over. I bet they can't make a movie out of this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just kinda drifts off...","review":"Great premise and could have been an extraordinary story, but it appears that Grisham forgot to flesh it out past a Hollywood treatment. Reading the last few pages, I was on edge waiting for the EXPLOSIVE finale. Didn't happen. I think that he was already into his next big, blockbuster, chart-busting, top o'the list bestseller and just shoved this one to the side..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a disappointment","review":"For me this was the most disappointing Grisham novel yet. Unlike some of his more polished stories, Brethren lacked the essentials of a good novel. Certainly nowhere near the underlying psychological tension of The Firm, for example.Character development was weak, the plot lines were strained and the hypothesis completely unbelievable. The ending failed to bring any sort of critical denouement to the storylines and seemed as if it was thrown together because the author ran out of typewriter ribbon. It may sell a lot of copies but I'd only recommend purchasing this if you are the ultimate diehard Grisham fan...or if you just want to read a sodapop novel, have it taste good and then burp, it's gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite simply, Mr. Grisham's worst.","review":"I have enjoyed a few of Grisham's novels to pass time on long flights or the beach. Most have been enjoyable for the genre; that is, don't take it too seriously. Obviously Grisham is an author looking to sell books, rather than write a strong story. I think he does have it in him, I would certainly welcome the attempt.The Brethren is by far his worst. I am embarrased to have read it and finished it. The only benefit I can see in my \\"accomplishment\\" is that I can save others from such a folly. Read anything, just not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper.......","review":"This book fell completely flat for me. Not enough character or plot development. I was finished with the book way before I even cared about what was going on. JG has usually made me atleast want to know what's going to happen next. This time the only reason I finished the book was because it was a quick read and I had nothing better to do on a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"A friend gifted me with The Brethren and I ulitmately got through it after putting it down and thinking that, since no book could possibly be that bad, it had to get better. . . but, it did not. The Brethren is worthy of inclusion in the bottom 10 list of the worst books of all times, right below The Street Lawyer (which I bought myself and vowed I'd never buy another Grisham book). This silly silly book had nothing. Nothing. No developed central character or no plot that anyone with an IQ approaching the imbecile level, or above, would believe for a nanosecond. On the other hand, it was so pitifully bad, it was funny. I get it! Grisham's done a comedy. (It would have to improve to deserve even one star.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham proves there is life for him outside of courtrooms.","review":"Good plot, and easy reading. He ventures away from the classic trial theme and does a good job at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"It appears as though Mr. Grisham -- much like the characters in this awful book -- is too busy spending his royalties before they're received, rather than concentrating on his writing. A poor effort that shows little regard for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disapointed with this story. There was no suspense as in previous stories by Mr. Grisham. Just when you thought the story would take a turn it didn't. I dare say it was predictable. There were no \\"good guys\\" and no \\"hero.\\" In past stories by Grisham his characters had principles, not so with anyone in \\"The Brethren.\\" Very disappointing and almost depressing. The darkest story Grisham has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You gotta keep busy\\"","review":"Just finished \\"The Brethren\\". The last four have been great, and this just keeps me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"This was the biggest disapointment in a novel Ihave read in a long time. It is certainly not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"I love John Grisham--especially Testament and The Partner. I was disappointed that I purchased this one in hardback. I had read the first chapter on the net and thought it was a little slow, but I figured it would speed up and be as good as the previous books. I went ahead and purchased the hardback and it continued to be slow. I had a hard time getting into the plot and was bored through parts of it. I really did not like how it ended. Would I recommend it to my friends--only if they borrow my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"Well, where do I start? I really enjoyed Grisham's previous works but this one just never takes off. Many, many, loose ends. Seems like the book was beginning to build and it ended in two pages! Very disappointed with this latest offering. Hope he get recharged and comes back strong. If your going to miss reading one of his books this is the ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for it at the library","review":"Easily his worst book. Worst than Rainmaker. Very boring and unbelievable story with no surprises at all. Save your money and borrow from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh where, oh where has John Grisham gone....","review":"This MUST be his evil twin. There is no way this is the same author that wrote The Firm and The Client. I gave this book 100 pages (my general rule) to grab my attention. After that, I just gave up. In the past, I would have waded through the novel, hoping that eventually it would live up to its potential. I did that with The Chamber and what a waste of time that was. Waste no more. Maybe it's not fair for me to pass such judgement when I didn't even finish the book, but had the book been anything like his earlier works, it wouldn't have taken 10 pages to grab my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a real disappointment, and I am an avid fan of John Grisham. Maybe he is turning books out too quickly; they just don't have the interesting storylines and great suspense they did several years ago. I had a hard time getting through this one, and was really glad to be done with it. I didn't even care how it ended. It just wasn't \\"The Firm,\\" \\"The Partner,\\" or \\"The Rainmaker.\\" I won't rush out to buy his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS able to put it down!","review":"As much as I love Grisham's books, this one was a bit of a disappointment. It did not have the \\"flow\\" of his other books, and I found that it took me longer to read this book then most of his other lengthier books. I thought with the mail scam the judges had going, some mention would be made of federal postal inspectors involvment, but he did not choose to go there. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but also a disappointment---would anyone who had received such a lucky break be that stupid? If you have never read any of Grisham's books, do not judge him on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No too good...not that bad...","review":"Grisham knows how to tell a story. The setup here was very very cool, but the story just sort of... ended.... Whacking the drunk lawyer surprised me - seemed really out of place... I will continue to buy Mr. Grisham's books and will just figure he didn't have his heart into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham lo mein","review":"To me John Grisham books are like chinese food. I crave them, once I get one I wolf it down, and afterwards I ask myself: Why did I do that?If you liked \\"The Firm\\", you'll like this book too.It is predictable, but I think this is more than compensated by Grisham's honest and accurate treatment of the law. Plus, it's an amusing premise: 3 disgraced judges \\"doing time the federal way.\\"Good beach book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"It only took about 75 pages for me to wonder how this book could have been published and why would anyone pay 20 plus dollars to purchase it. To say that the plot was paper thin would be kind, this plot was totally unbelievable. Why would Grisham think that we would believe that the CIA director could tell the Presidential Candidate about secret mass murders but he couldn't tell the Candidate what the CIA had found out about his personal life. Give me a break. My advice is to not waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"While THE BRETHREN has Grisham's characteristic pace and styling, two major flaws made it a disappointing read. First, there were no likeable characters - no one to cheer for or fear for. Second, the plot lacked suspense - likely because I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. Grisham seems to have written this one while in a cynical funk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judges in Jail. COOL!!!!!!","review":"I passed on the last few Grisham books, but as a lawyer I couldn't resist reading about judges in jail. (Could there be a song in that?) While this does not live up to Grisham's early novels, it is well written and has lots of intrigue. It is certainly worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book combines all the plot twist we are used to with Grisham while proving that he can work outside the courtroom. The characters in the story are extremely real. And the concept, while hopefully fictional, seems very believable. He keeps you guessing until the end as to all the tie-ins. The book is a good story until you relize at the end how they fit together. This suspense is what makes the book great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Entertaining","review":"While I didn't have high expectations for 'The Bretheren', what I found was an entertaining novel with a very believable plot. Definitely an easy read, with characters that hold your attention. Makes you wonder who is really running the Washington show..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a Little Different","review":"Although this is only the 3rd book I've read by John Grisham, I found it quite different. It was light, enjoyable and at times, it was humorous. It was so enjoyable to me that I found difficulty putting it down.I look forward to more like this from John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh? did it end there?","review":"i never really found myself enjoying any one whole page of the book, nor did i like the book as a whole at all.the characters were too unbelievable to be interesting. and the whole plot just didn't seem real at all (maybe even less real than the worst of jeffrey archer's books). plus, the book stubbornly refused to offer any climax.it turned out that i was a very patient person. (surprisingly) i finished the whole book. but i did that only based on the expectation that grisham would be kind enough to save the readers from total frustration by giving them a good/surprise ending. but as if he wanted to tease those who endured all the 400+ pages, grisham ended the book just in a way one would end a chapter.after \\"runaway jury\\", this one and the like, i was no longer sure if i would pick up another grisham's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort","review":"I read this book with great anticipation. It had all of the elements necessary for me to love it: a tawdry plot, interesting characters, and a political story line (its so hard to find good political fiction). Yet this book is so disappointing. The ending seems to be building into a cresendo and then thud. You feel duped and betrayed. A decent book but nothing like I expected. If Grisham doesn't shape up soon, I am going to have to stop reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"It seems to me that once a person has made a name for themselves in the world of popular fiction their writing deteriorates. Once I had been introduced to all the players in the book it was predictable and therefore boring. It was just too easy and pointless. If this had been another author would this book have been published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Is this the same Grisham who wrote \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Rianmaker\\" etc? Very boring book to read.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Disappointed Long-Time Fan","review":"I cannot believe that John Grisham wrote this book. The ending was foreseeable from the first chapter. Still, I continued to read it hoping that there would be the usually twist in the plot. I finished the book with the oddist sensation. It was not one of surprise that I would normally experience but relief that it was finally over.I am glad that this is not the first John Grisham book that I have read or it would be my last. I have faith that whatever took place during the writing of this book is over and his writing style will return to the great books that we have come to know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor effort on Grisham's part","review":"Very disapointing. Not much effort by Grisham here. The ending was very anti-climatic. I will think twice before buying another John Grisham novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book goes nowhere","review":"I don't know what got into Grisham. Maybe he is getting bored. Maybe he had a contract he had to fill, but didn't have any ideas. Anyway, the book starts out with a reasonable premise. But there is no real suspense in the development and the end. The story went nowhere and finished flat. I'm glad I read the library's copy and didn't spend money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!","review":"Usually I read Grisham with guilty pleasure, staying up well into the night until it is done. With this book I find myself taking a nap all the time - it literally puts me to sleep. And I have to force myself to continue. These characters have no redeeming value and the story is depressing and manipulative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Sorry, John but your characters didn't grip me. I couldn't even finish the novel! Not up to your usual standards.We need something fresh and engaging. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Grisham's best","review":"A bit lame- the story is original, but it doesn't tie up, especially the end which is disappointing. I still can't figure out why some people get killed and others don't .........! But, as a great fan of Grisham's, his style is still impeccable and his character descriptions very amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Best","review":"A very entertaining story. With \\"The Testament\\" and now \\"The Brethren\\", Grisham has branched out from the purely courtroom stories; the result is each book is better than the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the suspence?","review":"I thought that the book was okay, but nowhere nere as good as what I hove gotten used to. The plot was predictable and there was no suspence. I read it just because I am a Grisham fan, but I thought that it needs a longer ending. It wasn't really boring, but he can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable (Great Plot, Enjoyable, yet TOO predictable)","review":"By page 40, I had a guess what it would be like. By page 90 I wrote down on a sheet of what my prediction of the ending would be, and told myself how disapointed I would be if I was right. Sadly, the book was so predictable that I nailed the ending completely (except for the 'time for children again in the white house' part).Grisham, keep up your writing, but put back the surprise twists please.I give this book .5 - 1.0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor John ran out of good Southern Lawyer stories...","review":"Have read most Grisham books to date. Most have been predictable but enjoyable. Would liken his style to a grown-up Hardy Boys book. Clean with simple plots, easy to read. This latest output seems like it was forced out, to meet a deadline or condo payment. (Maybe it wasn't his own story?) At any rate, save your money and buy Angela's Ashes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, I was wrong","review":"I have read every Grisham book. My husband likes to buy me the hardcovers when they hit the shelves. When we saw this one in the stores, my husband asked if I wanted it, and if I thought it would be good. I said \\"Of course it will be good! All of Grishams books are good.\\" Now I have to tell my husband I was wrong. I don't know if I can forgive you for that John."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you get this book from someone for free...","review":"If you get this book from someone for free, it is still not worth reading. It is like going to a bad movie and leaving the theater wondering what all the fuss was about. Grisham's publisher must be pressuring him to write for the sake of the almighty dollar, because little effort has been put into this book to even give it a chance to rank up there with his earlier works. John, if this is the best you can do at this stage of your career, please quit while you are still on top. Your fans deserve better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grisham filler?","review":"Mr. Grisham certainly has his up's and downs. This book is clearly a weak effort. Although, to be fair, it is entertaining to a degree. But this is not why I look forward to Grisham's next book and, I suspect, not why millions of his fans tune in. I expect excellence from his work (Firm, Partner)and must admit that this seems to be a real \\"satisfy the contract filler.\\" Sorry, John. I know you can do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"great read until the end","review":"this is my second Grisham book. I liked the good story telling and interesting characters. The end was terrible, unimaginative, and unsatisfying. I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book....until the end","review":"Grisham is by far my favorite author. This book though....well it just stops! No real ending, it just stops. There isn't a conclusion. I don't know how else to put it....very, very disappointing. But I'll NEVER stop reading his books. One dud in ten is a pretty darn good average :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just churning out books","review":"Grisham starts out with a great idea and great political timing then I think a weekend rolled around and he wrapped things up early. The Brethren would've made a dynamite 800 page thriller but he turned it into a subpar 300 page novelette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Every time Grisham releases a new book I always tell myself that I am not going to buy it. (I have not enjoyed a Grisham novel since he wrote The Pelican Brief). However, I usually end up giving in about a week after publication. I should have listened to myself with this novel too. I feel that he has lost his ability to write novels and is now just writing screenplays. Oh well, there is always the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I used to be a Grisham fan, but you can be let down by a writer just so many times. His last books have been mildly disappointing. With The Brethren he has conceived the most unbeliavable plot line, characters appear and disappear for no logical reason. Everything in this book is so one-dimensional and contrived that you never forget that it is only a piece of fiction - and bad fiction at that. Mr. Grisham was never a great writer, but he was always good entertainment. Not anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book seemed like two separate stories that intersect with an interesting twist. Three disgraced former judges who call themselves The Brethren are serving time in a federal correctional facility. They dispense jail justice to the inmates and devise a lucrative scam. One quiet senator is about to have his life turned upside down as he begins the run for President. If you have read Grisham books before you will find characters that you already know. An interesting look at politics and a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and very non-violent compared to his other novels.","review":"Grisham's ability of story telling is immensely talented.Also, unlike his other novels, there are no rapes nor any gruesome murders. I would recommend this book to anyone who has enough wisdom to know the justice system and enough vocabulary enjoy a fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Populism for ever!","review":"Mr.Grisham should give a decision.Earning money easily being over-populist or being a respected writer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocrity revealed at last","review":"Grisham's novels are highbrow trash and this one, the Brethren, finally shows him for what he is: not worth the price of the book at all. He has made millions with his stories but this one is not at all captivating or fetching. He should go back to sitting in the southern sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best work","review":"This kept my attention to some degree, but it never WENT anywhere. Once the premise was laid, it just kind of wallowed along and there was never really a climax, I'm not sure what character was supposed to be the one we cared about or liked or rooted for...They were all pretty disgusting. And the ending was like...what thats your ending...come on wheres the next disk? Something more has to happen than this! Theres alot of good audiobooks to invest 10 hours in so don't spend it on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, do I feel stupid","review":"As you may have read in other reviews the first few chapters of this book alternate between two totally different subjects. Grisham did a masterful job joining the two. I didn't see it coming. I should have. The book is an easy and quick read. No problem following it at all. I especially enjoyed the CIA agents with their gadgets. The only negative thing I can say is that I'll have to go at least a year before reading another one of Grisham's offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF HIS BEST","review":"When reading this book, I kept thinking of a \\"Three Stooges\\" episode. Although the book was somewhat humerous, it lacked the type of depth and meaning found in some of his other novels such as \\"A Time To Kill\\" and \\"The Testament\\". I thought the ending fell very, very flat and it appeared that the author was in a hurry to complete the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a plot...but that's about it...","review":"Grisham peaked with \\"The Client\\" and \\"The Brethren\\" is just another book continuing the downward trend. The basic plot is there, but it lacks development and passion. The story dragged on without suspense or excitement. And as for the ending, what ending? It is as much of a wash as the rest of the book. If you are looking for mindless dribble, then by all means, buy the book...but I'd wait until it's on sale...in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a novel from Grisham?","review":"I just finished reading 'The Brethren'. The story is more predictable than thrilling. This book is so different from his earlier novels that I even wonder if it is his own work. The style in writing as well as the concept of the story does simple not match with the work which brought Grisham his deserved fame years ago! Grisham fans will buy it anyway ... others might like it, especially when they tend more two general fiction than to legal thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books - even before he became rich and famous. I am always first in line to buy his new books each and every year. I read some of the reviews at Amazon before I bought the book and should have listened to them. This was a waste of time. There was no character I cared about. No story line that was interesting. Don't waste your money. And pray no movie gets made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is a complete disappointment. The first half of the book was typical and built the characters and the story, then something happened. A tight web was woven with the CIA monitoring all the mail and somehow a letter which pulls the plot together gets through the web? Was there no way to pull the book together other than to rip off the reader, hoping that nobody would notice? There was no second half to the book, after the letter gets through the story goes down hill rapidly. I gave the book one star because I had to, but I feel that John Grisham owes me that star back. I also resent that I bought this book. I have bought every one of John Grisham's books the day they hit the street, brought them home and devoured them. This book was a real disappointment for a true fan of his ability to write good, believable, enjoyable books. I have to hope that he will make it up to me with his next endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move Over Rice & King","review":"Yes I will admit to reading The Brethren. Seems Grisham has gone the way of Anne Rice (post-vampire) and Stephen King (post Green Mile). I am disappointed that my favorite authors seem so uninspired lately and looks like I will need to seek fresher talent for my bookworming activity. Good reading for those with insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I felt insulted by this book. The characters were not fully developed, and the sense of drama, the legalese was starkly missing. Mr. Grisham seems rather inept in the political and electioneering process, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham let me down","review":"As a diehard Grisham fan I bought The Brethren soon as it hit the streets. I read it in two nights working the two interwoven plots, and figuring how Grisham would bring this together. It could not be as elemental as it appeared. It was. I should have realized when it started on page 9 instead of page 1 something was wrong. I got to the end, and threw the book in the trash. Grisham had something more important to do then write one of his usually fantastic endings. What a waste of genius"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I guess this is John Grisham is due a bad book once in a while, I heard some people I spoke with his \\"laundry list\\" proving some people will buy anything certain authors write. Since the \\"Pelican Brief\\" Grisham has gone down hill some but this book is just plain bad. The story seems to go nowhere fast and seems to limp along at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"I sure expected more from this book. Grisham does a fantastic job all the way through half the book. After that, the story is predictable, some secondary characters are never mentioned again (not that they were missed) and the conclusion is anti-climatic. Not best Grisham material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent, uneven, not even worth the read.","review":"Grisham gets further and further away from his earlier brilliant books. I could barely follow the extremely implausible and uneven plot line. He is really inconsistent, often the characters contradict themselves within a few lines or paragraphs, i.e., extolling that they will only go so far to bend the rules of law, which they hold sacred, then in the next breath they go way over the line, almost in parody of what they just said. Grisham's had his time, wrote some of the best pageturners ever. This one was phoned in or ghost-written in a couple of days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Implausible plot, not one character with any redeeming values, poorly written....and the WORST ending I have ever read. This book is horrible and is a mere shadow of his better works."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Blair Witch Project, you'll love this book!","review":"The last time I felt ripped off this bad, was when I saw the Blair Witch Project. That was the first time in years where I wanted walk out of a movie and get my money back. That's essentially how I felt about this book. JG should provide a refund. I know some people will like this book, just as some liked the Blair Witch movie, (different strokes for different folks). I felt JG's books were inconsistent in the past, but I pretty much enjoyed them. But, this book has no character worth rooting for, little or no conflict, no suspense, or no rising action, it's just plain BORING! The only person greedier than the judges in this book is JG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Typical Grisham","review":"Although it isn't Grisham's best work, I have to admit that I couldn't put it down. Yes, there are a lot of flaws, but it still makes for good fiction. The big disappointment was the ending. I wonder what was going through Grisham's mind whe he wrote the last few pages. It is worth reading but be prepared to be somehwhat disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment . . .","review":"I eagerly looked forward to reading this next installment of Grisham's. What a disappointment. This book was lightweight compared to his previous blockbusters. There were too many characters intertwined who had no real purpose in the story. The underlying sub-plot of the \\"brethren\\" was also a turnoff. I miss the courtroom drama of his previous books and the intensity that always lies within. This book is not a true representation of Grisham's talent. Novels like \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Testament\\" and \\"The Partner\\" more accurately depict the true genius Grisham is. This particular book shows that he, too, can write a bad novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, poor execution","review":"I bough \\"The Brethren\\" driven solely on Grisham's credentials, not bothering to read the reviews. Big mistake! I can't believe Grisham dropped so low after writing so many engaging stories. I am saddened his been bitten by the same bug that damaged a few of today's best writers.The writing was repetitive. Characters were flat; none were likable. The ending was disastrous. It appeared Grisham wrote this one half-heartedly, as if only to meet a deadline, to meet a commitment to produce a book, any book, not literature.I've read The Rainmaker, The Partner, The Testament, The Runaway Jury, and The Street Lawyer. None among his best, all better by far than this flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This book, similar to the ones he has written in the recent past was a waste of time and money. I bought it thinking that this will be a better one, but, NO. The begining was allright but as one reads along there is no suspense or excitement anywhere to grasp your interest. I am thouroughly disappointed and wouldn't recommend anyone buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaps, Gaps and more Gaps","review":"I have to say that this is the worst of all the Grisham novels. There are more holes in this story than swiss cheese. Grisham is getting like CSI. He is writing down to the people that can't follow a normal story. This book assumes so much and leaves a million questions open."},{"rating":"1","title":"infuriating","review":"The Brethren features an intricate, suspenseful build-up. And that's it. The book just ends, with no satisfying resolution to all the seeds it's planted. The story is completely absurd and a monumental waste of time, and should be retitled \\"Really Much Ado About Nothing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham riding on past successes","review":"An extremely disappointing book. The author seems to have run out of decent ideas and is now trading on the reputation he established with his earlier novels. It appears that he had no idea where the story would end when he started writing, and that's exactly what happens. Right up to the last page, I kept hoping that something creative would emerge. No such luck. I guess one might say that the book has a plot, but it has one of the flatest endings of any novel that I can recall. Each of his last several books has been a bigger disappointment than the one before. The good news is that this is the last review I will probably write relating to his works, since I don't intend to waste my time reading any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually fun, if you don't take it seriously...","review":"This was a fun John Grisham novel. Sure, the characters are sleazy, people are killed, etc, but behind the whole thing the author was clearly enjoying himself. I enjoyed it more than most Grishman novels. In fact, one could argue that the entire book is a meditation, a condemnation, a spoof of national politics--but I doubt that the intention...maybe it was. Anyway, it is a fun ride that is not typical Grisham--which is a good thing. One thing that is very spooky, is that book was written in 2000...Grisham had the threat of terrorism to the United States nailed perfectly. I wonder if he thought of this book on 9/11. Oh well. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brethren","review":"The book I read was the call The Brethren, written by John Grisham. I feel this was a great introductory book to read from his large selection. I enjoyed every page of it! The book was easy to understand and it always kept me in suspense. In the beginning there were two main plots in the book, but twords the end they merged together. The book combined the world of lawyers and the U.S. government and created one awesome story. There were some confusing parts, but I say go pick it up and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Grisham's Greatest, But Not His Worst By A Long Shot","review":"With The Brethren, John Grisham has written yet another engaging, thrilling novel. The plot centers around three judges who were disbarred due to their criminal activities. While serving time at a federal prison, they form the brethren, a group that controls the prison system with an iron fist. They come up with a scheme in which they will prey upon people with secrets to hide. From the first page, Grisham draws us in with his trademark twists and turns. As usual, this was a quick read. This is definitely a book that everyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's Best","review":"I had picked up The Brethren awhile ago but never got into the book for some reason. When I finally did get past the first few pages I was hooked! It may not be great literature, but it will definitely hold your attention. This book is written in the typical Grisham style with plots and subplots all over the place. All of these loose ends do eventually tie together and make for a very interesting read. The ending is better than some of Grisham's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Grisham","review":"This book is about three retired judges running a scam, against closeted gay men, from prison. It is also about the director of the CIA grooming a political puppet to run for President. It takes about two minutes of thought to figure out how these two plots intersect.If you are a Grisham fan, you will read this book. Otherwise, just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could ruin Grisham","review":"I generally have enjoyed John Grisham's novels, but this one left me appalled. A fairly clever blackmailing scheme by three corrupt judges, jailed in the same prison, accidentally intersects with an evil plot to take over the U.S.A. The take-over is being engineered by government insiders, presumably within the CIA, who have at their disposal unbelievable resources and technology. An undertone of homophobia is the final nail in the coffin. Skip this book - Grisham must have let his dog write it. (Yes, I'm a cat lover.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"This is the worst fiction book I have EVER read, and the second worst book I've ever read (Mein Kampf is the worst, just so you know what level I'm dealing with). I'd gladly give this book minus 5 or 10 stars if it were possible. I'm not a big fan of most of Grisham's work, only enjoying A Time to Kill and Testament. This work made sure that I will never read anything else by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"If this is the best that John Grisham can do, he ought to give up writing novels. It is trite, mundane, boring and has no intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's latest is a big disappointment","review":"As one who has read all of John Grisham's novels, I must say this is probably the weakest of all of his efforts. There is not one redeeming quality to the novel and none of the major characters is in any way a sympathetic character. If this indeed marks a turning point in Mr. Grisham's writing career as some have suggested, I shall probably spend my time with other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham? Are you sure?","review":"What a huge disappointment. I look forward to my yearly February read of Grisham's latest novel. This one was a jumble of characters, none of them believable. The story line was pretty good, but I just couldn't get into it. If you are a Grisham fan, you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet!","review":"John Grisham has reached a new low in \\"The Brethern\\". After taking us on some fantastic rides with his earlier novels, Grisham has slipped into a quagmire of average writing and predictable plots. He needs to step back from turning out novels for the sake of a buck. I know that I'll wait before I rush to the store to buy his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and I am a die-hard fan of his, but I found The Brethern to be disappointing. I usually devour his books and read them sometimes in one night because they are such page turners, but The Brethren I kept putting down because it was boring. I didn't care for any of the characters, the ending was lame, and the story line was very unrealistic. If you have to read this book, wait until it comes out in paperback, or borrow a friend's copy. You'll be glad you saved your money. Let's hope next year's book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"fulfilling a contract","review":"Just like a rock group with a contract for so many albums a year, Grisham barely fulfilled his contract with Doubleday. I hope Doubleday doesn't renew his contract. Grisham laughs all the way to the bank, at the readers expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redeeming qualities","review":"So I get a Amazon gift certificate for Christmas and I say to myself, gotta get the new Grishham. Loved the last 2 - The Street Lawyer & The Testament - they had people who you could root for and who ended up having some sort of redemption in their lives. In other words, all Grishham novels up to now had \\"anti-heroes\\", but they did the right things for the wrong reason, or the wrong things for the right reason. But there are no such characters in the Brethren. I think the author had so much bad feedback from the Testament that he had gone Christian or had lost his cynical touch, that he just gave us all cynicism and no heart in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save it for the beach","review":"Not his best outing. Lame blend of his previous books. Save this book for reading after you finish 18 holes in the morning and don't feel like doing anything taxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly disappointed!","review":"I agree with every negative comment your customers made. I have read every one of Grisham's books, and I can't believe John wrote this one. It took me a whole month to read this book. I had to make myself finish it. I went to sleep every time I tried to read it. I hope he reads all our comments and does a better job on his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I have read almost all of John Grisham's books and it seems to me that they keep getting worse. I loved The Firm, A Time to Kill, and the Partner. After the Street Lawyer his book are just boring, the Testiment was a little better. The Brethren was about the worst of his books that I have read. It took me so long to get through. I was not reading the book to find out what happens but to just finish it so I could start a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to all the twists and turns","review":"I am a big Grisham fan. This book was just plain! Where are all the twists and turns his books usually take. The story was one I could read and put down. Usually his books keep me hooked. Life is too short to waste your time on this one. Read A Time To Kill if you want great reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"John lost his steam","review":"I always loved Grisham's works, before the Testament. I kinda fond of The Rain Maker, The Runaway Jury too, I think they're John's best novels. But now...... Come on John, certainly you could make something better than this? Kinda getting boring, I think. Always screwed up the government, always connected with high money (or dirty money), could you think another subject John? I'm sorry to say this, but I'm sorry for buying this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Grisham So far","review":"I have been a fan of John Grisham for years. He is not my favorite author but probably one of the top five or six. It was a fair read for the first two-thirds or so, then fizzled. I kept expecting something to happen, but the end of the book kept getting nearer and nearer and never really did. It was as if the author lost interest after writing the first part of the book. I will keep an open mind as far as future books, but this one I can't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fulfilling a contractual obligation....","review":"I think he called this one in. Very unsatisfying. Not finished"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor imitation of a novel","review":"There is no intrigue, no ending, and took effort to continue reading. It appears to have been written just to make (not earn) money. I feel like writing Mr. Grisham and asking for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mystery-Just Another Enemy of the State","review":"I cannot beleive I paid good money for this book It was so predicatable from beginning to end-I was disappointed(although Testamont was even more disapponting)I maay have to stop reading John Grisham Books-Mary Higgins Clark is so much better I mean Big Brother,Homesexuals and Prison Inmates-give me a break-John Grisham please don't make a movie out of this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best but possibly his worst","review":"It appears John grew tired and wrote an ending just to stop the pain of continuning a weak story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I enjoyed this one! Excellent story line that kept me riveted to the pages. Coundn't put it down. As always, I look forward to the movie and the next book from this great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read all Mr. Grisham's book and the quality continues to decline. Never was difficult to put it down. Just didn't excite me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...but not worth the effort","review":"I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do. It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character. I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting...","review":"I have all of Grisham's works and have enjoyed all of them; however, The Brethren, was quite a disappointment. The frustrating part is that it had all of the makings of an excellent book, but it did not have a build up of excitement nor did it end with an unpredictable conclusion. I will continue to read his books, but I have to say this was not one of his better works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a Grisham fan, but this book was definitely subpar. While it started out as a promising book, it ended up just being boring. The end was very predictable, and there were few plot twists. I would recommend some of his other books (Partner, Firm, Time to Kill), but not this one. I agree with a previous reviewer that said that the last half of the book seemed rushed - perhaps by an overly eager publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Shapeless, Boring, Bland","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all of Grisham's earlier novels, such as A Time to Kill, The Firm, The Client and The Rainmaker. However, with THe Brethren, the trend begun with the Partner and The Street Lawyer was continued: uninteresting characters no one cares about, a predictable plot, slow start. In his early works, there were always one or two characters I truly cared about, but not so this time. The only half-interesting person in this book was the 23yearold with a 48 year sentence, Buster. I didn't root for Trevor, nor did I care about Aaron Lake, the CIA, the three judges or any of the others. Frankly, I think Mr. Grisham is running out of plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the meat?","review":"Disappointing! I'm an avid fan and grabbed the book the first day it was on the shelf. Two weeks later I was FINALLY finished.I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the other books that John Grisham has authored. This one seemed like a hurried attempt to put something out. The prison/political sub-plot was confusing and the outcome became pretty obvious.I sincerely hope that the next book returns to the same style of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Again I say, what a waste of time. Both Grisham's and mine. Don't bother to read it. And if you just have to, borrow it from your local library. Don't pay for it! No heroes, no one to root for, no one to feel sorry for except the reader. Come on John, I know you can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John must be tired -","review":"Having read all of John's books and finding that the last couple were not as good as the earlier ones, I was hoping that The Brethren would be in the spirit of the earlier books. This was not the case for me. In fact, I found this bood to be most disappointing. The suspense was not there. There was a 'dangling' sub story that went nowhere (did John forget to show its significance?)The 'joining up' of the two stories was not very believable even for a novel. The ending was 'cute' but left me feeling cheated. I was hoping for a Grisham ending that would let me say WOW! Instead it left me saying that I wasted my time reading the book. Sorry John, but you need to get energized before you write your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just cranking them out? ....","review":"John Grisham's lastest novel has great potential...a good story line, an interesting mix of characters, and even the right policital timing - but what happened? Although the book starts out well, as the two stories begin to intertwine, the novel just slips and fades away. Attempts at humor appear sarcastic and cynical. There's no true charater development, no exciting climax, and often the story draggs- not going anywhere. I stuck it out, hoping for some of John's typical twists or surprises or excitment, but no such luck. The whole book had a \\"manufactored\\" feel to it....just cranking out the next one so he could pick up the check. It could have been a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the End a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"The book was well written until the last 50-100 pages. The ending was a very big let down from such a great author. I wish I had waited for the paper back version. It was not worth the hard cover price. I cant wait and really hope John Grisham can improve the endings fo future booksand that he will not feel rushed to finish the next novel. That is what it seems happened to the Brethren. the first and middle are well written then just falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stay up late to read this book !","review":"Night after night, I tried to keep awake fighting myself through this endless and boring book. What should I say: Battle lost, deeply disappointed, especially about the \\"end\\" of the story: It simply doesn't have one. What a waste of time, what a dramatic drop after \\"The Testament\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"I have read every book ever written by John Grisham. In \\"The Brethren\\", I found the characters weak and the story line slow. I can't tell you how many times I put the book down out of boredom. The ending was a disappointment. I found myself saying, \\" Is that it?\\" I admit, when I finished \\"The Partner\\", I was angry, I didn't like the ending - but at least it stirred some kind of emotion in me. This book left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ends poorly and the premise has a hole in it too!","review":"Overall, I was disappointed with this book. I agree with many of the reviewers that the ending was a complete dud! Possibly not as apparent except to political junkies such as myself, was a flaw in the premise as well. There is no way a candidate for President who doesn't even announce until after the New Hampshire primary would be able to meet the filing deadlines in many of the other primaries which follow close behind. Maybe we could extend a little literary license if the story had other redeeming features such as strong characters or a sizzling climax but this one misses the mark all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A loaner","review":"A friend loaned me this book. On finishing it, I'd decided two things. One, I am glad it was loaned to me and I did not buy it. Two, I'm sorry my friend bought it. A recent generous newspaper review listed as the most memorable part the section where it went for fifty pages without switching back to the campaign subplot. As I said, this was generous. This book just missed the mark. Maybe the next one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's It!","review":"Wasn't a whole lot to it. Interesting premise that didn't go anywhere, and an ending that was lacking. Exceptionally predictable from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, Mr. Grisham, what happened?","review":"Extremely disappointing, kept waiting for the book to reach the reason it remained #1 for weeks and weeks, it never got there! Almost seemed that Mr. Grisham had a deadline for one more book, so over a weekend he wrote one, weak plot, characters with virtually no development, thoroughly predictable and basically a story without no twists or turns... most disappointing compared with his past works...John, What Happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book. Don't waste your time or money.","review":"I swore off of Grisham's books after The Street Lawyer, and only read this one because someone lent it to me. What a colossal waste of time. None of the characters were likeable, and there was zero plot. The book just stopped; there was no well plotted ending. I've read several reviews of the book that mention Grisham's use of comedy; they must have read a different book. Nothing in this book was remotely humorous. I can't believe that a book this bad got published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"When the story got going (after about 100 pages), I thought it was going to take off. While an interesting plot(s), the storyline could have been a real page turner- instead it just dies-and the ending was very disappointing indeed. It leaves you with way too many unanswered questions, and I felt Mr. Grisham was just plain tired of writing, and wanted to end this novel as fast as possible. I've truely enjoyed some of his works in the past, but this one I wish I had skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Has Lost His Edge","review":"Like The Testament, The Brethren meanders and finds nothing in the end. Grisham seems to have lost his ability to create suspense and excitement. His previous novels were filled with suspense and rivited me to his pages. The last two have left me with \\"so what! \\"Grisham needs to re-focus or we will need to find another writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"\\"The Brethren\\" simply does not measure up to previous John Grisham books. The plot runs out of steam way before the end of the book. The ending if you can call it that was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it a book I don't know","review":"The book read like somebody was full filling a contract quota. I was a fan of Mr. Grisham but I think after this poor showing I believe he has falling to my \\"b\\" list of authors. On the other side I just finished reading \\"The Testament\\" after the Brethen and enjoyed it very much. I don't know maybe he has contract that made him this last book. I sometimes wonder does Mr. Grisham want to be author or screenwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham-lite","review":"The latest offering by Grisham is a disappointment for those of us who were expecting the same riveting intrigue as his previous novels. I found the plot to be predictable and the characters were uninspiring. This was definately \\"Grisham-lite.\\" I've read better Nancy Drew stories. I expected to see that he had only loaned his name to this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"I loved Grisham's other books, so I didn't hesitate to pick this one up. I'm sure The Brethren will find its own audience, but that doesn't include me, unfortunately. I guess it's impossible to keep up the pace of nail-biting intrigue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best","review":"This book was good and intriguing but it was not one of Grisham's best. Perhaps I have higher expectations for him then other authors. It was, however, a good book. I did enjoy it and as I often do, finished it within a week. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary plot, predictable and lame ending","review":"Having read all of Grisham's novels to date, I believe his last great book was \\"Runaway Jury\\". Beginning with \\"Street Lawyer\\", the quality of his books has steadily declined and \\"The Brethern\\" is the worst yet. The book is devoid of character development, there isn't a single likable character, it is relentlessly cynical, there is nothing particularly creative about the plot and the ending is not only disappointing, it is lame. I don't expect Grisham to write a legal thriller every time, but his earlier works, culminating with \\"Runaway Jury\\", have shown that he is capable of developing intricate, creative plots with likable protagonists and unpredictable resolutions. I can only conclude that a multi-book deal requires Grisham to produce too many books too quickly, so that he has resorted to completely ordinary, formulaic novels. I doubt that I will read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissapointing Ending","review":"I thought that this was the best Grisham plot to date. I really liked the corrupt politics and extortion scam, I thought that it was very similiar to how our (united states) government really works. However I was extremely disapointed in the ending of the book. I think Grisham took the easy way out. It would have been much more interesting if the \\"main extortion\\" would have actually been reported to the media. Regardless, I couldnt put this book down and recommend it to all Grisham fans along with anyone who distrusts the government."},{"rating":"1","title":"He keeps getting worse","review":"Grisham should have quit a few books ago. You can tell he only writes for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for insomnia","review":"I like Grishams work - except for this one. Unfortunately, there really isn't a character that I ever really care about, and nothing ever really develops in the story line. It took me a couple weeks to wade through this one; where usually a good book will last a day or two. I actually forgot that I was in the middle of reading it at one point and started rereading an old favorite. Forget reading at night - I literally fall asleep within a couple pages! If I had it to do over again - I'd definitely wait for paperback, or pass on it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was missing from this book","review":"There was humor in this book as characters began to unfold. Later, there was disappointment that you never really connected to them. I wasn't pulling for anyone or against anyone either. There was no innocent victim, no hero and lastly no women or love interest. I'm afraid this book was rather boring, which is a shame given the enjoyment of previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To My Expectations","review":"This book was off-the-mark for Grisham...I've enjoyed all of his other endeavors and although there were differences in style, i.e., The Chamber vs The Street Lawyer, this one just didn't measure up in the reasons his others were successful...no tension, no thrill...both plots were insipid and dull. I kept waiting fot it to get better and then it ended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"grisham delivers another disappointment","review":"I loved john grisham and waited anxiously for his next novels after reading his first 7 books. BUT starting with the street lawyer, he began getting away from the courtroom and things went downhill from there for me. I didn't enjoy the testament and I REALLY didn't enjoy the brethren. I hope he gets back to what he does best--courtrooms/trials. which is why I enjoyed him in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"I used to anticipate a new Grisham novel. I couldn't wait for it to hit the shelves. Unfortunately, this will probably be the last Grisham novel that I purchase in hardcover. He never explores Lake's unknown side and offers him as a very shallow main character. While the premise of the novel promises a page turner, it is a true turn off. Not his best, but as of now, definately his worst. My advice to the author: Take some time off and re-evaluate your need for the million dollar bonuses for the amount of books you sell and think more about the millions of readers that you are disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Great Grisham\\" work","review":"Despite my admiration for John Grisham and his immense talent, I was very disappointed in this book. I could not find one character with which to bond, no one to root for, and an ending that left me listless. No plot events ever grabbed me and I never found myself awaiting to read more. Come on, John. Don't let the publishers rush you! Take your time on the next one and give your legions of admirers what they missed this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good book","review":"This book was pretty good. John Grisham, as always, uses stunning description and detail. There are plenty of twists and turns in this book which will keep the reader excited. Another thing i liked about this book is how it went back and forth between the stories of the bretheren and Mr. Lake. John Grisham hasn't always used this technique and I'm glad that he did in this book. ONE WORD OF ADVICE for those choosing to read this fine book: don't take a break from it. In John Grisham's writing i feel you need to keep all the details in your memory to make the story exciting. When i took a break from reading it for a few days it took a bit of time getting back into the story and made the experience a little less enjoyable than it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost...","review":"John Grisham almost had a good thing going, and then he blew it. The rising action and the climax is great, as well as the character description, but after that the book falls really short of expectations. The ending is even worse than the plot sequence that leads up to it. I don't know what John Grisham was thinking when he wrote this book, but he should have put more time into it.

I am afraid that JG is churning out books too fast and that his stories are becoming crap. Reminds me of Harold Robbins....I think JG should go back to the first book he wrote...A Time to Kill, and reflect some before churning out another book. I was very disappointed in The Bleachers and am now hesitant to read his next one...I would wait till it came out in paper back before purchasing any more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mistake","review":"I hated this book when I read it a few years ago. The absense of the classic form hero, the lack of even moderate moral ideals and principles generated a rather juvinile review. The reality of life lies in the pages of this book. There are no heros. There are only the made, the undone, and the shot callers. The so called undeveloped charactors was just that, dispensable pawns. Better yet, pawns that can suddenly become a knight, bishop or even queen if the shot caller's say,\\"Make it so.\\"It is my considered opinion that this author, John Grisham may well be better regarded a prophet than a writer. Recent history would support this opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"Grossly dissapointing. This was a terrible book and Grisham should be embarassed. Grisham would be spinning in his grave if he were dead. The problem with the book is that there aren't any characters to like, they are either criminals or queers. I for one don't give a hoot about either. Boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations at all!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It was in no way what I have come to expect from John Grisham. It was slow and not really that interesting, but I stuck it out to the end where major irritation was achieved. Of all the endings possible, it seemed that Grisham just took an easy out. I disliked the book overall, but I really hated the ending. The whole thing gave me the impression he wrote it in about 2 hours. It just didn't have his usual depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been a John Grisham fan since his early days, but I'm having trouble getting through this book. It is definitely not one of his best. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Pelican Brief\\" but I can't see me finishing this one. I just can't get into it. My husband feels exactly the same way. I came here to see if we were the only ones with this opinion, but there are a few others who have the same thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grisham BBQ","review":"Reading The Brethren reminded me terribly of the old days of the charcoal barbecue experience. Great anticipation for the whole event. Then, once lit, the briquettes take forever to heat up to a nice grilling temperature. But as soon as you throw the steaks on, the heat dissipates and you're left with raw meat. This is exactly how I feel about The Brethren. I was intrigued by the tension and the potential danger created by the main characters weaving together. However, the slow start and the weak ending killed the whole book for me. Raw meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Grisham getting bored?","review":"This novel like all the others starts out boring and slow. If you can last until the completion of the 4th chapter that is when the real story will begin. An adventure sometimes if you happen to live in the South to places you have actually been to or heard of or seen. Then come the end, ho hum, no justice, no excitement just wondering why you wasted your time... BR>I have purchased and read every paperback Grisham has written and these endings are just a turnoff. I would like to see some variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline in quality","review":"I've been a big fan of John Grisham since The Firm. I've read all his books, but by the time The Testament came around I have to admit he's lost steam. The Brethern is even worth. If you've read any of Grisham's previous books and want to read this one out of royalty, expect to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"I am a new reader of Grishoms, and although I enjoyed the story line, I was very dissapointed with the ending.....Sean"},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful. the reader doesn't have any imagination pitiful.","review":"i am dearly sorry to say that this book failed to stretcch my imagination"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good as far as Grisham goes","review":"I've read all books written by Grisham, and this one lacked the engaging excitement that i found in The Partner, or The Pelican Brief for that matter. When Grisham started, his leading characters were mostly young, perfect lawyers. Later they weren't so perfect, as in the Partner parhaps, which is nevertheless one of the best books ever written, or the Testament. But all his books had protagonists; leading characters who kept the book together. Perhaps the greatest failing in this book is the absence of such a character."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst","review":"Of all the Grisham novels I've read--and I've read nearly all--his best was his first: \\"A Time to Kill.\\" Even his lesser efforts have had strengths. Until now. \\"The Brethren\\" has nothing, unless you like a trivial story that starts and goes nowhere, one-dimensional characters you won't care about, and plodding dialogue. A big disappointment for a longtime Grisham fan.\\"A Time to Kill\\" proved Grisham can write. The rest of his books prove he can also make piles of money. But \\"The Brethren\\" suggests either that he can't write anymore, or that nothing matters to him but the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime Pays!","review":"I really enjoyed reading Grisham's earlier novels. I did not enjoy this one. This novel followed the same new pattern that Grisham uses...crime pays. This novel does nothing more but reiterate that the American Government is crooked and in the end it is all right to do wrong, because heck, you will get away with it. If you really have to read all of Grisham's novels go ahead, but, it's all claptrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Start, Weak Ending","review":"Not Grisham's best effort, co-existing plots are intertwined in a clumsy manner. The dialogue did not read true, and some of the twists were unbelievable--even for fiction. I'm still trying to figure out the message Grisham was trying to impart to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre","review":"I once heard Larry McMurty talk to a group I was in about WHEN Authors start going down hill-----and I thought about John Grisham in that context while reading THE BRETHEN---and I have read every thing he has written.I put it down twice before I could get into it, and even though the stories within stories were engaging, they were unrealistic. The ending leaves the reader completely empty, like sayin \\"So what happens next.\\" Will likely NOT be made into a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"John Grishom is far more talented than this book reflects. The first several chapters hint at a rather good plot line, but from there if fizzles. The story line lacks any rising action and tends to just \\"go on.\\" Also, the book ends without any wrap up or solid ending. The resolution of the conflict needs to be much more suspenseful and thrilling. The characters of this book also lack any depth. The background on the characters of the bretren group are soggy and lifeless. There is no intense emotion involved with them, so the reader tends to not care what they do. A good read if you need to cure your insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Grisham","review":"The Brethren is a disappointing followup to Grisham's previous works. The plot is contrived and implausible. There is little character development. Indeed, there are no likeable characters or even characters with which the reader can identify. Since this is a presidential election year, it seems Grisham stretched to come up with a topical plot. It didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"I've try to start this book 4 times now and I can't get past the first chapter. John Grisham's books have always had such a gripping start to them, I don't want to put them down. I haven't had any problem putting THIS book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad I didn't pay full price","review":"After having read all 11 of John Grisham's books, I can only say that this is the worst yet. There is nothing to draw you into the characters and the ending does nothing to give the reader closure. The characters are shallow at best, and there's no page turning excitement. Grisham needs to start writing like he did in A Time to Kill and stop trying to write instant movie plots. I can only say, if you MUST buy this book, do so in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending --- What ending","review":"This is by far the worst books he has written. Not much an ending at all. Why he makes the us read through 300+ pages is a mystery to me. Grisham might need to read a few Tom Clany books, the CIA is weak and non-active in its time on need. Average story line, could of had been charters... Trevor the lawyer was the only interesting person in the book. Do not buy this one..... Don't wait for the Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Grisham!","review":"I was a huge fan of Grisham until The Testament (verbose and way too many jungle chapters) and was hoping he would return to his page-turning style. He did, at the beginning of The Brethren..but he got lost along the way..characters appear and disappear (Buster)without adding anything to the story and/or plot.The ending was ludicrous, at best..actually so was the book...the moral being power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely (gee, what a surprise!)In a word, this book was stupid...and well below the expectations of this once terrific writer! Mr. Grisham..get back to your roots and write a compelling book, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, definitely not the best","review":"This book seemed to show the author to be very pressured in writing it. His books are usually exceptional and exciting, however, this one was choppy and seemed to go nowhere. It could have been much more dramatic as all of his other ones are, but it was more of a bunch of brainstorming ideas bunched together without any real form. Not my favorite, but I haven't lost my love for Grisham's books yet, and look forward to upcoming ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get thee to a library and farewell!","review":"Fatal attraction meets the presidency (with a twist). Characters were shallow. Plot development and resolution seemed too forced and the ending, as has been of late with these novels, less than believable. Reminded me a bit of the infamous Freshman 500-word composition: fill up so many pages and then stop. Borrow it from the library (sorry Amazon!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the brethren","review":"I am a great fan of John Grisham. However, this book was a huge disappointment. I can't believe he wrote it. I gave up after the first 80 pages, it was so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestseller, my foot!","review":"I've read every one of Grisham's books and this one was a great disappointment. Totally ungripping, I nevertheless forced myself to read the whole thing. And got disappointed in the end too. Avoid this - if you want to read Grisham, start with Chamber and then move chronologically forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperors new clothes","review":"Where's the plot? Nothing happened. It starts with a fine premise, a group of wiley old judges, v. an evil CIA chief. But there is no battle of wits. Give us some real action. If Grisham's next book also gets bad review, I'll just take the critics word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"The book started out okay then it started to get really interesting, but at the end it just stopped. No closure, no solving all the characters in the book. It seems like John Grisham got tired of writing the book and just ended it where he stopped! That's the only explanation I can think of. I felt like I wasted my time reading it. John what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's Best","review":"I found this book predictable and depressing. The synical outlook on presidential politics would have been forgiveable if there was a protagonist to like, or even to understand. There were so many characters that no one's motivation was explored in any depth. The premise was promising, it was just the execution that was dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Boondoggle","review":"Grisham snares the reader with the first couple of chapters in this one, but soon leaves the reader feeling anxious for something to happen. Repeated lines throughout the book dull the reader as nothing exciting happens. The book picks up pace near the middle though as the CIA becomes the \\"Big Brother\\" of the West and every agent and his brother is placed on the \\"domestic issue of utmost importance.\\" Grisham could have gone a lot of ways with this one but the ending was a big disappointment (surprise?). Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"John Grisham must have thrown this book together while trying to come up with an idea for his next great book. Probably his weakest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I couldn't wait to purchase and read \\"The Brethren\\"; however, I found the book to be an extremely difficult read, and it took me weeks to complete it. I usually find anything that JG writes to be extremely entertaining, but I am forced to lump this one in the same category as \\"The Chamber,\\" which I also found to be a difficult read.Maybe his next concoction will be better....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brethren","review":"easy reading, fast story telling and good for weekend reading. But there is no climax, and it's awful ending. I still don't get what is his point. I have to say that this is the worst book he has written ever. I guess I expected too much for John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Being a John Grisham addict, I bought the Brethren with high expectations, considering the quality of his last novel, The Testament. However, I was very disappointed. When I finished it, I was asking many questions that had gone unanswered. The end was a big let-down, possibly the worst part of the story. Grisham had a great idea going with the 2 sub-plots, but it just didn't deliver like I was hoping. For those of you who aren't familiar with his work, don't start with this one. Maybe his next will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget T.V. movie","review":"Grishams latest reads like a bad t.v. movie. very thin, with very shallow characters. It is a quick read with an interesting premise. But as with his last few books the ending is boring and contrived. I have been a very big fan of grisham since \\"The Firm\\". I have everyone of his books in first edition hardcover. When the next one comes out I'll use the library before buying. It almost seems like he's trying to write simple screenplays instead of novels lately. Complete with the disney fairytale endings. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned off Grisham","review":"My husband and I have both previously awaited the release of a Grisham novel. While disappointed with The Testament, we still decided to give The Brethern a try. What a mistake. I can't think of a book that I've read recently that I have liked less. No more Grisham buyers in this household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I am a big Grisham fan but this one was not worth the read. I read the book on a plane and hurried to finish it before the flight ended. I wonder if he did the same when he wrote it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Review Ever","review":"I definately recommend this novel for everyone who enjoys John Grisham. The Brethren gives a new twist to the legal system through his portrayal of corrupt judges and powerful government officials.This legal thriller keeps the reader turning pages, and is easily a one-nighter, as one can hardly help but to rush to find out if a presidency can be so easily won, if you have the right friends.Anyone who finds an interest in the government, the legal system, corruption, or in just picking up a good book, this is a MUST READ!!! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one needs a \\"Street Lawyer\\" to get it out of trouble","review":"I have loved every John Grisham book that I've read until this one. \\"The Street Lawyer\\" and \\"The Chamber\\" are my favorites. This one needs a street lawyer to get it out of trouble. This one is indeed out on the streets and it needs help. There are no memorable characters in it and the writing itself did not hold my interest. I had to force myself to keep reading.I almost gave up several times. If you only read one John Grisham book, this is not it. Try \\"The Street Lawyer\\" or \\"The Chamber\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Mind Candy","review":"What a fun book to read! Unlike his signature work, A Time to Kill, the moral ambiguity inherent in these characters presents very little challenge to the reader. There is nobody to really like in the story. All the characters are more concerned with their own little scams and secrets--even when some of the scams have global proportions.It's nice to read a book, to be amused by the antics of the characters, but not to be emotionally hooked in to anybody's wellbeing. I rarely find a book like that. It wasn't that I didn't care--I was very curious as to how things would resolve. But this book is really a story about people who have compromised themselves so badly that it's tough to really care whether they succeed at their plots (although I kinda wanted some of them to), or whether they get screwed.The perfect book to sandwich between reading deep, emotionally provocative material, or to insulate one heavy tome on a ponderous subject from the next.Fast. Lite. Fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The 700+ customer reviews cannot go completely wrong: This book, \\"The Brethren\\" by John Grisham, is disappointingly boring. And it could have been so interesting.The CIA gets a conspiration going to install congressman Aaron Lake as the upcoming President of the United States. You can see the influence of money and company interests, the manipulation of the people by media etc. However, the story is not really worked out, details are missing, and actually, this seems not to be the main story the book wants to tell. The \\"main story\\" is the description of an extortion scheme used by three former judges, who are imprisoned in a federal jail, and their lawyer. The story is dragging, the writing is neither fast-paced nor rich in detail. And even when the two main streams of action touch you are longing for the end of the chapter to finally go to sleep..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre effort by a good author","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and this is the first one that I truly hated. The character development left a lot to be desired. The plot, while interesting in the beginning took some good twists and turns but leaves the reader flat in the end. In all honesty, if you are looking for a Grisham book, try The Testament, or The Firm. These are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not read any reviews before I read this and expected another great Grisham read. I really feel that I wasted both my time and money on this book. The story wasn't that good, but I thought that it would surely have a good ending. Not at all!! This has the worst ending of any book I have ever read! I agree with those who said he seemed to be writing this for a deadline and ended the book before it was complete. My favorite JG books were \\"The Firm\\" and \\"The Testament\\". My least favorite this one and \\"Pelican Brief\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This book about lawyers and politics is definitely not worthy of the title \\"bestseller\\". It was written out of pure greed for an easy buck off of the author's name. Unfortunately, all things written about can happen in today's world. There is nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"When I read The Firm and A Time To Kill I thought I had discovered a treasure. As a southern lawyer, I adored the books. All of the rest of his books have been sort of uneven..a flash of the old brillance here and there but ultimately unsatisfying. This one reads as if he dashed it off over a weekend. No real passion. John, PLEASE! Write something with passion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie of the Week","review":"Grisham's once crafty legal thrillers are fast becoming movie of the week material. Entertainig enough to watch, but you wouldn't recommend it to a friend or ever mention that you watched it. He's churning out these stories faster than you can microwave popcorn. Grisham's novels usually end with a good deal of closure and the bad guys getting theirs. In The Brethren, everyone walks away with more than what they started with. You're not really sure who to cheer for either. I agree with one reviewer that it appears that a chapter or two might be missing from the end. I finished this book saying \\"I smell a sequal\\", although that may have been the popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Like many others I looked forward to The Brethren. I've read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed every one. This was a big disappointment. The story bored me and I couldn't connect to the characters. I didn't find it suspensful--I knew immediately what was going to happen at the end -- and I was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost at Sea","review":"To describe this book as contrived, meandering, and without connection is to be kind to it. The author must have some purpose in writing it; maybe he was short of cash, had a contract deadline to meet, or was trying to get into the movies. Whatever, it was not to produce a fine work of fiction. Which is just as well because he didn't. I have had it with this type of author (Patricia Cornwell is another who comes to mind) who churn out work that just doesn't justify the expense in reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my gosh, what a book!","review":"oh my! this was an awesome book! It's somewhat controversial at times, but the story is so detailed and perfected! This book may be inappropriate for some ages, but it's a Grisham book, so-who cares if it's a little controversial, or inappropriate. It's John Grisham, baby! (only the best author!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham strikes again!","review":"I am a huge fun of John Grisham, having read The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Brethren, and am now reading A Time To Kill. The Brethren is a new masterpiece, with details and intricate storytelling perfectly bound within the pages. The story follows three imprisoned judges, who earn money by blackmailing gay men. Another subplot follows presidental candidate Aaron Lake. Eventually, the two stories collide. Perfect storytelling by one of the masters of the genre. Recommended to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"The Pelican Brief\\" instead","review":"I have read and enjoyed other Grisham novels (e.g., The Pelican Brief), but I didn't think much of this one. Most of the characters are seedy and all are unsympathetic, the link between the two subplots can be spotted a mile off, and the political elements are laughably unrealistic (what one-term governor defeated for re-election would ever dare to run for president? what government agency would be disciplined enough to fund a leak-free presidential campaign?). A book without a hero can be redeemed by wit or gritty realism, but this one has neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good pick","review":"This is the third Grisham novel that I have read, The Summons and Painted House being the first 2. I was extremely disapponted with this book. I waited and waited till the last page for some big ending or surprise, but it never came. While I have to admit that the book did keep me somewhat hooked, I finished the book very disappointed and wondering if I had missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"to be continued. . .","review":"Grisham writes well about people, but this novel is a cliffhanger. You'll have to buy the next book to see where it ends. He badly combines two subplots, I fail to see the relationship between them. Granted, he's a cynic about people, his writing is good, but the plots are odoriferous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's Worst Work","review":"I looked forward to this book with a lot of anticipation. I've read every one of Grisham's books. Never again.I wonder what the statistical odds are that so many sleazy people could end up in one spot. \\"Because it's a prison, stupid!\\" you might answer. Not so. I've worked in a prison. The prison employees I've known have been a honest, dedicated bunch. The attorneys I've known in the communities surrounding the prison have also been honest and capable.Maybe it got better at the end. I never made it that far. It took me three weeks to make it about three quarters of the way through.With all the other legal thriller authors out there, I won't spend any more time or money with Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst since Street Lawyer","review":"As a Grisham fan, I was disappointed in this book. There was no true protagonist to get behind and none of the characters were very likable or interesting. The plot was extremely limited and the ending was the most anticlimactic of his entire collection. Let's hope Grisham's venture outside the legal thriller with A Painted House can rejuvenate this great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"I wish I had read the reviews for this book. I'm a Grisham fan, but this was his worse by far. Easy reading, but totally unbelievable plot. Thank God I used a gift cerftificate. My sister-in-law should be refunder the 7 bucks. Shame on you Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you and what have you done with John Grisham?!","review":"Ugh. What a dissapointment. Who's the protagonist anyway?

My personal choice of his best is \\"The Testament\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had given up on John Grisham a long time ago and looking at his body of work, I can clearly see when I stopped reading and why. I loved Time to Kill and The Firm, but gave up when his writing became formulaic. Someone recommended The Brethren and I decided to give him another try. I was disappointed....the story is engaging at first, but simply falls flat. The characters are one dimensional and you just do not even care what happens to them. Put this one back on the shelf. Maybe if we are lucky, Grisham will go back to his roots soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Disappointment","review":"I always look forward to John Grisham's books. I bought this one as soon as it came out. Unfortunately, I didn't finish it because it was too predictable and uninteresting. In all fairness, I should mention that my mother was reading it at the same time and she did not find it as mundane as I did. Her review was much closer to \\"...it was ok. I liked it....\\"John Grisham is a better writer than this book illustrates. His previous books were hits because they were compelling and the characters were interesting. This book does not have the kind of quality I have enjoyed in his previous novels. This book is selling because he has made a name for himself with his talent.

Anyone who enjoys a good story should love this book. Some have complained they did not like any of the characters! Hey, this is not a romantic comedy. The plot is good, some twists exist, the ending is quite predictable, but so what. Great book, great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plot","review":"This is Grisham's weakest novel todate and can only have made the bestsellers list based on reputation and promotion rather than merit. Certainly looks as though it was written with the movie rights in mind. Plot also weak in that it hard to believe that: - 3 convicts would be allowed the freedom to hold court sessions in prison - that the CIA would chose to negotiate with 3 convicts - a man on a life sentence would be incarcerated in an open prison.If Grisham publishes back to back books of this quality he will soon lose his following. I certainly won't purchase his next offering blind."},{"rating":"1","title":"As an English teacher...","review":"After reading, and loving, the other Grisham books, I eagerly anticipated the paperback release of The Brethern. Although I did finish it, I was incredibly disappointed in it. There was not enough of a balance between the main characters, and Teddy had more power than any other man I believe (or would like to believe) that a man could have. The ending was incredibly unsatisfying as well.When I put this book on my shelf, I knew it would be sitting there for a long time before I would take it off again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG Disappointment","review":"This is the 7th Grisham book that I have read. I looked so forward to reading this and was gravely disappointed in it. Grisham's books are usually very easy to read and understand, but the plot in this book, was quite confusing, although it did straighten up towards the end. I found that I had to read at least 160 pages before I was somewhat interested in it. The idea of the book was good but it was confusing. It was also chopped off at the end and more information could have been given. I won't give up on Grisham. Maybe next time it will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, a little surprised","review":"I'm not sure why I buy Grisham's books every time a new one comes out, but I haven't missed one yet. And there not that great, but almost always entertaining. That is not the case with the Brethren. This book has almost no redeeming qualities and reads as if Grisham didn't even enjoy it. There is virtually no plot and the characters are as unlikeable asany I've ever read. His previous novel, the Testament, showed a promising new side of Grisham. Combined with presidential intrique I expected a good read. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a letdown","review":"The Brethren started off well and then seemed to lose momentum. I found myself waiting for a climax than never came. Im not sure if it was a matter of a rushed ending or just a poorly developed plot. Whatever the case, I was quite disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"Grisham continues to entertain and inform. I have greatly enjoyed all his books. This is of particular interest because I have worked closely with the criminal justice system and the plot is believable. Yes, Grisham does make his political statement, as in The Chamber, he is strongly stating his case. But there is no denying, he is an excellent story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I finished this book because I was 9 months pregnant and had nothing better to do.

The idea was great, but Grisham should have continued the book for another 300 pages.

The plot was ingenious but there were many \\"holes\\" in the story, unlike his former novels. It almost seems as if fragments of different books were pieced together.

The book seems to move rather slowly, because it is hard to find any characters in the book that you can like, respect, or even see anything unpredictable in. The difference between suspense and boredom in a story is often the development of some sort of empathy with the character or characters. A third of the way into the book I asked myself, \\"If all of the characters in the book died in a natural disaster on the next page, would I be sad, would I even care?\\". In fact, I wrote my own ending and happily put it down at that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Mr. Grisham disappointed me this time. The Brethern seemed to be written hurriedly.

His latest, The Brethren fell so short of my expectations, that I am honestly considering returning it for a refund. It was such an unintereseting premise to begin with, that I can't help but wish that Mr. Grisham re-think his current schedule of writing.

Although I suppose this is the opinion of a 13 year-old reviewer but with the reading age of a 17- year- old I might add. I thoroughly enjoyed it to be honest. There were so many twists and turns. In fact I used this book as my Novel study book because the books we were assigned were at a 9- year- olds level.

Much better than his last couple that were released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching Grass Grow","review":"This book sucked. Grisham appears to have gotten bored with writing and this book displays his boredom to all the world. The idea was good, but he could have done so much more with it.

In spite of the fact that both parents were abused as children it is difficult to relate to them as adults. Carol's mother (Diane Ladd) does little to help the situation.

Shark populations have declined by 90% and as an apex predator they are key for the health of marine ecosystems. The practice of finning is brutal and the demand in Asia for shark fins for shark fin soup as a status symbol is driving their extinction. Please boycott shark fin soup. Definitely watch this film to get an accurate view of sharks--they are not brutal animals but rather humans are the brutal animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opening experience","review":"This film is truly one that will go down in history in terms of changing public opinion. Showing the true barbaric nature of people who are motivated by greed was a real shocker. We as a global society know that we are overusing the resources that we have and destroying most of everything that has been around long before us and yet we just \\"keep on truckin\\" (for lack of a better term). What people need to realize is that everything on this planet coexists in a delicate balance that needs to stay in check and the deplorable killing of 90% of the shark population is part of that balance that isn't in check. Rob Stewart has taken his passion to a level that will truly make a difference and I thank him for that.

However, some poor filming techniques really get in the way. The narration is AWFUL! I understand that this young man wanted to tell his own story, but he would have been better off finding someone with a less grating voice. Also, some of the narration is downright corny. This really detracts from the message. The film also uses really corny music while showing sharks being killed. They should have enlisted the help of professional writers and directors to give this documentary a polished look so more people would take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing","review":"This is a documentary about shark-lover Rob Stewart, who (like me) has always loved sharks. Here, he tells us the truth about sharks, for example, he states that they are not as dangerous as they are claimed to be, due to popular inaccurate beliefs. He also explains the importance of sharks in the food chain, in the ocean.Stewart also presents the world of shark finning, off Costa Rica and the Galapagos.This is a very refreshing documentary that will change the viewer's opinion, but fast!, on sharks and their lives.Great images, and splendid undersea footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the idea across","review":"This documentary gets the idea across that simple stupidity is still the major cause of environmental degradation on this planet.

I knew a decent amount shark finning before watching this film but it still had a lot of good information, and more importantly, the stuff he got on film is totally amazing. It's very inspiring to see what he did. His passion for sharks carries over through the movie, and so into the audience--I guarantee you, if you didn't care about sharks before this documentary, you will after you watch it. He's not afraid to show what's really going on and how terrible it is.So all of the wonderful stuff aside, my only complaint was the cheesy bits--mostly, his voiceovers. Almost the entire time he narrates it is in the most distracting overly dramatic voice. However, the film is good enough that after a while I was able to ignore how he sounded (only while narrating; while speaking to the camera he sounded completely normal) and is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharkwater","review":"I like to eat shark fin soup until I read reports and watch this title..

Do not upset of food chain of the ocean as Sharks has live in the ocean longer than any of us. It is maintained the food chain of the ocean well until man started to hunt them for their fins.

I am a scuba diver and enjoy observing and giving respect to everything that keeps our oceans in balance when I am under the sea. This movie can teach so many people both young and old how important sharks are to us and why over-hunting (or in some cases just decimating for shark fin soup) could throw many things out of balance both above and below the water.There are some parts of this film that are over dramatic and I did feel that the environmental group was acting beyond safety and common sense in some situations but overall it is an enjoyable film.I think any young person would find value in this movie to understand and perhaps become interested in our oceans and conservation at a reasonable level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy, meets expectations","review":"My son, who is 5, received this dog for Christmas.

I immediately removed this toy from the boys' toy collection due to severe concern about the extremely sharp edges very badly cutting little fingers and/or mouths or lips.I am greatly disappointed in my experience with one of Baby Einstein's typically well-trusted toys for play, enjoyment, and educational purposes.I felt that it was very important to let other parents know about this safety concern regarding the toy.

The imitators of Eliot by and large came across as complete mediocreties. Auden on the other hand produces a following with at least a modicum of competence.

If Cale was not producing music in the 80s to suit the pandering critics, well, this was a good thing. Fans of John Cale's music should not avoid this album. Cale should be proud of the truth in this set of painful words and haunting melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad!","review":"This album is not as bad as other reviewers say.It is much better than \\"Walking on Locusts\\", his other fairly weakish album.Every song is OK in my book except \\"Chinese Takeaway\\", which sees Cale doodling away playing recognizable motifs to a backgound droney synth soundscape-almost like a soundcheck throwaway.At one stage the intro to Beach Boy's \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\" start up and he cracks up.That really sums up the track.The rest is pretty good if you are a diehard Cale fan. Sattelite Walk is a tad weak butI can still listen to it ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"The professional review above says it all. Yes, \\"Dying on the Vine\\" is a significant Cale song, but you can find it in a much more listenable version on the live \\"Fragments of a Rainy Season\\" which trashes all the awful synthesizer arrangements and strips it down to Cale's gorgeous, untreated voice and piano.\\"Chinese Takeaway\\" is an embarrsing instrumental that fails to engage the purported subject matter in any coherent way, and \\"Satellite Walk\\" is also a ridiculous mess of a song. The sound all the way through is thin and uninspired, and as with many Cale albums that are primarily performed on digital keyboard instruments (or whatever he uses) you often wonder why and how he came up with the sounds he chooses.Why this record was ever reissued I can't imagine. It would better be left forgotten, much like an early 80's Cale show at a \\"Chuck E.

I'm ordering this one soon, so that I can begin to recite the Wales volume also.

Unfortunately, a great idea is all it is.

Even though this was published in 1977, it is amazing to see how deeply Rene's thoughts have come true and to the forefront in recent discoveries.If you desire a challenge, a need to know...this book is for you.The book I have was my father's. When he passed away, I took it, read it, read it again and was hooked from the beginning. It answered many questions and has driven me to look at many things in a new light.

However when I got it and read some of it, I found out that the author is a \\"creationist\\" and believes their garbage. So the book is being donated to a local non-profit.

This is terribly anoying, especially when every third shot is of the same audience members. This may be fun for a home video, but not for a mass marketed commercial release.The Dance Hall Crashers are an awesome band. Much of the fun of seeing the DHC in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence. It would have been great if this DVD had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate.And since the DHC are supposed to be the focus, why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience? It gets on your nerves.I love the DHC. Their live CD has a permanent place on my playlist. But this horribly made DVD only made it through three songs. Perhaps if I had been at the front of the stage that night, I would appreciate it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great","review":"If you like DHC, I can't imagine not liking this DVD. I've watched it several times and still play it as part of the weekend rotation. Two of the hottest female singers ever, unreal harmonies and with great guitar/bass/drums rocking hard along with them. The music is very \\"up\\", the lyrics are intelligent and run the gammit from sincere to totally sarcastic. I like everything DHC has ever put out so take that into consideration.

The receipts are easy and simple to follow with everyday items."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was looking for","review":"This book has a decent description of the glycemic index and glycemic load in the front. However, for carb sensitive people, this book misses the point. Woodruff substitutes whole grains for the refined grains, yogurt and fruit snacks for pretzels and chips, and otherwise sticks to the government recommendation of around 227-252 grams (50%) of carb per day. I think if your body can tolerate that many carbs, this book will provide healthy meals. And who wouldn't want to chow down on pasta and pancakes every day. But it's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I hate to report that a book is worthless, but honestly, this book is a terrible combination of too much and too little information. There are vague and complicated paragraphs on glycemic counting, etc., coupled with non-recipes -- recipes one can find in almost any other survey book (with perhaps way fewer uses of processed foods!). It's poorly organized and is ugly, too. Once you know the difference between a complex and simple carb (and hey, a simple list would do that!), then go in seach of good recipes (but not in this book!).I wish the author had chosen to either write a book on carbs or write a cookbook. I can hardly believe this book is so admired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for South Beach fans","review":"I bought this book from Amazon based on the rave reviews. I should have read the bad reviews first. This book contains a lot of recipes using egg substitute and low fat/non-fat ingredients and then uses white flour, pasta, sugar, raisins, carrots and other ingredients we wouldn't consider \\"Good Carbs.\\" We were looking for a cookbook using healthy low-glycemic carbs and healthy fats. Unfortunately, they won't be found in this book.Perhaps this book is aimed at beginners who are trying to move away from carbohydrate addiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for South Beach Dieters","review":"This book gives a great explanantion of Glycemic ndex and helps you understand why it is important to eat low on the glycemic index.

Just using the older Atkins system of total net carbs did not take into consideration the moderating effects of combined foods upon gastric emptying and assimilation of various carbs, so this book corrects that oversight. Very good and easy to read. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too single, busy, and broke for these recipes","review":"Working with a tight budget and trying to eat right are very difficult. I was hoping that buying these cook books would help but for someone who has a very limited time to cook because they work 60-70 per week, this is not a great cook book. But to be fair, I've found it extremely hard to find one that is.This is just my impression since I was looking for very quick, painless recipes I could whip up, store, and use through out the week. I can't afford fancy spices or expensive cuts of meat and seafood. I also can't store veggies for very long because I am never really home to make them so they go bad and my money goes down the drain.I wish I could say this book worked for me but it didn't.

She has done a good job with some decent choices of recipes. The recipes are easy to read, and read while preparing. Most of the items in the cookbook are items I usually stock within my home shelves, except wheat pastry flour & oat bran, which I will look for on my monthly shopping trip. This book cleared up several items for me, as to amount of carbs to eat, how to rate them, etc. I recently found I am Insulin Resistant, heading to the family line of diabetic. She talks about my particular issues within her book. My only (and I do mean only) problem with this book is that she does not give a sugar count on the recipes. At the end of each recipe she gives all the other info - carbs, fats, etc but not sugar. I am using my software cookbook, plugging her recipes in to find the sugar grams in the recipe. I have been limited to 50 grams per day at my stage. But other then that I am happy to add this cookbook to my home shelves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Carb","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

The recommendations suggested it over the Powerfood Cookbooks, but I found the recipes in the Good Carb Cookbook to be of far less quality than those in Powerfoods Cookbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe good for beginners/novices","review":"I was very disappointed with this cookbook. I was directed to it when I searched on South Beach Diet items. This cookbook has very simplistic recipes, many of which are high in refined carbs (!?). It is not an appropriate companion for South Beach or Atkins Dieters. If you had very little knowledge about cooking and foods, you may find some of it helpful. There are better choices, though. (South Beach Diet Cookbook for one.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scientist Yes, A Cook No","review":"The first section of this book is an excellent introduction to using the glycemic index as it relates to insulin resistance and all the other carbohydrate and diet related issues which are so hot today. The second half of the book is an awful cookbook. The recipes which call for 95% fat free chop meat for instance betray a lack of knowledge of what makes food taste good. If I had the book in front of me I could site more examples but in general I was struck by the author's desire to offer both low calorie recipes along with ones that avoid foods high on the glycemic index without regard to the flavor of the end result. What you get is a pretty standard low calorie diet minus the baked potatoes and the breakfast cereal. My advise would be to read the first portion of the book and then use the information to modify recipes written by real cooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cookbook ...EVER","review":"This is a simple rehash of known recipes and facts.What a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it....","review":"The quality of the paper in this book is very poor - its that yellow newsprint paper, no pictures, not the quality of other books this price. I bought three books on the same topic and this one was the only one that was a disappointment. Its hard to read the print because the paper is so dark and the print is small. It does have lots of information and recipes, but I haven't read them yet and probably won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with small print","review":"I have read many books on health and nutrition but this one was boring with extremely tiny print. The information is valid, but the way they explained it was a bit technical. I have read the information on low glycemic carbs in other books and it was explained in layman's terms. This book could not hold my interest. Then, when I decided to just turn to the recipes, they were filled with more carbs than I thought they would have. Nothing new, just the same old boring stuff. I returned my copy as I just couldn't get through it. I think I could be more creative in the kitchen without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rip off","review":"Another magic diet book that seeks to separate you from your money. Want to shed pounds? Reading this re-hashed book won't help. Eat healthy meals, get some exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cookbook with no photos? How lame is that?","review":"It's difficult to browse for menu ideas when there are no photos.It's also hard to make something you've never seen before because you aren't sure what it's supposed to look like during the process or when you're done. There IS good information to help you understand and apply low glycemic concepts to your diet, but she uses egg substitutes, chemical sugar substitutes, and other questionable ingredients. If you're looking for healthy recipes, you'll need to substitute natural ingredients for such unhealthy ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"There is no way that many of the recipes are low carb or even good carbs. There are way too many pasta recipes, recipes calling for too much sugar, and many other recipes that call for ingredients that would definitely not be considered good carbs or even healthy. I wish I would have read the one and two star reviews before I bought this book. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood sugar is constant now","review":"I had 2 goals this year: to eat more healthily, & to meet more women. Two books have set me straight. This book by Woodruff, and make every girl want you by Reil. I was obese because of too much \\"bad carb\\" consumption. I'm also diabetic, which didn't make things any easier. Woodruff's recipes are a godsend. Having these recipes allows me to go beyond my previous diet attempts of just bread and pasta. My one knock is that the first chapter is a bit too scientific for me. Other than that, the book is great. Thanks to Woodruff for explaining the difference between good carbs & bad carbs. Of explaining the perils of making your blood sugar level shoot up, and for explaining what foods make your levels rise, and what foods keep it constant. Most of all, this diet makes me feel good. I no longer have the ups & downs of blood sugar levels, and no longer feel the need to snack unhealthily because my blood sugar levels are low. I feel the best that I have in years!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Carb Cookbook!","review":"This book is wonderful! I ordered this book because my husband has had much success eating low on the glycemic index with a nationally known \\"food ships to your home\\" diet plan. Fearful that when the shipments stop the weight will come back, I realized I had to adjust our family meals. I learned so much in the first section on why and how to eat low on the glycemic index. So far I have created three recipes that were hits with the 7 and 9 year old and the old man himself! Best of all, the ingredients were purchased at our local discount grocer with a few things coming from our grocery chain store. No special trips to the specialty stores yet! I have already recommended this book to several others. Be sure to make notes in the margin so you will remember which meals you enjoyed most and where you made any substitutions to the recipe.

Also, the Tuna Spread with fat-free cream cheese and sour cream, celery, onions and black olives...VERY good. For supper I made the Citrus-Chicken....the spices and the sauce were THE BEST!! Everything looks so easy to prepare and what I have made so far has been wonderful! I am finding it hard to fit in all the calories I need for my healthy, desired weight since I am not eating the high calorie, BAD foods and sweets I normally eat. I am sure I will like this way of eating. Since I have just started I can't tell you about the weight loss yet.I highly recommend this book for some really TASTY foods! You will not feel like you are on a weight loss diet. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Round it off, for crying out loud","review":"The book seemed to me much more a low-fat cookbook than a good carb cookbook. Lots of call for sugar, fruit juice, white pasta etc. Also lots of call for fat free cheese, fat free velveeta, and egg substitute. I prefer to eat natural, whole foods, not processed foods. That is not what I expected from a \\"good carb\\" book.I also found the measurements annoying. The book will call for 2 teaspoons of garlic rather than a clove of garlic. Who measures garlic like that? If you chop a clove, use the whole clove! Also there are many calls for 3/4 cups of something plus 2 teaspoons. I found the fussyness extremely annoying. Round it off, for crying out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing talent with no recognition","review":"A friend of mine introduced me to this artist by including the track \\"Leaving this town\\" on a compilation tape that she made me. I liked the song so much that I purchased the CD. I am very glad I did - it is truly outstanding. Terri Binion is a uniquely talented songwriter, who complements her inspired song-writing with well orchestrated arrangements for a wide variety of backing vocals and instruments. Her ability to draw a picture through music, and to convey it through a variety of styles - country, R and B, blues, should place her at the top of her profession. Unfortunately, the music business tends to go more for Shania Twain types, which is too bad. A talent like this should not be overlooked or neglected.

Then I switched the mouse to the keyboard side and it stopped beeping, however the computer now interpreted the mouse movements as keystrokes and every move of the mouse would type jibberish into any available text box.

I have to go into the device manager for that PC to uninstall the driver that is not functioning properly, and reinstall it, and if the PC gods are looking down favourably on me, the keyboard starts to work. Otherwise I have to resort to other methods to breath life into the dang thing.The firmware upgrade, I thought OK, maybe this could solve all my problems, but using a parallel cable, both of my PCs don't have a parallel port!

Getting it to work with two computers is rarely possible, especially if one is a Mac and the other a PC. Sometimes the keyboard is not recognized unless you plug it into the extra USB port instead of the one marked for the keyboard. But if you do this you will be presented with an annoying and loud chirping sound. Belkin technical support sometimes admits that they have a firmware update that can fix it, though other times they deny they have any updates for it at all. Unexplained flickering of the digital video output often occurs.

So, for example, if I typed \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\\" what appeared on my screen was something like \\"Th quckbron fx jumpd ovrhe lzy do\\".There were several other minor annoyances. The connectors are poorly laid out; for example: (1) when the power plug is inserted into the power connector, the plug covers one of the spare USB ports; (2) the monitor connector is located so close to the rear of the unit that it was difficult to attach a monitor cable. I would have been able to live with these issues, but the keyboard problem was just too big a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Until Further Notice","review":"I received this KVM along with the MS Desktop Elite for Bluetooth (mouse & keyboard) Combo for Xmas.

Other than the fact that it doesn't not switch (the entire purpose of a KVM) this is a good product. The video, keyboard & mouse all work great on CPU1 input.

I hoped it would give me insight into life under occupation. Trouble is our resistant author, although very brave is a bit of a cow. The sanctamonius putdowns of all and sundry while blowing her own trumpet wore thin and detracted from the story she had to tell. It did not paint a picture of being under occupation that other autobiographies/biographies have. Compared with \\"Gaston's War\\"-Gaston Vandermeerssche- it is pale and insipid. Nor does the spunk stand scrutiny next to Nancy Wake (The White Rabbit)- Ms Wake was also a bit of a character but she could tell a good story and her bitchiness was sauce to what was a complex person. She did not have to settle scores. However, all stories of survival are worthy of being told. My father never told his. Never received more than a comendation from his government (Belgium) and hated war to his dying breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing:)","review":"i love it!!!i ve bought these same boots before and i will continue to buy them until my feet dont move anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"EW??????","review":"Returned these Boots.

It is a good concise review of existential philosophy. It also contains excellent reviews and insights into modern art (mainly cubism) and modern literature. However the author is quite chauvinistic. He categorizes women as inferior beings. His writing is focused on the perspectives of white male. I guess given that this was published in 1962 it is expected.

If I wanted to learn about everything in this book with out all the fluf and extreme waste of paper, I would buy actual existential authors that have credit and deserve my time and energy(and yours). If you do want a history of existentialism, gets the power house book, \\"Existentialism: From Dostoevsky to Sartre\\" by Walter Arlnold Kaufmann.

It should last undefinitely.FYI: I found USB terminal terminology terribly confusing and even after looking up the different kinds on the internet, it took me some time to figure out exactly which ones I needed more -- their names aren't exactly intuitive, I fear.

He has that psycho look.... bald, evil looking, wearing a straight jacket and all. We find him loose in the asylum with a female psychiatrist trapped there in a maze trying to hide from the psycho! She finds aid in the janitor, played by Judd Nelson ( who is weird himself! ) only to find out he was also an inmate of the looney bin. Not a slasher or gore film.

Alas and alack, no such luck. We get the ever interminably boring Larry Drake as the Trasher, a serial killer who has murdered several people and hidden their bodies in the cities sewer system. They catch him and lock him up in a soon to be closed down asylum, waiting for the feds to pick him up at midnight. This asylum also houses Dr. Jurgen Prochnow, an elderly psychiatrist who wants one last chance to make Drake talk. Paulina Portikova couldn't be more trite and boring if she tried; Judd Nelson as an inmate and janitor tries hard but his scenes are so small that he can't save the sinking ship.

Luckily, it's only happened twice so far on its own, and once by me when I pulled the keyboard plug out by mistake.Only other thing that would have been nice is if the cables had a marking or some other way to distinguish monitor1 from monitor2.Otherwise, it works fine all day, every day. Very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beeping, it never stops","review":"Having used many Belkin KVMs in the past (and all worked flawlessly) I purchased this dual-head unit. As many have commented, the unit complains by beeping when either the keyboard or mouse is not plugged in. What I found is that of my dozen or so different USB keyboards, only ONE would satisfy this KVM. I ended up leaving the \\"good\\" keyboard plugged in and tucked behind the systems out of sight and used my preferred keyboard in one of the other USB slots. It must be a flaw in the design; I sent my first unit back to the vendor because of this, but the replacement has the same problem. Belkin customer service was no help at all. I haven't purchased another Belkin KVM since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent cast, what happened?","review":"With several first rate actors and excellent filming, I was dismayed by the weak story and dialog, just not at all what I expected. Julie Christie's character is too haughty and conceited (snarl, snarl, snarl, who would want to be around her for a minute, let alone be married to her?), and Glenda Jackson is quaintly dowdy but amazingly we are told this ordinary lower middle-class woman has a romantic history with our rich, shell-shocked hero. In a nutshell, the story wasn't believable, and the script seemed to lack subtlety. The sets, costumes, filming, and cast should have resulted in something fantastic, like a Merchant/Ivory film, but it didn't come off well, and the stilted dialog and uncomfortable acting were the kiss-off. It's strange how so many terrific components would not add up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the Soldier","review":"Great plot dealing with a WWI British officer who is shellshocked and suffers amnesia concerning his past 15 years.

Thirty years later it all looks so immature and ridiculous. His theatrical broadway R & R antics just look wimpy.

It probably deserves 1 star, but I can't bear to give Alice a failing grade, so out of the kindness of my heart, I'll give him 2 stars.

While this is awesome and enlightening to see in places just how depraved he was back then, some of the antics take away from the performances. The music is tight (you can see some extra players now and again in the background)but on occasion Alice forgets the lyrics.

I bought one from Grizzly. The drill bit bound and then cut into soft metal of the guides. Each time I drilled a pocket hole, more of the metal was removed. The result was shallower and shallower (and less consistent) holes.I'm spending the $100+ for a KREG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk with a capital J","review":"The first reviewer has it exactly correct - the drill guides are softer than the drill bit; each use bores out the guide a considerable amount, leaving it with less and less precision. I used it once and went back to Kreg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steelex D1060 Pocket Hole","review":"Not an easy product to use. It tends to slide too much even with a proper clamp. I recommend a spray of Herculiner truck bed liner, to stabilize the bottom in order to keep the guide from excessive vibration and movement. Also, a second clamp to hold down both guides is also helpful.For best results, the manufacturer recommends a step drill bit of 3/8\\" with a 1/4\\" tip. Be aware that the bits are rather large and can not touch the black metal guide holes where the bits enter, or else the metal easily grinds away and warps unevenly. This is not an isolated incident, as other reviewers have noted. The guide holes are the worst and most inferior part of this product, which makes it a shame.The adjustable clamp is the only advantage to this tool, as it easily situates the proper distance between pocket holes without an extra ruler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where","review":"I bought this about 10 years ago.

This is the supreme arrogance of atheism- just because there doesn't appear to be any deeper meaning to existence, doesn't mean there isn't any. All it means is that you have chosen to observe the universe from your own dismally limited perspective. The author's mind has obviously been warped by unsucessful psycological techniques and due to his unfortunate experience, the only way he can rationalize existence is to dismiss the possibility that he is mentally ill and the universe and individual human potential are limitless. If he can sincerely crave permanent oblivion after a short and meaningless life I'm sure that will be his fate. He is pitiful and confused but I would not hesitate to greet him with the same advice he gives us concerning Buddha."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your money","review":"We were expecting a book with different paper plain models.

Dr. Riley's knowledge as a world-class doctor and as an experienced mom informs the detailed information in the book. There is also a detailed section on labor and delivery and the first few weeks after the baby is born which are invaluable. I read it while pregnant with our second child. I first got it from the library and soon decided I had to own it- it is a tremendous resource and Dr. Riley makes all the information on all the multiple topics accessible and easy to find. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for pregnant moms- especially first timers","review":"A lot of pregnancy books were recommended to me- this was one of three books I read and by FAR my favorite.This book is comprehensive, well organized, and very detailed. I would have a symptom or complaint one day and the next morning read about it int he book my coincidence. I was not left wanting for more information in any of my trimesters, the book covers it all, and covers it well.I also reads What to Expect when You're Expecting- found it to be a very dry read. Dr. Riley's book was a MUCH better read. The book also covers postpartum care- I haven't gotten there yet (I'm due in 4 weeks) but I sure am glad it's in there.If you are going to read one pregnancy book, read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, could use more detail","review":"I purchased it because an OB/Gyn was the author but I was dissappointed.

Did the author read the studies?Asking permission to have a doula, that is what is wrong with birth in hospitals. Women are paying for a service, birth is theirs, they do not need to ask permission to have a doula present. Your body, your baby, your choice. You are the expert of your body. Birth is about empowering women.Waterbirth? Waterbirth is a safe option for women having babies, yet it is not mentioned at all.Midwifery- Midwifery is completely left out as an option women have, Nurse Midwives, Certified Practical Midwives, Licensed Midwives. Midwives have the best outcomes overall, so it is interesting that this was completely left out of this \\"evidence\\" based text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Week by Week","review":"This book is almost entirely week by week information, so what you get is more detailed. At the end there are small sections on feeding your baby, the postpartum weeks, and questions for your doctor.

It also includes a pregnancy wheel and full color photos of a fetus at different stages, which are nice bonuses.

I was amazed how real it looked. I ordered it.It only took 3 days to come. Took it out of the box and put it in the fireplace opening and had it going in 20 minutes. It looks far better than any gas unit. The flame looks real and the embers looks great too. Guests come to the house and say it looks like a real fire. I am very happy with this unit. Thank you Dimplex and thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"no heat output","review":"I bought two of these inserts to fill fireplaces that have been capped off in an old house.

During the day they look exactly like what they are, fake. They do not put out any significant amount of heat. I tried to use it in my 6x4 hallway last week to take the chill off in the morning. It took three hours to raise that small room 10 degrees.Bottom line-if you are buying them just for decoration, great, you'll like them.

However, this particular one was a real chore, and I gave up after 1/3 into it.

(For those of you who have not read any Connelly...his books are always self-contained. You do not need to read one to understand the others.) Harry is a lone wolf police detective always bucking the brass in his desire to solve the case. I won't even give the plot away. I'll just tell you that you can't go wrong by taking the time to read this work. BTW, I'm re-reading the series in order just to savor Connelly's writing.Thanks Michael for all of the wonderful stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Harry Bosch mystery!!!","review":"What starts out as a obvious suicide by a Los Angles narcotics officer, turns into a top notch Harry Bosch mystery. This one is a real page turner, that will take you to the darker side streets of L.A. to the poverty stricken border town or Mexacali Mexico. And all the way through you will be kept on the edge of your seat as you try to guess who is who. Michael Connelly has to be one of the best mystery writers around. His characters are so real and life like, it's as if they are just going to jump right off the page. I strongly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriging","review":"As the story progressed, I lost track of who was who, but wanted to find out how it ends.

It slows down to a snooze inducing drag by 2/3, and the big DEA showdown in Mexico becomes so stupid that it's hard not to toss the book across the room. It's only when the real ending, from the meeting at the castled to the end, starts up, that the book picks up it's lost momentum and comes to an interesting and satisfying close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good story","review":"After releasing the Mickey Haller series I came back to the beginning.

I only wish I would have started here first"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine thriller","review":"The Black Ice is a story of detective Bosch who investigates the murder of a fellow police officer and takes him all the way into Mexico as he digs to find the root of the crime. The resolution is quite unusual yet satisfying. The story is gripping and moves fast. A fine thriller. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The Black Ice is Michael Connelly's second book in his series of Harry Bosch novels. What makes his books special is the combination of an interesting and complex main character with fascinating story lines that are complex enough to keep you on your toes, but also fun and engaging.In this installment, Bosch discovers that a suicide of a narcotics officer might actually be a homicide, and that the officer may have been playing both sides. The story bogs down a bit when Bosch travels to Mexico, and the story started to veer off into 3 star territory, but for me, the ending redeemed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts from the past","review":"It is Christmas, and Harry Bosch is on standby to take calls for any murders. He has the police scanner on, and hears a report of an incident within his jurisdiction. When he investigates, he becomes involved in a messy case involving a police officer. Things develop from there.There is a lot about bureaucracy and bean counting in the police department. Increase the number of arrests and increase the percentage of solved cases to make the atatistics look good when the budget request goes in. There are continuing conflicts between Harry and his superiors, but there are some tradeoffs. Not everything is as it seems, but everyone seems to come away with something. Sometimes it's better not to look too close.Black ice, by the way, is a new form of narcotic - an emerging recreational drug showing up on the scene.The novel is also available as part of the omnibus collection, \\"The Harry Bosch Novels.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch at his best","review":"Michael Connelly consistently delivers exciting hard-boiled police procedurals with Harry Bosch in control. In Black Ice Bosch is cut out of an investigation of an apparent suicide of narcotics officer Calexico Moore by the bigwigs of the department. They want to do what is pc and Bosch is definitely not that. At the same time Bosch's supervisor Pound feels compelled to increase the percentages of his homicides solved so Bosch is elected to solve some cases of an out on stress leave detective, Porter. Harry realizes that Porter's case, his own and Moore's \\"suicide\\" are all tied together. As usual Bosch cuts corners and goes out on his own to make the pieces fit.An excellent read for any fan of mystery and suspense. Connelly is always exciting and hard to put down. I am ready for a new one. For anyone unfamiliar with Connelly and Harry Bosch, read them in order and not spread out over years as I have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic characters and good plot make a great read.","review":"This mystery has it all for the lover of the \\"hard-boiled\\" genre. Harry Bosch is a compelling, unpredictable, intelligent, and, of course, tragic character. He makes his second appearance in The Black Ice, following his debut in The Black Echo. After reading The Black Echo, I immediately purchased The Black Ice and was not disappointed. Harry's character is \\"true\\" and multi-dimensional. The plot is complicated but not beyond belief. The other characters in the story add to the richness of the whole by giving an emotional undercurrent to the events unfolding. Michael Connelly writes police procedurals that have intelligence, tragedy and heart. The Black Ice is, in my opinion, the best of the five Harry Bosch novels, although they are all worth a read, just to keep up with Harry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, character driven.","review":"A suspenseful, character driven mystery novel that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the satisfying and surprising conclusion. Bosch, a true maverick hero, is one of my favorite characters in the genre (and I love his taste in music).Connelly skillfully overlaps law enforcement with the criminal world. Some of the so-called good guys seem just as rotten as the bad guys, and Connelly doesn't make excuses for anyone. The only complaint I have with the book is that everyone seems to be against Bosch, and it gets a little frustrating. But it is a very minor complaint and isn't enough to take away from the five-star rating. I can't wait to read the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"The problem I had with this book was that I just couldn't make myself care about the case Harry was working on. Found myself skimming and skipping pages to get to the end. After reading and enjoying all of Connelly's Harry Bosch stories, I was surprised that this one was so uninteresting. I'm glad this was the last in the series that I read. If it had been the first, I doubt I would have wanted to read his other books. And that would have been a big loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Ice","review":"Michael Connelly is just one good author. Love all of his books.

I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great police thriller!","review":"It is my first book of Harry Bosh' series (but I've read other books by Michael Conelly that I liked) and I was impressed. There are many novels with the motif of 'lone wolf' but it is difficult to make the reader really like the main hero. This book is the one. The plot seems totally logical and realistic, and at the ame time intriguing until the end. Mexican background, including Harry' adventures there, seems real and interesting. The police work in LA is described with such details that you definetely get the atmosphere the writer tried to convey. Definitely recommended to all fans of mistery novels and police thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"i found out who i was","review":"I am a Michael Connelly fan and found The Black Ice not as satisfying as his other works to some degree, but still way ahead of his competition. There was the usual brilliant writing I'm accustomed to with Connelly, but the story dragged a little more than usual in some spots. My big wish for this novel was that it skipped the romance (two different women in one week?) Still, being a Connelly apologist, they only took a couple of pages. All in all I did enjoy this mystery that took Bosch to Calexico (a California border town) and Mexacali south of the border. Recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't worry, he's all better now","review":"I was a big fan of Connelly after 2 other books (out of order) and was concerned when Black Ice fell flat for me. However, I think it really was soph. slump and Connelly has recovered nicely. It was tedious whereas his others are detailed and I decided one night I wasn't curious about anything and reading the rest felt like a chore. And that is a rare statment for me: I am the one everyone makes fun of for reading so much and for needing reading like breathing.Skip this and go to other Connellys, especially The Narrows."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUDIO TAPE WARNING - MULTI-TRACK STEREO","review":"Just a warning to all the audiobook listeners out there. The unabridged cassette tapes are multi-track stereo meaning that the cheap publisher uses the left and right channels to record separate chapters.

I fail to understand why in this day and age, the publishers can't spend a few more pennies and put the 4 additional tapes in the box. If AOL can send out about a bizillion CD's a year for free, why can't this publibsher spring for some old fashon cassettes!I listened to about 5 minutes of it and couldn't stand it any longer.

Plenty of Dragons, shooting and driving.But then, that's all there is to it, just drive, shoot and try not to get killed by the dragons in the air. Woo hoo.It took me a while to get used to it, as with everything, but the graphics are okay, the driving and shooting system is fun and simple, and the voice acting is similar to the movie's characters.

I felt like I was back to playing an original Game Boy game. The gameplay is horrible, with your little men running around shooting dragons. end of story. there is a VERY short campaign, and once you beat it playing humans, there is an even SHORTER dragon campaign. The \\"many vehicles and weapons\\" is more like \\"3 awful vehicles and 1 weapon\\". The story lacks any depth, whatsoever. You run around and shoot dragons. period.

Perhaps TP has spoiled me but I didn't care for the choir director's voice. There were No BIG stand out messages or memoriable parts. Nephew Tommy was good but he just wasn't believable as a thug/drug dealer mostly because I'm use to his comic side on the Steve Harvey Morning Show and his side kick D is also a comedian so their roles to be were like Blah.

While interesting, this is not what I was hoping for in a book about riding skills.Actual technique sections were rather light on detail, and provided no more information than even the most basic of motorcycle instruction courses.

I read this book ages ago and gave it away because I didn't like it at all, it's kind of weird and not very informative if you are seeking to learn about the ancient American peoples way of life.If you are looking for a book akin to the Earth's Children series then The Mammoth Stone is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ancient Native American with one green and one blue eye?","review":"Nothing in this book is believable or even remotely plusable.

Over all, it is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a youth size helmet","review":"While the quality of the helmet is decent for what it is - it's a bike helmet with a face guard - I was very disappointed with the over-sized fit. The packaging says it's a youth helmet, but the helmet itself is labeled as a 'Medium', and I've got to believe that means 'adult medium'. I'm a 6'6\\" adult, and this helmet fits snugly on me (with all the internal velcro pads still in place) - the thing is way too big for my son's head. Buyer beware: I didn't think that Razor could screw up a bike helmet too badly, but this helmet is unusable for the average 8-year-old child unless they wear a knit cap underneath."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fit","review":"I bought this for my son a few years back and he loves it.

He is 7 now and still has a hard time sometimes securing the strap, but once it is on it stays put."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Extra Pads - Old School Chin Strap :(","review":"We already bought the black version of this helmet for our kids. However, we needed another helmet and decided to add the red version since it would be familiar and easy to use. Unfortunately it did not come with the extra pads that are supposed to be included as listed in the features. Also, the chin strap on the red helmet is not a simple click open/closed buckle but it is more like a 1970's loop in/over/through style that is nowhere near as quick and easy for kids to learn to use. Build quality of the helmet is great but it's other features are definitely lacking and need to be upgraded to the same standards as the black helmet. This one will definitely be going back to be replaced by another black helmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Rounded, Well-Written, and Worthwhile","review":"Bridging concepts of career and life, Hayes' text serves the astute individual in all fields, from Management to Homemaking.

I would have been ok with the authors spending a few more pages. \\"Here's Shakespeare, here's Rumi, moving right along...\\" That's what made me withhold the fifth star.It's hard to pick ten poems, or ten love poems, for the \\"List of Tens\\" section, without being subjective.But still, this is a good book to read for someone who has a desire to create poetry, but doesn't know where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This was a great movie - such a shame I never saw it in the theatre.

I was looking forward to this movie and then I watched it and....well...it is really boring. It also leaves out some of his more perverse and interesting quirks. The movie has Albert Fish acting \\"odd\\" once his children are adults. However, he acted odd way before that. Once his wife left him for another man...he fed his children raw meat but only on full moons. Albert's letters to women asking if they would like to participate in his perversities were also left out. Plus his paddle wasn't mentioned...The narration of the movie with the detective taking over was very annoying. The narration sounded like some cheesey gumshoe from a film noir rather than an officer to be taken seriously. The pace of the movie was slow and at times it didn't seem that time passed then oh yeah it did. It was very disappointing and lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another film is the true story","review":"To see the true story, and an even more graphic depiction of events, see the film: Albert Fish, In Sin He Found Salvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better and less expensive microphones than this","review":"The AT831cW Lavalier Microphone is small, solid and sounds fine. The problem is the cable. The cable is too fragile, it breaks easily and needs to be replaced every couple of years, or sooner.

Even as a advanced knitter, this book for me was hard to follow. The directions written in general terms and not as clear and concise as I would like. I guess I am a little anal about the kind of pattern I like. Specific number of stiches, not 23% of total number of stiches on needle #3 and 35% on needle # 4. This book is not for anyone who is not very good with numbers, especially percentages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, the book didn't do it for me","review":"I often feel that I am the only non-EZ fan in the knitting world. The book didn't do it for me. I don't like steeks and the book did not convince me that they are anything laudable in making a sweater.

What a lady. I highly recommend this book for knitters of all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"EZ rocks!","review":"This is the best knitting book I've seen. Besides challenging knitters to go beyond the basics of published patterns, Zimmerman provides a large helping of her unique attitude and way of describing things. She has a very distinctive \\"voice\\" in this book (and all her other books). I think of her as the M.F.K. Fisher of knitting. This book is both informative and funny. I hope other knitters who read this will forgive my casual one-line above, but that's the best and quickest thing I can think of to say about her style. I think anyone who reads this book would be inspired to learn to knit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knitting in layman's terms with several sweater patterns","review":"This book is good for beginners but better for advanced to experienced. EZ uses direct, simple explanations to take one by the hand and lead one through the knitting of a sweater from start to finish. However, a working knowledge of basic stitches and construction is very helpful. The illustrations leave much to be desired and if color, detailed illustrations were included I'd give this book a big, fat 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually cried","review":"My boyfriend says \\"at least the book isn't called 'knitting without killing your partner'\\". Although I did actually cry when I couldnt get the hang of anything in the book to do with needles and wool, I've finally reached an even balance. I can knit, just not the way she tells me to. OK, I do actually like this book now, lots of useful stuff but just takes a bit of getting used to her \\"conversational style\\". Just a pity the book got slightly ruined when i threw it against the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pictures. Not for dummies like me. Disappointed.","review":"I agree with the reviewer who was disappointed because there are no pictures. I didn't realize that I was a visual learner, but when I received this book I felt that it was almost useless to me. I am going to chalk this purchase up to \\"lessons learned\\". This was my error, not the book or author's fault. But if you expect a fun, easy to use book with lots of drawings, (i.e Stitch and Bitch, or Knit Girl), this is not for you. Happy Knitting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for Wife","review":"This guide has excellent pictures and explanations of all issues and tools about knitting; an extensive background is not needed, just some familiarity with the craft.A keeper of a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable read","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Elizabeth Zimmerman has such a distinctive way of writing - you feel like you are listening in to one of her workshops. An absolute bonus were the many tit-bits of insightful and clever ways of dealing with many day-to-day knitting issues. I especially liked her way of shaping shoulders - why had I not thought of this before? If you have been knitting for a while so you know which aspects of knitted garments don't seem \\"quite right\\", then you will gleam many practical gems from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good for beginning knitting students","review":"This book is more a collection of essays and the opinions of a knitter from a long time age. I read her instructions on how to fix a dropped stitch and forget it -she is not very clear about how to do this. Stitch and Bitch by Debbie Stoller is a great book for beginning knitters. I've owned Knitting w/o tears for over 10 years and I find it boring. It certainly lacks illustrations. Yes, she gives you ideas for patterns but doesn't teach you how to do things. Of course, she has her devotees. I for one, found this book to be useless. It is very dated. This book might be great for super advanced knitters who are of her generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I'm an intermediate knitter who has heard about how great EZ is. Well this book was very lame. It taught me nothing and the patterns are hideous. People say her tone is entertaining, if that were true then this book wouldn't have been a total waste of money. I would hope a beginning knitter would not buy this book because they will then consider giving up the hobby. There are many other books out there that are better at teaching knitting and are more entertaining with much more attractive patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful primer for all knitters","review":"The mother of all knitting, Elizabeth Zimmerman is the ultimate source for all knitters, regardless of experience or ability. It is great to have this classic in such a comfortable format!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype","review":"This book has been hyped up so much by reviewers and other knitters. I found her writing to be disorganized and not as useful as I had hoped. I was hoping I would be able to break away from using patterns, but this book did nothing for that. Her percentages method was not explained. How did she come to use percentages? Who knows. Obviously Elizabeth was a talented woman, but, in my opinion, not able to translate her knowledge very well. I will keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for most beginners","review":"If you are looking for a good how to knit book, with step-by-step instructions on the basics this book isn't it.

I was really disappointed by this book. I expected to find information as a beginning knitter, but this book seemed to be geared towards knitters who are more experienced.I do like the homey style and the fact that Elizabeth Zimmermann was a knitting enthusiast, but this is a book that should be added to the knitter's library later on, once technique and method has been established."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT basic or easy to follow, contrary to what title says","review":"I started knitting a few months ago and thought this could help me to get beyond scarves. I suppose it would if I were a sewing expert, but alas, I am not. I guess it's good for advanced knitters and designers, but not being born with natural talent for this, I need something more basic before I can comprehend this. If you're a beginner, save your money. I got more out of Stitch-n-Bitch and Leisure Arts pamphlets than I did from this book. Maybe I'll pick it up again in a couple of years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated in the extreme","review":"I bought this book four years ago (mine has a red cover) and I have yet to use it for anything. I understand she is revered for her 'percentage' method but in my opinion the sweaters and caps in the (boring b&w) photos look very coarse and often downright ugly. If this is what the percentage method yields you can have it. I've turned to this book looking for tips and inspiration more times than I care to remember and am always disappointed. It took writing a review of her daughter's boring book to wake up and realize I should have listed it on eBay ages ago. I'm writing this review because so many people rave about Zimmerman that I felt a little balance was in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book hits the nail on the head","review":"Since I'm a fairly new knitter, I appreciate the down to earth directions and the accompanying photographs.

The Cherokee were treated sympathetically, but the whites were stereotyped as badly as native Americans have been in the past. The language and subjects addressed made it inappropriate for children and we had to fast forward through more than one portion. Most upsetting was the presentation of fundamentalist Christians. The characters were so one- dimensional they were like paperdolls. It was clear that the film makers do not understand or care to know the Scotch-Irish people. Well, at least the scenery was breathtaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct","review":"I rented this movie and was initially delighted with the cinamotography and actors. Not long into the film the thrust of the message became overt: all things Indian are wise, good and wonderful; all things white or Christian are hypocritic, laughable and not to be trusted. The writer commited the same atrocity on whites and Christians that was done to American Indians by the U.S. government and white settlers that were biggoted, selfish and downright evil. You don't right wrongs by portraying history incorrectly or by blanket statements that condem all. In the end, what could have been a good movie became predictable, a lie and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"This movie was horrible. My five children ages 7-15 all walked away from it after 45 minutes. My wife and I continued to watch it for another 15 minutes, then we couldn't take it anymore and shut it off. The movie critisises on numerous occasions Christians and also white people in general, and the \\"grandpa\\" blasphemes and curses throughout the movie. Also, grandpa makes illegal whiskey and teaches his grandson the \\"trade\\" and also teaches him to lie to cover it up. If there was a 0 star rating, that is what I would give this movie.

Personally, I don't want my kids reading or watching a story about Native Americans written by a notorious KKK member.

It is an education for us all. Maybe Dana Spears didn't realize that this story is an autobiography. The author, Forrest Carter, lived this life and I think he tells the story so beautifully.

Although she's gotten more bluesy with her music now, this one has to be her most powerful, raw, and creative work that I have heard. In some songs there is this hard hitting power she expresses musically and in some songs she delivers a southern rock roots feel to them.

Certainly, the original Broadway recording is the definitive version of this production. But, I'd recommend this 1994 cd over the movie cd for a second, very different, take on the music. To be clear, not only is it a different take, but it is also very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds up well 15 years later","review":"I love this recording of the JCS soundtrack. Indigo Girls' Amy Ray gives a wonderfully passionate performance as Jesus, while Emily Saliers is a perfect foil as the gentle, loving Mary Magdalene. Admittedly, some of the other performers represent the quirky side of the Athens music scene at the time, and so the recording may not be to the taste of purist fans of the original. But listeners looking for a new perspective on a classic soundtrack should check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame, lame, lame","review":"This recording adds nothing to the original interpretation. In fact, the musicians have trouble with the changing time signatures, and can't even play all the guitar riffs properly (there are more than a FEW bum notes).

I have all of their albums, a couple of soundtracks (i.e. Philadelphia, etc.), and even an autographed ticket from The Boathouse in Norfolk, VA (great show there!). However, this recording...hurt. It hurt me to listen to it, and when I decided to give it another chance and listen again, it hurt even more. I mean deep-down-in-my-gut pain. I'm willing to bet that when they are hanging out with their friends and they play some of this music that it sounds great within that environment. But not here. Oh well, like it says above it was probably some childhood fantasy to be in the show, so when they had the power they said hell, why not record our own version. I'd probably do the same. Not worth buying, unless you like your ears to be punished for an hour and a half. Sorry Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well","review":"It's somewhat worth it if only for the interesting new arrangments, adding a fresh twist on how the music is played, I especially liked the pounding drums on many of the tracks and the retooling of the overture, but the performances really sink it. I doubt most Indigo Fans would really enjoy this. While an okay singer, Amy ray makes an unconvincing even laughable Jesus, and the rest of the cast is just as blah. Hard Core Indigo Fans might dig this. As for the JCS fanatics, well, let's just be glad those poundig drums I mentioned drown out most of the vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement for Thunder Research Intake","review":"This K&N intake replaced one that had been washed too many times.

It's the most complete work I've come across, and shows some excellent growth if your familiar with Whiskeytown's Pneumonia, or last year's Heartbreaker. It is a significant departure from both, but in an outstanding way. Ryan Adams has made an album that is both new and familiar. It's not the same retread albums you hear on the radio, but rather the songs that you hear in the back of your head from childhood, when artists had to convey their message in disguised lyrics, rather than dropping and F-bomb every 5 seconds. On a song like Answering Bell, you'll think you're hearing Van Morrison. Others will conjur Robert Plant, or the Who. But that's the beauty of this album. Adams has taken everything that was once great in music, and built upon it. Everybody may not adore this album, but you won't be disappointed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"another gem from ryan adams","review":"wow, what a great bunch of songs here. a rather long record but each song is very very strong, there's no filler on this album at all. the material is like a cross between the whiskeytown and rock n roll albums, some of it's country and some rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Something about his voice...I luv it!

Gold was not the rock that bI was use to, but I listened and gave Adams a chance. I must say by the 3rd spin I was hooked. His voice is very soothing when it wants to be or loud at other times when it needs to be. ---note 2 artist---I think that you're a great artist and you should think about usng jazz or classical musicn if u want a challenge.

From beginning to end, Ryan Adams draws you in with his famous hooks, and whether the music is bouncy and joyful, or melancholy and introspective, you are happy to be along for the ride. My husband first picked up this album at the store because he was offended that the flag was hung upside down on the cover. But after sampling a few songs, we purchased what has come to be our favorite album of all time. Standouts are numerous, but \\"Somehow, Someday\\", \\"Firecracker\\", \\"Answering Bell\\" and especially the soft and beautiful \\"La Cienga Just Smiled\\" are not to be missed. Ryan Adams is one of the of most prolific artists alive today.

And some powerhouse ballads(not to be confused with 'power' ballads known to glom up FM radio). With whip-smart, say-just-enough lyrics. Although he doesn't have a great voice, he's got the right one. The crystalline production is come by rightly by Ethan Johns, the talented son of Glyn Johns, engineer/producer of, among others, The Rolling Stones whose work this CD much resembles. Adams' versality and prolificacy are frightening (as is the thought of ever using the word 'prolificacy' again). There are so many good songs here that they spill over onto a second CD. We are more than a bit reluctant to say that 'we have seen the future' of rock and roll, but we may have just met the new Boss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, once I gave in and exhaled!!!","review":"I resisted this CD for months.

If you have in mind that terrific music at the end of the movie, and if on newsgroups you are being told it is this one, well, simply: that movie song you are thinking of is not the one listed here as \\"the Rescue Blues\\".

The silence was deafening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped beyond reason unoriginal Adams","review":"This is not a bad record it just isn't that good.It comes across as an Alt country by numbers record without the touching (if a little hackneyed) songs that made Adams's name on \\"heartbreaker\\".Even the title \\"Gold \\" is hardly inpired?You'd be better off with a Wilco or early 1970's late 60's Rolling Stones record from which he has taken so much and made so little.It is interesting to note that the record was produced by Ethan Johns, the son of sometime Stones producer Glynn Johns and features Chris Stills son of etc..I think this kind of thinking is what holds Adams back as he has an obvious talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss bout???","review":"I bought this because everywhere you go people are raving about the 2nd coming of Gram Parsons. I am not a convert. To be fair I have not listened to Heartbreaker or anything from Whiskeytown but this CD is marginal at best. There are 3 or 4 good songs here and 3 more mediocre ones. After that is a lot of filler. The big burning question is can this guy even sing? He is repeatedly mumbling words and his singing is questionable in my opinion. I actually thought a couple of songs were in a different language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"As a huge Whiskeytown fan, I ran to the record store to pick upa copy of \\"Gold.\\" If only it had been worth it.Gone are the country influences which made Whiskeytown standout, and in their place is a weak, uninspired folk-rock record.My only hope is that this record will be an anomaly in Adams'scareer, and he will get the hell out of LA, away from AdamDuritz, and back to the music that he does best."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, you might forgive him for dating Winona Ryder","review":"Gold is no Stranger's Almanac or Pneumonia, but I hardly regret buying it. I tend to think the harder-edged tracks are overblown and unnecessary (\\"Tina Toledo's Street-Walking Blues,\\" for example) but the slower tracks are excellent (\\"La Cienega Just Smiled,\\" \\"Wildflowers\\"). The appearance of Adam Duritz on background vocals (he just doesn't mix with the music at all) and the multiple props given to Alanis Morrisette in the liner notes gives me nightmares. Overall, he has a beautiful voice and intriguing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold is Good.","review":"One of Ryan Adams best albums, very happy to receive it. Only complaints are the record jacket is made for one record (it's a double album) and it did not include the liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan Adams hits a home run!","review":"I read the review in no depression and the editorial piece which said this cd wasn't all that great. Boy am I glad i purchased this cd and didn't listen to those reviews. It arrived last night and i can't take it out of my cd player. I have become a huge ryan adams fan and this cd proves he has the stuff to be one of the best. The varied styles of play make this well worth a listen. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so well known, but a decent songwriter.","review":"Ryan Adams has some solid songs on this CD. His style is similar to Shawn Mullins, if you're unfamiliar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to Great but not quite there","review":"Ryan Adams is a great songwrtier, and if he could maintain focus over the course of an album, he would produce a classic, but he is so prolific that he puts out a lot of stuff that is not up to snuff. As a result, his discs are all good, with flashes of brilliance, but they are never the knockout punch I think he has within him."},{"rating":"2","title":"All That Glitters Is Not 'Gold'","review":"There may be a number of 2001 albums that \\"glitter,\\" but none of them are 'Gold.' This is the Album of the Year, hands down! I was really disappointed when I heard Adams was breaking up Whiskeytown. In fact, to show my spite, I refrained from buying 'Heartbreaker,' and did not intend to buy 'Gold.' By chance, however, I heard a couple of tracks and was immediately hooked. The thing is, this is not just an extension of his Whiskeytown genius. It is fresh. It is different. And, it is brilliant. There are plenty of songs that will jump right out at you (e.g. 'New York,' 'Firecracker,' etc.), but the brilliance lies in some of the more subtle numbers like 'Rescue Blues' and 'Stars Go Blue.' This album is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who appreciates music and longs for the days when rock 'n roll stars weren't supposed to be role models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an easy album","review":"This is a really good record. There are a couple of knockouts, but many of the songs on the record are pretty slow and soulful. Not to say they aren't good, it just took me seven or eight listens to get a bite into the slower stuff. Bought a Whiskeytown album, and the same thing. He's got a great voice, writes good songs, he just needs someone to light a fire under his back side, because when he rocks, it is indeed Gold. You gotta want to be patient to like the slower stuff, but I have slowly acquired a liking for most of the record. It really is a very, very good record, I just wish he would pick up the pace and rock a little more. Highly recommend that you get the limited edition with the extra disc which includes six great, rollicking songs (a great disc on it's own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much of a Good Thing","review":"Because he shows such promise, it seems churlish to complain about Ryan Adam's Gold. But ambition ain't achievement, and though he'll no doubt get there, he ain't there yet. That said, Gold is a mighty fine, derivative work. In his defense, Adams is a stellar writer - whatever the genre he's working over, he's passionate and focussed - and, more importantly, he's a limber singer who adapts to the style of the moment. His rockers rock; his ballads are direct and moving. Problem is synthesis - as each track goes by, you tick off the antecedents: Stones-rip, Who anthem, Van Morrison stroll, Elton John love tune, with the rare track that feels completely his own. Other problem is length: 16 songs, 5 more on extra disc, and it's too much of a good thing. Once again, less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rate This CD On The Quality of the Music","review":"I was reading the reviews people wrote for this album and there was this one that caught my eye: Reviewer: A music fan from Houston, Texas United StatesWe have men dying for their country and ryan adams turns the flag upside down.

Well for the people who like true music and dont rate CDs on the front cover's picture, but listen to the music and you will like it for what it is. This is one of the best true rock n roll albums to come out in years.GO BUY ALL RYAN ADAMS' CDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I encourage all those who are interested in Adams (or have given up on him after this album) to check out the work he did previously with Whiskeytown- a lot more feeling and much better musicianship. He should never have given up on his country roots, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithless Street Fan Left Disappointed","review":"Whiskeytown's Faithless Street introduced me to the amazing singer songwriter that was Ryan Adams. I wore out that album, taking in the aching harmonies, the fearless rockers, the liquor-dripping ballads -- I ate it up.Gold left me baffled. Where did Ryan Adams I knew go?I've done my best to let this album grow on me, but it just won't take. The Faithless Street spark isn't there, in my opinion. This album feels eerily calculated.Faithless Street fans looking to catch up with Mr. Adams should proceed with caution. His focus seems to have shifted a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I had previously reviewed this album on the day that I purchasedt this cd and the truth of the matter is I have listened to it only a few times since then. Ryan Adams does not have an original bone in his body it appears plus he is a little too prolific for his own good. Heartbreaker was an amazing album but everything else that Ryan has done has been so spotty that it almost isn't even worth picking up. Save the money and buy something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's true!","review":"Ryan Adams is a minimally talented, pretentious, pompous twit with an ego as vast as San Fran Bay. There's no realy way to describe this album other than to say it's profoundly silly and creates in the listener the deep desire to destroy every acoustic guitar and coffee-house warbler from Norfolk, VA to Long beach, CA. Adams thinks he's making deep and significant Art; unfortunately, so do his deluded, oh-so-sensitive fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ryan Adams is a Chameleon","review":"The Press may believe in Ryan Adams. I do not. He is just a good imitator and nothing more. I just wonder if all this hype is payola from his record label. It seems most of the record industry types are dying to have another marketable Neil Young or Gram Parsons. With the exception of his punk band the Patty Duke Syndrome, I have never heard anything original from him. They were a band that had some worthy ideas. Gold is contrived and so derivative it reeks of thievery. However, since he is playing music that is tried and true and radio friendly for the mindless masses to consume; perhaps he can become the major labels new marketable poster boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT BUT GREAT TO LISTEN TOO","review":"YEA I AM MIDDLE AGED AND I NORMALLY DON'T BUY THIS TYPE OF CD BUT THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY AND I MUST SAY I WAS SURPRISED...

It is truly Ryan Adam's best album. You can tell that he is still true to his country roots, yet with strong overtones of Blues and pure Rock n' Roll.

If I wanted to listen to this kind of music, I'd pull out my old Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Black Crowes....and a dozen other white man blues/rockabilly/R&B albums. Nothing new here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best music this year, without a doubt","review":"Sure, the album isn't perfect and it could use a bit more editing. And it definitely isn't another Whiskeytown album (or even another Heartbreaker). For those people looking for more of the same Ryan Adams, you will probably be disappointed.Initially I listened to the album with those same expectations and it didn't completely resonate with me. The next night I saw him perform live in Boston and witnessed an amazing concert. He shattered my expectations two seconds into \\"Street Walkin' Blues,\\" rocking as hard as anyone could. He blew me away.I came home and gave Gold another listen and heard it though new ears. Songs like NY, NY, Firecracker, and Street Walkin' Blues are rockers while tunes like Answering Bell draw more upon Adam's country/folk influences. There are some amazing songs on this album. Listen with an open mind and you will be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album, sub par packaging.","review":"Ordered several vinyls this holiday season, all from Amazon, and received them in 3 different shipments, with 3 different pacaging techniques. This album came laying loose in a rather large box with some inflatable \\"PILLOWS\\". Lower corner of the album cover received some slight damage, the other albums came in carboard sealed covers.....then in the large box with pillows. I'm not reviewing the album, because if your loking for RAA vinyl, you already know this is great music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...and I don't care what anybody else says!!!","review":"I got this cd a couple of months ago, and I loved it! I know that everybody is saying \\"It's not Whiskeytown!\\" but hey, every musician deserves to explore new territory, and that is just what Gold does. In fact, it he had written Stranger's Almanac over again, I would not have been pleased...because music is not static. Anyway, as far as the album goes, the influences are far and wide, and each song (yes, EACH song) reminds me of something that I love. And call me a sap, but I am a huge sucker for \\"When the Stars Go Blue.\\" Plus, I just saw Ryan in concert last week, and it was AWESOME!

The citation reads, \\"Stalking Elijah is an insightful journey through new landscapes of Jewish practice. Profound and often raucously funny, Kamenetz's spiritual adventures take him from a poolside Kabbalah lesson in Beverly Hills to a Passover seder for Tibetan freedom. This book will inspire readers to delve into the rich mystical traditions of Judaism and to search for their own paths to Judaism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalking Jonathan Omer-Man","review":"Stalking Elijah is the follow up to Kamenetz's very successful The Jew in the Lotus. Stalking won the National Jewish Book award, and deservedly so. Kamenetz asks the same hard questions about Jewish practice and spirituality that he did in Lotus, but this time with a greater focus on the Jewish side of things (as opposed to the Buddhist side). With that said, the parts of this book that particularly shine are related to Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man. Omer-Man's tough minded mysticism is a good counter-balance to the softness of most New Age inquiry into Jewish mysticism. Omer-Man is suspicious of easy answers and realizes that the spiritual quest is not linear in any sense. One comes out of this book with a sense of the man's personality, learning, humanity, and frailty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get his books instead","review":"While Douglas Brooks puts out some of the best books on resistance training (which I would highly recommend), this DVD is not a good example of his advice.
