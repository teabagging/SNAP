Well, there was no magic nor a shiny finish. Tried putting the buffer to it to bring out the shine but got nothing to brag about.

I however needed it for a class. It didn't help clarify the subject in the least. The material in the book was not very well explained and thus didn't stand on its own. The instructions for the exercises were windows excel 2003 specific, so I had to not only switch from my beloved mac to a pc, but then had to revert back to the 2003 version just so the step-by-step procedures would be relevant. Other than that, I'm sure it was awesome and insightful. All in all though the scope was so narrow I would not recommend this edition.I have also considered my views might be bias, but seemed to share in the idea amongst classmates that not much was gained from this book in regards to the decision support systems class. Perhaps that has more to do with who the class utilized the book rather than the potential of the book itself. For that reason, I changed my rating from 1 star to 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better efforts","review":"I believe that Emeril has slipped just a little bit. This book is grand in concept, but somewhat lacking in substance. He may be so busy trying to keep his shows going, his personal appearances, all of his restaurants, etc that he has lost a little bit of his true creative edge. Most of the recipes in here are ambitious, but they tend to miss the mark. He has taken some of the fun of innovating and run wild with it, to the point that it is counterproductive. I would advise Emeril to take a break for a little while and get back to the kitchen to do some real cooking. He should get back in touch with the basics that are so vital to true Louisiana cooking. The 'creative' dishes that he has been displaying lately on his show and the recipes in this book are indicative of how he has gone just a little overboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE PICTURES OF THE FOOD?","review":"This book features many pictures of unidentified good times but no pictures of the food being featured. I have tried four receipes and of the four only one turned out as it was described. I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy medium","review":"I also recieved this book as a gift, and I loved reading it-- not looking at the recipes, but sitting down and reading it cover to cover. It's that kind of book. I agree with the reviewer who stated that it was not for beginners-- certainly not!-- but it's an interesting take on the food of both Louisiana and Emeril's multi-geographic, multi-ethnic background. If you don't like Emeril, and are just looking for some Cajun and Creole recipes, don't go here. But if you, like me, have become wound around his little finger, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry","review":"I'm sorry y'all, I went to NOLA, and it was terrible. I've watched Emeril for awhile on FoodTV, and I always thought his restaurants would be heaven. I went with a girlfriend named Sally, and we both agreed that it was the worst evening we've EVER had a at a restaurant. Everything that he had talked about on his show that looked so good was horribly over-seasoned. I thought that I was going to be sick. The 'smashing mashed potatoes' just about made us both sick. I bought this book before I went to his place, but I am going to give it away. I'm sorry that I made the mistake of thinking that he was a good chef. This was the worst. I grew up in Louisiana, and I thought that maybe some of his innovations would be as good as what I gew up with, but they weren't. This was NOTHING like what I remembered. Save your money and don't buy this book. Some of the things he writes about in his book are served at his place. Save your money and stay away. Otherwise, you may get sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ...","review":"This isn't what I'd thought it would be. It aint nothing but pictures of Emeril and other party pictures. There arent any new recipes in this book. Emeril's the man, he can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening!","review":"This book was scary! My arteries were clogging just reading it! Every recipe, and I mean EVERY recipe is listed as an 'old time Louisiana tradition', even the flautas! That makes sense. There are LOTS of pictures in this book, and not enough recipes. However, the recipes that did make it are not really suitable for celebrating with."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"I am a chef by trade. I operate my own restaurant and have published a lot of my own recipes. After watching Emeril on TV, I've decided to try looking at some of his books to see if I could find any inspiration. I've never enjoyed his shows too much, so I thought maybe the books would be better. This book was a great disappointment. I looked at his recipes, and there were a lot of glaring mistakes in proportions, time, etc. There is some potential for his ideas, but they are poorly put together. I think Emeril would have benefitted from working at a Denny's for awhile. Save your money and buy a better book than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Day is a Party","review":"This is \\"classic\\" Emeril! Entertaining, informative, and over the top! His style abounds in this book. It is far more than a cookbook. It is a glimpse into Emeril the man. For those who criticize this book or Emeril, perhaps they can do better. I would be the first to buy any of their books should they accept the challange. Emeril's cookbooks are like Emeril, \\"happy, happy, happy!\\" This book will be on my Christmas \\"giving\\" list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Cookbook","review":"I think some people did not like this book because all they wanted was a cookbook. If anything, it is a Louisiana travel guide interspersed with plenty of recepies to keep you cooking all year! If you love Louisiana or love Emeril, then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This was his worst book yet. Sorry, but there is a difference between well seasoned food, and this stuff. I am not impressed with Emeril's talents at all, and I use the term talent very loosely. He is overrated, and undertalented. Very little in this book is worth fixing. Most is overdone versions of old dishes. Just because it's been Emerilized, doesn't mean it's going to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn out the lights ...","review":"... the party's over. They say that all, good things must end .... This book is not good. Emeril put a collection of mediocre recipes together and passed it off as a cookbook. His success has gotten to him. If you want a good sample of what Emeril is capable of, go look at his New New Orleans Cooking. That was written when Emeril still had his edge. Now sadly, he has gone commercial and the quality has suffered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cajun food","review":"I live in New Orleans. Emeril is a well known celebrity around these parts because of all of his restaurants and his TV shows. However, as popular as he is, the locals realy don't consider his food to be authentic. Emeril has taken classic New Orleans cooking, and 'Emerilized' it to a point that it is something completely different. A true native to New Orleans would not really appreciate Emerils version of something as simple as fried crawfish tails. This book is the same. While there are some 'interesting' recipes, they are not authentic, nor are they necessarily that good. I tried almost all of them, just to see how they would be. This was a sad mistake. Don't be fooled into thinking Emeril is a master Cajun chef. He's not. He is probably much better at pasta or other regional dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give NO stars!","review":"I bought this book around New Years Eve, because I was going to have a party with my friends. I thought there would be some great recipes in this book to entertain with. I had some real probles with the directions on some of the recipes. They were incomplete and inaccurate. Also, if you followed the recipes according to Emerils directions, the food had too much seasoning. The flavor was not very good at all. I was a little embarrassed in front of my friends, because I'm usually a very good cook. This book is not that good. I wish it were better, because I have always enjoyed Emeril before. I hope he does better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"North Louisiana cooking book","review":"This book is a public relations effort instead of a Cajun cookbook.Lagasse is so busy patting himself on the back, he doesn't have time to tell you how to actually pull off these recipes.

It is obvious that Emeril no longer cares about his recipies and is simply out to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This is not the book that I'd recommend to anyone. How much more commercial can you get? Now, we are getting ready to be asaulted with 'Emeril' as a sitcom. Emeril used to be a pretty entertaining cook, now he is nothing more than a corporate cartoon out there shucking 'his' wares. It wouldn't surprise me if this book was written by a team of corporate hacks. ....This book was BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a book!","review":"Break out the Maalox and dust off the plunger, we're going to cook with Emeril tonight! A wild collection of Emerilized recipes in the newest installment in his series of books. Emeril explores his own unique ways of preparing classic New Orleans fare.

Only Emeril could or would put a book like this out on the market. Only you would actually buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emeril's book","review":"My friends at work gave me this book for a going away present, bu t I wasn't leaving the company. I really don't know how to cook and had a hard time following the recipes. Emeril uses too many ingredients and it is hard to figure out what to do. The pictures in the book were nice, but it didn't show how to make the dishes. I wish Emeril included National Airplane Day as one of his holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I expected more from Emeril. This was a disorganized mess. This book is a case of celebrity appeal rather than quality appeal. I will keep using it for a door stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Party Time","review":"Has he no shame? What was the man thinking? This book is a very sparse collection of over blown, in-your-face recipes loosely tied to various holidays and festivals. Nice pictures in the book, but on the whole not worth the cover price.

In fact, I look for any information about exploitation of people by false methods of healing. The title of this book, BEHIND THE SCENES, THE TRUE FACE OF THE FAKE HEALERS led me to believe that information would be given by investigators who had researched and observed false practices in the area of healing. Instead, I found the content to be a complaint by the author of his being ignored by Benny Hinn (this occasion being mentioned repeatedly) and a rambling treatise about many various healers with no objective reporting at all. He wanders through his own personal troubles, again emphasizing how he has not found acceptance in the \\"healing community\\" that he would like to find. I found that the money spent on this book was a total waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Separating Bills From Billfolds","review":"This book is about the most important current controversy on the North American religious scene, the status of the charismatic gifts. The evidence which Brault presents that the current gifts are based on the teachings of Anton Mesmer, that they are an intentional hoax, and that the actual purpose of the charismatic movement is to separate bills from billfolds is extremely persuasive. And Brault really has been behind the scenes, closely associated with several prominent Pentecostal leaders.Sure,the book has some rough edges as other reviewers have noted. But no Christian who cares about the good reputation of God's Kingdom should miss this compelling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the Scenes : The True Face of the Fake Faith Healers","review":"Fake Faith Healer is a title that does NOT apply to Benny Hinn.My good friend and fellow Prayer/Bible Study Partner was HEALED of cancer when Benny Hinn personnaly prayed for her at one of his Baltimore Maryland Crusades.Fake is when NOTHING happens.Healing is for those who believe.Many times Jesus told those who sought Him, \\"As your faith is,be it done unto you.\\"Check it out.

To turn such a great subject into an utterly BORING book. The language is dry, dates are given haphazardly within a chapter. There is no timeline table for easy reference. It has no flavor, no color, gives one no sense of excitement or adventure. It devotes only one or two pages to each of Alexander's campaigns and conquests, usually without explanation of how he was able to accomplish an amazing feat like crossing the Himalayas, or taking his whole army up a mountain on a \\"narrow path\\". The maps that are included provide no reference to modern names of cities and countries so one is left to guess just where an ancient city is located now.I had really looked forward to a book that would make this extraordinary man come alive yet ended up having a hard time finishing it.

Michael Dobbs would have the reader believe that FDR was a doddering idiot, Stalin interested in nothing but gamesmanship, and Churchill governed almost completely by the emotion of the moment. Mr. Dobbs needs to think more deeply about the behavior and motivations of real people. Instead, he has presented us with cardboard cutouts who, if they were as preoccupied with trivia and self-involved as he indicates, would never have reached the positions of power that they did.

It is made of cheap, low quality compressed wood (if it is even wood). I tried a different platform at Sport Chalet and it was definitely much smoother and rebounded like it should.

One or two of them were \\"so, so\\". I did catch an error or two that I just can't stand while reading books, the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, the reason being that in one story particular the writer goes from first person to third person in the middle of the story. Very amateur, because it seemed to be a mistake. Plus it was one of the better stories and it threw me off, but I'm just picky like that I guess. But overall this book is a good buy and good addition to my collection!(I'll update after reading the whole book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be.","review":"I read a lot of horror stories, mostly at Ezines. I especially like ghost stories. I was thrilled to find this collection, thought it would be better than what I usually read. It really wasn't. Subtle horror can be good, but this one goes too far. Most of the stories I read paid too much attention to suspension of disbelief and ended up boring. I didn't read the entire book. I let off after the Grant story, so I can't comment on any after that. It may be better for someone who appreciates a highly intellectual style of horror, but I couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How God Teaches Us","review":"It is such a relief to know that at least a few other human beings are tuned into to God's will for his creatures.

This season was when West Wing turned into one ridiculous parade of grinding \\"big dramas\\". Here's where it started turning into a dreary soap opera, where DC becomes \\"Dallas\\". In previous seasons the show could stand on its own merits, on the fascination of the political process, on the characters, but this season descended into muck as someone must have decided that every show had to be more whiz-bang than its predecessor. You almost expect Bruce Willis to show up.The addition of the bookish Josh Molina doesn't compensate for the loss of Rob Lowe's character. Add to that the amazing mortality rate of so many interesting characters who appeared for awhile during the first few seasons, then vanished into thin air and it seems that something was just slowly going wrong.Somewhere in the middle of this season this show outlived its usefulness. Maybe if we simply stop feeding it, it will go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"the west wing will never be the same","review":"I miss Aaron Sorkin. There is something about seasons 5 and 6 that just rings false. The world they create is a Democratic fantasy-land: it just isn't believable anymore.The characters are now smug, arrogant, pedantic, and overbearing without being quirky and endearing; they take themselves far too seriously. By contrast, Sorkin's world felt very real. In fleshing out his characters, he struck just the right balance between seriousness and levity, between rocket-scientist smart and airhead-silly. Similarly, his stories were powerful and moving, yet laugh-out loud hilarious. I am so thankful that seasons 1 to 4 have been released on DVD for West Wing fans to enjoy, but I still wish there were more like them coming. Yes, Aaron Sorkin is sorely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love","review":"I LOVE The West Wing! I'm completely addicted.

I'm 55 and do lots of yard work, and I consider myself an active person. When I got it, I laughed and thought...\\"here's one gift that's going to sit in the shed\\". It took about 20 minutes to put together and I started using that very day. I was just amazed at how the cart made my work so much easier. Over the last month I have moved stones, rocks, mulch, and dirt. I even used it to hall out trash from the shed to make room for my cart since I wanted to have easy access to it. It can stay tilted up on its own which makes it easy to store and dump things out. I get an entire weekend out of one charge and it doesn't even slow down. My cart has two speeds forward and one reverse, which I thought was a nice feature.Who would have thought that I would be using this, but it really works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Two parts required to assemble it were defective and I had to make my own. The instruction manual says no steep hills, but the web site said nothing of this limitation. (I bought it because my yard is very hilly.) The instruction manual says not to store it in temperatures over 75 degrees F. This apparently eliminates outside use and storage in the summer. The instruction manual said not to discharge the battery all the way, or it would be damaged. (How does one know when to stop and charge the battery unles it stops propelling the cart, and is thus completely discharged?) The instruction manual says to charge the battery every month even if it has not been used. Winter storage thus becomes inconvenient. (Whoever heard of maintaining your wheelbarrow in the winter?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yardmans helper","review":"I just got this cart and I think it is already worth the money.

However the LUVCart failed almost immediately after being purchased. The LUVCart is a great idea, and the plastic tub that holds material seems to be fairly well constructed. The weak point seems to be the motor and circuitry. The LUVCart only operated for me for less than an hour before it stopped working and would not restart. Even while it was in operation it strained under the very small load of pea gravel in its bucket, and the bucket was not even half full. The 5 cubic foot of material that the LUVCart is capable of handling is a wild exaggeration unless you only want to haul 5 cubic feet of grass clippings or dry leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"I bought a cart form Amazon in May 2005. It was relatively eazy to assemble, but proved to be completely useless.

Even so, a \\"best of Laura Love\\" CD would be good to have. Sadly, all of her funk and liveliness have been produced out of this album.

More power to her, I say! Unfortunately, the slicker, more generic production makes Ms. Love blend a bit too much into an anonymous wall of female pop singers. Some of her greats, like \\"Less is More\\", *were* a bit homemade sounding on previous albums, or at least I thought so upon first listen.

Some may notice that Clorox recently changed the design of the scrubbing head so it may look a little different then the picture you see here. I have used both the new and old heads and I can not say there is much difference when it comes to effectiveness.This is a great product. The disposable cleaning heads are easy to change and the unit even has a release so you don't need to touch the dirty cleaning head. The heads also come prefilled with a blue cleaning fluid. So all you so is slosh the new head in a toilet a few times and you are ready to scrub. If you are going to use the same head in multiple toilets you may need some extra toilet bowl cleaner. On a side note I have used the Clorox toilet cleaner liquid and it works fine.My only complaint it that the handle looks weird. Like some sort of disembodied swan head or some alien probe.

In case you are wondering about refills, easy to get, any major store sells them, even Target for $7.99 per box of 20 refills. You can store refills out of the bags too, per Clorox. You can leave the refills to the air if you are concerned about kids getting hold of the plastic bags the refills come in.

I'm giving up 2/3rds of the way through because I just don't care anymore how these idiot characters end up. I am most appalled by writers who write of supposedly intelligent characters - in this case, two married lawyers - who do unbelievably stupid things without sensible, logical motivation. The two main characters are completely pitiful. They repeat their own self-doubt endlessly. and I mean ENDLESSLY. So much so that I finally stopped caring what happened to these two.

I have read The Millonaires and The First Counsel and thought they were both decent but still lacked realistic character developments. In this one, the characters are unbelievable while being completely irritating. The story line is so far fetched it is beyond fiction.

Meltzer does an admirable job of weaving in plot and friendship betrayals,keeping the reader guessing. The relationship between ADA Sara Tate and her ladder-climbing husband, Jared Lynch, provides good tension, but its outcome was fairly predictable.

This is a silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"While I enjoyed \\"The Tenth Justice\\", I found this latest novel by Brad Meltzer boring and unconvincing. Meltzer takes the easy way out on several occasions - for example, instead of detailing Sara's closing arguments to the Grand Jury, Meltzer justs states that she was brillant. How she got the indictment is beyond me. Also, how was Conrad involved in the scheme, and why wasn't that explained? I won't be passing this one on to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 10th Justice rerun with new characters","review":"I actually liked the 10th Justice.

It just wandered....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy--ignore the hype.","review":"I saw a review in \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" where the headline was a lot more enthusiastic than the review itself, it gave \\"Dead Even\\" a B-, but that's grade inflation. Since I like legal thrillers I read \\"Tenth Justice\\" and didn't much care for it -- actually, that was a pretty poor book -- but the EW review spurred me to try again. Won't get fooled again. Unrealistic, dopey, and written with all the verve of a legal textbook.

Okay, getting beyond that, there's every cornball cliche in the book here. The novel teems with improbability, the characterization is flat, and the prose is substandard.

My friend agreed. However, 'Dead Even' was a different story. The person reading it was a female, and I just could not bear listening to her. She was terrible! Maybe because I'm so used to hearing males reading on audio, or because her reading and voice were just bad. To be fair, I've disliked some other audio books due to a boring male reader. I actually did not get past the first 5 minutes, so I couldn't even say if the story was interesting. I do not recommend this book on audio. Try 'The Tenth Justice'. It's GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get going until mid-way through.","review":"Sara Tate is a Manhattan assistant DA. Due to budget cuts she will lose her job unless she wins a big case.

(After all, I did not get bored with Grisham until his fourth or fifth book.) Dead Even, though, failed to deliver any enjoyment. It was not that I had plausibility problems with the plot; instead, I just did not care what happened. The events failed to interest me. The characters failed to interest me. Like most of the other people who have posted reviews, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade school writing at adult prices","review":"It is quite obvious that many of the readers who've submitted reviews have read very little, if any, real \\"literature\\" in their lives. But even by popcorn book standards, DEAD EVEN is dreadfully ill-conceived and executed. It is truly an insult to compare Meltzer to Grisham or Turow or Baldecchi. These writers, albeit not Steinbeck, at least have a grasp on basic principles of writing such as character development, structure, and story. Much like the equally juvenile TENTH JUSTICE before it, Meltzer's writing and the thought processes behind it is painfully inadequate. That of course unless, these novels were meant for elementary school students rather than even semi-well read adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"My gut instinct said \\"don't buy this!\\" unfortunately, I did","review":"I enjoyed most of the tenth justice, so I was pretty excited to read this. I hesitated after reading the flap copy because the concept really irritated me--beyond farfetched and seemingly designed with a movie in mind, but I gave in on a rainy Saturday. This book is crap. It reminds me of another disappointing second book, Reaper by Ben Mezrich. Both books are very shallow, and read like summarized movie scenes--or sound bytes, all flash and no substance. The absolute low point came near the end, with the ridiculous grand finale which never could have happened. I think Brad should read a few more good books--he makes Grisham seem like Hemingway or Fitzgerald in comparison with this poor effort. I too, am suspect of many of these 5 star reviews. Curious how they read rather like back of the book raves, isn't it?

In the right hands the plot could've been clever. These were not the right hands. The lack of tension was remarkable. One didn't care about Sara or Jared's fates. For Sarah to start an office flirtation at that point in the narration was simply not plausible.

It has great dialogue, but the story line is pretty unrealistic. It's no Grisham novel, but I don't think that's what Meltzer was going for. The plot twists definately held you on and made you read the whole thing, however the ending is very shoddy. The book could also do without most of the swearing in the dialouge.

This is a real loser. I bought it thinking it was relatively new before I realized it had been written a few years ago, early in Meltzer's career.For those looking for a thrilling, well-written read for the beach or an airplane flight, I recommend you check out the author Harlan Coben, who I recently discovered, and just love."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad, it hurts.","review":"Sara Tate, an assistant district attorney, has gotten an ordinary buglary case on her first day on the job. The case changes to murder and she realizes it is anything but ordinary.Jared, her busband, gets a client who will bolster his chances of becoming a partner in a law firm. The catch: he will square off against his wife, and anything less than acquittal results in death for the one he loves.Will they be able to surmount the difficulties at home? And what will be the price of their rivalry, because no matter who wins he loses.Brad Meltzer gets high marks for content; a couple slugging out it out in the courtroom is indeed fertile land in the malnourished plains of legal fiction.Still Dead Even is no immacaulate conception. The dialogue is puerile, the plot asinine, the ending insignificant. No one stands up to the thugs as they go around harassing Jared and Sara.The novel resembles a house painter's effort on canvas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"I read the 10th Justice by Metzler. It was okay for a debut, so I expected Dead Even to be better. I had also read an article Metzler wrote in Details magazine about his relationship with his wife (high school sweetheart) which was very good.This book is just absolutely horrible. The plot is pathetic, the dialogue is terrible, and the characterization is very weak. He has a total of 11 characters in the entire book and all of them are so shallowly developed that they would be out of their depth in a puddle. His facts about the law and the NY DA's office were obviously written for the layman because they are not true, or glossed over. If you want to know about the DA's office try Grand Jury by Philip Friedman.Dead Even was excruciating to finish. I doubt I'll ever read another novel by Metzler again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Grisham and Turrow together!","review":"Fabulous page turner!

My husband who usually only reads biographies or historical novels is reading it on my recommendation and loving it as much as I did. I can't imagine who would not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"Brad Meltzer's Dead Even is a great book by many standards. The plot is suspenseful, and the law know-how is very interesting. The characters are realistic with different foibles, personalities, and ethics. I loved this book a lot and I can safely say I could not put it down most of the way. The complex story is very fascinating, and as a writer myself, I appreciate the cerebration something like that might require. However, I was not too satisfied with the ending. It is too gory for my taste. I would have preferred steaming courtroom disputes and heated trials, and a legal clincher to end the story. That is what the story lacked. Nevertheless, the book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light-weight airport reading","review":"If I'd recognized the name of the author of The Tenth Justice, I might not have bought Dead Even. In this book, Meltzer recycles the characters from his first book - we have the same snappy (or is that \\"sappy?\\") dialogue between the same cardboard characters. Sara Tate is supposed to be a hard-driving attorney, yet she is also a mass of self-doubt and vulnerability who so doubts her ability to get a job that she has to cling to her position as an ADA, even when her husband's life is threatened. The same can be said of that husband, Jared (where does he get these names?), who, we are asked to believe, deeply loves his wife, but wouldn't dream of quitting his job, even though doing that job is putting his wife's life in danger. This is the sort of book that you might try when you're stuck in an airport and you're desparate for reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I decided to read this book after seeing the author on a talk show; even though it sounded only moderately interesting, the premise sounded intriguing. So I started out with fairly low expectations and still was disappointed. The writing lacks any spark of creativity, the characters are cliched, the plot is predictable, and the dialog is banal. I read it as quickly as I could, hoping it would improve. It didn't. Even the characters' legal expertise is questionable, as basic issues that are common knowledge must be laboriously explained by one supposedly experienced lawyer to another. I suggest that if anyone is determined to read this book, they borrow it from a friend or go to their local library. Save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Bad Meltzer fan and have loved all of his other books. This one one how ever was DOA. From the start his characters (usually his strong suite) were uninteresting and cardboardish. The plot was totally convoluted and downright silly!! My advice would be to skip this book entirely and read ALL of his other books. This one is about equal to a Paterson book, which isn't saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Can't put down\\" book!","review":"This was an awesome book!

However, once I get into the actual book, I was wondering if Meltzer had a boat payment due, and wrote this book to make it. The plot sounds contrived, and is ludicrous when executed. The characters are unbeleivable, and after lying to each other for the 9 time, I was really tired of\\" I swear this is the last time I will lie to you ....\\". In summary, I have not read such a lousy novel by a \\"named\\" author since before I can remember. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If \\"0\\" was an option, I would have given it that","review":"This book was one of the worst I've ever read. No hyperbole (unlike Meltzer's absurd use of it). Meltzer's dialogue is not only flat, it leaves you cringing. Like listening to the kid in French class horribly mispronouncing the language. Additionally, Meltzer did little or no research into the actual events of an A.D.A. in New York City. There is no way a defendant and his lawyer would be present in the Grand Jury during the presentation of other witnesses; the defendant would be present only for his own portion. Read Turow for a decent legal thriller. Don't waste a penny on Meltzer (and I actully kinda liked \\"The Tenth Justice\\" -- despite having the same implausible dialogue problem!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Over-Hyped Piece Of Tripe.","review":"I could not agree more with the reader in NYC who believes the glowing reviews for this book are plants from the publisher. All that glib crap about a great beach read and roller-coaster ride could not be more off the mark. I can't believe I even bothered to read it: it is as implausible, phoney, dumb and boring as his first effort. How does this guy keep getting published? Surely Generation X has more savvy, intellect and taste than this. If you want a legal thriller, try \\"Chain of Custody\\" by Harry Levy.

Why not just set fire to the $25.00 in your wallet? The flames would be prettier than the prose, the feeling afterwards would last longer than the story, and it would be over a lot faster. Hackneyed, lackluster, sold-it-to-the- movie-producers-before-I-typed-a-word Brad Meltzer is in it for the dough. And his work gives me more reason to HATE all lawyers-turned-writers.

I bought Dead Even thinking that a second novel would be a more mature effort. But in the first few pages we have Sara Tate, Columbia Law School graduate calling her legal assistant \\"amigo\\" on the first day. While the concept of husband and wife being on opposite sides of a case is potentially interesting, some of the stuff they do even lawyers wouldn't do in real life. Meltzer is 0 for 2 as far as I'm concerned and novelists unlike baseball strike out with me after two strikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead On","review":"\\"Legal thrillers\\" I still wonder how they didn't come to be called \\"legal borers\\".

More to the point, Heidegger himself is famous for railing against the superficial \\"chatter\\" of the industry of letters; yet few philosophers (aside from Nietzsche perhaps) have been subjected to as much useless chatter as has been Heidegger.My advice - dispense with the \\"industry\\" of philosophy altogether, and especially its pathetic popularized forms.

The maps make it easy to find whatever it is you're looking for. The arrangement by area also makes perfect sense, and the color coding a life saver. Drawings of logos are helpful when you're looking for something. All in all, an excellent guide and recommended for anyone traveling to Paris. Also check out other Access guides since they're in the same format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but not for the budget traveler","review":"Paris Access is a must-have guide book for Paris -- a real insider's view of the city.

My husband and I, neither of whom speak French, took Michelin, Frommers, and this Access guide with us on our honeymoon in Paris. After the first day, we put all the other books back in the suitcase and relied on this book. The restaurant ratings are accurate both for price and quality.

The maps are great as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT for a budget travelor!","review":"If you've got lots of cash to spend and want a fancy vacation, this book has lots for you to do.

I assume they may have been a return. They didn't have a scratch on them. They fit well although stiff but I believe most new quad skates would be stiff when new. I had to work on rolling the top of the tongue out on the right skate to avoid cutting into the front of my leg but that fixed the problem. The wheels were attached so tightly that the wheels didn't roll smoothly. I still used them three times at the rink before asking the tech there and he loosened the nuts on the wheels telling me they were right against the bearings. They now roll smoothly. I feel I got a super pair of skates for a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size runs large","review":"I am a ladies 9-1/2 and ordered the size 8 based on other comments.

I realize this book was done in 94,but there was still an availability of color pictures from old drum catalogs which are now collectors items in themselves. Thought alot of the history was sketchy and not nearly as detailed or complete as The Great American Drum Co's.by Canagy. Felt it was an amateur attempt to put an inferior book out on vintage drums.Illustrations were dark and overall quality was poor.Various books on individual drum co's are much better sources.(i.e.Rob Cook's books). May be worth a look at the bookstore but not a must have reference for your library! Surely the experts on vintage drums could collectively compile a much better and more informative and valuable book and price guide on this subject.Vintage drum magazines and articles will have to do till a better book comes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Help with Crises","review":"Since I bought this book, I've had three crises with my senior horse. And in each case, this book was useless. It didn't cover what to do when my horse came down with the neurological form of equine herpesvirus! For colic, it didn't mention Banamine. Banamine is no where in this book. For ulcers, it had minimal solutions.Their formula for measuring a horse to determine its weight is for the metric system, not the English system we use. But they use inches, not meters.Another ridiculous section -- they suggest using \\"cold-pressed\\" oils to add to your horse's feed. I checked into this -- these oils are EXPENSIVE!!!!I thought this book would be wonderful. It's not. Save your money. The Internet has more useful and free sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for new horse owners","review":"When we decided to add horses to our family, experienced horse people highly recommended purchasing older, experienced horses. So that is exactly what we did. This book has proven to be highly valuable to us. As stated in a previous review, it does say to call your vet at many of the symptoms. However, that is NOT a bad thing. The easy to follow charts included in each section clearly state if its something you can handle on your own, or if you need the help of a vet. It also tells you WHY you need the vet. It doesn't just state \\"Call your vet\\".The chapters are easy to read and understand. The book covers both health and care for the older horse. I'm sure a lot of the care items would apply to younger horses also, but the book covers the specific needs of the older horse.An experienced horse person would probably find this book to be a bore. However, it is ideal for the new horse owner, young or old. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Serving","review":"This is a ridiculous book, it does not offer any useful advice, it simply leads the reader through a series of questions that always result in a recommendation to call your vet.No wonder as the author and one of the editors is a vet.Do not buy!!!(..)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I decided to buy it after reading all the reviews.

I had ordered it for my mother to remind her to take her afternoon medication. Turns out it is a timer that has to be set every time it is used rather than an alarm clock type that can be set once and will alarm each day at the same time. My fault I guess but I can't see why anyone would want a timer that they have to set each time to remind them to take medication.

Details the actions of the people of Washington and each, and it would seem every, dish that was broken. The battles are cover only mildly to bring you to the 'burning' and afterwards to bring conclusion. A wonderful book for the interested reader, but not so much for military battle analysis. This book only goes into details of the 'burning' making it more of a tour guide than a history of the invasion. On the invasion there are far better titles.Honestly, I found Walter Lord's book to be worth a second read and not happy with this title.Make SURE this book is what you want to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Detailed Stories - Needs Maps","review":"Anthony Pitch gives wonderful tours of Washington DC, which is how I first happenned across this fine book. The book captures a superb level of detail which lends personalities and stories to historical people and places, as any good tour guide should.Pitch gives the reader a great sense of the confusion and fear that Washington residents felt, and the difficult decisions that were pushed upon them. He frames the burning of Washington with early unrest in Baltimore and later American victories in Baltimore and New Orleans which lends perspecitve, and places the burning of Washington in the proper context of the overall war.The book needs more maps to acquaint the reader visually with the movements of individuals, ships, and armies. I highly recommend reading the book with a map on the side, to complete your immersion into this fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story.","review":"Jude and Tucker's love story was something else.

This film is a showcase for Bette Davis and Erroll Flynn and really has very little to do with Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex. In the light of Hollywood's traditional contempt for actual history, I can't judge the film too harshly on those grounds. But it does gall me that they chose to whitewash a maniac (Essex) while making good men like Cecil etc. into conspiring villains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and EssexThis has to be perceived as one of Bette Davis' lesser efforts, especially when compared to her performance as the same character in the now available DVD release of \\"The Virgin Queen\\" which she did when she was closer in age to Queen Elizabeth. Also Davis' costar in \\"The Virgin Queen\\", Richard Todd, is more appropriate because his level of skill as an actor surpasses that of Errol Flynn in this disaster. Whereas Flynn portrays the Earl of Essex, Todd portrays Sir Walter Raleigh. Not being very much aware of British history, I presume these are different characters with whom Elizabeth was involved at different times in her love life. In any case, Davis' dialogue in \\"Virgin\\" is so sharp and witty that it approaches Shakespeare and Davis' spot on delivery of her lines will have you marveling at her and clinging to every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technicolor terribly out of registration!","review":"This is so incredibly frustrating -- this film was one of the most beautiful and lavish Technicolor productions done (pre-Gone With The Wind) when it was released in November of 1939. And while the DVD attests to its glory, many, many shots are terribly out of register -- the Technicolor having a \\"3D without the glasses\\" look. What was Warner Brothers thinking to release it on DVD in this state?? Did they think that no one would notice? One shot will be perfectly gorgeous and the next shot is halloed. Better not to have released it than to have sent it out like this.

With the 'script' button out you get the modern (block MXR logo) phasing. With the 'script' button in, you get the classic 'script MXR logo' sound. The 'block' sound is a more enhanced, full-range phase, while the 'script' sound is a more subtle phase.It's really like two phasers in one.I really only use this to play early VH, with the script button in and the knob between 9 and 10. It VERY accurately replicates that early VH sound. I also use it to play Paul Gilbert's 'Fuzz Universe' with the knob at about noon.I found it better to use this pre-amp vs. FX loop as the phasing was VERY IN YOUR FACE and enhanced in the loop. Placed preamp this gives you a nice subtle phase: You know it's on, but it's not overpowering.I've tried my fair share of phasers and this one really knocks out the competition.

Janice VanCleave takes you and your child from human cell division all the way to reproduction.(no explicit graphics used). We particularly enjoyed the chapters on the human brain where there are many hands on activities to give the kids a better understanding of how the brain works. If you have kids and your trying to teach them something about human anatomy, THIS IS THE BOOK TO GET."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"While this is full of information, it wasn't really what I was looking for. This might be good for kids over 10/12, however it's presented w/ silly science experiments that they may be too cool for, by that age.Basically, it's complex science w/ silly experiments. My daughter likes doing the experiments, but she doesn't get much out of them because the science is too advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Project Book","review":"I paid extra to receive this book in a few days because my daughter was working on a science project and we needed the book very quickly. I ordered two books that day. The first one I received the next day. This book took almost a week to get here which was way too late and a waste of extra money to have it shipped quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espresso Bible","review":"No matter how much you are into Espresso this book has more information than you could possibly care to know. The writing, research and presentation are impeccable. There are some fascinating facts and descriptions that are sure to make your ability to understand and make better espresso possible. There is however page after page of very heavily technical or scientific data that separate each one of these fascinating facts.Whether you are a roaster or just looking to further your understanding to make better espresso, you will learn from this book. But this book is really written for the \\" coffee scientist\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Caffeine Clout","review":"I liked this book because it makes a good showing on my shelf. People at my house say \\"Akmed, you are a coffee chemist?\\" I say, \\"yes, everything coffee does for me this book can undo. Ever drank too much coffee and can't sleep? This book solves that problem! Sleep for days after reading this book! I did. And you can too.\\" One of my friends borrowed the book just before she quit coffee and died of severe depression. I'm not saying she read the book, but carrying it around seem to have the same effect. I hope everyone with too much time and energy will read this book, as they too will suffer a lingering malaise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling felt set","review":"This Three Little Pigs felt set helps my grandson tell a great story. He loves the story and the set was actually one of his favorite Christmas presents. The pieces are large and durable, with vibrant colors and there are more pieces than I expected. I would recommend this product for any child who loves a story. It helps them use their memory and imagination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refer Standard Deviants","review":"Refer Standard Deviants School - Basic Math, Program 7 - Fraction Basics both are same and Standard deviants price are so cheaper"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read from a great new author","review":"This character driven story provided me with a pleasant escape from the holiday rush! I needed a break from all the pressure I was feeling and when I found this book I planned to sit down and read a few chapters. Several hours later I found myself reading the last chapter and feeling sorry that I was coming to the end of my afternoon escape! I thoroughly enjoyed the main characters, Celia Langston and the Duke of Severly, and the series of events that eventually brought them together. I also enjoyed the secondary plot line revolving around the budding romance of Drake's sister, Imogene, and his close friend, Major David Rotham. Several unexpected plot twists were very satisfying to this reader, and I found \\"A Spinster's Luck\\" utterly charming. I look forward to more from this author whose characters kept me enthralled through the entire book. It was great to find a new author with a unique outlook on the Regency genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting characters in a regency with a twist!","review":"I really enjoyed the characters in this story. This new author provided a good plot with a different twist to the governess meets powerful guy story! I found the book held my interest and I look forward to reading more from Ms. Woodward. I always like to see local authors in the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author needs to learn how to use a calendar","review":"Did not get past first chapter.

If you are at all interested in todays poets and poetry on a wider level, i suggest that you pick up this book immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full-sized eeBoo cards are excellent; the tiny ones are useless","review":"I found a deck of eeBoo cards at a local secondhand shop and the whole family LOVED them. I thought I'd get a set of other card games from the same manufacturer. Unfortunately, when the set arrived, the cards were TINY! My 4 and 5 year olds both had trouble holding them (heck, so did mom and I!), but thankfully returning them was a breeze. These cards are beautifully illustrated and very durable, but the dimensions are not accurate on the amazon page for this and the \\"volume 1\\" sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD label is incorrect: Songs are NOT by these artists","review":"The CD notes indicate (falsely) that these songs are by the original artists. But unfortunately, this disc is just some guy who re-did all the songs. Not sure what the point of that was! But this CD is rather disappointing, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great childhood experience!","review":"This is the kind of book a young girl will remember forever. A great start to a series of special memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic--nope!","review":"The praise on this book is just a bit suspicious, and when I read it, my suspicions were confirmed. A workmanlike piece of juvenile fiction that is dull, formulaic, and not at all \\"classic.\\" Even Nancy Drew is a better read than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The description of this product led me to believe that it was something altogether different.It was not the kknd of music I enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Hard Drive died after 15 Months","review":"Do not buy this sony laptop. It has a sleek design and stylish look but does not have a lot of features and also beware of your hard drive as it dies in little over an year.Sony support sucks and they wont even let me know about the nearest sony support center until they bill me for the time I spoke to their support guy. Their support is also very expensive.Thank god I did not need to spend $750(as per their website) and send my laptop and wait until they fix it, as I got it replaced the hard drive which I bought online for less than $300. Very bad experience with the laptop and their support. My friends who bought Dell and Toshiba for $1300's (cheap when compare with what I spend $2000) around the same time I bought this Sony viao are using them without any problems and good features and great support. On an overall I am not buying any Sony laptop in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like others my disc died after 15 months...","review":"I have the EXP model, which is the same as this model except with Windows XP. I bought it in April 2004, and it failed in July 2005. The hard disc crashed, the machine started up once or twice in SAFE recovery and then would not start, and it said that the \\"config\\" file was corrupt. I have automatic update on my firewall and virus and Windows so I am sure that it was not a virus.Beside, when you read so many other stories about disc crashes and unreliability with SONY VAIOs then you know that you made a mistake with this company. The support centre was worse than useless and when pushed refered me to an \\"authorised\\" dealer who quoted me twice what another city-based data recovery firm eventually charged me to recover the disc. Based upon my experience and what I now see is common with others I would never buy another Sony laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great","review":"I love sony vaio's. I have had this v505ex for a couple of weeks and love it. It is so fast, light. The screen is huge and the keyboard is great. It has a great warranty and sony backs everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"The touchpad is fine. Please read your manual","review":"I have an PCG-V505ECP. The touchpad was a little bit confusing in the beginning but after I read the online manual the mistery is solved. The touchpad actually work both as mouse and scroll wheel. When you slide your finger along the right side of the pad, it activates the scrolling mode. This is configurable if you don't like it, although I agree they probably should put some hint (such as a color strip) on the touchpad so people will aware of it at the first place. The wireless 802.11b works fine for me. I've use it for only a few days but I like it a lot. The battery life almost as good as they described (maximum 6 hours if you don't use any power-consuming features). Also it comes with the support of Java by default. The only thing bothers me is that there are too many trial software (AOL, MS Office 2003 60-day trial) so I need to spend one hour to uninstall them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, Hard Drive Died...beware","review":"Have been pretty happy with this for two years -- lightweight, reasonable performance. I take it with me everywhere.Hard drive gave signs of dying, and finally gave up the ghost this week. I would probably give this three stars because it gave me a relatively useful life, but the Sony support has been very poor. Review sites like this make it clear that hard drive failures are common for this product, but Sony buries and obscures hard drive assistance online. Frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard drive, sound card, CDRW/DVD drive failures...","review":"Purchased for my wife about 2.5 years ago. Not a bad little computer--save for about one year after purchasing the speakers quit working--which Sony fixed quickly as it was still under warranty. Then about 6 months ago the DVD combo-drive began to fail. Most recently, (two weeks ago) the hard drive has failed completely. (with some warning, but I was unable to back up some of the data before complete failure)Bottom line: Wife loved the computer--it was light, small, and had great battery life. However, ours had its share of problems and there are many people who seem to have similar problems with hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine, case scuffs annoying","review":"I love this machine. The one kvetch I have is that the beautiful casing scuffed very easily, and I can't seem to remove the scuffs. Other than that--it's extremely fast, very light, keyboard size and play are great, I have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a cookie?","review":"Sorry, I really didn't care for these cookies. Weird mealy texture, flat taste. I've never met a cookie I didn't like - until now. Couldn't even finish one. I gave them away and the recipients said they tasted like \\"nutrition bars\\". I'd never buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go, Keoki, Go!","review":"This mix album stands out from the crowd in several ways. First off, at a time in which nearly every mix album seems to be trance, \\"Disco Death Race 2000\\" has a much more old-school feel to it. There are a lot of synth bits and samples from the early nineties, and therefore a rawer, harder sound than a lot of today's techno. Keoki's not a stellar DJ, but he does a great job here. He ignores peaks and valleys and instead opts for a smooth, comfortable cruise through techno of a few years ago. If older techno is still okay by you, this is a great mix to pick up.And yes, this mix DOES have the infamous Speed Racer track (\\"Go Speed Go\\" by Alpha Team). It may be cheesy and a novelty, but I really like it. (To win they'll stop at nothing! Let's break that speed barrier!) Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"woah what a cd!1!","review":"if you were to own one electronic dance cd,this is it. this mix is unbelievable. it starts out with some driving psytrance into some banging acid house,then comes the breakbeat,some straight up techno followed by subliminal vocals. keoki really takes you on a journey with this one! his mixing is flawless,showing you why hes one of the greatest djs in the world. this cd is a must have!1! i first heard it in 1996 and it has no problem standing up to the test of time. i still keep it in regular rotation in my cd player. you will not be dissappointed with this mix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, if you want to know how the band began","review":"I wanted to hear the band playing songs, not necessarily a documentary on how the band came together. I stopped playing it half-way through, so I don't even know if any songs were played in their entirety (without documentary-type comments interrupting them) before the DVD ended. If you're into the bands' history, you might like this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"This is a very good book with excellent text for some really neat picture post-cards. Especially liked the ones on the restaurants that are long gone ie Horn and Hardarts......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fresh as in store -- some nuts rancid and inedible","review":"These products are excellent when bought at a local store, but what I got, in spite of being five months from its \\"sell by\\" date, tasted decidedly antique. This was also true to a lesser degree of the \\"Soccorro\\" Macadamia / hazelnut snacks from Sahale. However, the \\"Soledad\\" almonds and \\"Valdosta\\" pecans were excellent, just as are those from the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this Hot Shot a silver","review":"This is a repaint of the original Hot Shot for the ENERGON line (not the ARMADA line). The silver coloring makes this version look much nicer than the old. As a robot on its own, it makes for the perfect transformer; not to hard to transform, but not too easy either, has nice posibility, and a great look. Sadly, neither of its forms in a Powerlinx is that great. In \\"pants\\" mode, his doors/arms are in the way and his \\"shirt\\" mode is unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"More pics of her home and how she's embellished, not my cup of tea. I thought it might give me some ideas, butI haven't looked at it but once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Book but Been There and Done That","review":"I recently became aquainted with the art of Dena Fishbein and love what she does so came to Amazon to see what they had available. I found Embellish Your Home and the price was very attractive so I ordered it. Dena has some fabric and paper goods on the market that are wonderful so I was excited to see what this book would have to offer. I was really kind of disappointed with it. It felt like \\"been there and done that\\" but it is an older book. That would be why it is priced so low. Duh! I enjoyed looking through it and did learn some techniques that could be used in an updated way so it was not a total loss. It was like looking at a magazine that was nice but now you've read it so put it aside for the next trip to donate to charity. If you look at it like that, you won't be disappointed. With the price of magazines these days, it was not priced out of line. The painted furniture was the saving grace to the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Spicer review","review":"I own this cd & recommend it to lovers of stomps, rags & blues, played on trombone, trumpets,clarinet,tuba, banjo, piano & drum. Fifteen selections include, Big Bear Stomp, Where Did You Stay Last Night, Some Of These days, Original Rags, Chattanooga Stomp, Snake Rag, Yorba Buena Blues, Angry, Beale St Blues, Copenhagen, Down in Honky Tonk Town, Someday Sweetheart, East St Louis Toodle-oo, Dallas Blues, & Baltimore. The style is similar to that of Lu Watters, Yerba Buena Jazz Band. I bought the disc to hear Cal Owen play the banjo, but the whole disc is a delight. It was recorded in Jan 1977, and Nov 1979 and the sound is very good. I hope this review is helpful.Jack Spicer"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has become my mantra!","review":"I have now had this book in my life for several months and must reiterate how important this book is for my healing. I highly suggest the passage by John Conrad, Sr. He touches upon the most intimate and least spoken of event: the intimacy of being with your deceased loved one in privacy before the very public event of a funeral. It was tremendously moving...I shall never forget those words. Thank you again, Anne & Mary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read for grieving parents seeking comfort.","review":"There are many good books on the market for bereaved parents, however this book by far outranks the rest. From poetry to prose and other accounts, the book offers comfort to bereaved parents, especially the shared feeling \\"you are not alone.\\" Many parents before me have suffered the loss of children, famous or not, we're all bereaved parents who will always love our children. Thanks to Anne & Mary, what a wonderful book you've shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, compelling, and informative.","review":"This is an extraordinary book. The combination of literary selections and the editors' poignant and personal introductions to the various chapters make a powerful and unforgettable reading experience. This book is not only for bereaved parents. It should be read by anyone who wishes to have a more profound understanding of the way tragedy can affect family, friends, acquaintances, and yourself. Furthermore, one obtains a tremendous insight from this book as to how the creative process of poets, authors, songwriters, playwrights, etc. is inspired and motivated by loss. Finally, the literary selections themselves, which range chronologically from Homer to contemporary writers such as John Irving and Ann Tyler and Eric Clapton\\"s lyrics to \\"Tears in Heaven\\", are keenly illustrative of the complex and multi-faceted aspects of the worst thing that can happen to a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hebrews Through A Hebrew's Eyes: Hope in the Midst ofa Hopeless World","review":"The book is FASCINATING and I am enjoying reading it! However, it isn't handling any indepth study of the Book of Hebrews. It's hard to describe, it deals with the general yet specific issues of Hebrews but doesn't tackle any verse by verse or indept study. This book is more of a personal testimony of the author's embracing of Yeshua. This would be a good tool to give to any Jewish friends who are really searching. Again, it's a fascinating! And I want to read it again and again. I would love to see the author give a more verse by verse study. He'd do a wonderful job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak at best. bunk game save your cash.......","review":"I bought this game for my sons thinking it would have all the monster circuit trucks like grave digger/ el toro loco etc.. but none of those trucks are in the game i think monster jam and ubisoft had some finacial disputes which is a real shame, I spent 27 $ on this game the only good part of it was the location sites, the graphics were the same quality as there last game ubisoft put out. save your money buy the last one older version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"My son and I love playing this game!

I recently bought this book for my daughter. I was disappointed that this 'book' felt more like a finely printed pamphlet consisting of only a few pages stapled together, rather than a children's book with larger and clearer font. It does not have a 'kids book' feel to it - more like a 'rental car contract fine print' version.The story of course, independent of the packaging in this disappointing book, is an all-time classic and a must-read. Kids will enjoy it.

The next day, Rikki finds Nagaina's eggs on the ground and begins crushing all of the eggs except for one. When Nagaina threatens to kill Teddy, Rikki distracts her by threatening to destroy her last egg. Then, Rikki chased Nagaina into her hole in the garden and kills her.

My favorite single from this album would definitely by Thursday's Child, but this 'rock' version retains the cool, relaxing melody while giving a new, somewhat harder edge to it, a very good listen.And then there is the airy, electronic-tinged b-side We Shall Go To Town which sounds like a precursor to the style of Heathen; I think this, along with the other outtakes should've made it onto the album, but you can tell that those songs would compromise the image Bowie was going for in it, still it's not one to be missed.This single obviously could've a bit longer, but considering both tracks are great new pieces of music they most definitely make up for the length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon defective title listing","review":"Mr. Murphy's review is actually for volume 1 (books 1 & 2).

The speaker reads a phrase and you click on a matching picture. There is a lot of repitition which makes it easy to retain the information you learn. There is quite a lot of vocabulary introduced, but not so quickly that it gets frustrating.CONS:The cost of this program is outrageous.

It's best to use the enclosed clip and fasten it to the bill of your hat. It also would serve well as a key-chain light.

The dimmer function is also very handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Keychain Light","review":"This is the best keychain light I have seen. It is tiny, light weight, bright, waterproof (at least to 3 feet), dimmable, has excellent build quality, and comes with a high-quality keychain clip. It basically throws the same light as a Mini Maglight but is a fraction of the size.Do not underestimate the value of the handy keychain clip. It lets you quickly take the light off your keychain and use it by itself. I'm not sure how sanitary this is, but in a pinch I hold it in my mouth for a hands-free light (can't do that with keys attached).I use the light often and run through batteries every three months. Buy theBluecell batteries. At less than fifty cents per battery they are great deal.I also recommend the tinySwiss+Tech Keychain Multi-Tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Switches","review":"Ordered 5 of these suckers.

This is when I realised the first light I got was a piece of junk, a scam. It had no brand name, no clip no functions just a simple ordinary light.

They are not all doing the same thing at the same time, or the same way. The instructions are not clear, especially when talking about proper form, and it is difficult to ascertain proper form by observation,as they are all wearing black.

There is no action in this film. 80% of the film takes place in one room. But having said that, this is a really good film. That has a well written, interesting story, that is enhanced by the performances of the two leads.The story revolves around Dennis's character who wakes up in very sterile hospital setting, not knowing why he is there, why he can't leave, where he is in time, and is his life really at risk.Thanks Dennis another good film.

Denis Leary is quite good in this movie, i would say that it is one of my favorites. A highly underrated actor, Leary pulls off the frustration that would come with people told that the world as he knows it, no longer exists.A slow moving film, but quite engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it Over Yet","review":"I bought this movie because of its four star reviews - but found myself tempted to fast forward halfway through and end the slow slow storyline and low budget misery.

Kudos, Dennis.Beyond that, though, I can't see what others are raving about. The plot-twist was unexpected, but I kept waiting for things that didn't come: more evidence of chemistry between the doctor and Dennis, and SOME evidence of special effects.If you buy this DVD, be prepared for what it delivers: Good acting by one guy and his lesser-light costar, and a good plot twist at the end.Other elements you'd expect-- action, high humor, high tension, SF effects, technology of the future-- are not evident. This is a no-action drama with a plot twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not great...","review":"Ahhh, Bivouac.

His focus is clearly on applying the knowledge of scripture in the life of the reader. Tim presents several commitment levels of study for the reader, recognizing that individual members of his audience will be at different phases of faith maturity. Tim prescribes various approaches to reading the 66 books of the Bible, depending upon the specific interests or needs of the reader. He presents a plan to read, and learn from, the entire Bible within 3 years. This is a terrific guide for anyone who has never been taught how to read the Bible effectively.

Studying the Bible involves more than just reading a few passages now and then and LaHaye shows you how you can carefully and methodically engage yourself in an enjoyable and enriching study of the Bible.When I lead Bible studies, I often suggest others in the class use techniques described in this book to gain further understanding in their at-home studies.Great book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought","review":"The sales pitch for the book made it sound like it was a devotion book for Bible study, exactly what I wanted.

Out of 8 image interpretation questions, I counted only one where the picture matched the question stem and choices. Also, many of the \\"explanation\\" windows for the test questions did not really address why each choice was right or wrong, but just added another piece of trivia about the disorder.

I can't speak for the other Penguin editions, but this volume was a huge disappointment such that I had had enough of it after the first 100 pages and went out and bought an older edition.The five star reviews on here are very misleading as the majority are for the Modern Library edition.

In fact, Sardinia was more a Mediterreans crossroads and has had influences from its North African neighbors and Byzantine traders. Thus, the first track of this anthology song by Rosa Resolza is clearly influenced by Moorish Spain, while the following track featuring the launeddas, a very ancient reed instrument with three pieces, including a drone, sounds Italian. The launeddas sounds like a bagpipe, but there is no bag and circular breathing is used instead. Polyphonic a cappella singing is a hallmark of Corsica, but Sardinia has its own version, essentially a vocal form of launeddas music. Other selections are modern compositions with various world instruments, traditional ballads, and religious tunes. This album is an excellent introduction to the music of Sardinia and its national instrument, the launeddas."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Oversoul Song","review":"Please ignore the rating, but if you listen to the sample the song \\"Nothing Like Tomorrow\\" and really like it, or if you have the CD and really like that song check out the band \\"Supreme Beings of Leisure\\" because it sounds like it is them under a different name.

However, I give the product 1 star because it does not come with an adequate user's manual. It has an extremely light weight 10 page \\"guide\\" that isn't worth the paper it's written on. There was a huge user manual published but Sony has discontinued it, and I can't seem to find one. If you've already used the program, you'll be ok. Otherwise, stick with Acid, the non-pro version.

I'm taken aback that Ms. Bentyne, a perenially exciting performer on Heart's Desire, Foreign Affair, Spies in the Night, et al., seems so uninspired on this solo disc. She brings nothing new to these standards. Nor is her concept, presenting the stages of a love affair as a song cycle, new. It was done far more convincingly by Streisand two decades earlier in Till I Loved You.Even the haunting title track turned out to be less than meets the ear. Its lyrics are not only inane -- Cole Porter, who is represented on this CD, would chortle -- they don't even sync with the melody. Its arrangers have plagiarized note-for-note the opening to the Singers Unlimited version of When I Fall in Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to my collection","review":"Always looking for a new voice.

Iknow it's harder for her to sing since she dances, but I know alot of people who can dance and sing at the same time! And what's this whole thing about trying to make a \\"Young britney and sexy britney\\"?? she is such a contradiction!! Not to mention the in-between-song skits... like the hippy section... what the heck was that all about? I admit I do like some of britneys songs and it seems she does have a good personality, but this concert is not one of her best...

The whole presentation was confusing and didn't make sense. I wish she had better direction and guidance because every performance was weak and watered down. But then again I am spoiled. I have been to countless concerts (madonna, janet jackson, shakira, etc). and I have never seen a concert so poorely done. No wait, there was vanilla ice.

I grew up with Britney five years ago, however she dresses pretty trashy in her concerts. I suggest Christina Aguilera or Mandy Moore because they are more peaceful and relaxing even though I've never seen any of them in concerts. Even though I like Britney a lot, she's very breezy the way she dresses.

Can anybody tell me why no one has done this yet?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing show","review":"I bought this DVD after hearing the top hits from Britney. I think the songs rock. But that's about all. I was ulterly disappointed with the performance from Britney. Let's face it, Britney cant dance. There is *no* rhythm in her steps and all her movement could be described with just one word - rookie. I'm not a dancer, nor a talented star. But I sure can tell you that Britney was simply too clumsy in all her moves. I dont know who was her choreographer, but I do suggest that they see how other top stars perform, like MJ. I watched this on a Saturday afternoon, and for the record, I fast forward 30% of this DVD adn still fell asleep towards the end!! If you're drawn towards britney's songs, I suggest you to stay as it is. Dont look at how she dance nor any of her performance in this DVD. I dont know about the rest of her other DVD, but this DVD of mine is gonna be out in ebay today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....","review":"She calls herself a \\"singer\\"? She was lipsynching the whole way! Why can't she use her skanky abilities in adult performances? Sure, she can move and is a hell of a performer, but the fact that her voice is so feeble is like an insult to talented singers. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!!","review":"I borrowed this DVD to check out the performance (because I already knew she CAN'T sing) and it was a huge disappointment, I was expecting at least good choreographies and a good show, since she never sings, but what I saw was soooooo sad, I've seen her performances on MTV and her videos and those were really well prepared and very well organized (with some great choreographies), but this presentation in Vegas was too sad, the outfits were horrible too, but that doesn't surprise me she always dresses really bad (despite all the money she has). Finally, the sound is VERY GOOD, BUT the tracks that were used on the concert were the same tracks from her album, so if you want to hear her songs then buy the CD, don't spend more money on the DVD is not worth it, at least they should have made a good mix for the concert, not putting the same tracks for her to lipsync."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Concert","review":"This is definately her best concert since she had more hits by now. I really enjoy the different versions of all her songs and the moves. She is a great dancer and although alot of the songs are lip synced it does not matter because i do not know anyone who can dance like that and keep a not. Her voice is shown in Her slower songs. If you really want her to sing you can not see her dance well. Madonna did it, Janet Jackson did it so why not Britney. The concert is excellent and critics need to base it on a professional level not a personal level. Well overall it is very entertaining. Great for a party, to play in the background while you have fun. Buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Very Bad.","review":"This would have to be the worst performance I have seen in a very long time. Britney lip-synced almost every song. Her tired dance moves echoed Madonna and Janet Jackson's early 90's performances.It has been clear to many for a long time that Britney does not have a very strong voice and it is proven here. The songs also seem to all be part of medleys (performed mostly at under 3 minutes). Too much time and money is spent on costumes and set. Basiaclly it's a live music video. Also can't help but be a little confused by the whole 12 year old girl thing for one song and then the grown up wannabe madonna for the next???The show is cheap. The DVD quality is very good. Britney is very bad live (even with pre-recorded vocals) and all the songs seem to have the same beat, same sounds and same formula ( intro / verse / chourus / verse / chourus / bridge-verse / altered chourus / chourus with ad lib / end ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Does anyone else feel like their being force fed this girl? I gave this 2 stars because I love dancing & even thats getting old for her. The same moves again and again...... Additionally, the singing/lip syncing leaves a lot to be desired too. I just don't like singing/pre-recording when it sounds like someones sucked on a container of helium prior to the performance. I'm sure others gave it a better rating not b/c of the singing but for pure visuals or adolesence. To each his/her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"If I wanted to listen to her lip sing I would have just listened to the darn CD. This dvd is a total waste of money. She doesn't sing, just dances around moving her mouth to the music, proving she has no talent other than dancing around in skimpy outfits. I'm not impressed at all. Wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen it all before......","review":"this tour did nothing for me. I won't lie when I say the visuals were appealing to look at, with britney in her cute clothes and stage sets, but she TOTALLY rips off janet jackson with her dancing, style of dress and so forth, so I don't understand why little teenagers like her and won't give ms. jackson the time of day when she's the one who did it better than her. I got a sense of deja vu when I watched bits of this show, I felt that she purposely stole elements from the janet, velvet rope and all for you tours such as the costumes! Janet's All For You Tour, Madonna's Drowned World Tour and even Michael Jackson's 30th Anniversary concert were far more entertaining in 2001, and way more superior than this garbage. This garbage just goes to show that young & pretty stars are given more attention than those who actually have more talent that shines even without all the special effects in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live?? Not Live at all... Spears puts up a kiddie show.","review":"In her Live in Las Vegas get up Britney Spears should be crowned princess of lip-syncing not pop princess. Watching and hearing this is just like closing your eyes and listening to her CDs at home. She maybe live to the sight of eyes but the vocals aren't one bit live in this DVD or any other performance she has ever done. A big fat F on this DVD and this performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Alright, but I Wasn't Impressed","review":"Britney Spears' \\"Live from Las Vegas\\" is a true spectacle. Yes, Britney wows the audience with her dancing, special effects, and filmed sequences, but these are all things I've seen before in many, many shows. Britney does serve her purpose for going out there and putting on a big show, but hearing the backing tracks that play on her CDs in the background and her lipsynching is not very interesting. After a while you get tired of it. Then comes the ballad and Britney tries her hardest to make the audience believe that she is a real singer, but it comes off very forced and almost painful (I'm going by her facial expressions as she sings). I'm not trying to bash Britney Spears, but writhing around on the floor soaking wet is not my idea of a great show - we've seen all of this before from her and others, so it's nothing new and exciting. Like another reviewer stated, \\"She has a lot to learn.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A performer should really sing at a concert","review":"Saw this one on HBO.

The choreographer did a good job, but that doesn't say much about Britney. She has great stage presence and is very appealing on the eyes but it was very dissapointing to listen to a pre-recorded track. I thought Britney LIVE meant we would actually hear her singing LIVE but that wasn't the case, and it really took a toll on the quality of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"So entertaining","review":"The DVD of the Dream Within a Dream tour is so visually beautiful to watch even my family members who aren't Britney Spears fans were watching it. I admit, some of the song redentions were a bit hokey though. At the time, this was Britney's most well produced tour. Beautiful costumes, great dance routines in which Britney puts her heart and soul into, cool special effects, and just great overall energy. At one point, she even takes a break to address the audience and what she says comes from the heart and really shows her sweet personality.This DVD is also family friendly and doesn't contain any of the adults themes that were included in subsequent concert tours."},{"rating":"2","title":"For any Britney Fan!!!!","review":"This is probably one of my favorite Britney Concert specials she did. I really enjoyed this DVD. I would recommend it to anybody! I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it lacked Bonus material, actually it had none at all. I think it would have been a little better with behind the scenes or something like that featured on the menu. Over all I enjoyed the concert. I was glad to add this to my collection.

What i also loved about it was that she remixed her older songs such as baby one more time, oops i did it again and made them much more enjoyable and they WENT OFF!!!! She has lots of energy and LOOKS HOT!! Her choreography is incredible and shows you what britney is really about!! Also inbetween the songs she has the background dancers dance along to club music which also adds to the energy of the show!!!I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this DVD to anyone who wants an uptempo, high energy, highly produced concert to watch.

Well, the sad truth is that you'll never really get much better than a cheap foam surface pad, or maybe just the surface of your desk.What makes the heavy soft pads better than this one supposedly made specifically for optic mice, is that the weight of the pad keeps it firmly in place. This pad is skinny and shifts on your desk frequently. This is not favorable for any application, particularly gaming. Also, the pad tends to warp and become uneven. Pads with grooves in them will cause misreadings in the optics sensors causing your pointer to skip around the screen.Trust me, cheap, 3 dollar pads are better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flimsy disappointment","review":"So many have said they love this pad, I must start by saying my complaints might be unique to my set-up. So, on to my gripes:1) I expected the pad to be much more substantial than it is, it's very flimsy... really thin and flexible, and easily scratched and bent; this really upset me, since I had chosen this pad over another pad which had a sturdy metal back suitable for holding in my lap; and2) I have a Logitech Lasermouse which never gave me any trouble until I started using this pad, but now, with this pad, my mouse-pointer has a tendency to jump or skip all over the screen like crazy at times... I've checked, and the cause isn't a dirty mouse, so I don't know why it acts up only part of the time.The bottom line, at least for me, is I wish I hadn't bought this pad... it's pretty though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Mouse Pad","review":"I really love this mouse pad. It is almost perfectly flat on the desk and doesn't shift around while I'm using it. It almost seems too thin, but it really works great.

This mouse pad cured a lot of my mouse issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falstaff a bit over the top","review":"This is an acceptable rendering of a great opera. From my perspective what keeps it from high praise is that one never believes the characters are real.

We are thus the less likely to watch this and see the flaws withing our own character."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal!!","review":"I just got my Hearthkit and couldn't wait to try it. I whipped up a couple of batches of pizza dough and and set up my hearthkit while it was proofing. Well as they said it took less than 1 minute to assemble the thing. Couldn't be easier. They tell you in the video that it takes about 30 minutes to preheat the item. In actual fact it took almost 1 hour. No big deal except my pizza was assembled and waiting and got soggy by the time the oven was ready. I highly suggest getting a pizza peel if you plan on using this for pizza. Getting it in the oven was the most difficult thing about the whole operation. We kind of threw it in and it got a little (make that alot) mushed but it came out with a thin and crispy crust as good as any I've ever had. I can't wait to try bread and roast chicken!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"19 inch HearthKit Is Discontinued","review":"I haven't used the Hearthkit, although I've ordered it from many suppliers - all of whom are waiting for stock.I finally phoned the manufacturer and was told that the 19\\" size was discontinued long ago. Apparently, Hearthkit does not believe in letting its distributors know that the 19\\" kit is a thing of the past, so orders just keep piling up, and folks are getting angry at their retailers, when in truth, Hearthkit has failed to communicate.If you're lucky enough to be able to use the larger size stone, its still available. This may be a great product, but the company could certainly use some common sense. I wonder how many orders are laying around at Amazon for the 19\\" unit, waiting to be fulfilled. Pretty stupid of HearthKit, huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel","review":"The book \\"Angel\\" presents itself as a romance, yet the courageous Angel character in the book extracts different attention. I enjoyed this book because I feel it delightful to grip my hands on a book that focuses not only on romance, but invites action and insecurity, as if the characters were here in real life. I recommend this book to any person who enjoys reading books with a slight mid-evil day flare and love for a taste of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetfully Sweet","review":"Angel is the perfect example of the under dog coming out on top. I really enjoyed this novel, because the hero, Angel, is everything women have been brought up to believe men should be. He's strong, noble, courageous and very sexy. When he gets out of prison everyone is against him because he was a convicted killer. Though this is the background given to the character, it's hard to believe Angel could kill in cold blood. It comes as a relief at the end of the novel that he really is how we the readers think him to be. He is shown to be a courageous and noble man who went to prison in order to protect his sister. It's a very sweet story in which a hardened \\"criminal\\" is given a second chance at life because of a good woman's love. All in all this novel is a compasionate tale in which good once again overcomes evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, handsome, but not so functional","review":"Headset is comfortable and secure, and the sound received is excellent.

I bought it to use with my Blackberry, but the plug was too small so I bought a converter from Radio Shack. Unfortunately, people consistently told me that the sound on their end was terrible, like I was in a super windy place, even though I was in a completely quiet environment. This could very well be the fault of the converter but I thought I'd give a heads up to anyone who was thinking of purchasing this item for the same use that I did.

It still works but the microphone apparently isn't that effective, as I am frequently asked to speak up. The fact that the over-the-head design also made my head hurt occasionally sent me in search of an improved design. I found this Plantronics under-the-ear headset and thought it was worth trying. After three days, I am very happy. The incoming sound is excellent and adjustable. My voice seems to be heard clearly (also adjustable). The headset is easy to use and very comfortable. Since it's Plantronics, I expect it to last, as they make the headsets used by nearly every call center in America (including one where I worked for many years). In short, I highly recommend this headset, whether it's for your cordless home phone (where I use it) or for your cellphone. Good choice, good quality, good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear Piece Challenge","review":"The earphone/mic works well but the style takes some getting used to. It's an under ear style, rather than over ear. Even after using it several times, it's still a bit of a challenge to get it in place. Once on, it's comfortable and works fine. I use this in a home office and since it's not wireless, it's not feasible to just leave myself tethered to the phone. I'd rather be able to pick it up, slide it on and use it. However, it is too cumbersome to do quickly. About the only time I use it is if I'm initiating the call and have a minute before hand to set it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics MX500C Under Ear Headset","review":"I am on the phone 8 to 10 hrs a day and have been looking for a headset that was comfortable and did not fit over the head. This definitely met my expectations. I wasn't sure at first how I would feel with an \\"under ear\\" headset or how that would even work. It's light weight and easy to manage and sound is crystal clear. I didn't give it a five star rating because the only thing I would change is if it had a soft ear cushion (I think I am describing that right) to fit over the part that goes in your ear. It's really not bad the way it is but I think that would provide more comfort. Either way, I am very happy with the product and if it broke, etc., I would not hesitate to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Mic works very well. I used it while driving, in the house, and while walking the mall. No one has complained they cannot hear me, like they have complained about other headsets I have used. It could be that my hearing is not the best, but the ear mic volume is a bit low for me. I can still hear those I am speaking with, it is just not as loud as I would like. I thought it would be louder than what I can hear when using my cell phone.

Also, it's supposed to be \\"Velour Lined\\", which is NOT. In addition, in two places they forgot to cover exposed metals inside the case, making the guitar prone to scratches.I don't think Yamaha really makes guitar cases.

If they are going to advertise a feature, the product shipped should have it. I wanted the lanyard ring so I wouldn't have to always have a belt and I did not want the metal at the bottom of the belt clip as these have always been poorly made or badly attached and can scratch your belt or anything else they come in contact with. The one shipped is the worse it could possibly be. there is no material to buffer the sharp corner. Very disappointed in AccessoryOne. Fast shipping, but but product not the same as advertised.

This movie is so boring and crappy that I can't think of anyone who could like this. This is NOT a horror movie. This would be accurately described as a \\"dramatic thriller\\". There isn't any gore. Nor is there suspense because the protagonists are never in any danger til the last 10-15 mins. But even then I couldn't feel suspense because the acting and characterizations are so awful that I couldn't feel scared for the characters. I bought this in an 8-horror movie pack so that makes it around 65 cents a movie. But I still think I could have used that 65 cents for something better.

Stone's presentation of faith commitments(variety of Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities) seemed distressingly superficial with a strong preference for a universalist position, i.e. all faiths are many roads up the same mountain. That is always the position of an outsider to faith traditions and so is incapable of shedding any light on the traditions themselves or providing any insight to the readers. This is especially unfortunate because the friction of Jerusalem in this novel is the friction of a variety of faiths and the secular humanist observers. It is bland like Joseph Campbell is bland. Parallels are nice, but in the end don't explain any community's point of view. Unfortunately Damascus Gate is more like your average/mediocre thriller then it would like to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a wordsmith who likes to read his own words!!","review":"A complex, multi-dimensional read that I could not wait to put down. I struggled to pick it up to get through it. At any page I could walk away from it, I kept reading the reviews on the back cover and opening pages to see if I was reading the same book. The writing bogged down enough with intricate detail that did not seem related. The characters came in and out of different scenes almost as though they were not connected. I struggled to complete the book only to be disappointed by an ending that seemed to be retro-fitted to the story with yet another twist. It may be that I have little interest in the geography of that region but the book did little to enhance its image. It seems like a dark, fanatical, intense place to visit or live, always on the edge. A disappointing book for all the positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizzare Tower of \\"Babble\\"","review":"I was a Religion Major in college, and I lived in Israel for a year and a half, and I STILL don't get this book, so if I don't, I have no idea who does. Mr. Stone's portrait of Israel was bizarre, and while I understand everyone has a different experience there, his was completely unrealistic- I question how much time he has actually spent there, as he seems to have no grasp on daily life in Israel or Israelis in general. As another reader indicated, he seems to have gotten most of his information from a travel guide. As for the religion aspect, I could barely follow it, and I studied religion. And the characters? I could have cared less. In fact, I did- I couldn't even finish the book. The professional reviewers were obviously too embarassed to admit that they didn't get it either. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down...","review":"Had high hopes for this novel but was left with overwhelming disappointment. The story sounds worthy - a plot to blow up the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Unfortunately the book doesn't work as a thriller or as historical fiction or for that matter even as literature. The locales seemed like they would be interesting - Old City Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank - places full of fascinating biblical and recent history of which I knew very little. After reading the book still know very little. The characters were cardboard and wooden. Through 500 pages of text I generated no emotion for any of these characters. Muftis, Sufis, Haredim, Shebab...an eternal list of religions, phrases, symbols, and nomenclature that goes virtually unexplained - very frustrating. The only aspect of the book that works is the depiction of the extraordinary tensions between the religions (Jews, Muslims, and Christians) in Jerusalem and Israel. That is not enough to recommend read! ing however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not the only one who didn't like it...","review":"I logged on to see if I was the only reader who did not like this book, or wondered why it was nominated for a National Book Award. I'm glad to see most readers share my two-star views. While I was impressed by Stone's vast knowledge, I found the book clunkily written and difficult to get through. My biggest problem was that I simply did not believe in the characters at all (particularly Sonia and Raz). Does anyone use that kind of hipster lingo anymore?

This is one of the most arduous and tedious books I've read, with excessive and boring detail about everything.

What a disappointment. The plot was hard to follow, thin and choppy without any continuity. The characters were forgettable (if you could remember them at all). It took me forever to finish the book. Worst of all, one has to have prior extensive knowledge of Jerusalem, Hebrew and all of the conflicts going on because there was no explanation of anything.

As far as Damascus Gate is concerned, I found it a jumble of nothingness, appropriate since the protagonist himself is bogged in the quagmire of religious confusion (and never surfaces), that is, the nothingness he professes at the outset is the same that he clings to at the conclusion.

Once there we're treated to a weak story line that seems to be headed somewhere only to veer off course into one of our hero Chris Lucas's childhood flashbacks. Few of the characters, if any, are developed to their fullest, including Lucas. The only character I cared about was Sonia Barnes, although had she met a tragic end I wouldn't have shed a tear. Long, tedious, and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawfully boring","review":"Such drek! If you want to have your spiritual house rocked to its foundation, read THE LAST DAY by Glenn Kleier. Without question one of the most celebrated, controversial, interesting, intelligent and suspenseful philosophical thrillers ever written in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I had two hopes for this book: (1) that it would offer some interest to the religion aficionado in me, and (2) that it would at least make decent beach reading. Unfortunately it failed on both counts. Stone's character's are only hiply \\"religious\\" or \\"doubting,\\" kind of like the black-turtleneck-wearing, Valium-popping, chainsmoking deconstructionist kids I remember from college, and the plot doesn't hang together well enough to be considered a good action novel. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing with a cast like \\"War & Peace,\\" yet nteresting","review":"Having lived in Jerusalem as well as in Palestine and Israel, I am astounded at the detailed and intimate knowledge the author has of Israel, and of the the religious fanaticisms ruling that place and its time. Jerusalem today feels like South Africa in the days of Apartheid, with everyone hating everybody.The most surprising evocation was Robert Stone's use of the term \\"Paskudniak,\\" a Russian pejorat- ive, long out-of-usage, used in this case in the setting of a cafe for old time leftists in Jafo. It was a chiascoro illumination of a vaguely remembered landscape.Even with its impossible large cast, none of which them filled out in depth, the book held me spell- bound, mostly because it triggered so may faded memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"a review, written ala Robert Stone","review":"\\"I thought it was pretty bad,\\" he said airly. \\"How could you?\\" she asked drily. \\"I don't know. Maybe the novel had too much 'schmeiihuqie,'\\" he said, referring to the Babylonian god of pretentiousness. \\"Didn't you read the reviews? All those smart people couldn't be schlemiels,\\" she said. \\"Perhaps it was trahison des clercs,\\" he said, realizing he was in love with her. \\"I think I need a Prozac.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a tedius read","review":"I'm very disappointed in this book. I was looking for action and high drama, and instead, got plodding dullness and monotony. The book could have been boiled down to fifty interesting pages by a decent editor. If you want to see how this type of topic can soar, I would highly recommend the vastly more exciting and rivetting novel, THE LAST DAY by Glen Kleier. LAST DAY is the epitome of an end-times thriller that captures all the insanity, action, suspense and poignancy that GATE lacks. I've read LAST DAY three times and will read it again for its amazing depth and power. Also interesting in this genre is Stephen King's THE STAND, which is a bit light weight compared to LAST DAY, but at least entertaining. which GATE wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone is too enamoured with his vast vocabulary...","review":"Just because you know how to \\"use it in a sentence\\" doesn't always mean that you should... especially if the use of all the grand words one knows interfers with the telling of the story. Stone is too enamoured with his vast vocabulary and thus, alas, the story just does not flow as it might if he wrote as if he were telling us a story rather than composing one. It is too \\"literary\\" and trying to impress with his \\"writing ability\\" rather than \\"storytelling ability\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious junk with incomprehensible character repartee.","review":"This is, perhaps, the most pretentious bit of junk writing I've experienced since my college days. Continued reference to obscure religions, and Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and on words, always in italics, but never with definition or explanation. The repartee between and among characters is effectively incomprehensible because of the language as well as the context. And the plot line is about as muddled as could be, nearly impossible to follow because of the continued introduction of new characters whose presence in the story is never really explained. This is a book I've had trouble finishing and would recommend to no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same author who wrote 'Outerbridge Reach'?","review":"'Outerbridge Reach' was a work of genius (as was 'Children of light'). We peered into charcters' souls and learned lessons through magnificent writing. this is the most pretentious, awful book I've ever read. On page 290, when I still couldn't even visualize a chacter, let alone feel who they are, I quit. I also had no idea of a plot at this point. Here is a sentence that explains how this book is written: \\"To hear Sonia, Lucas thought, was to be close to Shekhinah.\\" What the heck is 'Shekhinah'? Stone name-drops obscure religious terms as if we should kow them. Hey Bob--you may have researched this stuff; we haven't. This his first novel, 'A Hall of Mirrors'. All the spectacular growth and realism of his last 20 years is gone. And it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful!","review":"How could such a fascinating subject be rendered such a dull and dreary read? I read some of the \\"professional\\" reviewers comments here and I wondered if I had read the same book!Reading this book can be likened to trudging on a long journey through intellectual mud- and at the end it is ulitmately an unsatisfying journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I'd heard","review":"This was good stuff. I am a Stone reader but usually do not pass his books along to my friends for fear of depressing them too much. The Bear and his Daughter is an excellent example. I liked Damascus Gate and the questions pondered. Lucas is a typical disaffected Stone character who is just a tad less jaded than most of Stone's creations. There are many characters to follow but Stone keeps them all memorable and all interesting. So far this is the read of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Buy this at once and read it. If you already know Robert Stone (I've read all his books), you'll find this is the best. If you're not familiar with him, here's a great place to start. His Jerusalem reminds me a lot of Phnom Penh, and I have seen his characters drunk beside the Mekong..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of America's best novelists","review":"Compared to the novels of its year, Damascus is one of the best. Poetic, entertaining, and profound, it is certainly a novel worth your time. It may not be as strong as his earlier work, but who else can write like him? As far as I'm concerned, the only writer who can beat Stone at his own game is Denis Johnson. (Stone is the better technician and has more consistency---but Johnson's flaws produce moments of genius that other writers lose through caution) Damascus is a beautiful shadow landscape that has more in common with desire and subconscious, than it does with the rational or mundane. The virtuosity with which it is told brings clarity and wonder to even the darkest corners of the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damascus Gate","review":"PLEASE tell me where is Ethan Hawke reading this audio book?

Only thing is I noticed that I was getting pimples. I have been lucky enough not to have had acne; just the occasional pimple every now and again.Once I started using this serum though, I noticed that I was getting several pimples - almost every day. The only thing I had changed in my regimen was the serum so I conducted my own (kinda) control experiment. I stopped using the serum and went back to my regular moisturiser. No pimples. Started using it again, pimples.I've stopped again and decided to give it 2.5 stars because while I was using it, it did make my skin feel great.

One doesn't need much. And it lasts a long time. UPDATE: After using this for almost 5 months, my face started getting red spots. I discontinued use and the spots disappeared.

I was a little concerned that he didn't have \\"wings\\" and could not 'fly' but my 3 year old paid that no mine. He mentioned it once when he first opened the box but that was the last time. You see, our Buzz does fly. My grandson holds him high in the air and off they go.He has dropped Buzz, thrown him and even accidentally stepped on him and nothing has caused Buzz to stop working. He talks, he has a cannon that lights up and he comes equipped with all the correct noises. He is indeed a well constructed toy and will probably last for years.I highly recommend this product.

The story line, which moves along briskly, does not get bogged down in superfluous deep scholastic detail and thus maintains the interest and attention of the listener.

The book begins by looking at an oasis from a distance and detailing some common desert animals and phenomena as we move closer to the oasis itself. Once inside the oasis, author and illustrator show the inhabitants of the oasis, from fauna to humans. Every two page spread contains two concepts detailed in two stanzas and picked up in the illustrations. Each stanza begins with the phrase \\"This is the place...\\" which becomes wearisome, especially during a read aloud. The illustrations are colorful and appealing, making up for the text's deficiencies. The book serves well as a basic introduction to oasis living, but might inspire more questions than it answers. A short glossary at the end of the book expounds upon common desert names and terms, but still doesn't compensate for the slight, strained text of the bulk of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amamzing tale of the African Baobab tree","review":"This book is an amazing story of an African Baobab tree through the seasons.

Legs come in two pieces that must be assembled with the pre-installed screws. However, because of the lack of precision in installing the screws by the manufacture, most legs when put together come out crooked. Also, the plastic gold rings are susceptible to breaking during assembly. Though the table looks good at a distance, it naturally is top heavy (stability issue) and upon seeing it closer the crooked legs become quite noticeable. Maybe the poor manufacturing is due to the XMAS holidays and a rush job for sales. Nevertheless, would not purchase this again.The remedy for the poorly manufactured table legs would be to buy one-piece wooden legs with screw assembly. That way, the crooked leg issue becomes a mute point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay on my Porter Cable Sander","review":"I also had problems with these staying on my Porter Cable Sander.

They were absolutely on the money!! It was simple, so very simple, to follow the basic body movements with the accommodating and accompanying foot placements. The book was certainly cheaper than even a group class but more importantly much more convenient. The author, Jeff Allen, correctly states in the book, \\"read my book aloud and you have the feeling of having me right in the room with you.\\" We already owned the all time favorite party song Hot, Hot, Hot, the author suggested to use as our first Merengue and once we caught on the rest of the evening was spent with Merengue and Sangria.

What a disappointment! Not only does this book take the reader for a moron, but it is poorly written, poorly illustrated and overall very unprofessionally designed. It gives the impression that a student took notes while Mr. Allen was teaching and thought that was good enough for publication! I have been looking for a good book on social dancing, to no avail so far. I am used to software books that include a CD and such a presentation would seem a natural for a book on dancing. I could envision a book with a CD of clearly \\"tempoed\\" music, maybe with a few minutes of the teacher counting the beats at the beginning of each track. Is that so hard?

The introduction to Swing dancing and movement skills in general found in Quickstart to Social Dancing are outstanding. The leg actions taught are right on the money, teaching the student to acheive a great center of balance.We have plenty of Latin dancing down our way and I have been drawn in by these tantalizing rhythms. The basic development of Merengue, Rumba (makes Salsa very easy to learn since it's just quicker with many of the same steps), and Cha-cha presented in Quickstart are equally as good.I highly recommend this book and then move on to Mr. Allen comprehensive Swing book called Quickstart to Swing its a Swing dancers bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non dancers will remain non dancers if they read this book","review":"This book is a total waste of time for anyone wanting to learn social dancing.

The tape instruction and the local instruction matched perfectly. This book, Quickstart to Social Dancing, has a nice introduction then finally begins with foxtrot instruction on page 47. This is where I downgrade the book. The foxtrot half box steps suggested in this book do not even come close to matching the tape foxtrot instructions or the instruction in our local dance classes. One would think that a dance like the foxtrot would have universally recognized steps. I fault the book for not mentioning that their instruction is different.It is my conclusion to learning to dance takes practice, practice, practice. No matter.

In an effort to cultivate their friendships one of the ladies decides the group should work on a church cookbook. We get introduced to a little bit about each character's lives, but I felt that the author just scratched the surface and there wasn't a lot of substance.

The music borrows from celtic, folk, classical and pop to come up with the kind of songs that you fall in love the first time you hear them and yet they are not quite like anything else out there. The pipes and strings give it that celtic feel while Jayne Ellison who sounds more then a bit like Madonna (on a very good day) gives them a pop feel. There is not a looser on the album, but I particularly love Brenton Drums which alternates betweeen sounding like a pop tune and a theme for a Movie about the American Revolution which tells the tale of a girl who cuts her hair and disguises herself as a boy to search for her missing lover and a trio near the end Benediction, Sanctus, and Coventry Lullaby which all have the sound of Church music in the tradition of Bach and Handle but with a decidely pop edge. Now stop reading these review and order your album so they will put out another one real soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Soul-soothing","review":"I bought this CD based on the reviews for it, and am thrilled with it! The songs are all lovely and make an excellent background for working, cooking, driving, or any of my other daily activities. In particular, I find it soothing on those especially exasperating days we all seem to have. It is inspiring, and the vocals on it are also quite beautiful. I think my favorite songs are Spin the Circle Down and Come Silver Moon, both of which are rather slow, dreamy songs. I highly recommend this CD, it has barely left my CD player since it arrived, and the more I listen to it, the more I find to love about it. If you like soft, ethereal celtic music, I think it will be one of your favorites, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Gem","review":"I read the reviews here and decided to try this CD.

Both side arm-hinges were for the same side of the cargo box so we couldn't use them.(3) The edge-hinges were very difficult to attach, and it took two of us to do it.Even if we had the right hardware to assemble the cargo box, I would not trust it to stay closed while driving over 50 MPH down the highway. My suggestion to anyone interested in buying a cargo box is to buy a more substantial box (heavier) and ideally one that is already assembled! Don't buy this one.Post Script: When we took our son to college, we squeezed everything into the car and did not use the cargo box. When I got back, I dis-assembled the cargo box and returned it for a full refund. It was a pain to re-pack it but the Amazon process for returning items was excellent!

How it made it through the Thule assembly process is amazing, obviously nobody looked at it before shipping it. The hinge looks like it is installed at the factory and is not something that I could install if they sent me one.I have seen a few other reviewers of this product complain of the same problem.Amazon took the unit back, paid for shipping, and refunded my money. The return was very easy, all I had to do was go to the \\"orders\\" section and click on the \\"return\\" option. Amazon handled it all, I didnt have to contact UPS or anything.

Whether you care or not, a presidential campaign once again is becoming a frenzy of speculation and possible scandal over something that may have happened decades earlier in a candidate's personal life. Decisions are made about how much to tell, how much to reveal, how much to hold back. By the candidates, by the reporters who cover them. Their lives can be changed by what they choose, and the nation's life can be affected as well. Want to know what it feels like inside? Read Reed Karaim's book. A compelling and often suspenseful tale, it takes you inside a fictional campaign to watch how these characters of politics and the press dance with one another and around one another and how their histories and values guide their decisions about truth and deceit. One revelation of my own: I am a friend of Karaim's. I am also a political writer, and I know a terrific book when I see one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\" If Ever There Was One","review":"I don't write many reviews anymore; it seems a tedious, unrewarding exercise.

Billy Collins, for example)(Not to knock those two giants; they've both had moments of perfect lucidity.). Still, they are playful and provoking, and the language is completely acrobatic.

But, it is detailed enough that the brain does not have to fill in the blanks of information not included as is the case with many such books. There is a section that addresses a method of exposure form a more \\"right brain\\" view and draws on the experience of using a light meter for photographers who are at that level.I do not believe how well written this book is compared to others dealing with the same subject.

The characters lack profoundity, and I soon tired of them, because they were so nondescript in personality (other than glitz and glamour) that I lost all interest, given also the oblomovian lack of emotion they display whatever happens to them.

It just didn't catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Kudrow is Dandy!","review":"I've read all 6 volumes of Tales of the City by Armistead Maupin and recommend them to anyone who enjoyed Misadventures in the 213. Dennis Hensley has clearly read his Maupin and has fashioned '213' in a similar style. I couldn't put this book down (like all 6 volumes of Tales) but I have to admit I started feeling like a Valley Girl the more I read it. If Hollywood comes around for the film rights I have 4 words: Lisa Kudrow is Dandy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wacky story of 2 L.A. friends","review":"This book is one crazy mishap after another! Dandy and her best friend Craig are constantly running into celebrities. Not to mention making dumb mistakes like getting stuck in Disneyland over night. It doesn't have a very deep story to it, but very funny at times. I wouldn't say it was the best storyline. If you are looking for a deeper novel pass this one over."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely entertaining read!","review":"I am an avid reader and no other novel in recent memory has made me laugh out loud like Misadventures in the 213. It is the perfect mix of wit, satire and honesty. Dennis Hensley is an enormously clever talent. While the plot is, at times, outlandish, the characters are so likeable and quirky that the reader is easily able to go with the flow and appreciate the constant chaos that takes place throughout. If you're a person with an open mind and an interest in pop culture don't miss out on this literary treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out-loud funny!","review":"This book succeeds where so many other comic novels do not: it is actually funny. Very funny. You will laugh out loud at these characters and their outrageous adventures, one-liners and off-the-cuff remarks. Much better than other silly comedies like Glamourpuss or Hello Darling ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Entertainment [Hopefuls]!","review":"Remember that television series from a few years back about Jennifer Grey trying to make it in Hollywood? This book is everything that show wasn't: clever, hilarious, satirical, and--dare I say it?--insightful. It's all about trying to make it in the insane entertainment industry of Los Angeles, and the tone is frothy and superficial, exactly like Los Angeles itself! Hensley shows us the city and the industry from the inside, and he's clearly a fan. Unlike Hensley (and Randy Newman), I hate L.A. But I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss the joke and Character development?","review":"I really like entertainment books and LA lifestyle. This one missed the mark. In fact, I kept struggling to finish it and was very happy to move on to my next book.I didn't find the jokes overtly funny although there is some that are humorous. ON the bright side, the character development of Dandy is over the top and funny. The lead character's love life is casually developed with no real conclusion. Most of the other characters are just not funny.Maybe I'm too old to get it. However, \\"Word\\" by Felske is a much better read of the Hollywood lifestyle. I also found \\"California Screamin\\" a better read than this one and it really qualifies as a gay romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely entertaining!","review":"For someone who lives in Hollywood and works in the business, it was a delight to read such a sprite and cheeky book. Dennis Hensley has a great talent for capturing the heart of a character and weaving in a fun line of sarcasm and wit. What makes the book such fun to read is not just the smart portrayal of the characters, but also the interaction and \\"walk-ons\\", if you will, of various celebrities. Because truly, we all get a kick out of dirt and gossip, and Mr. Hensley offers some rather unique situations for us to revel in. (I'd keep my eye on my koi pond after reading this!)Above all, Misadventures... tells a story about friendship, set in one of the wackiest towns in the world. Great characters, great writing... What more do you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny book by a very funny writer","review":"This book made me laugh out loud, something I seldom do when I read, no matter how funny the content. The way the author uses contemporary pop references and wry commentary makes for effective pictures in my mind of what is going on, and adds greatly to the humor of the situations he describes. My only regret is what happens toward the end with Craig and Godfrey -- though it does provide the book with some bittersweet poignance."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're gonna pee your pants!","review":"\\"Misadventures\\" had me rolling on the floor! As a former El-Lay resident, the characterizations and descriptions were so true-to-form! Dandy, Craig and their wacky friends will endear themselves to you so quickly that they'll seem so real you'll swear you know them. It's quirky and hilarious, along the lines of Robert Rodi. Armistead Maupin wishes he was this funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries but fails","review":"This novel reads like something a fourth grader wouldproduce. The characterisations are for the most part OK but theirdevelopment is hampered by immature dialogue and laughable situations. Some of the comedic scenes do provoke a laugh especially Dandi's escapades on Politically Incorrect with Bill Marr but generally the humour falls dreadfully flat. Maybe Hensley is really only trying to impress us with his knowledge of the local LA scene... who knows! There is also no story and the episodic structure it pretty mundane as it has all been done before. This is supposed to be a funny book which is really unfunny. Maybe it would make a better cheap, prime time sitcom. I couldn't even finish it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb discussion of Aristole","review":"Well written, balancing general discussion, review of critical discussion, and detailed examination of specific passages.

I find it unpleasant and unnatural, stilted and hard to listen to, jarring to the ears. Too much money for a cheap product, which isn't even nice. I much prefer the less expensive, but far superior TES 'Navigating the Bible 2' program, as a real chazzan is singing the passages, and the program is extremely easy to load and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SINGLE !","review":"Stephen's first solo single is great !

Roberts gives a narrative of human history starting with evolution through the end of the 20th century -- and manages to do it in 15 chapters that average a little over 30 pages apiece. The result was that I was able to absorb the broad sweep of history in a little over two weeks.The main caveat of this book is that its title may be somewhat misleading. Roberts's focus is very much on Western history, although to be fair, in the introduction he a) acknowledges this and b) makes a case to justify it -- so I don't think he's trying to sneak anything past the reader.So if you can accept that it is quite Western-focused, it really is a great book. I basically felt that I was able to cover all the history I should have learned in school but didn't in a little over 500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be sold with aspirin.","review":"I may actually know less about world history after reading this book than I did before. The author has removed all the excitement and pure narrative power of human history and reduced it to a weaving, confusing, incongruous listing of names and dates. In addition to being an unrepentant anglophile, he seems to feel that a culture can only be as valuable as its metallurgical advancement, droning so much that one expects his work would be produced in a hive and not a publishing house. This book is also printed in an eye-straining font, which only serves to increase the pain-inducing effect of the words themselves. I can only shudder when reminded that this was the \\"short\\" version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is using very antiquated racial theories.","review":"I am sad to see the \\"hamitic\\" hypothesis is alive and well after reading the first sections of human history here, and to see the author claim that the Sumerians were \\"probably caucasian in root\\" (43) According to Matthew Frye Jacobson's very good book, Whiteness of a Different Color, the \\"caucasian\\" racial category was cooked up some time in the 1920s and has no scientific basis. The naturalizing of racial categories in this book is disappointing, and I am sad to see that a book using them received such uncritical reviews from such respected publications as The Economist and the Christian Science Monitor. As an antidote to this version of world history, I'd suggest a little Basil Davidson and Martin Bernal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, Unbalanced, Filled with Errors and Hard to Read","review":"The title of this review sums it all. This book only benefits from a catchy title that gets the attention of people looking for a good book to get a flavor of the world history. You buy it and every few months you give it a stab and you finally leave it on the shelf for good thinking the world history is a tough subject to get into.The biggest problem is that it is very boring and difficult to read. No pictures, maps or timelines, all text, tight font, arcane British English and worst of all it moves from one topic to another randomly.How much does this book say about the greatest empire of the ancient world, the Persian Empire? Very little.I m looking at A History of World Societies by McKay, it has errors and has some issues but it is laid out beautifully, reads fluidly with great maps and timelines and is a page turner. Makes you love history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for \\"A short historyof the World.\\"","review":"Thank you for sending the book so quickly; I would definitely buy from yoy again; the book was in mint condition, and you sure know how to make someone feel appreciated; again I say, thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"A Short History of the World definitely has a slant to it. The author calls the French and Indian War the Seven Year War. I think it would've been easier to use the French and Indian War, afterall there's been only one French and Indian War in the history of the human race-- there's been countless wars that have lasted seven years and can be called a Seven Year War.Furthermore, he even uses outdated names for mountain ranges and countries. He mentioned a range in America that I couldn't find on a map-- I think he was referring to the Appalachians or Rockies, but I'm not sure. Plus he uses the term \\"Anatolia\\" instead of Asia Minor/Turkey. I've never heard \\"Anatolia\\" used before, but then I don't have a PhD in history.Lastly, this book is boring. Basically he says a lot about nothing. It rambles. I finally finished it after three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Content, Poor Form","review":"There is no doubt that Roberts knows his history, and he has performed admirably in reducing the epic content to some 500 pages or so, but nonetheless I found his writing style tedious and cumbersome. Robert's sentences are disjointed and liberally populated with unnecessary commas. I often had to reread a paragraph because of some parenthetical remark that seemed placed specifically to disrupt the reader's flow of logic. I also felt that his history was slightly biased in favor of Britain, inasmuch as they often appeared to be the heroes of world history, but any history is bound to be biased on some level. In the end, I think you could find a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summary of the history of people; sentence structure hard to read in places.","review":"When many people think of reading a book about the entire history of mankind, many would think the book would be heavy, hard-to-read, and boring. This book is none of those things. The writing is almost conversational and moves along quickly. The range of information and effort to touch on events around the world is commendable.My one \\"negative\\" is that I struggled now and then with the sentence structure of the writing in some places. I am not sure if it was a problem with the editing or if it was written in a style which did not \\"flow\\" for me, but I found that I had to re-read sentences occassionally to \\"make sense\\" of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable...","review":"I was looking for a good overview of world history and many raved about this Oxford professor's one-volume \\"History of the World.\\" Problem is, even for a reasonably educated person like myself (I have an advanced degree), Professor Roberts' writing style was so cumbersome, tortured, and convoluted that I had to re-read passages several times. Occasionally, passages still made no sense, or were so vague as to be equivical, after re-readings. I'm sure Professor Roberts was a good teacher and knew a lot. But none of this amounts to a hill of beans because his writing is so terrible. A much better one-volume history, in my view, is William McNeill's handbook on the History of Western Civilization (although its emphasis is on the West)."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it","review":"I'm really confused as to why amazon keeps recommending me books for a middle school age reading level!With the plot this story could have been really good.

When she recieves a letter from her sister (in the first 2 pages), she is upsetted, and does not want her sister to be alive.But when Jazz shows up at the door, Sunny believes that this is not really her sister at all, but that maybe Jazz had hired somebody else to impersonate her.Well, my thought is this: wtf, wat kind of person wouldn't know if someone were her sister or not? wow, this book is so unbelievable, definently for people from ages 10-12 maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"a confusing disappointment","review":"I was very impressed with Shattering Glass and had looked forward to DGDWL, but after having read the ending three times, I just don't understand what happened.

Maybe I'm still not sure, but there are a lot of things in life that make me wonder, question, and those are the most interesting. I'm still talking about it. And that's Giles' whole point, I think. Or at least a big part of it. How well DO any of us really know what's going on in someone else's head? An excellent choice for book groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and chilling","review":"Scary, funny, and poignant, this tightly written mystery is another winner by Giles. The Reynolds family is overjoyed to welcome their missing daughter home. Everyone but the girl's sister, Sunny, who has good reason to wish she'd stay gone.

This album i see was put together to try to put some songs on the market, compared to his past releses (Disco Death Race 2000, all mixed up) that flowed through most of the time not even leting you know where the song changed. But a must whene makeing mix tapes for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been entitled \\"History of the Vietnam War.\\"","review":"This book provides a fascinating, chronological look at the history of the Vietnam War. As a quotation reference, however, it is next to useless. Unless you know who you want to quote, or are willing to read the book cover-to-cover, you aren't going to find what you're looking for in this volume. I own a substantial number of quotation books. Some are easier to use than others, but this is the most difficult in my collection.If you want to capture the year-to-year history and thoughts of the Vietnam War, buy this book.

I feel that the author did not tell the story as in the fashion of other good authors. There are incomplete sentences that make one have to reread the sentence to get the jist of that emotion. I, for one, feel that this book is not anywhere near or close to the other crime stories that I read. I would have to read another book by Miss Chew before giving a true explanation of her work. I have read the other reviews which tend to say the opposite of what I say but people are different.

Secure seems to have less toxic properties and it holds well enough, although I think it may wear off a little more quickly over the course of the day than other products. But it will definitely hold well enough to get you through a couple of meals and it is definitely much easier to remove when you go to clean your dentures. The taste is much less pronounced as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 second rule","review":"I have a 2 second rule, if it causes pain in the first 2 seconds you use it, you probably shouldn't be using it. Although the product brags to have a special ingredient list that makes it impervious to saliva or other liquids allowing it to hold all day, the ingredients used began burning my mouth the second I put my dentures in. I never was able to test for its staying power as I had to remove them after just a couple minutes as the burning sensation became to much for me. I am not sure if it is a sensitivity to a specific ingredient in the product or just the combination of ingredients. But to say the least I wasted my money on this one and am still trying to find a good natural adhesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I really expected","review":"This stuff doesn't work any better than fixodent, I would have sent it back but didn't want to spend any extra money on shipping it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try this product.

After first application, my upper denture stayed in place for three days due to the suction of my palate so I no longer use it on top. However, my lower dentures do not stay in place for anything like 12 hours. In fact, polygrip or fixodent work just as well on the bottom and I carry a tube of fixodent in my purse for \\"repairs\\" after eating or drinking (hot or cold) outside my home.

First, the pocket is pretty much useless. It clings to the bib itself and doesn't catch half the food... even when it does, it's hard to get it out. It makes it very hard to clean these bibs sort of putting them in the laundry. Plus I used dish soap and let them dry out for a long time but one of the bib started to have black mold stains, and even cleaned that way they end up stinking after a day. Then, even with the little sleeves, my 16 month old managed to pull it off right away, so unless you can watch your kid like a hawk when he's eating, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Piece Of Cinema","review":"I enjoyed a lot of the good moments to this film, although the audio track was really distorted on the DVD, maybe its my crappy TV, but the audio sounded horrible, I'm sure it wasn't the intent of the director, for it was a really cool movie for being made in 2 days on a budget of 75 bucks. I will recommend this to hardcore gore hounds and 70s film lovers, but if you cant handle your stomach, you might get grossed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imprudence","review":"What to say about a film that is destined for cult status? I can honestly say that I did have a good time at the premiere at the tivoli, and I have enjoyed the DVD. There were some really sick parts in this movie, some of them I had to turn away at. Blake, this was an interesting movie. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"bad movie\\" ever made.","review":"This was probably the last great cheesy film to come out of the 80's. Any time it's on, I feel compelled to watch it through to the end. Far worse and more obscure films have been released on DVD, so why not release this one? I actually purchased the VHS several years ago. But this film would be a prime candidate for one of those 80's themed DVD 2-packs. Maybe they could sell it with \\"Adventures In Babysitting\\" and call it a George Newbern double-feature. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This movie is a top dollar fine.

To my opinion it's unethical to sell this CD's at such an high price AND without informing possible buyers of the facts. DON'T BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just Chanukah music - excellent CD","review":"I've owned this CD for a couple of years. My children light up like a menorah on the eighth day of Chanukah when I play the CD. It's got an excellent mix of songs in Hebrew, Yiddish, English, and even Ladina, a language rooted heavily in pre-Inquisition Spanish.In addition, there are songs for Pesach, Purim, Rosh Hashanah, Simchat Torah, Shabbat, along with traditional festive songs, including a selection by the great Mandy Patinkin. It's a perrenial mainstay in our household. It has enhanced my sons' interest in Judaism, and helped their self-confidence in Synagogue, as they recognized a number of songs from the CD.This is no hokey kid's CD, either. Some of the tracks have familiar tunes, and the beauty and depth of others is stirring for even the most casual of lantzmen.This CD makes a great gift for Jewish parents, grandparents, etc. Have I mentioned that I like the CD? Trust me, I don't throw five-star reviews around. This one is a five-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Classic or Not ?","review":"I used to watch this cartoon ever since I was a little kid,I had a great time with this one,but it's very hard to find anywhere.It's a good thing I had found the right one on amazon.com and in good condition too.This cartoon was made by animated director Bill Melendez,the creator of Charlie Brown cartoons.This is a mixture of three of Gilbert & Sullivan's operettas such as H.M.S Pinafore,The Pirates of Penzence,& The Mikado.It tell the story of a secret agent{Dick Deadeye}who Searches for a unknown stolen document called the ultimate secret.In my opinion,this is the most hillarious musical cartoon that you have to see for yourselevles I wonder if they going to remake this classic cartoon on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a vacation from your easy chair","review":"I originally bought this because I had heard about Aaron Cometbus and wanted to learn more about his life and 'zine. I really enjoyed the stories about his travels by Greyhound Bus. I wish I had figured out his method when I was younger and single!

Good stories, good comics, well worth the money.I liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A SUPPLEMENT NOT THE REAL BOOK!!!","review":"At least three of the Amazon listings for this book, including this one, fail to mention that it is only a supplement or appendix.

I highly recommend this enduring classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroscape Castle","review":"The heroscape castle expansion pack is one of the newer sets for Heroscape. In it you will find bases, walls, battlements, ladders, wall walks, and a doorway. Building the castle is one of the coolest parts or it. Although one castle is in the instruction book, you can spend hours building your own design. Once you get to play time however, you will find that the door is very hard to take out, and it is hard to take over the castle since there is no siege equipment.But that's not all. With the set you can make little towers for archers, and the ladders are incourperated nicely into the main game. Overall the castle is very enjoyable set and a worthy addition to herscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best heroscape toy so far","review":"Heroscape is a great strategy and fantasy game. In this great expansion, you can use towers and walls to create castles (and walls). I think this is the best heroscape set so far and can't wait to see what else they'll come out with in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great expansions for a GREAT game!","review":"Heroscape is such a great game for it's simplicity, replayability, and originality. I play this every opportunity I get. The Castle Walls and Frozen Tundra expansions for the game are awesome and add so much more dimension to the base game and the overall look of the playing field. The total experience of playing Heroscape is just plain fun! I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good 'battle' game. Simple enough to play with your kids, while also providing the tactical and strategic complexity to satisfy deep-thinking adult gamers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition","review":"This is a very nice addition to the base Heroscape set. My son built a board using the wall and we played three or four very basic scenarios using the same layout (swapping players in and out) over a 6 hour period. There are rules for taking control of or destroying the main door and there are ladders inside the fortress for climbing, which work suprisingly well with the figures. I was very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome addition to any Heroscape collection","review":"This is a great addition to any Heroscape collection. The ability to add a CASTLE to the gaming environment is just way too cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaseline & a small screwdriver","review":"i found these pieces a little hard to put together but using a small screwdriver & some Vaseline helped with the stickier pieces. after that, it was fun to assemble.the actual castle takes up some board space & i'm not sure how useful it is in actual game play but it looks cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"it is a great part to have for heroscape it just ads more to the hole battle part and it gives you a strong hold to have when playing with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroscape Fan","review":"I can't wait until this comes out!It's suposed to have over 100 pieces and 4 ladders and a door!I think that it would be fun to get at least 2 so that you could build a bigger fortressbecause even though there is over 100 pieces,it's not all that big as you might think it is.But,besides it's size,it should be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroscape Wall and Tower Set Review","review":"A much needed expansion set for Heroscape, very well done and for the low price worth it! Only one flaw: the pieces are hard to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in the negative portrayal of the children and the teacher in all the pictures. Each page contained a picture of the same boy with his finger stuck up his nose along with various other bad behavior from students. The teacher's expressions clearly showed her lack of control. This book was not a positive portrayal of kindergarten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glitch Sandwich With a Beat","review":"This is a solid album, great beat, good package, engaging entrancing sound. Excellent introduction to several artists that I hadn't heard of before - well worth your money.Genre mix of glitch, experimental, and a house beat. Don't let the house reference scare you off. This is music at the edge of the movements we've been seeing for the last year or so, but as several recent albums have - a beat is sneaking in.This CD (published by Force Inc) has 12 tracks by relative unknowns: akufen, steve beaupre, orazio fantini, crackhaus, jetone, mitchell akiyama, jeff milligan, suna, deadbeat, mike shannon, mateo, murphy, eloi brunelle.The insert has got some brief bio's and web address for the artists. Making it easy to find out more about the artists you dig.To sum up - this album is worth your money. Its glitch experiment with a beat. You can drive to it, practise your breathing to it or just zone out and let the music take over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a good book","review":"Someone had torn a page out of the book. It was a page with picture on bot sides, not a good idea being that was a big part of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not tighten--don't buy","review":"I've tried using a slightly different model (635-011) of this on two different occasions. The blade simply will not seat securely and tighten enough into the handle to work. Trying to tighten an Andersen door handle was an exercise of frustration. I could not get this screwdriver to hold--the handle would turn, while the blade would not. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly organized and pointless","review":"I had to buy this book for an obligatory masters course. I have kept most of my textbooks, but this one was awful! It is so horribly organized. It rambles in such a way that it is impossible to understand what the author's point is and where the topic is heading. Useful kindling, at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice flow","review":"I bought this to connect to a 3/4\\" hose that feeds right from my water line from the water co.

Pattern was nice from :mist, jet, and flood, then it broke. The plastic threads inside broke, and it was completely unusable for me. I returned it. Too bad, because I really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"It's awfully hard to find anything to dislike about this nozzle. That is, until you leave it attached to the threaded brass coupling seemingly found on every garden hose. I found that three weeks was all that was needed for the nozzle's aluminum coupling to forever fuse to the garden hose's brass coupling. Result? The nozzle is now junk and the new garden hose needs a coupling repair kit. I don't understand Nelson's (Goodyear's, et al) logic unless it was the few pennies they saved by using the cheaper aluminum instead of brass. Accountant-driven engineering apparently in play here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Buy It Again","review":"The plastic nozzle threads broke and it fell apart after less than 6 mos of use. It was already too late to return or it or I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic internal parts","review":"Good pattern range but these did not last very long.

Glenn gregory has an unmistakable voice which just destroys everything around today, and H17 just continue to produce perfect electro-dance music. the sound is much more polished than the early days, and they do sound different - but its a good different. they've even squeezed in a cover of don't fear the reaper - i normally hate covers but i reckon this would make a great single. Go on buy it - you know you want to!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Are Back - You must buy this album!","review":"As an avid fan from the earliest days of H17, this is a real back with a bang album... sensational! If you liked the ground breaking Penthouse & Pavement album of the early 1980's... this is ground breaking for the current decade. The true roots of H17 synth-pop style music are not cast aside. This album feels very modern and will not leave any listener disappointed. Glenn Gregory's vocals are still as stunning today as they were 20 years ago and the album certainly lives upto the BEF 'music of quality and distinction' marque! Truely inspiring for the synth-pop devotee!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!!","review":"I loved this book!!! I have never read one where I laughed as hard as I did in this one.

This duel cd collection took my parties by storm and still to this day it remains one of my favorite solid mixes to throw in the player. Carl Cox put together a fine collection of tight sounds and this hookup is hands down of his best. If your looking for good old school techy sound don't leave this out of your collection ;)Dj Mordredd........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good -- even great -- tracks, but...","review":"I kept reading things that said, basically, Carl Cox is the greatest techno DJ in the world. So I had to buy this album.I just don't see where the acclaim comes from. The guy throws down some fat wax, for sure (at least on disc one). But the transitions from track to track are pretty consistently ragged. If I were a club owner, and some kid off the streets gave me this as a demo disk, I doubt he'd get the gig, because the beat matching just doesn't cut it; the mixes consistently strain to stay in sync.If this were a live set, I could understand. But the liner notes say that he cooked the FACT 2 collection up in a studio. I just can't imagine putting out a CD that isn't perfect if you're not trying to record a live set. And it ain't perfect.If somebody told you that Carl Cox is the best techno DJ in the world, and you're looking for evidence, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"really like disc 2","review":"I really like the mad, trance feel of this techno mix on disc 2. While disc 1 is a sadistic torture akin to some crazy German techno song that repeats the word \\"dildo\\" every beat in every measure, disc 2 induces one to just spaz out to a true mix of an odd collection of techno. I can see how its kinda awkward but not so much. Prolly the chap uses not-ready-to-be-mixed songs, and techno songs on vinyl at that - not some drawn out, trance computer file. And have you thought of odd-time signatures? he probably uses them here. Anyways, the set has a nice tribal evolution like some fantastic hula luau of hallucinogenic fire and tiki gods demanding your reverence.I gave it a 2 cuz disc 1 is just aweful and disc 2 is great so it averages out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Crazy Acid house. Dj HMC - LSD, is incredible. Check it out. Not the most melodic stuff ever, just full of sounds. A very interesting selection.

I should have saved my money and taken the photos myself. The pictures are amateur at BEST. The talent is non existent and you will see that numerous pictures are OUT OF FOCUS. It looks like most of the photographs were taken with a Kodak disposable camera. The photographer must need glasses if she thinks the pictures are in focus. Conclusion: Save your money. You'd be better off buying your own camera and taking pictures yourself. There are plenty of other GREAT gardening books out there with much better, well thought out, professional, in focus, photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"This DVD is just Pink Floyd members being interviewed about thier albums. It shows memebers of the band and a couple of other people being interviewed about every single album (except \\"More\\" for some reason). This DVD is not authorized by Pink Floyd but does feature music by them and a couple of cover versions which is weird. It does show them in concert at times but you mostly see the band memebers being interviewed. It's kinda cool because you get to hear what the band memebers think of strange albums like \\"Ummagumma\\" and \\"Atom Heart Mother\\". Overall it's not as bad as I thought but not great either. The closest thing out there right now you're going to get where you get to hear what the band memebers think about every album. (Once again except for \\"More\\"). It also comes with a nice book.NOTE: This DVD is region 2 so it will only play if you have a region free DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Know What You'll Get","review":"Length:: 0:40 MinsThis product (if your picky) is one that is better to buy in a store so you can actually see it rather than buying it online.Being \\"natural\\" you don't know what you'll get.The one I received is shaped like a \\"Y\\" as you can see in my \\"customer image\\".I have aSunterra 114516 Medium Fountain Pump, 130 GPH, Blackwith a riser tube (inside the hollow bark) pumping water to the top of the cork.No regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Set-Up, Works Great!","review":"I purchased this item to connect my Direct TV receiver up to my home network as it is not a Wi-Fi capable device.

MUCH easier for my son to read and follow along with. Theres not huge paragraphs on each page, discouraging him. I LOVE THIS (and the Peter Pan) BOOK!

With an excellent overview presented to the reader, the option prevails for further study should he/she so choose.

It's a decent movie for the genre and the era in which it was made. The lead actor (I'll never forget what's-his-name)was a poor choice for Merrill. Actually he was a poor choice for any role. Otherwise the movie was competently acted & directed. The photograhy could have capitalized more on the lush locals. The charactorization was shallow to nonexistant. The battle scenes were decently done. All in all, a decent enough war movie for a couple of hours of entertainmet. OK for rental, but I wouldn't recommend purchase.Merrill's Marauders"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast, lame script, not filmed in Burma","review":"I have to disagree with folks who like this film. The action scenes are extremely lame. Even the gunfire sounds like blanks, not real shots. The scenery could never be mistaken for Burma, it looks like, well, the Philippines! Despite earnest performances by all concerned, especially Chandler, the script goes nowhere and is merely a string of cliches. The budget must have been tight on this one, and it shows all over. The only decent music is stolen from \\"Objective Burma\\", a far superior production. It's too bad, as the cast here could have done fine with a better script and budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Over-rated War Movie","review":"I thought this was a very average over rated war movie.

I truly hate watching BIG UGLY BLACK LINES on my tv screen and I do not normally purchase movies that include them.

Second, there is a great lag in between songs and the song stops in the middle and seems to never resume. And when the songs are changing, it makes a loud whirring noise which gets annoying. The anti-skip system is a scam. It says 960 seconds, but it's more like 9.6 seconds. I wouldn't recommend this product to others. For cell phones, get a Samsung.

To me it doesn't come off as totally authentic, some recipes in particular come off as a Thai-ish version of Chinese favorites (I'm looking at you, fish-fragrant eggplant, although to be fair it's a great dish). Sometimes I find it a little bland, which is easy to adjust once you have a hang of the recipe. But it still calls for gulangal, fish sauce, palm sugar, etc., which puts it above a lot of other Thai cook books.Anyway I learned a variety of easy dishes that I really enjoyed, and learned to appreciate something of the subtleties of cooking Thai from this book.

The recipes were mostly interesting, and there are pictures for each recipe, but the final result is disappointing. Unlike most Wei Chuan books, this one seemed rather quickly and sloppily put together: Several recipes listed ingredients that did not seem to be used in the directions and photographs accompanying some recipes seemed to have been intended for other dishes.

Would have liked a critical analysis of the 1912 Henson book \\"A Polar Explorer\\" in light of the culture during the time it was written, and how it would have been re-written today, since the book publication could only be possible after Peary's review.

I raced through FAITHLESS (which is great, by the way) to begin TRIPTYCH.....and am totally disappointed in this book. It simply isn't worth the read. Karin Slaughter has followed Patricia Cornwell in departing from her tried and true main character and format to do a stand-alone book.A horse of a very different color. There isn't even a trace of her feminine flair for forensics (how's that for alliteration?) anywhere...just a lot of severed tongues and gorey murder scenes and a cast of ugly and unlikeable cretins who made me want to toss the book without finishing it.I did finish it but I hated it.I understand Slaughter is at work on another such book and my only comment, regarding a successful writing genre is: if it isn't broken, don't fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This is my first and last Karin Slaughter novel. I love a good murder mystery as well as the next person, but I also appreciate some redeeming qualities in the characters portrayed. I couldn't like any of these people! I felt betrayed after part one, because I started to like and feel sorry for Michael, I really disliked Angie, and felt nothing but pity for Will. I'm all about having \\"real\\" characters with flaws and all that but come on, could we at least try to have some good with the bad here?There were some unexpected twists, but overall I was extremely disappointed that I took the time to read this book. It is too vulgar with no warmth to balance it."},{"rating":"2","title":"triptych","review":"I read this book some years ago but, after reading Criminal, Karin Slaughter's latest book, I was curious about Will Trent's first appearance in her books.

I really liked how the book introduced each character and went into detail about them and made me actually feel like I knew the people. There wasn't a chapter that didn't have me wanting to read on.Every single chapter had me thinking on what will happen next, if it involved detective Ormwood dealing w/ his personal problems at home, or the recently paroled sex-offender John Shelley trying to make an honest living, or the many other characters in the novel.

Great seller to buy from!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"Except for the title and its obscure inferences, I thought the book was quite well done. I do believe I was misled into thinking the first detective was a 'good guy' by some (now seen) cheap ploys, but I can forgive that because the rest of the material made up for it.I loved the twists and surprises and the insights given to one who has severe dyslexia.I think using that many swear words was a cop out (sic) and the author should try to broaden her dialogue vocabulary so the reader won't feel like he's listening to teenagers on the after-school bus.All that none-with-standing, I would definitely buy another of Ms Slaughter's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be a blockbuster but...","review":"This book could be an excellent one. A paramount story. You'll never have an inkling of who's the bad guy. The problem with this plot is to find it!

I highly reccommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, fearless writing","review":"This is my first Karen Slaughter novel. To say I liked it would be false, to say I was compelled to read it and finish it, would be more in line with my thinking. There are no light moments in this book. It's gritty and violent but Slaughter's writing, her research well done and her storytelling and the way she keeps the reader guessing, amazing.When I started the book I was confused, I thought I was following the hero--and didn't like what I was reading at all. Turns out I was following the antagonist, which as I read made sense. Love that she takes chances with craft and character arcs. Gutsy, fearless writing.Some of the characterization rang false, everyone was \\"so\\" tortured, but again I was compelled. And if an author convinces a reader to pick up a book to see what happens, and the reader picks it up every chance she gets -- heck, it's 482 pages long --that warrants a five star rating.

Given that many times it is this stage of his work that is under-represented in books on his art, this book is advantageous. I've been looking at Klimt for years, and many times I've marveled at his intuitive, initial marks; they are records of a man obsessed with obervational drawing. The drawings in this book, rarely seen, are great examples of the first and most direct marks he would use and they attest to his amazing skill. They shed light on the finished works while standing nicely on their own. Even though the works shown here represent only a minute fraction of his drawings (thousands littered his studios at any given time), these particular pieces provide a unique view of this controversial artist. A good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The simplistic beauty of a continual line","review":"Gustav Klimt is amazing. I love his work and I have most recently become more intrigued by his ideas and sketches. If you like Klimt, check out Auguste Rodin, and Egon Schiele also. They all have similar sketch stylizes and imagery. I am an art major and I specialize in painting portraits, so Klimt's sketches are a natural way for me to go. I love his work so I loved this book but as another reviewer stated, the images were too light. The drawings were awfully faint and on gray paper, I would have liked them to be printed darker or at least on white paper.

I'm hard pressed to detect any influence by Debussy or Satie, no matter what Watson's bio says.This is a promising effort, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Patrick Watson is amazing, I love just about every song on this album.

I'm a long time fan and another one of those who just never understood why this band didn't have more success. The songwriting, vocals and innovative instrumentals make them one of the best bands to come out of the 90's but still not a lot of success.At any rate this album is a good starting place for a new Del Amitri listener. It includes many of my favorites and all of the songs that had any commercial success. I hope those who buy it will find it a good jumping off spot to pick up some of the other albums and give them a listen but if this is the only one they ever buy they sure won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE best Del Amitri album.","review":"This album has all the great Del Amitri songs that you've come to know and love, from \\"Last to know\\", to The brilliant \\"Nothing ever happens\\".I bought this Album on the spur of the moment, wondering if I really wanted it.

I came across them listening to \\"Always the Last to Know\\" on American Top 40 a decade ago. As great a band asthey were, the certainly should have had much more success here in America. The songs are all well-written and soulfully sung. As a band, they fall in somewhere between Squeeze and Crowded House, with a bit more emphasis on soul. To list the should've-been-hits on this album would beoverkill, but I will say that \\"Tell Her This\\", buried 2/3 of the way in, is quite possibly the most beautiful love song ever written. The other material is no let-down either. if you like quality, well-written, intelligent pop/rock music, please find your local record store and BEG for a copy.

The only thing I don't really care for is the price, but I guess I can justify that by knowing that its all natural and fair trade.

I am usually VERY particular about the shampoo I use, but I tried this soap out on my hair too, just for the heck of it. My naturally curly hair needs some form of conditioner or it gets frizzy - so I follwed up with my usual leave-in anti-friz product and my hair looked great.

The writing is patronizing, assuming we don't know how to pronounce city names like \\"Lhasa\\", and explaining what a crevasse is. the characters are flat, and the adventure isn't exciting. This is an example of someone who got a book just because they did something that unusual, and maybe who they knew, not on their writing abilities. I would recommend that you do not read this book.

Allen--who claims to be a college graduate--is completely ignorant of basic rules of grammar and punctuation. Much of the book reads as if someone had picked up handfuls of magnets printed with dance-related terms, and thrown them at a refrigerator.The barest, most cursory proofreading would have cleaned up a lot of this. Moreover, most people who write this poorly are aware that writing isn't one of their strengths. So why didn't Allen bother to have someone look over his manuscript?

Overall very disappointing as book that will teach you to dance, but enjoyable to read about the subjective though processes involved in the dance.Instead of focusing on teaching the basic steps clearly, the author fills the book with dance theory, history, and conversations. A vexing aspect of this book is his writing style: the book is filled with meaningless repetition and vague 'artsy' expressions that would leave anyone but advanced dancers in the dark. This book is woefully inadequate for the beginner as it has no diagrams of foot placement, and far too few photographs to see the connection between each photograph that makes up any sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell it the way it is!","review":"This weiter does not mence words.

Every grad student has seen or heard these dreaded words: \\"(insert equation) can be solved easily to arrive at (insert completely different eqation minus the ten or twenty preceeding steps)\\" This book is filled with those instances.

The movie was a joy to watch and part of the joy was the music. I've never listened to Indian music before, and don't know what I would think of this outside of the context of the movie. It reminds me of new age music, but with more ethnic color. At least one song also sounds a little Latin American. So it's a great mix of types, I'm already familiar with and like, but different because it's Indian. Some songs are very danceable tunes that sound quite techno! Someone who likes upbeat foreign music and pop would enjoy this. I love it for the unique sound and, upbeatness. It's something to put the convertible top down for!

It is not that it is particularly great or perfect, or a consistently thorough musical opus. But it really offers you a glimpse of what Indian music is all about. Well, some of the Indian music since this is mostly a Delhi Punjabi style or inspiration, a fraction of what India has to offer.

I accomplished in 2 mornings what would have taken me 2 weeks without them. So far, no problems.Jeannine Otchis, Maui Hawaii"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remington Branch Wizard Better than expected","review":"This arrives in a very big box just about all put together. The final stages of the assembly (connecting the bar and chain was a bit confusing) but once finished, I found the ergonomics of this comfortable and easy to maneuver.We tried this out trimming some dead wood from tall, overgrown Hemlocks. I was impressed at the ease of use. In fact, once i got comfortable maneuvering around, it was so easy to use we cut more than we started out to. It feels powerful and has a good reach.From reading through these reviews I didn't know what to expect, and this Branch Wizard worked much better than I expected. It does seem to be constructed geared towards occasional around the yard type of jobs and not built for heavy duty everyday use. But, like me, if light duty yard work is what you will be using this for, you should be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"My original Remington was much better.","review":"I had previously owned the Remington 8\\" pole saw and used it with good results. It got damaged in an ice storm last year. After looking at what was offered, I decided to try the lighter weight 6\\" saw as a replacement. The 6\\" version is like a toy compared to the larger one. There is no oil system, and I found it impossible to get the correct chain tension. Amazon made it easy to return, and promptly credited my account.I then ordered a Poulan pole saw from Amazon that I am very happy with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.","review":"Item works very well.

After some serious persuasion on Curtis' part, his mother decides to let him get a dog. After all, how much trouble could one small dog possibly be? Well, Curtis find's out that having a pet requires a lot of responsibility. Curtis learns alot in this story about the love of family. I found this book easy to read. As a teacher, I would suggest it to children struggling with the divorce of their parents. Overall it is a good book, however it is not a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great choice for my family....","review":"I have to agree that this topic and the sad ending of the story might be of value to specific kids, but in general this book didn't go over well in our house.As a very sensitive animal lover, my daughter didn't handle the ending well at all. We've read other books by this author that were great, and I'm sorry I trusted that her book would be appropriate for my daughter without reading it first.This story has a sad ending, with not much to \\"hope\\" for, and a couple of pages at the end from a dog handler about how the family made some poor choices. Maybe this moral stuff works for older kids, but not for my 1st grader. Pass on this one if your child has any trouble at all with sad endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"I bought this book with the idea of finding out more of the types of relationships women shared at the beginning of the twentieth century. I was astonished to find more than I bargained for. The Red Rose Girls provided more than insight into these relationships, it also provided a look inside the rise and fall of the progressive and arts and crafts movements. Pre Freud, the relationship of these woman was accepted and cherished as they lived together, and created their art. Post Freud, their relationships deteriorated as did their careers. All in all I found this book extremely entertaining, as well as heartening (a forty year relationship between two of the women) and the pictures are absolutely beautiful. If nothing else, as an art book it is extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forgotten Comeback Of Lillian Roth","review":"This is a marvelous album but, like an earlier review points out, is not a collection of her songs that made her originally hugely popular but is an album that she recorded just after the release of the movie biography about her \\"I'll Cry Tomorrow\\" starring Susan Hayward. However, that's what makes this album so wonderful to listen to. You hear a more mature yet still energetic and in fine voice Lillian Roth perform these superb songs including \\"Beyond My Worth\\" which she wrote herself and is a highlight of this cd. My personal favorite song here is \\"You Can't Take It With You, a spirited novelty tune which Lillian Roth raps as well, if not better, than any of today's rappers. Listening to it also makes you think about a connection between religious preaching and rap music which hadn't occurred to me before. Prime Lillian or not, most anyone who isn't familiar with Lillian will become a devoted fan after listening to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latter Day Lillian","review":"I have to disagree with the other reviewers. As a lover of 1920's and 30's torch singers, I was very disappointed in this CD. I am familiar with Lillian Roth's singing from the movies she made in the early 30's, and hoped to find 1930's recordings on this CD. Unfortunately, this recording was originally done in 1957, with 1950's arrangements. Lillian sounds fine, but doesn't have the tear in her voice that she had in the 30's. If you're looking for a young Lillian singing original arrangements of standards, this is not the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool for back pain!","review":"I have chronic back pain and am always looking for tools to help me at home. I heard about this one from my sister and was eager to try it. As many of the other reviews state, it takes some getting used to. It is hard and wooden and requires that you position it correctly so your spine is centered on it and when you find a sore spot stay there and rest for a minute if possible before finding the next spot.

Its palettes have a larger number of colours so you get more flexibility in choosing. That whole books has a more serious tone and content. Its palettes come from nature or historical time so they are not necessarily trendy. Just bear in mind that using this book is going to be much more time consuming since there are so many choices.

As for sizing, usually I wear an 8 1/2 in sneakers. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers here and did NOT order half a size up. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly without socks.

She also has very muscular calves and so the top of the boot is a little tight.

BearPaw Dream is even more comfortable than Uggs' ultra short since ultra short feels a little too tight. Uggs' classic short ($120) is still the most comfortable tho, but its style, which is more rounded and doesn't have a 2nd line around the edges, is a little outta date.These BearPaw Dreams serve as a great alternative to the new Uggs ultra short. Its shaft is a little taller than Uggs as well, which I think is smart because then it looks better with pants tugged in.Caution: if you wear 1/2 sizes, go one size up.

Unfortunately, the inside liner quickly began to wear down, as did the arch support in the boot making them pretty uncomfortable to wear. I didn't want to buy a new pair of boots so I inserted a new insole. I continued wearing them for another month, in which time the sole of the shoe began to crack and pull away from the fabric of the boot. I waterproofed the boot when I first got them since I live in a snow belt, but that does no good if water can get into the boot through the sole. Ultimately, these boots left my feet cold, wet, and aching. If you are looking for a good winter boot for everyday walking in the snow, do NOT buy these boots!!! They seem to be made more for fashion than function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"The company delivered exactly what I ordered and on time.

It is a poorly designed, underpowered unit and once you have a problem, you are on your own.

I recommend it for people with lots of shrubbery to trim and want to do the work themselves. Keep the cutters well oiled. It's much larger than a regular hedge trimmer.

Problem is that after one, yes one minute of use, it choked on a twig. Surprising since the manual indicates it's supposed to be able to handle a pretty substantial branch. I doubt it.

Three amps is not enough. Many reviewers complained about the cheap parts and shoddy design. Maybe so, but the combo of underpowered AND poor drive design makes this item unacceptable. I felt stupid when I bought my third one because I needed one to trim my decorative trees and shrubs. It's light enough, has reciprocating blades, has a long reach and does a great job....until the motor burns out and the blades seize on a branch. That's the beginning of the end for this piece of junk.Taking the cover off the cam mechanism, you can free up the works but from then on it only works on small growth items for a while and then nothing.

The stated capability to cut 3/4 inch branches was a serious overstatement and it cut only when you could approach the material from a 90' angle.

I freed it up several times and then when using again had the same results. The cam would jam with the hedger blade assembly. To me it seems to be a poor design in that the cam needed to be larger in diameter to keep from coming misaligned and jamming with the blade assembly when coming in contact with larger hedge stems. A normal hedger would jam when something is caught in the blades , however, the cam assembly on this hedger would just jam without anything caught or stuck in the cutting blades. I would recommend that Remington look at figuring out this problem as this seems to be the only flaw in the design. Anyway, returning the hedger for a refund.

I had an older Remington that performed great. The newer ones are not as powerful as stated. If it's going to be used only to cut new growth it's fine but if you plan on trimming back branches, anything larger than 1/4\\" causes it to over work and jamb. I also would not buy from Cub Cadet Super Store which is where it came from. I did receive a refund but only after many e-mails, contacting Amazon and dealing with unfriendly e-mails from the store.

Excellent choice for those just begining the soprano ukulele."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor help at any level","review":"I'm a beginner and I bought this book looking for some sound advice on strumming, picking, some chord progressions, and maybe a few songs. This book was a huge letdown. it doesn't cover picking at all, strumming is covered on one page that is devoid of any useful information, and all the songs are hopelessly outdated. Who knows how 'little brown jug' is supposed to sound? For a while I thought that I just didn't understand the hidden genius of the book, but then I got the Hal Leonard Ukulele Method and realized that this first book was just terrible. The Hal Leonard book has actual practice exercises that get progressively harder and I learned a lot from. This Mel Bay book is just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get anything from this.","review":"I have been strumming my ukulele for about a year now - I get maybe 30 minutes a day to play on a lunch break at work.

I haven't really gotten anything from the book at all.

Even with 550ex attached to it and a 70-200 4L lens on, I still feel it is well balanced. And 2nd group of button is really convenient for portrait. Of course, 2 batteries always have more power.If I remove it, with 550ex flash on it, I really feel awkard to hold it.So if you just have the kit, forget about it.

Consumer Labs had an expiration date of 2005, while the other labs' batches had an expiration date of 2006. Thus, it is totally accurate for both sides to make their claims/statements. However, lead is too dangerous an item for developing brains and bodies (and for adults, too) to take chances.If Gummy Vites had stepped up to the plate and stated that they did have a batch which had problems and that they had undertaken the strictest standards to make sure it would never happen again, then I would feel much more comfortable.

This vitamin contains 2.5 mcg of lead per two gummy bear serving. The article states that even low levels of this heavy metal can possibly disrupt neurobehavioral and cognitive development in children especially under the age of six! Children's bodies cannot eliminate lead as an adult body can; rather, the lead is stored in the child's bones and soft tissues (including the brain!). Lead poisoning can have a huge impact on a child's growth and development. There is a website called leadpoisoningnews.com to get more info on the damaging affects of lead absorption.

The other thing is that a number of routes listed in the book are segments of paddling routes, so they begin and end in the middle of Florida Bay or the Wilderness Waterway.

I have several old LP's of Don Ho singing all his classics, including Tiny Bubbles, I'll Remember you, and Beautiful Kauai. Which by the way are the only good songs on this CD.

To call these the best electronica songs ever is a disgrace to techno and embarasses me as a long-time fan of techno/trance/house. There is nothing \\"cool\\" about mainstream electronic music--when something hits MTV or gets slapped on myriads of trashy compilations, there is something wrong. This is just the result of some label trying to make money off of impressionable kids. Just because something says Prodigy or (even worse) The Chemical Brothers does NOT mean it is good.

Packer's Knowing God, Hunter examines prayer in the light of God's holiness, sovereign power, innate goodness and spirit compositon.

The song 'Watch the Lamb' puts you right there in Jerusalem during the crucifixion of Jesus and is absolutely heart wrenching. I believe that songs like these (including 'The Hammer') are ones that can bring a non-believer to Christ.My other two favourites are 'Shepherd Boy' and 'You Will Always Be a Child' and the closing song 'Take up your Cross' is very challenging and always reminds me that Jesus expects me to follow Him wherever he leads.If you are looking for a great Christian album, this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but expensive","review":"Really, this a nice book and cds for some slangs in English, but the cost is so high for such a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"slangman guide to biz speak 1","review":"This book has few useful American slang words.There are way too many repeatations an redundancy spread over 240 pages.The information contained can be easily presented in some fifty pages or less.This book is grossly overprized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoorama","review":"If you want to learn about the animal inhabitants of Denali, this video is for you.

What a great book. We have a lady who's life falls apart in the span of 24 hours. Where does any good daughter go when everything falls apart? Why home to mom & dad of course. The only problem is that her father is dying, she & her mom don't get along, and her daughter currently hates her for taking her away from everthing she knows. The family dynmics in this book are enough to blow you away. The mother cracks part of the way through the book from all of the pressure of reliving the most tragic event of her life, all the while trying to help her daughter & herself. I could go on & on about how fabulous this book is, but really you just need to read it to love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send the heroine to a shrink!","review":"After reading Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants and Ape House, I really expected much better. Her heroine Annemarie was such a train wreck that I found myself either embarrassed for her or just plain annoyed at her as she bungled her way through this novel. It was difficult to feel any sympathy for her and Sara did a poor job of developing a relationship between her and her new-found replacement for Harry, her beloved horse who died in the accident. Granted, I listened to the audio book version, and the actress who read it was overly dramatic and very harsh sounding throughout, so perhaps I'm being a little unfair. I found myself just wanting to tell this woman to go get some therapy before you totally destroy your world and everyone in it. It wasn't a fun read, just disappointing and irritating. Sara obviously improved with experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a whiner!","review":"I have read some of this author's other works and found them quite enjoyable. I had to force myself to finish this book, and that's a rarity for me. The main character, Annemarie, is so selfish as to be unbearable. At close to 40 years of age, she was way too irresponsible and refused to acknowledge her role in a series of life-altering events. She was conveniently able to blame everyone but herself. I really wish I could recoup the time I wasted on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Sara Gruen has invented a character so inadequate, insensitive and incompetent, that it defies credulity to accept that this 'heroine' has enough insight to narrate a first person account of her ridiculously tenuous hold on reality. She does not cook or clean or parent her daughter or help her mother care for her desperately ill father. She takes on the management of the stable business, but does not even get to know her employees. She expects sympathy from her audience, as she whines or screams through page after page. I actually felt sympathy for the fictional people with whom this fictional woman interacted, until I decided that life was too short to spend another moment on this tale. The death of her father was where I reached the end of my tolerance for this book. I had enjoyed Water for Elephants very much, and was sorely disappointed in this attempt to create a story around horses, and people who like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am halfway through the book and hoping the sequel is better. I bought both because of how much I loved Water for Elephants. The main character is so frustrating and unappealing. I'm sad to see that she apparently does not grow up. I'll make myself finish it and hope for the best in the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this book with great hope","review":"Though the author seems to know horses, the character of Annemarie left much to be desired. She was written as to be so absorbed in self pity, that she couldn't see any of the characters around her.When I read that her father was suffering from the last stages of ALS I would have thought that she would come out of herself to some extent and read on in that hope. But these characters were shuffled aside while she whined and cried over what she couldn't have for most of the book.I read on in hope, but found that whether it was her daughter going through the throes of growing up, her mother trying to give her father dignity in his last days or even the man she professes to fall in love with.... the character is so mired in her self interests as to be almost disgusting.I was sadly disappointed in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BIT DISAPPOINTING","review":"I read her book, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, and enjoyed the book.

But, I'm not sure she is the same person as the level was so much lower that Water. The story was predictable, the main character was selfish and unreal. The husband leaving a sterile marriage for the pregnant girlfriend was boring. There was not even feeling in the slow death of her father from ALS, a life-draining disease.

Thank goodness the author kept writing after this novel! I've become accustomed to horse novels being wildly inaccurate in their portrayal of the horse world, and this one is no exception. However, what is more frustrating with this novel is that I just couldn't bring myself to care about the main character, Anne Marie. Yes, she suffered a terrible tragedy, but she comes across as a selfish person who drinks excessively and lacks self-awareness to the point of pathology. One feels sorry for her child, certainly, but it's difficult to care about a story when the heroine leaves you cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Water for Elephants","review":"Easy to read, but not nearly as well done as Water for Elephants.

Clearly this author gets the horse world, she understands the combination of fear and love and respect that is between rider and horse. Her writing allows you to taste, smell and feel what the main character Annemarie is feeling.I read Water for Elephants and enjoyed it very much but this book really hit home for me. Her writing is rich and sensitive and her main character is frought with flaws but the reader really relates to her and her struggles with her relationships with her mother, father, daughter and \\"friend\\" If you at all have a love for horses or just a really good and real story, give \\"Riding Lessons\\" a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time I wanted the main character to die....","review":"This book was ridiculous. I'm sure people like Anne Marie exist, but I wouldn't give her the time of day. She is a self-centered jerk, a terrible mother and daughter and she deserved all of the chaos in her life. Worse, the writing was trite and the story line wasn't believable in any way (what kind of mother would behave that way?).I've never quit reading in the final chapter, but I did with this book. I wanted Anne Marie to die in a firey crash - and I had a feeling that Gruen didn't end the book that way, so I put it down and wrote my own ending. It's really difficult for me to believe that the Gruen who wrote this book, also wrote Water for Elephants. Either she had a major writing metamorphosis, or something fishy is going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"a despicable main character","review":"Question for the author: Who are you and what have you done with the Sara Gruen who wrote \\"Water for Elephants\\"? Thank goodness I read the wonderful \\"Water for Elephants\\" first; I never would have picked it up if I had read this book first. This book was terrible! The heroine - and I use that word very loosely - Annemarie Zimmer is whiny, arrogant and selfish. She spends almost the entire novel wracked with sobs, dissolving into tears, on the verge of tears, shrieking, yelling or howling at someone and \\"sliding down the walls and convulsing in sobs on the floors\\". How many people do you know who actually slide down the walls in anguish anyway? Apparently men love women who do this because a couple men in the book are in hot pursuit of the miserable Annemarie!

Her complicated personal life and family set-up mean that, gasp, you almost pay as much attention to what's going on in the house as in the stable. And as life piles complication after complication on to Annemarie's shoulders you find yourself rooting for her.Pour yourself a glass of wine, run a bubble-bath and read RIDING LESSONS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of characters","review":"Not sure why the title \\"Riding Lessons\\" actually.

And here is the reason: the reader is making it almost impossible to continue listening. Oh! The Drama! I can't imagine who would have made the decision to have this story drawn out and acted out unrelentingly from start to (I assume), the finish, but it must have been someone without a personal history of listening to books. My plan is to finish it, but can only listen when I'm somewhat distracted from that voice speaking at me. I listen to books constantly and have had experience with good and bad readings, but this one is a challenge. Others may like their books dramatically acted out, and if you do, this one if for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new author","review":"Sara Gruen's Riding Lessons and its sequel, Flying Changes, are masterfully written.

Okay - people make mistakes but this woman truly is one of the most narcissistic individuals I've ever encountered in fiction, and why would I want to read about her? I kept waiting for the epiphany but it just didn't happen. She blames everyone for her own mistakes. She's a horrible mother and then blames others.. totally obsessed with herself with no compassion, empathy, or understanding for anyone.

OUCH OUCH ...She is shallow, horrible person, lousy mother, terrible daughter, thoughtless, not compassionate.Perhaps her other book is good? I got my copy of this book at a yard sale for 50 cent.

If I had read it first it would have been the last Sara Gruen book I would have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unsympathetic protagonist","review":"_Water for Elephants_ is one of the best books I have read in the last decade, so I was looking forward to reading Sara Gruen's debut novel. After reading it, I have to say that I do not know how she got a contract for another book. Annemarie Zimmer is a loser: bad wife, bad mother, bad daughter, bad girlfriend, bad employee, bad manager, bad human being. She whines constantly and is completely self-absorbed. Worst of all, she is not even an interesting character. At least Voldemort is a compelling villain in Harry Potter - Annemarie Zimmer shows absolutely no growth or self-awareness throughout this novel. I would have chucked this book long before the end if it hadn't been written by Gruen. It is hard to believe that the same author wrote this mess and _Water for Elephants_. To recap, I hated _Riding Lessons_."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment after reading Water For Elpehants","review":"My expectatins were high for another great book. I read the reviews from other readers and most were good to great. What a disapointment. The book was shallow. The characters were predictable. This book was chosen for our book club with great expectations. We all loved Water for Elephants. Next time I will read all of the reviews before selecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horse porn?","review":"I admit I bought this book because I liked Water for Elephants by the same author.Also, in the interests of full disclosure I am a horse nut, so for me there was the added incentive of the horse theme in this book.However, this is basically a standard issue woman's romance story, predictable from the beginning, and certianly nothing I'd ever read in the normal course of events. But I was tricked into perservering by the hope that there would at least be some nice horse riding action. But no.Very little of horse interest, a heroine who is mostly a selfish temper tantrum witing to happen, an amazing lack of self-awareness, and loads of tempestuous emotional blow-outs: this book is like the fever dream of a fourteen year old.Gruen has definitely grown as an author since this was published. May she continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Lessons/Riding Lessons","review":"AnnMarie has to go through many of life's lessons to find out who she really is and what she really wants. Some people may not suffer such pains or losses, but those that do sometimes lose their grip at times and end up making a mess of things. This does not mean that one cannot be resurrected from their fallibility. If there were perfect characters what would be the reason for a book. Sometimes books teach you something more about yourself or other people in your life; thus teaching you how to be more empathetic to the world around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I didn't think that I'd like Sara Gruen's Riding Lessons or Flying Changes, but wanted to read them after reading Water for Elephants. However, the storyline told in these two books was very intriguing. I found myself wanting more after finishing Flying Changes. I wish there would be a third book, or a movie made from these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as her later works.","review":"If you're planning to read Riding Lessons because you loved 'Water for Elephants', you'll likely be disappointed. Thank goodness the author kept writing after this novel! I've become accustomed to horse novels being wildly inaccurate in their portrayal of the horse world, and this one is no exception. However, what is more frustrating with this novel is that I just couldn't bring myself to care about the main character, Anne Marie. Yes, she suffered a terrible tragedy, but she comes across as a selfish person who drinks excessively and lacks self-awareness to the point of pathology. One feels sorry for her child, certainly, but it's difficult to care about a story when the heroine leaves you cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books EVER","review":"Hard to believe this was written by the author of the masterful 'Water for Elephants' in fact I don't believe it! How could it be???This was such an awful book I kept thinking there was some type of trick up the author's sleeve. But alas, it really was just a bad book.Read the other 1-star reviews, they are all true, accurate and honest. The book is unbelievably maddening and the main character, Annemarie, sickening.I loved 'Water for Elephants' but will NEVER waste my time reading another Sara Gruen book. I feel as if someone cheated me out of a portion of my life. If it wasn't for the fact that I had a Book on CD version, I could never have gotten through it.Yuck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trade Riding Lessons for Writing Lessons","review":"Hard to believe the same person who wrote Water for Elephants wrote this book. It's not nearly as well written or well-crafted. Sara Gruen, thankfully, has grown as a writer since she wrote this one. I hope that her further efforts will be more in the vein of Water for Elephants.The story in Riding Lessons is not engaging and the characters are not believable, particularly the main character who is too stupid to relate to. She does ridiculous things, treats people in amazingly inappropriate ways and is, in general, too annoying to care about. If she were a real person you'd want to slap her. It's hard to get into a book when you feel that way about the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I loved Water for Elephants-- a compelling story with a F. Scott Fitzgerald-like feel to it, so we picked Riding Lessons for our book club. It was lite chick-lit at its most trite and contrived. The main character is completely self-absorbed and unsympathetic; she creates all the misery in her life, and somehow we're expected to care about it. The chapter in which she tries to cook a meal but fails miserably was unreadable. Come on, how many times has that device been used? The ending was predictable about halfway through the book. I think that the only satisfying ending would have been if the barn burned down, consuming all the characters in flames. That she chose to write a sequel is mind-boggling."},{"rating":"2","title":"REFREASHING","review":"Riding Lessons was an incredible read. A refreashing story that touched my heart in more ways than one. As soon as I was done, I purchased the sequel, Flying CHanges. Facts and situations in regards to the horse world are right one and the descriptive writing creates the movie for your mind. You won't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"This book was awful. I love horses, used to show jump and had a lots of ups and downs in my life also. I don't like the way the book was written, it was to predictable and the typographical errors in the book I purchased were just awful. Many times, I had to go back and re-read a page just to figure out who was saying what. If they had a zero rating, I would have given it a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"I was excited to read this book and ended up being very disappointed.

I found the main character self absorbed and equally immature as her teenage rebellious daughter. Was the reader ever in doubt that she would get her horse back?

Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read.","review":"In this first book of the pair, I found the characters somewhat difficult to relate to, namely the main character. I found myself almost annoyed by her, truth be told. However, it is well written and an interesting story. And of course, it provides an excellent lead-in to the next book in the series, which what makes the story feel complete. Recommend if you have the patience to get to that second novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"One of the top 5 books I've read this year. Really identified with this book. Reminded me a lot of the Horse Whisperer. This has a completely different story, but shares the similarities of an accident and a woman who believes everything she touches falls apart until the love of a horse pieces her together. This is a library book I'll definitely be buying. (Just wish the photo on the cover used a correctly colored and marked horse!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest book I ever read","review":"I will give this book one star only because of the effort it takes to write a novel. It was stupid from start to finish, and I did not like one thing about this book. Her characters are one dimensional, immature and vapid. I honestly cannot believe it was published. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"Had to believe that the same person wrote Water for Elephants.This book was such a waste of time. Annemarie whined throughout and acted like an idiot. None of the characters were likeable,not even Dan who put up with Annemarie's stupid behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is hard to believe that his author wrote Water for Elephants as this book is nothing but fluff by comparison.

She had a rent controlled apartment in New York City. Danny illegally takes over tenancy of the apartment, and is told he can't leave until the court order comes through where he can take over the lease. Joe (Thorsten Kaye) is the touchy-feely Russian doorman Danny has to contend with. He likes to refer to himself in the third person. \\"Joe got paint for you.\\" \\"Joe go ATM for you.\\" \\"Now you need Joe.\\" Irritating. Also irritating, Sharleen (Cody Horn), who is filming Danny for her video blog. By the 40-minute mark, I was wondering if anything was going to happen at all. Bodies eventually start turning up, and we all know the fate of pets in a horror movie. But no amount of camera shaking, jump cutting, or tense music can up the anxiety when nothing's really happening. Ultimately, nothing in the way of an explanation is given for the semi-strange goings on. A colossal waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OCCUPANT","review":"I did not like this paticular movie. It did not have much of a plot and was not quite understood who the hec was in the apartment other than the grandson of the lady who died. I mean was it the grandmother haunting the place because she diden't want the granson living there or was something there when she lived there and scared her and that's how she died? anyway the grandson was paronoid and crazy as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Right Stuff, No Stuffing","review":"It lured you in, characters all had potential. Good teaser scenes. Then what you discover is the movie is all thrown together ideas for a movie. The movie is really more of a film studies \\"brainstorming\\" event, because the movie itself has all sorts of interesting people and situations, but NOTHING is tied together, or even one or more possible scenarios hinted at. How anyone could watch this and be either frightened by it, or intrigued, is intriguing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"as the world turns","review":"For reasons that are unknown to me, this movie is coming up as horror. As someone that has seen more than 500 movies in all genres of horror I can empathetically say that \\"Occupant\\" is in a league of its own. Instead it's about a guy that will cut himself off from the outside world to get his granny's old apartment (what some people won't do to get a rent controlled apartment in New York is beyond me). Filmed on a shoestring budget the movie has a very underground quality to it that is dark and somewhat surreal, although this adds little to the overall insipid plot. The fact that it's only available through VOD and not on blu-ray should have been a tip-off that it's a poorly produced movie. Van Hansis wasn't bad but he didn't project the type of emotion that one goes through as they suffer through utter dementia. Watching him was like watching a racecar get from zero to one-hundred without getting to fifty or seventy-five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I can't believe there were viewers that rated this film highly.

Danny (Van Hansis) becomes a squatter in her apartment on the advice of Joe, the Doorman (Thorsten Kaye) and Joe's lawyer friend. He wants the apartment for the same rent control price his grandmother had it. The landlord wants Danny out so he can rent the 3500 square foot, downtown NYC apartment for big bucks. Joe gets Danny everything he needs to stay there, unfortunately there are weird things going on in the apartment and Danny quickly develops cabin fever.The movie doesn't have a lot of characters and is practically a one man play. The movie plays you along to the end.F-bomb, brief night time sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Occupant","review":"After watching the trailers for Occupant dozens of times I didn't quite know what to expect from the film. I knew that Van Hansis was an extraordinary actor and expected his performance to be great. Now after just seeing this mind boggling film, I can enthusiastically say that the performance Van Hansis gives is nothing short of brilliant!Thorsten Kaye, Cody Horn and the rest of the talented cast provide us with great performances as well. This dark, moody, very creepy film is gripping from beginning to end. The mark of a great horror film is it's ability to still haunt you once it's over and Occupant does just that. It's one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. Occupant is indeed a film that should not be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading and disappointing","review":"Spoiler Alert:I was under the impression this was a supernatural thriller. In fact I saw one person refer to it as similar to paranormal activity. First of all there is absolutely nothing supernatural in the entire movie. NOTHING! There is no indication that anything supernatural is going on so I'm not sure where people are drawing that conclusion.The lead actor was great but the story was disappointing since I was expecting a supernatural thriller. It is basically a story of a guy going crazy because he is boxed up in an apartment and can't leave. There is no motivation or reasoning behind his behavior. The story was idiotic and made no sense. I was bored about halfway through and almost turned it off but stuck with it because I thought maybe there would be some big payoff at the end. I was wrong.

The Diaper Champ has met all of our expectations. I don't think we could have lived without this thing. It definitely contains the odor but you do have to spray it with some disinfectant over time since diaper smells can be overpowering. This is so easy to use also with just a flip and the diaper is gone. I found this to be much better than the Diaper Genie which was used by some of my friends. Over time, they just stopped using it because it was too much of a hassle and costly with the specific refills. I'm certain we'll continue to use this as long as my baby is in diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The diaper champ is awesome, I have never once had a problem with odor in my sons nursery.

It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags. I use tall kitchen trash bags.

Real food produces real smells and breast milk and formula did not. Now that he's a toddler, I have stopped using it because.... I am LAZY! I have NO TIME or PLACE to clean up the thing to make it stop smelling. This is one of the suggestions/rules of ANY diaper refuse product. To make it work well, buy THICK trash bags not generic brands. The thicker the bag, the less smell seeps out. I just put the Champ in the trash can.To me however, the Genie seems to offend less. For the past year I have had a used Diaper Genie and for my son's most offensive diapers, they go in there! It just finally broke and I'm online today to buy another Genie.

Really a trash can would work just as well as this diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should get NO stars","review":"At first I thought that this diaper pails was wonderful, it kept in the stink and used regular garbage bags.

Please don't buy this waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking it back tomorrow for a Diaper Genie","review":"I read the online reviews for this and opted to register for the Diaper Champ based on feedback. I am incredibly dissapointed with this product. Diapers and/or wipes tend to fall out of the cylinder when rotating it unless you pack it down, which is hard to do when changing a baby. Also, the diapers tended to get stuck in the cylinder if the bag was not changed out often. Changing the bag out often caused a lot of wasted bags because they wouldn't even be half full. It also does not do a good job a containing the odor like the Genie has in the past. I am very disappointed in this and the customer reviews that raved over the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks after 3 months of use!!!","review":"Well, the first three months were odor free!!

Another nice feature of the diaper pail is the fact that wipes get lodged in the pail which prevents one from completely swinging the handle over. This results in a continuous struggle of having to jiggle and tug on the handle to get the wipe dislodged which causes even more blasts of fresh, i mean rancid, air to be released directly in your face. Buyer beware! seriously . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, makes a room smell worse","review":"After reading reviews we bought this thinking it would be more economical, since you don't need the special bags.

And the residual smell of past diapers is still in there, nothing makes it go away. It still stinks. And now that my daughter is walking she flips the drum back and forth, you have to leave the room.

Perhaps our problem is that we are using it will pull-ups and not diapers but everytime we turn it over, it gets stuck and I have to open it up and push the diaper down. The thing is useless. It frustrates everyone. I'm going to try to find an older model on Ebay. I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to. I would never recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a waste of money. No matter what you do it still smells! Also very hard to clean! It is neat that you can use your own bags, but the concept of the bag sealing like the diaper genie when you put it in seems like it would work better. My suggestion would be not to throw diapers in the trash cans inside the house just tie them up in a plastic sack maybe even a sented one and throw it away in your trash can outside to emliminate smell!! b/c not matter what you do if you put dirty diapers inside ANYWHERE they will smell, even when using this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay","review":"I purchased the white with blue trim from BabiesRUs and thought it looked and sounded great for the money. I would have rather spent more money for a better one. This \\"champ\\" will only flip diapers, no trash, q-tips or wipes. If you have anything you want to throw away either open up the entire pail and smell the dirty diapers or have another can just for trash. There is one good mention and that it that it takes normal kitchen size bags. I will be buying a different pail in the next few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This product worked well until my child reached about 12 months. I assume it was the larger size of the diapers. At that point, the bin would be half full, but the diapers and wipes would keep popping out of the bin - which is just disgusting. I had to carefully wrap all of the wipes into the dirty diaper and fold each shut. Then waste (the bm variety) smeared all inside of the canister mechanism. I made a valiant attempt to clean it - which is utterly impossible with all of the crevices. I went and bought another \\"improved\\" Champ. I meticulously folded, rolled and fastened each diaper. But it happened again shortly thereafter. I bought the least expensive \\"simple\\" diaper pail for $10 and I have not had a problem since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Unlike others, the Diaper Champ uses standard trashbags -- saving you headaches from trying to find the right bag and money because you don't have to buy a bag that only works in the Champ. The Champ uses a wonderfully simple design to keep out odors and won't break. The best part is that it is a full-sized can, which means you have to empty it less often. The one drawback about not smelling dirty diapers is when you go to empty the Champ -- take it outside before you open it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky and stinky","review":"Here's my list of things I didn't like about this pail:1. I found that the chamber didn't always push the diaper into the pail (had to push by hand...yuk)2. It made a lot of noise when it actually worked3. After a few months of use, the \\"stink\\" liner tore and fell out which then allowed all the stink to escape.4. The diapers always stacked on top of one another. I would have to shake the pail to get them to spread out, but even then it didn't hold much (or it didn't seem that way with twins).Here's my list of things I liked:1. It used regular garbage bags"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the stinky, dirty champ","review":"Poop gets all over this disposal, the smell is atrocious. Spend the extra $ for the genie & refills...less poop smeared everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS THING!","review":"I absolutely hate this thing. First all the little hole on top is too small for all but the tiniest newborn diapers. So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands. Then you cram it in the tiny little hole and poop inevitably gets all over the hole. And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip. So, yes, you need to take out the diaper and wriggle the handle. All this defeats the purpose of having a \\"hands-free\\" diaper pail! Get a regular old trash can with a pedal on the front, stick in a air-freshener, and save yourself some time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this diaper pail!","review":"I read reviews on this site before buying this diaper pail. I thought it was going to work well, and I had high expectations. Unfortunately, it broke after only two weeks of use, and since it was kept in our baby's bedroom, it wasn't even used all the time -- it was only used when we changed a diaper upstairs.I was VERY disappointed that I didn't keep the receipt. I would have made Babies R Us take it back.I recently had a friend over to see the baby. She saw the diaper pail (we hadn't pitched it yet) and asked me if I liked it. I told her that it had broken and was a waste of [$$$]. My friend said that she had the same one and that it had also broken quickly (after approximately 4 weeks of use)! Obviously, there's a pattern here.I have a Diaper Genie now, and I'm pleased with it. I had to read the instructions on how to use it, but it's been working well (thank goodness)."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinky pail","review":"Don't believe anyone that says that this is an odor-free diaper pail. The baby's whole room smells like poopy diapers. Plus the chute often gets clogged with diapers so you have to open the lid (which isn't easy) and pull all the dirty diapers from the chute into the pail. The only good thing about it is that you can use any kind of garbage bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pail if you want to regular garbage bags","review":"The Diaper Champ is great because you can use regular garbage bags, rather than special refill cartridges. It also contains most of the dirty-diaper-smell. We use the Diaper Champ for wet diapers and the Diaper Genie for soiled diapers. This cuts down drastically on the cost of getting refills for the Diaper Genie. With two infants in diapers, every little bit helps!I gave only 4 stars because if you don't wrap up the diaper before using the Diaper Champ and the velcro tabs are hanging loose, they can become stuck in the shoot and you have to open the pail to free the diaper.I highly recommend the Diaper Champ as an inexpensive alternative to other diaper pails."},{"rating":"2","title":"New mom","review":"I didn't want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product. The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ). The mechanism doesn't let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can't get into the Diaper Champ! Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it's simple to open. I highly recommend the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The first time I used this diaper pail was at [a store] in the \\"family\\" room and I absolutly loved it, so my husband and I went out and bought one (since the other one broke, understandibly from too much abuse). It keeps odor in and it is so easy to use. You just drop the diaper in and flip the handle. There are no little breakable parts, so this pail can take lots of abuse (ours has). I have told all my freinds and family to stop using their other pails and buy this one. I would pay three times what they are asking to have this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saves Money But Smells Funny !","review":"The Diaper Champ worked ok for a while. After we washed it down for sanitary reasons, and let it dry thoroughly, the seal seemed to weaken and let incredible odors out! We switched to the Diaper Genie and are completely satisfied with it. No more odors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Champion so far","review":"As a first time mother who was preparing for my newborn,I did a lot of product research and although most of my friends were raving over the Diaper Genie. I opted to buy Diaper Champ based on the reviews on Amazon. Now we have been using the Diaper Champ for two months now and can find no fault with it. It is easy to use, no expensive bags to buy (as with other products) and best of all no odour. I live in a tropical country and I expected to be diposing of dirty diapers often but the Champ stays odour less throughout. I will reserve further opinion when my baby get on to solids, but so far I am impressed!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell","review":"I have to admit, I loved the idea of the diaper champ...in the beginning. Now, I am looking for another diaper disposal system. My son is only 1 month old..and the diaper champ is not holding up in the anti-stink department. I have tried cleaning the diaper champ according to the inserts recommendations, with no luck. I am also changing the bags way before they are full, to see if that helps...it doesn't. Whenever you walk into my sons room, all you can smell is stinky diapers. I thought maybe I had done something wrong when inserting the trash bag or closing it...nope. So now, after only 1 month...I am off to try and find a less stinky diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"I have a 3yr old & 4mo old. I purchased this one because my other diaper pail broke. I thought this one would keep the odors out because of its design...well I was wrong. My complaints with this diaper pail are: hard to open, Size(to large), Odors(not good for #2 diapers..Ok for #1 diapers), & easy for toys to get thrown away in there(my 3yr loves to put toys in it). I am now using the kitchen trash again because it gets dumped everyday(no odor has time to build up and I put the #2 diapers outside right away). I hope this review has helped someone...save money an use your trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This product works fine for isolating diaper odors, but overall I was disappointed. If you plan on using cloth diapers, this won't work for you. Anything other than disposables that have been wrapped up in a ball will get caught in the flipping mechanism. Then the top has to be opened and the items pulled out- negating the purpose of the whole thing. Also, the bags are a bit difficult to get out and tear if you're not super careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use with cloth diapers!","review":"I bought the Diaper Champ based on all the positive reviews. Contrary to what it says in the description, this is NOT a good product for cloth diapers!About 75% of times we put our cloth diapers into the champ they would get stuck when trying to drop into the bag. And these are newborn sized diapers... the problem would just get worse with older kids. I called the company of Diaper Champ to try and solve the problem and they informed me that the Diaper Champ is not for use with cloth diapers!!With that said, I can see how this would be a good diaper pail for those using disposables. It is easy and quick to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for cloth diapering","review":"We bought this because we heard it can be used for cloth diapering as well as disposables. It works well for disposables, keeps smells in, uses any bag etc - all the good things people say. But for cloth, we found the bin to be too small and would fill up fast. And the cloth diapers have a way of jamming in the flip top part - so we'd end up just opening the whole thing up every time we had to change a diaper which completely defeated the purpose. If you're using disposables, this this is great. But if you're cloth diapering, a regular garbage can with a loose fitting lid works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for disposable diapers.","review":"Dh and I loved this pail until we went up to the first size of 4X8X4 cloth diapers. They were too big for the drum to turn effectively, and the diapers often got stuck. We tossed it and bought a plain old pail. I suppose it could also be a problem with the last two sizes of disposables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Rest!!!","review":"I nannied and the family I worked for had a diaper genie. BIG WAST!! It had very little room, had to be changed every day, and had pricey refill bags. I now have my own daughter, and after reading all the reviews I chose to go with the Diaper Champ. It's great. I can use my own garbage bags, and it 100% Oder free. I only have to change the bag 1-2 x a week. When I do change it, it smells a bit, but I always spray it down with lysol (in and out) when I change the bag, and once a day on the outside. That's keep the stinch WAY down. This is a MUST HAVE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT's THAT SMELL???","review":"Capacity speaking this Diaper Champ is the \\"champ\\", but when it comes to being odor free it's a FAR cry from that. It stinks much worse than the DIAPER GENIE. I have had both products and they both are not worth the price. A $10.00 trash can, with a couple of air freshners is a better investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Genie!","review":"This is my second baby, and I loathe the diaper genie. It stinks, it's difficult to empty, and the refills are expensive. This was an interesting alternative, and the reviews were good, so I bought it. I'm really glad I did! It's easy to use and easy to empty. I found that Glad Tall Kitchen QuickTie 13 Gallon bags work the best with the Diaper Champ. They are the right size, and you can buy them in boxes of 96. The taller kitchen bags are just too big. My only complaint is that when the Champ starts to get full, the weight that pushes the diaper down into the can loses some of it's pushing power. Then sometimes I have to manually push the weight down, and I really don't care to have my hand in the diaper pail, if you know what I mean. This problem is really not a big deal, and it just signals that it is time to change the bag. My daughter is breastfed, and her stools don't smell yet. So I can't tell what the smell factor will be on stinky diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats Wrong With The Good Ol' Trash Can???","review":"I have decided that I need a racket like these to make me rich, something that new parents think they have to have for their little one. I know in my house we empty our trash atleast 1x a day, sometimes we get a day and 1/2 out of it. I assure you, this is MORE than you will ever change your Diaper Champ, Diaper Genie or any other diaper pail specifically used for diapers. It can take quite a few days to fill it up.....and then people complain that it smells?? Hmm... Get a new Kitchen trash can with a lid.Avoid these things they are more headache than they are worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"diaper champ is a loser","review":"I have had the Diaper Champ in my son's room for 6 months and all of a sudden the room smells like dirty diapers all the time.

A friend of mine has the same problem with her Diaper Champ. It doesnt hold the liner well, the tube gets stuck and it SMELLS!

QUITE LITERALLY!","review":"Booooo! Thumbs down to this stinker of a product. Never seemed to contain the odor even when bag was changed daily! Would try to air it out in the laundry room to freshen it up...but spent so much time caring for this supposedly handy product, that it was just easier to bag the diapers and throw them out. YUCK! Also, rubber gasket pulled off after a while. Don't waste your money. Use a garbage instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You could just use a cute garbage pail","review":"We saw this diaper pail and thought it was neat looking, easy to use,and did not take extra bags. So we registered for it and recieved it as a shower gift. I bought vanilla scented bags and have used it regularly.I keep it very clean but it does not matter you can still smell a poopy diaper that you rolled up and put in it hours later. It just does not keep the smell in the can.My daughters room just smells like used diapers. i would be better off putting a cute garbage can in there and throwing the dirties outside every night like you do with kitty litter."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this champ!","review":"Being a first time mom I reviewed every diaper holder possible. Most of my friends had the genie, but I had used it before. Who wants to stick your hand in with a full diaper? This champ is so easy. Just drop in and turn. Yes, it does fill in the center, but if you shake the pail you can get a few more diapers in. We use a scented bag and are changing more frequently now because my son has larger diapers. With newborns we could go a week. The insert needs to be pushed all the way down for no odor to leak back. There is no comparison- this is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"ODOROUS","review":"We registered for this pail based on the excellent reviews and fact you can use your own bags. Like the other few previous reviewers, I have found this pail to stink to high heaven, just on day two! It is much easier to just walk to diaper into the kitchen and toss it there, knowing the garbage goes out that night and we don't have to deal with the odor...the diaper champ stunk up the nursery and it took an entire day to smell decent again.Do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"It works ok. I've had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I'm going to find something else. The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven't compared it with other bins, so I couldn't say whether it's the lesser of evils, but hopefully there's something better out there for the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Diaper Pail","review":"At first I thought the Diaper Champ was great, but then my sons diapers began to stink so bad- we finally put the diaper champ at the curb to go with our recycling. The Diaper Champ made my sons bathroom stink like a diaper pail- NO THANKS! We went out and bought the Diaper Genie 2- its the best - no stink what so ever in my sons bathroom.

Literally!","review":"This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!! Everytime you flip the handle you get a whiff of what is underneath! Which would be dirty diapers! If you dont empty it everyday the scent lingers! It is not just my sensitive nose, but this thing can really stink up a room. I clean it every 2 days with Clorox Clean up, Oust odor spray, and put a citrus stick up inside , and it STILL knocks me out with letting the stench escape! I have used this product for 7 weeks, and Im ready to put it out in the garage and use it as the downstairs \\"diaper pail\\" NOT IN THE HOUSE it stinks too bad! The diaper Champ is not such a knockout!

It keeps out odors and it is easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a champ","review":"Bad construction is my main issue. My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you're supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back. There's a little plastic tab that's suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get's cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I've given up on diaper pails in general. Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother looking at another one.","review":"This is the one!! Don't even bother looking at other diaper pails. This is the one that works. Period. (1) It uses regular bags (one less thing you have to buy, or remember getting at the store) (2) I can leave it in the baby's room, rather than in the bathroom, since there's really no odor to peek out of this pail. Truly the best. Also, the bags never get jammed like with the Diaper Geenie."},{"rating":"1","title":"smelly","review":"I have a 2 year old; I stopped using the diaper champ when he turned about 1. The smell was awful. I tried leaving an air fresher in the pail but it still did not help.

We finally just gave up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell is terrible","review":"It's true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie. I am going back to that. I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it! Save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"[...] Even if your nails are not very long, you will inevitably break off whatever you do have opening the top of this diaper pail. And no matter how often you change the bag, it will always smell like poop. I cleaned and disinfected mine to death, even soaking it in Lysol cleaner for days and there is no way to get that smell out. It's really gross. You're better off using it just for wet diapers and putting smelly diapers in a small plastic grocery bag and taking them right out to the garbage cans in the garage until garbage day. I have 3 1/2 year old twins and a 6 month old, and I have not used my Diaper Champ since my twins were a month old. The Diaper Genie may be a pain because you have to purchase refills, but it is much better controlling the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I really like the Diaper Champ. You can use any type of bag (I buy scented bags from the dollar store.) I empty the pail about every four days and my baby's room does not smell. My only problem with the product, I can't seem to open the lid without drawing blood! The lid is difficult to open and you need to use both hands. Other than that, I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok, but watch your fingers and hold your nose!","review":"when changing the bags it's easy to pinch your fingers when opening the cover. it's also stinky. there's no barrier from the rotating portion and the diapers so when the diapers get close to the top it can get pretty stinky...yes, change it often and wash it often. once baby is eating solid food it's tough keeping it from smelling. i wipe daily and wash out once a week, and also change the bag at least 2x's a week. there's got to be something better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This is a great product! It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and don't have to buy special ones. You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand!

I love mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product...but watch your fingers when you try to open!","review":"I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended. The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment. The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight. I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it. That would be my only complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Never got the Diaper Genie as I figured the refill cartridges would add up. Got the Diaper Champ from day one and would highly recommend! I use regular 13 gallon kitchen garbage bags that I guy from [a local store]. Far cheaper than the refills for the Genie and you get tons more! Contains the odor of poopy diapers very well. Nursery never smells! Holds lots of diapers too! Garbage pick up is twice a week, and those are the two days I change the bag... And we all know how often babies dirty their diapers! Fantastic capacity! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Diaper Genie!","review":"I find this better than Diaper Genie. For one, you save $$ from buying bag refills, Diaper Champ uses any bags. It keeps the order in. Easy to use, pull back the handle and the diaper is gone. The only assembly is putting on the bottom piece, requires just two screws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I love this product. It's easy to use, there is no odor, and it uses regular trash bags instead of expensive refills. You do need to tape your diaper into a bundle, otherwise the tape sticks to the cylinder and the diaper gets stuck. It is a little stiff to open, however, this is a good thing when your child is old enough to open it themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love the Diaper Champ. The design makes it so easy to use, and it is wonderful to not have to buy expensive refills. Someone bought us the Diaper Champ off of our registry, and someone else bought us the Diaper Genie.

Odor Champ...YES!!!!!","review":"We purchased this diaper disposal system after looking at all the others, comparing features and prices.

The first couple of days, it was fine. Then we started noticing the odor and it just got worse the longer we used it. Whether there's one diaper or ten, it stinks the same. It performs the same as the cheap $2.00 plastic garbage can with lid that I originally used in the beginning (I should've just kept that one and saved my money). You can literally smell the awful odor permeating through the plastic. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who let the STINK OUT!!!","review":"We bought the Diaper Champ to start with because of the every day trash bags you can use, the holding capicity, ease of use, etc, etc. Boy were we suckered. We have been using this product for 7 and a half months, and that has been about 3 to 4 months to LONG!!! As soon as my daughter started solids, the smell has been slowly creeping up a little bit more every day. Now that thing is stinking the whole house up. It has no odor control at all. I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby. Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you. Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one. I'd say look for something else! if you want a one and only investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for us!","review":"If you wrap up the diaper with the tape, it keeps the smell out just fine.

I thought I'd try the champ to save $ on the genie refills. Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags. The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it. The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier. I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child's room-they wouldn't be able to get into it! Don't waste your $ to \\"save\\" $! Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!! Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPER SMELLY!!!","review":"I would not recommend this to anyone! Its really easy but it smells all the time. You could smell it down the hallway it was so bad. We even bought the air fresheners that you plug into the wall and it didn't improve the smell at all. I still use it for wet diapers but if there is a dirty one I take it outside to the trash can so it doesn't smell up my house.Try anything but the diaper champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy but Smelly","review":"This is easy, but horribly smelly.

No complaints here","review":"I bought the diaper champ after a lot of people told me it was unnecessary, and I am happy that I did. It is simple to put together, easy to use, and doesn't need any special bags. A plain old trash bag will do. I don't have any complaints on the smell, I don't even notice a difference.

And when the shoot gets stuck, the poopy diapers get all over the shoot and you have to stick your hand in it to pull them out! GROSS. It did fight the odor and it would be hard for a toddler to get into it.... Still, the fact is that it's not big enough and it's unsanitary. You would probably be able to get about 5 bigger diapers in it before the shoot sticks! Like my husband says, \\"I have that thing!\\" It's now in the corner of our garage. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCKY YUCKY STINKY STINKY!!!","review":"Do not waste your money!!!! I just threw my 8 month old Champ out FINALLY!!! Could not take closing their door at night anymore!! I was starting to put the thing in the hallway so the room did not smell like a barn in the morning!!!! Went and got the NEAT 2. Totally odor-free FIANLLY!!! The $5.00 bags are worth not an ounce of smell. What a disappointment!! Not to mention how grossed out I would become when the cylindar did not go down fully and I have to push with my hand. YUCK! A DIRTY DIAPER WAS JUST THERE!!! Trust this review!!! I know someone else with one of these and SAME THING!!!! P-U!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Thing STINKS","review":"We read all the reviews and wanted the convenience of using regular bags. After using the Champ for 1 month I have to say that it does control the odors so far.HOWEVER, it is sometimes very difficult to open it up. *Sometimes it will tip over if you don't lift the hatch perfectly.*The diapers we use are size 1 and we wrap them up tight. They STILL get stuck in the plunger. The hole is too small for the diapers to go on. I'll open it and there are 3 diapers stuck in the hole. Unless you perfectly place the diaper, wrapped super tight, they will get stuck. I can't imagine what will happen when the diapers get larger.I am disappointed overall with this product. I would like to see these concerns addressed by the company. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"I do admit I like the idea of using regular trash bags but the oder that it leaves is horrible. I couldn't stand the smell any longer and got rid of the Diaper Champ! It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NEWBORNS DO NOT HAVE SMELLY DIAPERS! So of course you will not smell anything until your little one starts to eat more solid foods. It is just disgusting! I highly recommend saving yourself $30 and taking the trash out once a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!","review":"I'm SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail. We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down. There's no twisting and no special liners to buy. As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they're not changed often enough. We don't have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy). When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ. We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby. Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first. You'll be amazed at how easy it is to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumpster will always be best","review":"My son is 17 months old now and the thing with diaper pails is that the dumptser outside will always be the best place for those solid-food-eating stinky diapers. We've had this one from the beginning, and it's good enough for wet diapers, but we don't dare put stinky diapers in there. Even with only putting wet diapers in, when we change out the bag, we let the pail sit outside, opened up and sprayed with lysol overnight before putting a new bag in and putting it back in the house. I just don't know that you can really expect \\"odor-free\\" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out. I'm sure the smell factor will worsen now, so, trying to decide with another baby on the way if we'll buy yet another one of these or go with a different pail that requires expensive bags--???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad smells","review":"I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell. I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in. We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper champ user for a year","review":"My son is now a year old and we still use our champ. It did start to stink when he was about 7 months old despite our efforts to wipe and spray it with every bag change. We took it apart and thoroughly scrubbed it and soaked the stinkiest parts. We realized that the foam piece holds the majority of the stink. After putting it back together, the foam piece eventually came loose and came out. I thought that it may not have a good seal without the foam but it actually works better without it. I'm happy to read that the foam came out for other people too - I thought I caused it to come loose when I washed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not smell proof","review":"This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof. I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ye t","review":"We had the \\"Champ\\" (aka Chump) for less than 3 weeks before the odor became unbearable. Even tried using deodorized bags and had a Stick-Up in the diaper pail. And within the same time the tumbler started to stick - it wouldn't slide from one side to the other without an extra push. Save your money and your time - skip this dud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I like the one-hand functionality and it passes the odor test. Best of all, you don't need special expensive refill bags.Just make sure your diaper is wrapped closed or you'll have to clean the diaper shoot that goes into bag area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if you have twins or are using cloth diapers","review":"I bought the Diaper Champ last year when I first had my twins, and I think it only got used for about a month. The rubber seal broke off and released the stink into the room. The container is also too small and I found myself changing the liner too often. The lid is also very hard (and painful) to open. Watch out if you have nails! We use cloth diapers, which I found to pile one on top of the other as the can got fuller. I would then have to shake the can or reach in and disperse the diapers so that I can fill it further. Often I would have to push the piston down with my hand to force the diaper into the can when it got stuck. The piston and cylinder area would get soiled and I would have to often clean it. If you have twins or if you are using cloth diapers, I do not recommend this product. Instead we use a plastic flip-top lid container with a stick-up in it and have been very happy with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy with the Champ","review":"We purchased the Diaper Champ because you can use standard garbage bags which are extremely easy to change. The bags are secured nicely inside so they don't shift while the mechanism pushes the diapers into them. We have had no odor problems from the pail (we use the Glad Odor Guard bags). This pail has been everything we expected it to be. Its easy to clean and maintain. I recommend to anyone who wants a no nonsense pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I bought this pail before my son was born. First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it. I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky!","review":"I bought this diaper pail because of the good online rating and the fact that I didn't have to worry about special refills--just standard garbage bags. Well, I was happy with it--until my son turned 5 months old and started eating solids. Whew! Very stinky! This diaper pail does not contain odors! I've even tried scented garbage bags and stickups. We're buying a Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible..had to buy something different","review":"I chose this pail because I didn't want to spend alot on a daiper pail. In the end, I spent more because I had to buy a different one. After only a few months of using it, the seal broke and the odor came through. The latch would get stuck making it difficult to change the bag. This is certainly not worth buying!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It STINKS!!!!","review":"I hate it!!! It is a horrible product that in no way keeps the diaper smells in. It worked fine for the first couple of months, but the diapers barely stunk then. Shortly after that, it started really stinking, I'm talking about stinking up the whole back of the house! It stunk even when it was empty! I tried cleaning it many times with bleach and changed out the gaskets twice!!! After 8 months of stinkiness, I threw it away!!! I bought it in the first place because it had good reviews and got a good review in a book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diapers get caught in bag - terrible","review":"We bought this specifically so we wouldn't have to get the refills. After four days, we bleached it and took it back. The bags fall off or gets caught when you flip the diaper to dispose of it. Sometimes we'd open it to see that half the diapers had fallen behind the bag.Great idea but needs some engineering refinement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ is the best, hands down!!!","review":"I love the Diaper Champ! It holds a ton of diapers, it doesn't stink, it's easy to use, and you can use regular garbage bags instead of having to buy expensive refills! I can't believe how good the odor control is. I buy the cheap scented garbage bags from the Dollar Store and they keep any odor from escaping! I will never use anything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ is worth the money!","review":"My husband and I debated between the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ. Several friends recommended the Diaper Champ because it used ordinary kitchen bags rather than specialized bags like the Diaper Genie requires. So - we went with the Diaper Champ. Through time, like all other diaper pails, odor will permeate into the plastic container. My daughter is now two and I'm expecting #2 in October. I intend to recycle my two year old Diaper Champ before the baby arrives with a brand new one. I highly recommend this product especially for the ease of use, cost efficient bagging system and odor eliminating feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets stuck all the time!","review":"Our Diaper Champ kept getting stuck, either on the diaper tape or something on the gasket. This is not a good thing, especially at 4am after very significant output from our daughter. The Diaper Champ does a great job of containing the smell, but only if you can get the diaper in there. :-( Also, Diaper Champ's customer support was very disappointing. We returned our Diaper Champ for a Diaper Dekor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diaper Champ Wins Hands Down!","review":"I tell everyone I know who is having a new baby to get this instead of the Genie. The biggest advantage is being able to use regular kitchen size garage bags. The Genie refills are expensive and do not last very long. The Champ also holds more diapers and is easy to use with larger sized diapers as baby grows. You will get a smell when the Champ is full. I just give mine a spray of Lysol when I change the bags--- something you would do with the Genie too. I also don't think it's hard to change the bags--- you just have to do it a few times. I used a Diaper Genie with my first baby and switched to a regular trash can after a few months. With my second child I got the Diaper Champ and it is so much easier, economical and more eco-friendly. I've been using it for 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SMELL?????","review":"I don't know how everyone can say this diaper pail keeps in the diaper odor. Sure at first it does pretty well with a breastfed baby's soiled diapers, but once they get into solids it is no better than a garbage can. The smell was so bad I had to move it to the patio. The entire room smelled like nasty urine and poop and, somehow, small nats (baby flies) would grow inside of the bag in the diapers! Even, though, we would empty it once per week because otherwise the smell was unbearable. Another thing you really do hurt your fingers everytime you open it and for a low maintenance mommy like me a short length nail is all I have, but this darn thing makes sure break even that off. The pail itself develops a permanent stench of diapers that no matter how you wash it, it just won't leave. I used it for my first two children and now I'm expecting my third and I've registered for the diaper genie. In conclusion good for the first couple of months, but more than that just use a garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Chump","review":"This pail might be fine for disposables, but it's a pain if you're using cloth diapers and a service. It's really hard to keep clean (it gets pretty disgusting), it doesn't hold a whole week of diapers, the diapers fall in the middle and don't distribute evenly so it seems full before it is, and now that we're at the second size up (my baby's 5 months old) the diapers barely fit in the hole. I often end up just opening it completely and putting the diapers in underneath, bypassing the so-called handy one-hand flip method completely. I hate the thing. I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill. I'd never recommend it to anyone using cloth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you are a new mom or just in the market for a place to dispose of dirty diapers do not get this product. It does not contain the smell even after changing the bag daily. I hear the older models are much better. There is no tight seal and the smell just leaks out. Not worth the money. I stopped using this product after about 2 months. I now just tie up the diaper and put it in the trash!Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I researched prior to purchasing the genie...loved it!! No smell. But the refills where an additional cost I didn't want to pay for. After the cutting mechanism broke on the genie I bought the champ. Yes it holds dirty diapers, yes you have to clean it, and yes it sits in our garage because the smell of dirty diapers is way too noticable. If you are worried about oder...don't get the champ. I will give it a thumbs up for convenience. My 18mo old puts her own diapers in the champ (in the garage) and turns the lever. Just don't let it get too full or you can't turn the lever...that makes since though doesn't it???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for newborns, too stinky for toddlers","review":"Our son is 10 months old now and we finally had to toss the Champ. We originally bought it because we could use our own trash bags. We figured by changing it frequently, it would keep the odor away. But once our son started with the solids, we couldn't take it anymore. This unit is difficult to keep clean. If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be GREAT except.....","review":"We initially were very happy with the Diaper Champ- smell control was adequate, easy to use & cost effective to replace bags. BUT the foam(?) gasket that goes around the opening came apart after just a couple months. Then it became very difficult to turn the opening, kept sticking and getting caught. So we just finally took the gasket completely off which decreased the smell control. So we bought another one thinking that it must be a fluke but the same thing happened within a month! Our baby is only 7 months old and we have been through two Diaper Champs so we decided enough is enough and bought a Diper Dekor. We were disapointed because we didn't want to have to buy special refill bags plus we liked the easy design of the Diaper Champ, you could toss a diaper in one handed while your other hand was busy with baby, but the faulty gasket deal was too irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Horrible","review":"I would not reccommend this to anyone. It smells horrible and the diapers always seem to get stuck. I had to go out and buy a new diaper bail which was much cheaper and worked better. This diaper bail does not stand up to the competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET","review":"I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product. I have emailed Baby Trend for a refund so I can go buy something else. I am even nursing my daughter and the stench from her \\"odorless\\" pail is horrific. I cannot believe they didn't make a space for a deodorizer. I'm pretty shocked at how bad it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks and diapers get stuck","review":"I've had tthis through two children now and I just hate the thing.

If I paid $100 for this thing i would be upset"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"We've been using this diaper pail for two and a half years. It stinks. We decided to put it in the garage and just toss the diapers in the kitchen garbage, as it was getting taken out more frequently. I got tired of taking diapers into the kitchen though, and brought it back inside. After two days of using it again (with an air freshener in the bottom, my daughter's room stunk again. Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work. Then you find yourself pulling gross wipes out just to get the thing to flip over and sometimes you have to open it to pull them out. Opening it releases a nasty odor into the room which lingers for hours. I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for only few months","review":"Well, I thought it was an OK product at first. It does seal out the orders reasonably well. However I do not recommend it, because after 6 month of use, the rubber part on top is coming off, making it impossible to use .Since \\u0010I have read about this problem in other reviews, I do not believe its a fluke. Notice that most positive reviews are from people who have not had it very long. I will replace it with a stainless steel trash can. Save your money, do not buy this product, because it will break after few months ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regular cleaning and febreeze only kept the odor contained for 10 months......","review":"I had to rush out recently because the \\"odor seal\\" on the product had thinned out and has caused the dirty smell to linger throughout the house (I change the diaper bag regularly so it's not for lack of care).

The champ tends to stick about half of the time. The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through. I suggest using a trash can with a tight lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it! It Smells!","review":"I bought this because my sister bought the original Diaper champ and loved it. Shortly after that I went to buy one and I had no choice but to buy the new and improved model ( At Babies R US, at amazon you can get the older model) . This is horrible! Imageine the worst smell and that's what you get in your bathroom or childs room ( wherever you store it ) . It is so embaressing to have company over bc you have to warn them about the smell in the bathroom. I agree, diapers do get stuck when turning and forget about throwing a pull up in there. It gets all trapped and is almost impossible to turn the lever. I deep clean this thing with lysol, clorox wipes and spray, and also I put it into the bath tub and scrub it. I don't think I should have to do that. When I contacted Baby Trend I got blown off. The guy could've cared less. If you're going to get one, get the older model off of here. My sister seems to be pretty pleased with hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Diaper Pail!","review":"We were all ABOUT the diaper genie until we found this. It's the BEST.

I only wish we had another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Whoever said baby poop doesn't smell must be lacking the sense of smell. Yes, you should wipe the DC out occasionally or spray with Lysol, but so what. I can't imagine shelling out [money] for diaper gynie refills. If you have a really smelly diaper, take the trash out sooner--just like with kitchen scraps. There is no diaper pail that is bottomless and smell-free. The DC works very well. Not a panacea but we're talking poop and pee here not bouquets of roses."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!!","review":"One star is one too many for this piece of crap. The Diaper Champ SUCKS!! I have zero praise to offer. It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands. SAVE YOUR MONEY!

However, it does not confine the smell of dirty diapers. I have to throw dirty diapers directly into regular trash right away. Otherwise, it a very useful product to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked at first but not anymore","review":"I bought the Champ because I didn't want to have to buy the special bags for the Genie and at first it worked great. Very easy just to flip the top with one hand. Sometimes a wipe would get stuck between the plunger and the outer lid and would need to be pulled out. One day when the Champ was only about 3 or 4 months old I pulled out what I thought was a wipe and it was the liner that had come disconnected. Ever since that liner came out it has not kept the odor in. I have been changing the bags every couple of days and dumping baby powder in the new bags to absorb the smell but I'm through playing around with this thing and I'm getting a different diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"good at the beginning, awful later on","review":"the diaper champ was really great at the beginning. no smell when closed, use own bags..., but oh my, we've had this pail now for a year and it STINKS! if you keep it in a well ventilated area like the bathroom (fan on and windows open) i guess i would recommend it, but if you keep the pail in the baby's room don't get it. not only does her soiled diapers' smell fill the room, but the pail itself starts to smell. i think it may be because they have foam lined inside the opening parts. in the end it's up to you, but i'm chucking mine out and getting something new...*PU*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"When I did research on diaper pails before my baby arrived I liked that you didn't have to buy refills and the smell didn't seem to be a big issue with the Diaper Champ. I didn't keep my receipt to return it but I'm going to spend another $30 to buy the Diaper Genie. The Diaper Champ is extrememly smelly and I feel that I can tolerate a lot. The most frustrating disappointment was that it was constantly jamming. I was constantly having to open the top and manually stuff the diaper down into the base. My friend bought the Diaper Champ as well and has also returned hers for the exact same reasons.

It is super-easy to use and to change bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product!","review":"This diaper disposal system is, in my opinion, better than the diaper genie because you can use your own trash bags and not have to buy their refills. It's much easier to use and does what it's supposed to, keep the odor out. The Diaper Champ is unbelievably easy to use (my 4 year old loves to flip the lid and \\"help\\" mom with diaper changes) and that is helpful when you have to keep a hand on the baby. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is because when you open it to pull out a full trashbag, there is nothing stopping the odor from escaping at that point. You should do it outside, not in the nursery. But other than that, it's economical and works like a charm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true diaper champ","review":"This system is great. I had a diaper genie and hated it. Having to buy special refills was costly and then at times when I would do the twisting it would not seal but instead cut the bag and I would have to start the roll over.

I love It!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ Far Exceeds Safety First \\"Neat Diaper\\"","review":"While both the Safety First \\"Neat Diaper\\" and the Baby Trend \\"Diaper CHamp\\" got good overall reviews, the difference between the \\"Neat Diaper\\" and the \\"Diaper Champ\\" is incomparable! The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands. The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber. ALso, the Neat Diaper requires that you use their brand of plastic bags, which didn't last very long, while the Champ let's you use any common medium trash baggie (though a bit awkward to install) Wasted my money on the Neat Diaper. Don't know why this problem was not noted by other reviewers. The Diaper CHamp is our new champion."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like a stinky house this one is for you!","review":"After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie. What a difference!I like that Champ is easy to use and cheap (no special expensive refill bags) but it didn't do one thing that it was created to do: keep the house smell free!It's in my basement now! A completely useless product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky from the Start","review":"We were totally dissatisfied with the results from our Diaper Champ...we had a problem with odor escaping right from the start...and our daughter was breast fed exclusively for 10 months, so it had nothing to do with a change in her diet. Over time we noticed that the foam pieces of the pail do become increasingly stinky and are very difficult to clean...even bleach couldn't get the smell out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"diaper champ","review":"I am using the Daiper Champ for the disposal of my colostomy bags. It has saved me many trips outside to the garbage can. Now I only need to empty it once a week. There is very little smell. Of course there is more smell when you open it to change the bag. I am considering putting in a toilet deoderizer for this purpose. I am very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks so bad~","review":"This pail was given to me as a gift. when I had my first child. Well he is 2 now and I have a baby girl who will be turning one next month and I have to say it is the most worse diaper pail in the world. Not only do I have to change the pail every other day. But it likes to hold in the smell. I have done everything from bleaching it. Scrubbing it. Soap. White Vinegar. i even let it sit outside in sun. Cause I live in sunny FL. And that didn't help Instead it ends up bringing in these nasty flies. Now I am shopping around for another one. Cause my son is going to potty training and I can't stand the smell no more. it stinks up my whole bathroom and bedroom. Its disgusting. From all the cleaning and everything. It cause it to crack on the top. I am very dissappointed in the product and will not buy another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read before purchasing . . .","review":"If you are like me you research and research before you purchase a product. Many of the online reviews raved about how well this product eliminating the diaper odor. However, I do not agree with the raving reviews. For the first couple of month this product worked at eliminating the diaper odor, but after a few months you would have found this item out on my porch to air out. Even after cleaing it once a week - It did not trap the smelly diaper odor. I just don't feel for the amount of money this was it was worth cleaning more than once a week. I should of just purchased a rubbermaid trash bin. I personally would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Champ? The smell WILL knock you out!","review":"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I'd heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I've had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I'm looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I'd drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that's when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter's nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won't be returning for a come-back fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly in the long run!","review":"I received this diaper champ as a gift and at first it was great. Now that my baby is 9 months old her room is starting to smell. Since the diaper champ doesn't individually wrap each diaper the smell starts getting bad. I would suggest you spend the extra 10 to 20 bucks and get a diaper product that individually wraps each diaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I like the Diaper Champ. It is easy to use and it doesn't leave my son's nursery smelling like diapers. Let's face it, this IS for dirty diapers, so there is going to be some smell, but it really is minimal. The only time I really smell the diapers is when I am changing the bag. I didn't see the point of wasting money to buy refills for the Genie. I LOVE that I can use regular kitchen garbage bags for this. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the diapers sometimes get caught in the channel that dumps into the bag. I have found that to solve this problem most of the time, just be sure that the diaper tabs are stuck to the diaper rather than left flapping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to good...","review":"The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!! After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down. It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the competition","review":"I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ. I prefer the Diaper Champ because it does not utilize expensive refills and it keeps the odor in better than the Diaper Dekor. The Diaper Dekor broke, the arm that lifts the lid up broke off. So I had to go searching for a new product again since they discontinued the model that I was using. I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check. Let's face it, even the best can't keep in that smell, especially as your child gets older. I have two children now, so the Diaper Champ is getting utilized quite a bit and it beats the competition hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEFINITE MUST HAVE","review":"I laughed when my husband wanted this product. I felt it was a waste of money and that you could just throw the diapers in the garage. Well thats not a good idea. We have the diaper champ and never smell anything. This is a great item that every parent needs. Its easy to use, and you can use your own bags. We actually use kitchen bags, and they hold quite a few diapers. We only have to change the bag out about once a week. I can't say enough great things about the diaper champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!","review":"I also had heard the rave reviews about the Diaper Champ versus the Genie. So I got two Champs with the birth of my daughter. When we had to begin shutting the nursery door after our cat was jumping in the crib, the diaper smell upon opening the door was almost unbearable. Yes, I do change it 2x per week and wipe it completely down but I still notice the smell. I was sold on the usage of regular garbage bags with it but I realize that may be part of the problem. There is nothing sealing the smells in. The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain. If the tabs of the diaper are not securely wrapped around the diaper they will get stuck in the tube and you have to open it up, thus releasing the stench. Friends have said they don't go through the Genie refills as quickly as I had feared, which was one of my reservations about it. If I had to do it again, I would probably go with the Genie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"I recently gave birth to my third child. When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it. Not to mention that the \\"sausage links\\" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them. With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try. I LOVE IT! In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there. I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little. So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it's still a great product. I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with cloth diapers","review":"We use cloth diapers and the compartment that flips around to drop it into the pail was not big enough. The diapers got caught in it and ripped the gasket off causing the pail to malfunction. We had to return it which just puts plastic in the landfill. It is very difficult to work the latch/blue clip to open the pail. My guess it that it would work much better for disposables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"Do not spend your money on this! I thought this would be a great idea - no special bags or deodorizers, but it is the most FRUSTRATING thing! Like other people have said, wipes and diapers get stuck in pail as you turn it, and you have to stand on it to be able to turn it. I am looking right now for a better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!!","review":"This product is horrible. It does not keep the odor from soiled diapers in. The entire baby's room stunk of poop. We had to put it outside on the deck to keep it from smelling the house up. Horrible horrible product. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss my Genie!","review":"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!! The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with. The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try...but can't beat the Diaper Genie","review":"We bought this in desperation because we couldn't figure out how the diaper genie works. During a visit with family, my brother-in-law showed us how to use the Genie. We then put the Diaper Champ in our baby's room and the Genie in the bathroom.There really is an odor problem with the Diaper Champ. We ended up using the Genie for Dirty Diapers and the Champ for Wet diapers only.I went online to see the reviews and I am amazed to find similar experiences. Truly Honest reviews.1. Gives off too much odor2. Tough to open3. Takes too much spaceI'm a clean freak and I use Clorox on everything. The smell disappears for a day but will soon start again once a single dirty diaper stays overnight in the Champ."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bags to Buy","review":"I love this item. It doesn't stink like the Diaper Genie and is definitely not as complicated to use. Just insert diaper and pull handle. No special bags. Just make sure that your diaper is properly closed (no tape hanging around) because that can cause jambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the smell all depends on your child's age","review":"This pail was great when my baby only ate formula. As this is a hectic time, I found it very convenient to use the same garbage bags that I used for my kitchen. But once my baby started eating solid food - WHEW!!!!! The whole house smelled!!!! We have since purchased a diaper genie ... and it is still the master!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So SIMPLE!","review":"This is great! It's simple to use- which new moms anad dads especially love! And like another stated- you use REGULAR garbage bags- way more cost effective! You can get good bags in bulk and still pay way less than the diaper genie refills. I haven't had an odor problem and I agree all pails will lessen in effectiveness as their diets change- your poop doesn't smell like roses either! HAHHA My husband told the husband of my friend that purchased this for us- (they didn't have kids at the time) \\"I know you don't know what it is- but it's GREAT thank you!\\" Now if it gets the men talking- it's a product worth checking into.oh and when the piston seems to stick change the bag or start wrapping the diapers with it's tabs so they don't stick to the side and cause problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use but it STINKS!","review":"I really liked it in the beginning, especially how easy it was to use. But as time has gone by, it has really begun to allow odors to escape, or it is absorbing them I don't know which, but it really SMELLS! I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags. I'll be buying something else this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It started out nice","review":"We have had the champ almost a year now and at first it was great we used regular kitchen trash bags, but recently it just hit stink mode. I think it has to do with the seal on the chute I can see that it has torn off, it looks like yellow foam material. I checked the warranty and it is conveniently for only six months. I have a feeling the manufacturers know about this little problem. That said it was a good product at first and I can see how early on it gets great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it--and ended up buying a diaper genie","review":"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant. It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad. Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers. Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn't want to spend the money on the refills. However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie. What a difference!! The only time smell escapes is when we empty it. To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell. If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the \\"champ\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!!!!!","review":"I registered for this item because of the rave reviews given on this website. I am throwing it away and buying my second Diaper Genie today. This item stinks in more ways than one!!! Unless your baby has very neat poop and you can wrap the diaper up carefully around all of it, poop will get all over the dispensing mechanism of this container. With time, even if you clean this container, the odor becomes unbearable when you have to change the bags. I bought a Diaper Genie to see if it was any better. I love it!!!! No stink and no nausea with bag chages is worth the extra money for the bag inserts to me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This broke before my son was even 4 months old. The blue ring/seal around the top stopped working, which made it impossible to put more diapers into it. I called baby trend, and they emailed me instructions to fix it, but they didn't work. I have a friend with the exact same issue. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product STINKS!","review":"I have been so disappointed in my Diaper Champ. It came highly recommended by a good friend, and the fact that it used normal grocery bags rather than expensive specialty bags was a huge draw. However, we have tried everything and still this pail stinks up our son's nursery. And it's not just a faint smell. The stench is so powerful that it practically knocks you down when you open the door. It doesn't matter how often we empty or clean and sanitize it, nothing seems to help. We would have to empty it after every diaper change, and that sort of defeats the purpose of having a diaper pail. Go with something different. It would be worth the extra money to get rid of the odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I highly recommend the Diaper Champ over the Playtex Diaper Genie. Its is very easy to use and most importantly, it will save you money by allowing you to use regular trash bags which you can't do with the other diaper disposal units out there. It does contain the odor very nicely. I ensure that the odors are kept in check by using Sassy baby disposable diaper sacks, also sold on amazon. They ensure that those poopie diapers don't get the diaper champ dirty. It also holds a lot of diapers, but we always empty it out every week."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE IT!","review":"Smells terrible and always jams up!!! We could smell the dirty diapers as soon as you walk in the babys room. Also, the diaper \\"chute\\" would jam up all the time, you would have to slam it to get the diapers loose. I'm trying the Diaper Genie ...wish me luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden mess/odor","review":"The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile. When the diapers get bigger, or if you have a messy one that leaks a bit as it's being pushed down into the system, BEWARE. We noticed that the odor coming from the Champ was stronger than normal even when we cleaned it & it was empty. Upon closer inspection we noticed that between the weight that pushes the diapers down, and the side of the 'chute' on the Champ, that there was quite a hidden mess. This mess was nearly impossible to clean and we were disgusted by it. Bottom line, this wasn't bad for a little while, but after seeing (and smelling) that disgusting mess, I'm going back for the Genie, expensive bags & all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't sem like a champ to me","review":"I got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift and was disappointed, because of some bad reviews I did not think it would work. I took the Diaper Genie to my Mom's house, since she babysits during the day, and I purchased the Diaper Champ for my house. The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken. I have purchased a Diper Genie for my house and it is working wonderfully all you have to do is follow the directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they really test this with cloth diapers?","review":"I received this as a gift, since I am planning to cloth diaper, and I played with it to figure it out. The hole for the diapers is too small! A *clean and carefully folded* non-infant cloth diaper fits into the receptacle with difficulty, and then stays stuck rather than dropping. A used diaper MIGHT fall more easily because of its extra weight, but it sure won't fit through the hole more easily. Who wants to fuss with a dirty diaper? I like the idea behind the Diaper Champ, and it's probably fine for disposables, but I'm returning mine for something more practical for cloth diapering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but Neat is better","review":"We bought the Diaper Champ with our 1st child and used it until we had another child. It was great while he was being breast fed and wasn't that stinky but as he got older and ate a more varied diet it just stopped containing the smell. We changed the bags and wiped it out every few days and used lots of Lysol and it still smelled. Also after a while the cylinder that pushes the diaper down started to slide too far and get stuck and then it became a huge pain the drop a diaper in. Half the time you would have to tip the whole pail over or open the top to get a new diaper in.With our second child we bought the NEAT by saftey first, she is now a year and we LOVE it. It even contained the smell of our older childs diapers before potty training."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U.","review":"Although the idea of not spending money on a pricey canister with refills may seem tempting, for my next child I am tossing this Diaper Champ and buying another brand. I have to keep it out in the garage, that's how bad it smells. Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$. Keep Looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ Works","review":"The Diaper Champ is a life saver. We have had no problems with odor at all as some other reviewers have complained of. We empty it out about 2 times per week and only when we open the lid to take the trash bag out do we smell anything. Once it's sealed shut, no stench whatsoever. No complaints about the Diaper Champ, especially since it is so easy on the pocket-book compared to the rest of the diaper pails out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diaper pail no need for expensive refills","review":"It is easy to use and great because you can use regular garbage bags. It definitely does a good job of containing the odors for us. We have some friends who tried it and found that it didn't contain the odors for them. I think that it really depends on how smelly your baby's poops are. Looser stools tend to be smellier and messier. If it is leaking out of the diaper, it could touch the sides and cause odors that way as well. I have a 3 year old who just got potty trained and a 6 month old and was using the diaper champ for both of them and had no problem with odors. I also use Lysol after every bag change."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 8 months of use looking for new diaper disposal system","review":"When my daughter (now 8 months old) was younger, and her diapers were smaller, the Diaper Champed worked well. But now that her diapers are bigger (and stinkier) I find that the Champ only holds about 10-12 diapers before getting jammed, especially if we put wipes in it along with diapers. Another thing is the velcro on the diapers often gets stuck and it's difficult to flip the diapers into the bottom of the container. Another problem is the smell, the champ doesn't seem to contain odors any better than putting diapers into a regular trash can. I've never used any other diaper disposal container so I don't know how this one compares, but I am now looking for a new one b/c the Diaper Champ just isn't cutting it for me. Half the time I end up just throwing the dirty diapers into a waste basket to avoid the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke!!","review":"I loved the Diaper Champ until it would no longer work! We've only had it 2 and 1/2 months and it's broken. It could just be ours, but I thought I would write a review anyway. I don't think we'll buy another one. We'll just be grocery bagging it from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying Another Champ","review":"My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and we bought a Champ when she was born. It worked like a charm until she was completely on solids/milk in which case the stinch overwhelmed the Champ. BUT I have heard this is the case with the Genie's as well. We moved the Champ to the garage and all was well. She is now potty trained - yippee! And we are expecting Baby #2. I'm buying another Diaper Champ to go upstairs. I will concur that it is difficult to open but then, my husband became in charge of emptying it on trash days and he managed it just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST DIAPER PAIL OUT THERE","review":"Before registering for this diaper pail, I researched all of them. I found this to be the most cost efficient and easy. To combat odor and the mess, which we haven't experienced, we use the scented tall trash bags and put the soiled diapers in a small disposable diaper bag(Baby First) to eliminate odor and mess. Needless to say this is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"Because you don't have to buy any refills, thank goodness, and I have a baby trend travel system that is truely awesome, I thought I'd give it a go.I couldn't be happier...no smells, easy to use and very economical for our tight budget, this pail stands up to it's name...a true champ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of 2 girls","review":"My friends think I am strange, but I have to show my Diaper Champ off to anyone that comes in my house:) I recieved a diaper genie as a gift when I had my daughter three years ago and hated it.

I think the best thing about this diaper pail is that it is so large that the bag does not need to be changed all the time. Also, my husband loved the design so much he was willing to change diapers for a while just so that he could put them in the pail.

You may pay a bit more for the Genie and the liners but your nose will thank you later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells as child gets older","review":"The diaper champ worked pretty well until maybe our son was about 12 months or so. I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it. His room always smells like a poopy diaper that was just changed, even after it's been cleaned and you've just added one diaper to it. I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS","review":"For the first few months I thought this product was great, but I was wrong.

We first got one in 2003, and when we did, we LOVED it. One-handed operation, plus NO SMELL. None. We bought a second one a few years later when the first one pooped out (pun intended!)Recently we needed a new one, and went to buy one here. We noticed the design had changed -- maybe it was somehow easier to use? Because there was no way they could improve on the smell. Like I said, NO SMELL.But the new one lets those acrid aromatics seep through, particularly when you operate it. The smell is DEFINITELY coming through. I'm very disappointed. For so many years, this operated beautifully, and now they are like every other diaper pail on the market. Only twice the price.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Smelly, Hard to Open, Diapers Get Caught in Mechanism","review":"I am really disappointed with this product. It really starts to smell after one day (and my baby is only 8 weeks old and is on breastmilk), which of course causes the baby's room to smell. By the end of the second day the room is pretty stinky. The way you open it is very poorly designed, making it difficult to open -- half the time I hurt a finger or break a nail. My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick. so you then have to go in there and tear the diaper off and try to pull out the little stuck piece, which is very difficult to do and incredibly aggravating. This product STINKS! I am now trying to decide between a diaper genie and a diaper dekor or just using a regular diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky, Stinky","review":"I am a first time Mom and I have to say that this is the worst diaper pail...ever! As a matter of fact, we stopped using it 2 1/2 months ago and my son is only 4 months old. The smell was awful. I used trash bags in the Diaper Champ, cleaned it out every 2-3 days (scrubbed the inside with soap and hot water) and disinfected it but it still smelled like a poopy diaper. Not to mention that it made my son's room smell like the city dump. I would not recommned this to anyone. Try another diaper pail or just use a plain old trash can and empty it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best diaper pail in town","review":"I love this diaper pail. It doesn't require any special bags which is the biggest selling point. If you want to, you can buy a heavy ply trash bag that now has odor protection and it's still cheaper than re-fills.The trash bags are easy to put in and take out, yet they securely stay in place. While some my complain that it's not \\"odor-proof\\", you do need to empty it at least once a week, but why wouldn't you. My husband and I, or any guest for that matter, have not noticed any smells from it.I also love how easy it is to throw the diaper in it and turn the handle... no twisting of any sort needed. This diaper pail is by far the best value around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!","review":"We had this product for a while. At first it was great, we thought it was better than the Diaper Genie, no need to buy extra bags. But after 3 months, it starts to smell. It stinks so bad! no matter how much we clean it, the smell stays around & it only gets worst. I wish we had kept our Diaper Genie. Now we are searching for another brand, if anyone of you know another product that don't need special bags & does not smell over time please share it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SMELLY","review":"This is a great item for the first few months-very easy to use, doesn't stink. But give it a few months and look out! The smell is terrible! I've tried baking soda, air fresheners (including the disinfecting ones), scented bags and have even gone so far as letting it soak in bleach for a day, but that didn't do squat. Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck. My son's room reeks since the smell seeps out 24/7. Off to buy a different one-too bad since my son enjoys depositing his diapers-until they get stuck and he gets frustrated! AVOID THIS ONE OR BE PREPARED TO SHELL OUT MORE $$ DOWN THE ROAD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have bought Diaper Champs for baby shower gifts","review":"My daughter is 18 months old and we have been using the Diaper Champ her whole life. I love the Diaper Champ. It is cheap (no refills) and DOES NOT smell (unless you neglect to take out the bag for long periods of time). I love this product so much I have recommended it to many others...I actually have bought 2 more as baby shower gifts. Both mothers I bought the Diaper Champ for love it too. Great, great, great diaper pail. You need to purchase this...you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My husband picked out this diaper pail because it uses regular garbage bags instead of pricey refills. I have to say that we absolutely love it! It is very easy to use, just put the diaper in the top and flip the handle. No smashing or twisting, which my husband really likes! We've been using it for two weeks now and haven't noticed any smells getting through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Diaper Genie","review":"I am disappointed with the Diaper Champ. It worked great in the beginning, when my daughter's dirty diapers didn't smell that bad!!! But now she's 8 months old, eating solid food and her diapers smell pretty bad. The diaper Champ has let me down. It definitely does not control the odor. I read a couple of the reviews that say it does, but from what I read, most of those reviewers still had young babies. Once your baby gets older, it does NOT control the odor anymore. I have two other friends with older babies that have the Champ and both agree, the Diaper Champ STINKS, both literally and figuratively! I would stick with the Diaper Genie. I know it's a pain to buy the refills, but it's worth it to control the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems Dog Proof","review":"Our diaper service provides a large diaper bucket with a flip open lid. We were concerned it wouldn't keep out our dogs who have less than appetizing \\"food\\" choices, so we bought a diaper champ. It's a great design and kind of fun to use. The only down side, and for us it meant temporary retirment of the diaper champ, is it only holds a couple days worth of cloth diapers for a newborn. (We were going through about 15 to 20 a day.) We had to go back to the larger bucket and lock the dogs out when we leave the house. Can't comment on the smells since our baby is only breastfed and there aren't any smells. We are in the process of doing \\"infant potty training\\" which is how baby wastes are dealt with in other countries. As we get good at that, our need for diapers will greatly diminish and we will be able to go back to the diaper champ. By the way, amazon sells two great books on Infant Potty Training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I love this item. Other reviews rate it poorly because of smell, well, it is plastic and plastic absorbs odors. Every week when we empty out the pail, I spray with Lysol disinfectant spray. If my baby has an ecspecially smelly diaper, I double bag it just in case (ecspecially now that she's on real food!) Convenient and clean. The only complaint, the lid can be a little rough to open and hold open when cleaning out, but no other complaints. :0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours is smelly!","review":"The Diamper Champ has not gone over well in our houselhold.

I am very surprised to see any positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds lots of diapers, but it SMELLS TERRIBLE !!!","review":"We have triplets and bought this pail because it holds a lot of diapers. We have always emptied the pail daily because it gets full and the ODOR IS UNBEARABLE !!! Please note, we always use the small individual bags to tie up poopy diapers before putting them into the Champ. We clean the Champ regularly with antibacterial wipes, spray with Lysol daily, and occasionally clean it with bleach. As long as the pail is open and empty, there is no odor. But as soon as we close the lid and add some diapers it begins to smell bad again. This is our second Diaper Champ and we've had the same problem with both: they don't contain the odor, even with proper cleaning. After one year of use, the seal partially came out on both Champs . Then, the seal adhesive sticks to the diapers so they don't always drop into the bag. Our triplets just turned two and we are ready to buy diaper pail #3. I don't plan to buy another Champ and would not recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Loser!","review":"Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure. I bought the first one of these, put in one dirty diaper (baby isn't even on solids yet-- on soy formula) and it smelled up the entire nursery. Thinking maybe mine was defective, I took it back and exchanged for a different one, and used scented trash bags. After 30 min., I could smell the scented trash bag when I walked in the nursery, so I figured if I could smell that, then certainly a dirty diaper would smell, too. I took it back for the second time and bought the Odorless diaper pail from Safety First, works great! I cannot understand why this product gets such good reviews. It was a waste of my time to even try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what us that smell????","review":"First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid, and then the room starts to smell like baby poop. Yes you can use reg bags for it, the only + about it. First day after changing the bag it smells OK but buy the 2nd WOW it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ","review":"I highly recommend this item. It is a must! I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn't stand it. It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install. Then I got the diaper champ. What a difference. Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors. It uses just your basic tall garbage bags. So you don't have to go out and buy special bags for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SMELLS!","review":"I believed everyone's great reviews for this item and put it on my registry. To my dismay, this product is NOT a champ. Yes, it may be economical because you use your own bags, but there's a flaw in the design. Everytime you want to empty out the pail, you open up the lid to an open bag filled with all your dirty and SMELLY diapers. Yes, the champ keeps the odor inside the pail but the bag mouth is open until you take it out of the pail (at which time the odors are all released) to tie it. I retured it and purchased the much contended Diaper Genie (...) to have a truly oderless room."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diaper Champ is a \\"diaper chump\\"","review":"I REALLY, REALLY wanted this thing to work. I refused to buy the Diaper Genie because of the special refills. I saw the Diaper Champ at a local Babies R Us. I brought it home, used it and less than 48 hours later, I could smell my 1-year old daughter's stinky diaper. My husband thought the engineering of the product was excellent and to this day does not understand why it does not keep the \\"stink\\" contained. We finally broke down and bought a Diaper Genie only because I had exhausted all other alternatives and I was tired of Corrin's room smelling like a diaper pail. The Diaper Genie prevailed, 7 days later, full of poopy diapers, I still couldn't smell a thing upon entering her room and that is all the proof I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Baby Shower Gift!","review":"This was my favorite gift I recieved!! It does not smell at all. Plus, you can put your own bags in it. I bought the cheap Wal-Mart bags, and throw them out in the big garbage can every couple of days. Many people have commented on how my daughter's room never smells like dirty diapers. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Diaper Genie!","review":"I love this pail. You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid. Sooooo simple. It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags. With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean. (It also needs special cartridges). With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second! It holds more diapers too. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a winner","review":"I bought diaper champ with our first and only child who is now 9 months old. At first I thought it was great--especially knowing I could use regular kitchen bags (vs. the diaper genie's special bags). I can't compare since this is my first child and I've not tried any other disposable system. However-- it really does not contain the smell, and the diapers ALWAYS get stuck when it becomes even somewhat full. My BIGGEST concern (and my primary reason for writing this review) is the platic from the kitchen garbage bag must fasten around the \\"outside\\" of the diaper champ. Now that my baby is crawling, he is drawn to the plastic. VERY SCARY when I first saw him crawl over and try pulling it to his mouth. In fact, I was surprised to find out this product is still on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Champ at all!","review":"I was attracted to this diaper pail because you did not have to buy special bags. It was great for the first 6 months before my son started eating food. Then, everything went down hill quickly! The stench that permeated my son's room was not pleasant. So, the DC is now in my attic (it was very large and unsightly as well) and I empty the trash can nightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"How old is your kid because THIS REALLY, REALLY STINKS!!!!!","review":"Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that's why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought...\\"Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners\\"...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn't stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don't think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!","review":"No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room.

This thing gets stuck when you put a wet wipe in it, gets poop down the inside of it and the piston just drags the poop through it if the diaper is not perfectly sealed up. It stinks, literally. After only a month of use as the babies diapers got more smelly, so did her room. It poorly contains the odor. Shoulda just got a diaper genie, like my own sister had. I hate to buy the refill's but its better than having a stinky room when people come to visit. I have to clean the inside of it all the time. THis thing sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"You really don't need it","review":"We had this with our first baby and it worked fine, but was very smelly after a while. I think we used it about 18 months and then it became unbearable.You really don't need a diaper pail unless you are going to use cloth diapers. Just use the kitchen trash. You think that might smell, but since most people empty their kitchen trash frequently, there are not as many dirty diapers in there. Put solid poop in the toilet, otherwise you can just toss the diapers. Our daughter is 11 months old, eating solid food, and we've never had a problem. We do have a cheap pail for the cloth diapers, but we clean it thoroughly when we launder the diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but doesn't contain odor","review":"After 18 months, our original Diaper Genie 2 had basically taken on the diaper smell and couldn't be cleaned anymore. With Baby #2 on the way, we decided to try Diaper Champ. Big mistake.Mechanically, it worked soundly, so no problems there. However, with every turn of the drum a \\"puff\\" of foul, diaper stink floated up.My decision to return it was made immediately upon opening the compartment to change the bag. The bag just sits down inside, but is wide open. The odor immediately filled the baby's room, and several adjacent ones. With eyes watering, I grabbed the bag, tied it off, then double-bagged. Fortunately, we could a few open windows and turn on a fan to disperse it.I hope I can get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and poor customer service","review":"My Diaper Champ wouldn't work properly (the drum won't rotate to dispose of the diaper) because the blue ring inside the device interferes with the rotation.

I have two little ones under the age of two. I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.

The plus is that it uses regular trash bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift For New Parents","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend's baby shower and they really adore it.

It's fabulous! We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it! We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great. We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!! A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it, my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days, it does begin to smell, but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days. So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!! :-D I'd recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like The Diaper CHUMP","review":"Don't waste your time and money. This thing is large, clunky, and worst of all doesn't do anything to contain the smell.

Just remember to empty frequently and you'll love this, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too smelly","review":"Thought this was the best diaper pail for the first 6 months... holds lots of diapers, no smell, etc... but once the baby started eating solids... poops were smellier...and the diaper champ didn't work... the whole room would smell despite emptying the bag 2-3xs per week... Also, my one year old thinks it's a toy to play with because of the flip handle it has... The Champ is now sitting in the garage because I got tired of the smell. There's got to be something better.

With my first child, I went with the Diaper Genie and decided that I would give the Champ a try this time. I had read all the kudo's all the new mommies gave the champ on odor etc. Well, I have been using it for a couple of weeks now with my toddler's diapers and you better believe that the pail stinks when you move the handle to dump a diaper. I am sure it works well for infants who do not have the STINKY toddler diapers. Another complaint....the thing is SO easy to use that my toddler loves to put things (other than diapers - pacies, toys etc) into it and flip the handle. Overall, it's ok...but I still think the Genie is the better of the two for the long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room smells like dirty diapers","review":"I can't imagine that I am using this product incorrectly, but just last night I walked down the hall and really noticed the nursery smells like a dirty diaper. I had noticed it before, but never really thought that the Diaper Champ was claimed to be \\"odor-free.\\" Sorry, but I don't buy it. Maybe little baby diapers and areas associated with them will just inherently smell like pooh, but if it claims to contain odors, it falls short. I don't know if we will bother to try another model/brand, but for the time being, I am buying a scent-masking spray/device to help tone the scent down. I love the little guy, but wow he can put out a scent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks, literally","review":"A very good friend of mine gave me one of these for a shower gift. We both thought it was a neat idea...no pricey refills to purchase. Unfortunately, after a couple of days, the diaper champ reeked to high heaven! I sprayed it with lysol, put an air freshener in it, cleaned it with bleach, emptied it daily and it still stunk!! I followed all instructions for operating it to no avail. We finally ended up throwing it out! My friends that had the diaper genie didn't experience the air pollution that we did with this. So if you need a system, I suggest the diaper genie. Right now, we are using the little bags our newspapers come in to dispose of diapers and we don't have any smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Diaper Champ","review":"I used the genie for two years and pregnant with my second child, I read the reviews of the champ and was excited. After two years, the plastic of the genie soaked in the smells. With the champ, I was very disappointed because after two days, I need to change the champ or it will smell up the house. I could leave diapers in the genie for up to 7 days before changing it out. I only use the genie/champ for poopy diapers. Maybe mine is defective...I'll never know. I am going to sell my champ on e-bay and buy another genie. The fillers with the genie are a pain, but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for up to a year only.","review":"We bought this since my sister was using it for her new daughter and having no problems with it. Well up to a year it was fine, but now the whole room stinks so horribly we can't leave it in the room. A couple times now I've cleaned it, sprayed it with clorox disinf. spray, and after putting a few diapers in it again the stink in his room is intolerable. We don't feed him anything out of the ordinary either.

We spend most of our time stuffing them in by hand because the chute gets clogged. In theory, it seems like a good idea and would likely work for disposables if you bundle them tightly with their tabs, but I can't say for sure. If you use cloth like we do, DON'T buy this product! We haven't used it for non-breastfed \\"output\\" so I can't comment on the smell factor yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"No major problems","review":"I have had no major problems with this product.

I would not buy this product again and I would definitly not recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me??","review":"All I have to say is OH NO, keep away!! I had originally bought the diaper champ since it seemed to be it the more economical choice since I could use any bags I wanted with it. I have had the thing for two years now, I use good quality kitchen bags, I air it out, spray it with Lysol and am very careful to correctly install the bags...HOWEVER... this thing STINKS!!!!!! When it is closed, the odor is bearable (but still detectable), but when you go to remove the bag...OH GOD HELP YOU!!! I cannot tell you how awful the smell is, especially once they start eating solid foods! The worst part is I had recommended the thing to all my friends because I really believed it was the better option and now we all hate it and won't use it anymore! It's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing oderless about this!","review":"While the design of this diaper champ is, indeed, streamlined (it is easy to use and doesn't need expensive special bags) it fails completely in the main purpose: to contain odor! The champ is not airtight, has no fan, no filters - so of course the smell of dirty diapers quickly permeates the room! I was changing the bag everyday and still could not contain the smells. I would NOT recommend this to anyone - better off to just use a plain bag and save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but a garbage pail with tight lid would be just as easy","review":"I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy. Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper. Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell! Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ","review":"It is simpler than I thought it would be.

Just regular old garbage bags that I have anyway.It does sometimes get stuck a bit when a wipe gets in between the piston mechanism and the chute, but it's my own fault for not tucking the wipe in the diaper.I've never had a problem with it stacking up and filling up to fast. When it starts to get too full and I don't have time to empty it right then, I just pop the top and dump in the diaper. Call me lazy I guess! But I do love this thing. It's a great diaper pail for $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well - but hold your breath when changing the bag","review":"Ok , so after reading some of the reviews - we got this one when our baby was born - We really liked the fact that it uses regular trash bags - we just went to the wholesale club and bought a large box of them! And it uses the same ones we use in our kitchen! It really works well and while you do catch an occational whiff of something - it holds the stink well. In fact so well, you won't even believe it when you open it up to change the bag! Hold your breath!!! But overall - definitely would recommend it over anything that needs costly refills."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job well enough","review":"we decided to buy this after my wife's extensive review search. It worked quite well for us. diaper could get stuck from time to time, but it is not really a big issue.

You will never see your diaper champ getting dirty, and stinky. Using kitchen bags is another advantage, you will never run out of bags.I don't recommend keeping any soiled diaper inside baby's room. Regardless of how good your system is, it will start smelling after some time and temparature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I used this in the nursery for the 1st 5-6 months then moved it to the garage.

It doesn't stink except when you open it to change the bag which obviously isn't the fault of the pail. It's easy to use and clean.

I have friends who use the Genie and they wish they had bought the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"the room still stinks like poopies","review":"yeah yeah, you don't have to buy refills, but the reason i bought a diaper pail (instead of just using a garbage can) was to reduce the poopie smell in the room. no dice with this thing even when i washed it out and sprayed it with lysol once a week. the stink gets into the plastic and won't come out. it's now in my basement. i bought a dekor and will hopefully have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied at all","review":"When I first discovered this, I was so excited about being able to use any bag with it and recommended it to other mothers I knew. Unfortunately, after using it for about a year, we started smelling the odors and were very disappointed. We also tried cleaning it out with bleach many times, but nothing seemed to work. Don't waste your money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"50/50 Satisfaction","review":"This is great for ease of use -- it uses any bag, is good-size (little on the large side), and holds quite a bit before it has to be emptied. However, it doesn't hold as many odors. For the first two weeks I had this it was great. I considered a second. Now you can smell the odors, faintly but enough to know what they are and where they are coming from. (yuck!) I'm going with the Diaper Dekkor for my second diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even compare to the Diaper Genie","review":"I had the Diaper Genie with my first child who is now 20 months. We have a second on the way, due in July and wanted something different since the DG was smelling, even though I deodorized it weekly. I was shopping at Babies R Us with my daughter and took her to the restroom to change her. Inside they had the Diaper Champ and I liked it right away, so I added it to my registry while there. Someone bought the DC for us very quickly and it was horrible! Even thought we wad the dirty diapers up very tight, they always got stuck inside the inner ring of the DC, ripping the dirty diapers to shreds inside, so the smell is awful! Granted my daughters' diapers are bigger than our newborns would be, but if we had that problem now, what makes me think that it wouldn't jam as our son got into larger sized diapers?!? We took it back and got the diaper genie again. Very glad we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore bad reviews if you want a STINKY room:","review":"At first we were pleased with the Diaper Champ because of its easy-to-use function and the fact that we did not have to buy special refills or bags. However, we quickly learned that the biggest drawback to the Champ is its inability to seal in odor. We frequently empty the bags and clean the pail (including Lysol, chlorine bleach, and anti-bacterial wipes) but have found the odor to be overwhelming and ever present regardless of disinfectant or frequent bag changes. Recently in a popular parenting magazine, they reviewed various diaper disposal systems and used Limburger cheese (a very potent and stinky cheese) to measure odor levels among the various systems. Diaper Champ received the worst rating for odor (4 cheese wedges indicating the worst odor rating possible.) I would avoid the hassle, spend a few extra bucks and get one of the other, higher-rated and popular systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEEE WEWWW!!!","review":"We received the diaper champ as a gift and when my daughter was a newborn and it worked just fine...then she got bigger and so did her diapers. They were constantly getting jammed in the chute. And now that she is on solids it is not keeping the odors in at all. Every time we flip the handle we get a huge wiff of dirty diapers. So needless to say we are not using this anymore. It's great for newborns but not for older babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cork the Genie, the Champ is the Champ!","review":"Who wants to fool with the expense of refilling a diaper snake? I use Ruffles scented 8 gallon trash bags and I leave the bag roll in the bottom of the pail. I simply pull off a new bag and drop the full bag off at the first trash can I come across. This pail can hold a ton of diapers but I do not let it get that full. I could change the bag everyday and it would still be cheaper then buying Genie refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use with cloth diapers!!!","review":"I wish someone would have told me that this is not work well with cloth diapers. I Hate this pail. The center piece does not drop easily I have push it. I found that when it is filling the center of the pail piles up and the sides are empty I have to open it and re-arrange the soiled diapers. Things get stuck in the center and it jams. I hate this pail. I don't know why other reviews say it does not smell - it does. I have dio discs in it and it still smells. I wash the diapers every 48 hours or so and it still smells. I can't imagine it working so great with disposable diapers because it will still smell and the center piece sticks even with cleaning. I have wiped it out with Lysol and a hose and it still sticks. Did I mention I hate this pail?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer my Diaper Genie!","review":"We bought this for baby #2 thinking that it would be easier and have a larger capacity. I had some trouble getting the garbage bags to be really secure in there, and furthermore ended up having to push the weight down in order to get the diaper to fall all the way through before it was really full, maybe when it was about 2/3 full. Lastly, for the really dirty, messed up diapers, I would have to clean the chute, whereas that is not a consideration for the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not contain odors!","review":"I bought this instead of the diaper genie because I liked the idea that I could use my own trash bags and not have to buy refills all the time. Unfortunately, this product does not contain odors well at all! I have to change the liner ever few days AND the odor manages to stay within the can even without anything in it! You may as well have a regular open trash can in your nursery because it will smell the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't remember if I wrote a review for this, but I want to","review":"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law's house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won't have a problem) and it works great, good design!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice","review":"I've had this diaper pail for about 18 months and really like it. I empty it once a week and after that time does develop a faint odor (it is kept in a bathroom not the baby's room) but if I wrap the poopy diapers in a grocery bag first this helps a lot. I used to have a Diaper Genie and that started to smell after a while, too, so I've come to the conclusion there is no 'perfect' diaper pail. Two of the best things about this pail I like is that is takes regular kitchen trash bags and that it has a large capacity (compared to the diaper genie). It is very easy to empty (esp. compared to the diaper genie and the complex process needed to change the refills). If you are going to get a diaper pail, this one is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT live up to my expectations!","review":"I purchased this diaper disposal system with gift cards I received at my baby shower and was so excited at the idea of an alternative to the \\"special bags\\" disposal systems. Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason. I have more than one child and seeing a toddler running through the house with a piece to the diaper pail in their mouth is enough to turn your stomach. Besides the unsanitary aspect of that, it is a safety issue. My husband and I both have tried to get it to stay in permanently to no avail. I also am not too thrilled with the fact that anything besides diapers will get caught in the flip mechanism and be stuck there. I really wish I had just stuck with the Diaper Genie and will probably go out and purchase it anyway. I am NOT a happy customer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Enthusiast","review":"I have the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie from Playtex. The Diaper Champ has horrible odor control. I would rate the Diaper Genie much higher. The Diaper Champ doesn't hold the odor, it smells up the whole room. I can actually smell the diapers down the hallway. It's much more convenient than the other models, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. I'm really disappointed in the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in diaper champ","review":"We purchased this because it did not require special refill bags. Also, we had heard it worked really well, & was odor-free. We have had a VERY difficult time with the odor. I wipe it down with a cleanser in between bag changes, & this does not help at all. I've tried placing the diapers in small bags before placing them in the diaper champ. That hasn't helped either. This product is comparable to a regular trashcan & isn't worth the money it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!","review":"I originally received the Diaper Genie as a gift but exchanged it for the Diaper Champ because I didn't want to spend the money on refills every month. BAD IDEA! While it was convenient to use my own trash bags in the Diaper Champ they NEVER contained the terrible smell. I used the Diaper Champ for almost 6 weeks before I finally threw it out and went back to re-buy the Diaper Genie. DO NOT spend your money on the Diaper Champ - it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not all that great","review":"We have used this for 8 months. Even with lysol, etc, there is still an odor. PLus, the one handed operation is not really possible...9 times out of 10 the handle jams as you try to flip it. We have also had diapers get trapped during the flip, even when folded compactly...this results in poop smears inside the flipping drum, where it is very hard to clean. I loved being able to use my own garbage bags as refills, but the sheer bulk and ugliness of this unit, coupled with odor and the jamming flip device, led me to buy a diaper dekor instead to replace it. Diaper dekor is MUCH better...even considerng the high cost of refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Diaper Pail","review":"I first bought this item because I liked that you could use regular garbage bags. I loved this product until I started my child on solids, then it was useless. It always smelled and I couldn't keep it in my babies room. I went and bought the new improved diaper genie, and I don't smell a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1!","review":"The best way better than the diaper genie! No smell! It lasted till my kid was done with diapers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product Stinks - literally!","review":"Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell! I originally bought this rather than the Diaper Genie because I did not want to have to buy special bags but what a mistake! If you do not use deoderized bags you will need to change the bag every single day because if there is one poopy diaper in there it smells really bad. I actually threw out the Diaper Champ that I had bought and got the Diaper Genie instead which is 100X better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ Gaskets","review":"I love the diaper Champ my child is 2 1/2 years old and I just started to have problems with the scents of diapers recently :( I called Baby Trend and they told me the gaskets need to be replaced every 6 to 8 months. They are sending some out at no charge to me! So I think this product is great. It uses normal kitchen garbage bags no expensive refills, it keeps little hands away from the diapers and I only have to change the bag about once a week and she is 2 1/2 years old. Wonderfull product as long as the gaskets work when I change them :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIlls up quickly","review":"I like the Diaper Champ because it doesn't use specific bags. I don't like how easily it gets backed up though. I have to frequently push down the center to get it to rotate, much before it needs to be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR CLOTH","review":"We are using fitted cloth diapers and now that my daughter is 6 months old and we are using a larger size diaper, the snaps are always getting caught on the way into the pail. Very frustrating and messy. The pail also doesn't hold very many diapers and I find my self washing diapers more often that I would normally have to. Contrary to other postings, I have not had any problems with odor. I will eventually have to get a new pail, but I hate the thought of dumping a huge hunk of hardly used plastic in a landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest to use!","review":"I received the more well-known diaper pail for my baby shower, even after registering for the Diaper Champ. I thought I would give the other one a chance, but after taking it out of the box and fiddling around with it for a while, I returned it for the Diaper Champ within a week. The Diaper Champ is bigger/taller which makes it more convenient to use, and it is so easy to setup and its more attractive! Not as many special switches and clips, and no cartridges that are difficult to change and operate. It is an odorless diaper pail that actually follows the \\"Keep it simple\\" principle. I recommend this one to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it smells... it's baby poop!","review":"This is great and much better than the Genie. You can use regular bags instead of special ones. You do have to change it often (like 2-3 times per week) in order to cut down on the stink but overall it does a bang up job. One of the most practical and useful items that I received for my shower and would definitely recommend to new moms and dads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!","review":"I love my diaper champ! It is very easy to use and no costy refills to worry about. All of my friends throw away their Diaper Genies and get the Diaper Champ because it is that much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH BETTER than the Diaper Genie!!!!","review":"I LOVE the Diaper Champ! It costs just as much as the Diaper Genie, and it's easier to use PLUS you use your own garbage bags instead of [price]refills that you have to buy with the Genie. A minor thing is that I'm 5 foot 8 inches, and the Genie is a pretty low reach. The Diaper Champ is larger than the Genie, so it holds more diapers. The Diaper Champ is the size of a typical garbage can and has a drop chute, so all you have to do is drop the diaper in and flip the handle and walah! I bought the Diaper Champ after having my second child, specifically for the ease of use and because it was easier to change bags. It's easy to throw away a diaper, but not easy enough for my two year old to open it's contents. My two year old loves to help Mommy \\"change\\" baby Katie's diaper by flipping the handle after I drop the diaper into the chute. I give the diaper champ my higest recommendation to all parents, especially those with multiple kids in diapers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky! Stinky! Stinky!","review":"I absolutely thought that this item was a great invention until I tried it....twice. It does not even come close to keeping the odor in and was a huge waste of time to even try. The first one that I bought broke after only 2 weeks of use. So I then exchanged it for the same item only to find out that it still is a bad product all together. The thought of not having to buy refill bags was a big turn on but now I will go buy the Genie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I'm shocked that anyone likes this diaper pail. First of all, it stinks so badly. I felt horrible having my baby sleep in the same room as this pail! Especially when you empty it...you must hold your nose and not inhale! Second, everytime you turn the mechanism to drop the diaper down it would get stuck! And then you have to put your hand in to pull it out, and it's not fun touching a dirty poopy diaper and wipe! I ended up buying the Neat Disposal System and it is 150% better.Don't buy Diaper Champ! Trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This diaper pail STINKS!","review":"This is the worst diaper pail ever! It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell. I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in. Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers. I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"It smells, smells, SMELLS!!! Don't waste your money. I was attracted to this pail because you can use any platic garbage bags. It spends most of its time on my back deck airing out!

I am currently looking for a new pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A baby room must have","review":"This is one of the BEST shower gifts my husband and I received.

No expensive refills and with one motion *plop* dirty diaper be gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use but doesnt stop odor","review":"This product is nice in theory but not all that its cracked up to be. The foam lining comes out after several months of use (this happened to 3 other people I know too), and it does nothing to stop odor. (If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely). Save your money and buy something else - this champs a chump."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK - BABY TREND WILL NOT HELP","review":"THE LID WILL NOT TURN.

DO NOT PURCAHSE THIS, IF YOU GET ONE THAT IS DEFECTIVE YOU ARE OUT THE MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE DIAPER GENIE","review":"I registered for the Diaper Genie thinking it was the way to go, especially since I hadn't really heard about the other brands out there. I'd used the Genie before and found it to be more of a pain, but figured I'd give it a try anyway. I hated it! The specialized bags you have to use, figuring out how the darn thing worked. Then I read about the Diaper Champ and decided I'd give that a try. IT IS AWESOME! Of course you have to change the bag at least once a week (think about things in your refrigerator that are in containers for more than a week -- they start to smell!). You don't need special bags, the flip handle makes it a breeze to use. I've recommended this to all my girlfriends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If mine ever breaks, I'm buying another one.....","review":"This is a GREAT diaper pail!! I had a different one with my first child (can't remember which one) and it was horrible. I looked all over for a new one with this baby because the pail is in the nursery right next to her crib and I didn't want the smell in there. I didn't want the Diaper Genie because, uh, gross.....you have to lug a long chain of \\"sausage\\" looking things out to the trash and it looked like a pain. Plus I didn't want to have to buy their refills. So I got the Diaper Champ and it IS the champ!!!! DD is 6 months old and I have not yet smelled a diaper in her room!!!! You fold the diaper up and toss it in, flip the handle and it's done!!! Plus I use regular garbage bags that are odor controlling too and when it's full, I grab the bags handles, tie it up and throw it out!! I love it!!!! A must have!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Product!","review":"I thought I had researched all the diaper pails that were out there. I previously owned a Diaper Genie, and hated the thought of having buy the refills. So I invested in the Diaper Champ and that thing stinks so much!!!

I have tried everything from a stick-um to deodorized bags and nothings helps the smell from getting out.. I have a 2 yr old and a 4 month old and that room gets really Smelly... I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ.

It isn't all that easy to clean either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY Daipaer Pail you should buy!","review":"I love this thing! I don't notice any smell while top shut.

I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stink is out of Control","review":"This was a very poor purchase I was sucked in with the no refills to buy but the smell is horrible I have to empty it almost everyday and even after that it sits out on my porch half the time to get the smell out and even then it still stinks.

I was on a very tight baby budget and thought this would be great because there were no refills to purchase. It did a HORRIBLE job of keeping the odor in and when I went to change the bag, there were MAGGOTS in it. I was so grossed out and disgusted!! When I wrote to the company to complain, my letter was sent back to me because the seedy little company had closed up shop and moved with no forwarding address!!On top of everything else, the piston kept getting stuck, so you had to push it down by hand.I ended up buying a diaper genie, which I should have done from the start. Don't let the lure of no refills trick you. To me, it is far better to have to purchase refills than to live with stench and BUGS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells after a while","review":"There are a lot of reviews on this site mentioning the fact that this thing smells after a while. I wish I listened to them. I used it ok for 2-3 months, but am now using my regular garbage can and emptying it each day.

You might be able to find a garbage can that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Smells","review":"This is a great item. We bought it because we liked that no special bags were required. Our son is three months old, and has more than his share of wet and dirty diapers, we only have to change it once every 5-6 days.

The one good thing about it is that you can use regular trash bags, so you don't have to buy specialty bags to fill it. The bad thing is that if you don't change it every other day, it stinks up the whole house. I have to bleach it once a week, not to mention keep a box of baking soda in the bottom to help control the smell. My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second. We are planning on getting rid of the diaper champ, and upgrading to diaper dekor."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking stink control","review":"I nannied for two babies in some one else's home and they have the Diaper Champ. I think the reason parents don't smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!! I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the \\"champ\\" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I'm sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper, but smells","review":"We bought this when our 6 year old Diaper Genie broke. We had a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn still in diapers. With the older child's diapers, the smell was pretty bad. It was nice to use kitchen bags instead of buying the more expensive Diaper Genie bags, but once the child gets old enough, it just doesn't cut it because of the smell. We bought a new Diaper Genie, and they have made some great design improvements in the past 6 years! The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie. If you have an infant, the Diaper Champ will probably work for you, but it won't last like the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went out and baught another system","review":"Don't waste your money! It sounds good on paper, but I had to go out and buy another system, this one kept getting diapers and wipes stuck in it (not the kind of thing you want to have to rip out with your hands) and I had smelling issues with it (mostly because it kept getting stuck open). I wouldn't wish this product on my worst enemy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"If you are thinking about ordering this item and don't live in California, I'd rethink. We ordered one and it arrived in a box barely taped shut -- the box was not sturdy enough to survive mailing and was pretty flimsy. There was no padding or anything in the box to protect the product during shipping.The diaper champ doesn't work. The flip mechanism appears jammed and I can't figure out how to get it fixed. The instructions are no help, whatsoever. Customer service was closed the day I called.

However, I was extremely disappointed in how difficult it is to get the top open to change the bags. I break a fingernail every time I have to do it!! Also, my daughter is only 3 months old and her diapers aren't even bad yet; unfortunately, after just a day of changing diapers (and making sure the diaper tags are secure), the darn thing is already difficult to flip. I'm sure it is great about keeping the odor down, but I have to change the bag every 2 days anyway because it is clogged up. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Junk","review":"We bought this thinking we were getting a great deal, an easy to use odorless pail that uses regular trash bags. WRONG! Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast. It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless. Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cost Saver","review":"As new parents, we have found it truly amazing how much money goes for all the little extras--batteries, film, pacifiers, wet wipes, etc. This is one reason I passed up the diaper genie, which although is a great product from what I've heard, requires the frequent purchase of refills which can be complicated to install. So we decided to go for the Diaper Champ, which just requires normal trash bags which you're going to buy any way. On the whole, it's worked well. To diminish the likelihood of bad odors in the nursery, one should change the bag frequently, before it gets full. The one problem is the mechanism it uses to \\"roll\\" the diaper into the champer often gets stuck if you use diapers with sticky tabs--velcro diaper tabs, no problem. Overall I like this product and I like not having yet one more expense like refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you don't mind the odor","review":"It seemed to be fine until my baby started on solid food. She's now 7 months and the odor is unbearable. Most of the positive reviews were written by people with babies less than 6 months.

I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...no odors, easy to use","review":"After reading many of the reviews for this and the diaper Genie, I decided on the Diaper Champ. I am very pleased with it. One, it is cost efficient in that you don't have to buy special bags. I use the plastic bags from the grocery store. The unit is large enough thatI can store two or three extra bags in the bottom so when changing the dirty bag, i dont have to run to get a new one. i have not experienced any problems with odors. i change the bag every two or three days and have yet to be offended by the smell. Once a week, I spray the unit with Lysol. For the money, it is well worth it. I have also bought this for two subsequent baby showers and have heard no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I had used the Diaper Genie before and noticed that it didn't always keep in the worst smelling soiled diapers. It also takes two hands to use which isn't always ideal when you have a baby in one arm. The Diaper Champ is great because it has a quick flip system that is extremely easy to use. The smells stay in until you have to open it to empty it. I found it helpful to throw the worst soiled diapers in a newspaper bag first and then toss them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right for Budget, Wrong for Nose!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was thrilled when I found out about this- a diaper disposal, using regular trash bags! Trust me- that is the ONLY benefit. The smell is putrid and I find myself placing the Diaper Champ outside to air out frequently. However, I would not pay for special Diaper Genie bags, either. It makes the most sense to wrap diapers in plastic bags and throw them out in the daily trash. It stinks- no pun intended!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stinky for us","review":"I am rather disappointed in the Diaper Champ. My friend recommended it but now I question whether I would recommend to other's. While it is the easiest to use I find it doesn't contain the odor. I can actually smell it across the room. My son is six months old and eating solid foods so the diapers themselves are stinkier but we find that the Diaper Champ doesn't mask the odors. We have even tried a \\"stick-up\\" to no avail. I am now forced to just take the diapers directly outside.I also find opening it a challenge and not friendly to fingernails. It has cause much frustration in our household."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it!","review":"I recieved this as a present for my first son, and ended up throwing it out! My two biggest complaints are 1)the lid is very hard to keep clean, and 2)it hardly contains the odor. It might be alright for just wet diapers, but definitly not for \\"messy\\" diapers. I much prefer to just wrap the \\"messy\\" ones in a grocery bag, and put all my diapers wet or messy in my kitchen trash, that way they go outside by the end of the day, and I don't have to fuss over cleaning a silly diaper \\"champ\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The #1 only pail, at best.... NO #2 ALLOWED!","review":"I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers. My cat box smells fresher! So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys! Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too. The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back. So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"My husband and I were shopping and we came across the Diaper Champ. We figured it was a great idea to save money using regular bags instead of purchasing refills all the time. After 2 days, I could smell the diaper champ the second I walked into my son's room. I was constantly spraying it with Lysol. My son, who is two, managed somehow to get the lid open, and can take the diapers out. I don't know how he did it, since I have a hard time opening it. When I had the Diaper Genie, there was vurtually no smell and my son could not get in it. Invest in the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It reeks","review":"This diaper pail worked well at first - it was nice to just use a regular trash bag instead of spending more money on inserts, and it contained the smells. But then after a while, it started to really stink, even if it had just been emptied. I tried various cleaners and eventually just soaked the whole thing in bleach in the bathtub, but nothing got rid of the smell. It permeated the plastic and is there to stay. I guess if your kid potty trains when they turn one, maybe it is a good buy, but otherwise, skip it. Now, instead of being able to pass a useful baby item on to somebody else, I will have to throw it away, which is so wasteful, but nobody is going to want a stinky diaper pail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams and sticks","review":"Sorry, this thing is a dog. The blue plastic ring around each opening began to separate right away, and the top wouldn't swivel like it was supposed to. I was able to get it working for a week or two with some lubrication, but it just got stuck again. Wife hated it, I got tired of wrestling with it. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make up your own mind","review":"I've read all the reviews on all the major diaper pails, mainly because I'm dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ I own. At first use this product seems like it should be great but a little more use and thought proves otherwise. When the bag gets full, it overflows. You won't know it's full until it overflows. Once it overflows it's disgusting. You will have to take all the dirty diapers and try to push them into the bag by hand. Also, the way the bag is inserted, 3 sides are held down to keep it from collapsing but the 4th side has no such restraint and will inevitably have the edge touching the dirty diapers.That leads to the final flaw. When it's time to take the bag out (whether it overflowed or not) the thing is wide open. Anything there is to smell or touch, you will smell or touch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Both Versions - Disappointed Both Times","review":"Our first was born in 2005 and we bought the original version of this diaper pail. It seemed so sensible. We liked it at first, but the smell just kept building...no matter how much I washed it and sprayed it with disinfectant. Then I realized the rounded part of the lid was lined with foam. Of course, once an odor gets into the foam you are doomed. So, I removed the foam, but we still had issues with odor. By now we had our 2nd baby and the pail seemed a little small for 2 in diapers (we emptied it more than twice a week). We bought the \\"new improved\\" version, since we still liked the concept of the pail. The smell issue is still attrocious and if a bag is really full it rips when you take it out. I had issues with the old version and I hate the newer version. I'm buying a really good trash can with a lid that seals out odors. We use one for cat litter and the smell NEVER escapes from that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to keep clean","review":"My husband and I were all set to buy the Diaper Genie when someone came running up to us at Toys R Us and said to buy the Diaper Champ. So we did and it was great for a while...but then no matter how hard we tried (we always wrapped up the diaper but sometimes they do get messy) the chute started to get dirty and the weight started to get dirty from the other side so it smelled and was a mess. We tried to hose it off outside and let it sit in the sun but it still smelled. We ended up getting the Diaper Genie and it's clean and it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Name Says It All","review":"I bought this diaper pail after buying and returning the Diaper Genie TWICE. I had a lot of trouble with the Diaper Genie individually wrapping each diaper like it was supposed to - the bag just opened up and unravelled with each new diaper, putting them all together. Finally, I gave in and decided to save myself some money and aggravation. I have had no problem with odor except, as others have mentioned, when changing the bag. We went away for 10 days and I forgot to empty the nearly full pail, and I expected there to be at least a slight odor when we got back, but you couldn't smell anything. Like another reviewer, I too use Lemon Scented garbage bags, but that really only makes a difference once you have tied up the bag and put it with the rest of the garbage to go out. I definetly would recommend this pail to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The smell is definitely there...","review":"I was at an open house this weekend looking at a home I might buy...you could smell the diaper pail through out the entire house. It was really strong when you were in the baby's room.They had this diaper disposer. I finally suggested to the listing agent that she might try putting some baking soda in it because everyone is going to think the problem was with the carpet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only review you need to read!!","review":"We contemplated going with the diaper genie, but some friends of ours had it and weren't happy with it. We did some research online and decided to try the diaper champ. We have been very happy with it so far. Our son's diapers are definitely not odor free anymore, but the diaper champ keeps the odor in. We like that it uses our regular trash bags. We spray it with lysol and let it set after emptying and before replacing the bag. The only problem we have noticed is you don't know that it is full until you turn the handle and the plunger doesn't go all the way down; which is easily solved by pushing it down manually and then changing the bag. We would definitely recomend the diaper champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper chump","review":"This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors. You are better off buying a trash can with a lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because you can't pick 0","review":"I got the diaper champ for my first baby. I thought it would be great since it used regular trash bags. It wasn't even two weeks after my son was born when the seal came out and his room smelled awful. I threw it away. It was the biggest waste of money. I bought the Diaper Genie and it's worth having to buy the special bags. It works wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Genie!","review":"All my friends got the Diaper Genie but I picked up the Diaper Champ after it had gotten a Best Of review on The Today Show. I've been thrilled with my purchase-my friends aren't so lucky. They have to spend so much money on the specific bags that must be purchased for the Genie. We just use regular old kitchen trash bags. We love it and definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Chump","review":"I previously owned a Diaper Genie and also didn't like the idea of buying liners and how few diapers it held. When I saw the Diaper Champ I thought it looked great. Don't let the base fool you, it is much smaller on the inside for holding disposed diapers. Also, I kept thinking my son had a dirty diaper, when in fact it was the Diaper Champ I was smelling. The Diaper Champ is residing in the garage after only 3 weeks of use, and I purchased another Diaper Genie, which I think ended up holding just as many diapers as the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, Stink and More Stink","review":"I was using a Diaper Genie and it began to take on the odor of the diapers after 7 months so I purchased the Diaper Champ as its replacement. I give this product 2 stars: 1 for its large size and capacity and 1 for the ability to use standard garbage bags. Other than that it began to stink worse than the Genie after the second day. Due to the fact that the diapers just sit in the bottom of the pail without being sealed off, the pail emits an awful odor. It was the worst purchase I made."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinky Situation","review":"Perhaps I'm not doing something right! but how hard can it be to drop a diaper into a pail. This pail is convenient, in that it offers a quick fix to dispose of waste, but it leaves my baby's room smelly! My husband and I have cleaned and spray the pail with Lysol, and it still leaves the whole house smelly. We have however, remedied this by wrapping the poopie diapers in the small plastic bags we get from the grocer, and then dispose of them in the pail. This is the only relief we get from the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible!!!!!","review":"I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, \\"New And Improved\\"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Thought I was being clever buying one that didn't need special bags. But it's too big & cumbersome to use. You will have difficulty rotating the top to make stuff go down. Once baby's a few months old- forget it! Too much trouble as you're wrestling with baby. Nobody but me ever bothered (mom, husband), so I'd always come in to find there would be diapers sticking out the top. The seal broke after about 2 weeks. You will get stuff stuck in it. Looks great, but it isn't. Bought a small commercial grade foot operated can and it works much better. Doesn't hold as much but then too much is kind of gross when you think about it!!! Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Stinks (literally)","review":"I thought that the convenience of not having to use special bags would make this product great. Unfortunately, this product does not help keep the odor away like the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly champ","review":"We bought this champ thinking it was going to save us money from using regular plastic bags. Well we thought wrong. It is horrible. The whole room smells like dirty diapers and no matter how many times we disenfect it and wash it out with hot soapy water, it still reeks!!!! I recommend the diaper genie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Disposal System.","review":"WOW! I'm very happy with my diaper champ! My baby is on formula and has pretty smelly poops! I have yet to detect any odor from my pail. As to older baby poops, you are supposed to flush solid poops. No disposal system is designed to control older baby poops. I have 2 diaper champs, one on each floor of my house, and NO smell. It is also very easy to use and cheap to refill. Buy this with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last very long","review":"This product worked for a while, but it doesn't last. Shortly after our daughter turned one: the outer material on the piece that covers the opening and covers the smell began to wear off; which in turn does not provide a tight seal and makes this product useless. we used the product correctly and cleaned it, and now we are forced to go buy something else. The other positive reviews that are written refer to kids well under one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ Rocks!","review":"As both a money saver and time saver, this is the diaper pail to have! It doesn't require any special bags to buy, other than regular trash bags, and only needs 1 hand to operate. You can be holding baby and still secure the diaper in the pail without having any accidents.I have had multiple friends tell me that they wish they had bought the diaper champ after seeing how it worked. They purchased the more complicated brands.The other great thing about not having to use the specialized bags is that you can use it for cloth diapers as well. It is spill proof and you can use the basin bag free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Champ for Diapers!","review":"Use any bag, easy to use, contains the smell, what more could you ask for? We started putting poopy diapers in a plastic grocery bag before putting them in when my 1st born was 1.5, since older baby poop is smellier...Currently use it for a 2 yo and a 5 month old...It has been the only pail we have owned (friend have the Diaper Genie and it is a PAIN!)my 2 year old can throw away her own diapers and those of sisters, she loves to help...We air it out after each bag change and spray in a little lysol...So much better than a plain pail at keeping oders in the can!

I have been telling everyone about it! It is great!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Pail","review":"I bought this diaper pail after reading all the reviews here. Don't believe everything you read. This diaper pail has stunk up my daughters room as well as the whole floor. I've even put a stick-up inside and that doesn't help the smell. It is gross!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go For The Diaper Genie - Learn from My Mistake!","review":"I didn't want to be tied into buying Diaper Genie \\"special bags\\" and all that. So I thought it was smarter to go with the Diaper Champ and make life simple. WRONG! We've suffered with this smelly, stinky, gross thing long enough. No matter how much you wipe it down, take it outside and hose it down, change the bags all the time, etc - it STILL STINKS! It works just fine disposing of the diaper, but the stink will drive you NUTS. The plastic seems to make the smell cling to it, and it won't go away with cleaning. Finally I bought the Diaper Genie and cannot believe I waited so long to finally give in. I wish I had saved myself all the work and effort and frustration and just have gone with the Genie from the beginning. Take my advise, don't buy the diaper champ. I wish I had listened to the other reviews earlier and gone for the Genie from the beginning!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"I like BabyTrend's products. We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair. We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born. I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo). Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don't spray water into the drop-in hole. The mechanism is not completely watertight and you'll trap some water in there. Myself, I've actually done a thorough cleaning only twice. Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for newborns bad for toddlers","review":"I really loved the ease of using the Diaper Champ - unfortunately when I my son started eating solid foods - the Diaper Champ just didn't keep the smells from invading my whole house - Yuck! Nice try Diaper Champ - sorry I had to sell mine in a yard sale when my son was 10 months old and go buy a Diaper Genie - a product not without flaws itself - but at least it keeps the smells to itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT USEFUL FOR CLOTH DIAPERS","review":"We bought this after reading positive reviews regarding this product and the advertising which claimed it would work with both cloth and disposable diapers. It hasn't worked well for us with cloth diapers. The diapers get stuck and you either have to push the plunger and jiggle the handle back and forth or worse, open the top and pull the diaper down into the pail (UGH). This is also unsafe while you are wrestling a baby during the dipaer change so you have to try and remember to come back and do this when the baby is changed and somewhere safe. It isn't containing smells now and is also impossible to clean well enough to remove the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wait until you have it a while!","review":"Well, unfortunately most of the great reviews for this product were probably written a short time after having the Diaper Champ. We thought ours was fantastic when we first got it! There was no smell at all. But... now it is 5 months later, and my daughter's room reeks everytime you go in there. The smell coming from the Diaper Champ just will not go away! We cleaned it out, sprayed Lysol, etc. I think this has to be some kind of design flaw. Either after using it for a while the seal starts to leak, or after the lid opening weight sits on the smelly inside of it long enough, it begins to absorb the smell from the inside of the bag. So when you turn it over, and it's on the outside......Peeeeeeeeeeeeewww! We now have ours out in the garage, and are considering replacing this with a Diaper Genie which my sister has and loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just remember, change the bag","review":"This is a typical diaper changing pail, nothing special. It does it's job though! You just have to remember that you do need to change the bag at least once a week, or else it is going to smell... But then, what do you expect from a pail holding soiled diapers! I change the back 2 x a week,or more, as I have two babies it fills fast. I also wash it about 2 x a month. It's easy. This is a great pail for when your child is a little older. My son knows to put his diapers in it and its easy for him to turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short term - Good; Long term - BAD","review":"We purchased the Diaper Champ thinking it was way better than the Diaper Genie, especially because we could use any bags we wanted. For the first few months it was great, then it started to smell. We tried cleaning it, putting air freshners in it, emptying it more often, but nothing worked. We even called customer service thinking there was something wrong. Turns out, in order to truly contain the smell, special bags must be purchased after all.Our Diaper Champ has been in use for 13 months and in order to keep our daughter's room from smelling terribly, we must empty the pail every day - not really the reason we bought a diaper pail.BOTTOM LIKE: IT WORKS GREAT UNTIL YOU REALLY NEED A DIAPER PAIL (I.E. THE POOP REALLY STINKS)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glorified garbage can......","review":"I bought this Diaper Champ with my third child, after using the Diaper Genie with my first two. Some time had elapsed since my boys were babies, and I no longer had my Diaper Genie. The thought of no expensive refills, and one-handed disposal was very attractive to me, as these were the problems I encountered with my Diaper Genie. However, I never truly experienced the stench of a dirty diaper in my baby's room until I brought this glorified garpage pail into my nursery. I had spent time researching healthy all natural smell removal aids for my daughter's room, checked the AC system, everything to mask that horrible smell, which lingered all the time...until I used my brain and moved our \\"Champ\\" out of the ring-and into our garage. Viola! Her room smells like baby powder. And now my garage smells like a toilet. I will be buying a brand new Diaper Genie for Christmas this year!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice product","review":"Diapers are expensive enough, so we didn't want to have to keep buying diaper pail inserts also. The Diaper Champ has worked well for us. When our daughter was infant there was NO smell. It was just awesome. As our daughter has grown bigger (and her poo smellier) we've had to take a few extra measures to keep the Champ in good shape. Like, we dump solids into the toilet (also introduces some potty concepts) before disposing of the diaper. And any particularly icky ones go straight to the outside trash. And I take it outside to air out every 2-3 weeks. But overall, its been great. I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to clean daily! Or PU","review":"I just read the review of the lady who went on and on about people who have complained about this product that she loves. I did not like the diaper champ. I know it holds dirty diapers; but I didn't know you would have to clean it every day just to mostly keep the smell out. I finally had to resort to putting every diaper in a plastic bag before putting it in and then taking it out every night. (Easier for home owners. I had my baby in the winter and lived in a condo where the trash was far.) My husband could never get it open. It is a two handed job; who's got a new baby and two hands? I have a friend who had it too. She hates it as much as I do. She said it was easier to run it to the garage every time, then to use the diaper champ.When I was a nanny they used the diaper genie. Wow, I must be picky because I think that is worse. I hope to find a better diaper pail before the next one comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Hero to Zero","review":"At first we were thrilled with the Diaper Champ--when our daughter was a newborn it was a lifesaver, and there was never any odor in or around the container. We would wipe it down with Clorox Wipes and spray it with Lysol to help disinfect, and that seemed to do the trick. Then our daughter started eating solids, and, as parents know, this changed the smell of her dirty diapers. And suddenly the Diaper Champ was no longer up to the job. It didn't just smell dirty--it was RANK. This was despite frequent cleanings, changing the bags a few times a week, no longer storing soiled diapers in the thing--we'd throw those out right away and just store wet diapers. We tried sprays and smell absorbers and old fashioned elbow grease to help it smell better, but NOTHING worked. It's like the odor seeped into the plastic and wouldn't leave. We've switched to a regular old garbage pail, the kind you buy in a kitchen supply store, and that has proven FAR better, and cheaper, than the Diaper Champ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but careful...","review":"I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great -- but may fail over time","review":"We've had the Diaper Champ for 18 months, and it worked great, no smells, very easy to use, until recently. Somehow (probably it got overloaded) the adhesive from a diaper snagged the foam that insulates the head of the champ and pulled just the teeniest tiniest corner out. Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ. We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail. Check you Champ carefully to make sure that no mesh or foam are visible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for dirty diapers","review":"We bought this b/c a cousin recommended it to us. It worked okay for a few months but then it began to smell from dirty diapers. I think the seal wears out after awhile but I've never seen replacements for it. I'm having my second baby now and don't plan on getting it back out for this one b/c it was a rip off. We just keep a regular waste basket in the room for wet diapers and then another waste basket with a lid outside for dirty diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Chump","review":"We have 2 children in diapers, so our diaper pail is an essential piece of equipment. We retired our Diaper Genie and moved on the Diaper Champ because it doesn't require special bags. We were very disappointed in the performance. It did absolutely nothing for odor control.

She also no longer uses this product even though she still has one in diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen trash is much better!","review":"We chose this over the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special trash bags. We wound up throwing it away after 7 months and just using the kitchen trash can (which has a lid). The diapers constantly got caught in the cylinder when we would flip it. We were always shaking and banging it to get them to drop inside. It also didn't keep the smell in very well - spraying it down with Lysol helped. We were also worried that our daughter would push it over easily because it isn't too stable. I think we'll just stick to a plain old trash can - much easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I love this diaper pail. It's very easy to use and I've had no problems with odors. I save the plastic bags my newspapers come in, as well as bread bags, used ziplocks, etc, to wrap poopy diapers in before depositing them in the pail. Diapers that are just wet go straight in."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems yet!","review":"I just bought the Diaper Champ last week. It's really easy to use and I am not having any smell issues yet. Right now, his diapers don't smell too bad normally, so we'll see what happens when he starts going to solids. Sometimes it doesn't completely go down when you flip it, but other than that, I really like it. I wasn't willing to get the Diaper Genie (either one), because with everything else, I don't want the added cost of special bags. With the Diaper Champ, you can use any bag, and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.Update: We are at nearly 6 months, and he has been eating solids for about 2 weeks now. Still no smell issues until you go to empty is out. It is still something I would recommend. The only other thing I might possibly see as an issue might be that it doesn't hold a lot, but if it held anymore, the bags would weigh a TON! Either way, it is still working great for me!{edit} We are now at 16 months, and it still works great for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Reviews on Sellers BEFORE you buy.","review":"Baby Trend Diaper Champ.

Sounds almost as if they seller continues to send the same product in hopes someone will keep it. I have never had any trouble with anything that I bought on line at Amazon. com. I did email the seller and they told me to take it to UPS and send it back. They didn't offer to replace it, just said they would do a refund when they received the product back.

It holds 3-4 days worth of diapers, doesn't need refills- a garbarge bag or even a large babies r us plastic bag (sorry guys!!!)will do and best of all it does not release any odors. So, if you looking fo advice- like I did, the diaper champ is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first....","review":"I bought this before my daughter was born and loved it at first. It was so simple to use and seemed to keep the smell sealed away. Life was wonderful until she got her first stomach bug and the diaper champ couldn't even contain a portion of the odor. I went out and purchased a diaper genie that day (which by the way is too hard to use...get the dekor!). It was nice while it lasted (about 4 months) but now is in my attic."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE USE IT FOR KITTY LITTER!!!","review":"Living in small quarters with two \\"productive\\" cats, we were desperate. My daughter, who has 6 kids (3 in diapers) recommended this product, and we love it. It's easy to use, discreet, and, best of all, EFFECTIVE at controlling odor for up to a week. We simply scoop the litter into a grocery bag, dispose of it in the Diaper Champ, and at the end of the week, we take the whole thing to the garbage. THANK YOU THANK YOU for this great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love our Champ!","review":"I had a Diaper Genie with my other children, and hated it. With our newest we bought the Diaper Champ and I'm SOOO glad we did!! We don't have a problem with the nursery smelling at all!! It's very handy, and so much cheaper than having to buy liners! We also love how slim it is...fits into a corner nicely!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS LIKE A CHAMP!","review":"I assumed I would buy the Diaper Genie when purchasing a diaper pail, but was discouraged with buying refills weekly and after looking at it, even working the contraption. So when I found the Champ, I was excited but unsure if it would really do the job. Well, it has lived up to its name and has been a blessing since the day we brought our baby home. The Champ is so easy to use and empty. The quick drop and flip makes diapers seem to disapear forever{WELL ALMOST :) A few odors do escape when empting the Diaper Champ, but are gone the second you tie the trash bag up and those few seconds of odor are well worth avoiding the hassel and hidden cost of the Genie. I love it and I am so glad I read the reviews before I purchased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Operation--No need to deal with refills","review":"I tried to use a friend's Diaper Genie and couldn't figure out how to use it. I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it]. It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught). You only need one hand (so you can hold baby with the other). It contains the odor with no problem. Best of all, it's easy to empty, just push on the blue handle with the heel of your hand (no need to break your nails...), take out the old trash bag and put in a new one. No need to worry about running out of a special refill bag like the DG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Champ, Time to Retire...","review":"We set up changing stations upstairs and downstairs before our little one arrived, and decided to experiment -- Champ upstairs, Genie downstairs. What we quickly discovered is that the Champ is simply not as sanitary. There is no way every diaper can be completely sealed before going into the Champ, so this results in unfortunate smears down the chute into the garbage bag, and on the piece that klunks when you turn the handle over. [Almost completely] impossible to clean. It is possible to clean - but you have to take the thing apart, with difficulty, and is that really how you want to spend your time every few days with a newborn in the house? Yes, the Genie refills are more $ than garbage bags, but I bet your time is worth more! Best wishes with your baby/babies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tossed out the diaper champ","review":"I feel bad that I purchased this product only to throw it in a landfill...regrets. It is a terrible product. It jams all the time, which requires two hands (a safety hazard while changing a baby).I now use a garbage can with a lid and change it frequently--a much simpler solution. Don't buy this big plastic piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 11 months I'm shopping for something else","review":"I don't like this product. You have to step on it to flip the diaper into the pail. Sometimes the plunger thing doesn't go down all the way. The blue rubber around the hole is starting to come off, which makes it more difficult to flip it over. Many times I have to just open it up and put the diaper in, so it's basically just a glorified trash can. I'm looking for something else because I am sick and tired of wrestling with it after 11 months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't contain smell, blue ring fails","review":"The plastic blue ring is constantly coming off. I wrote them, they sent me directions, I did the directions, and it didn't help. The blue ring gets so bent that it won't even fit on the diaper champ anymore. This leads to the whole thing being unable to contain the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't keep the stink in","review":"I've had the diaper champ for my fist two kids and I really am not happy with it. I don't know if there is a perfect diaper pail but this one just isn't it. It doesn't keep the stink out. I don't want to change it every other day which I guess you have to do to keep the poo smell from taking over the room.What I do like is that you can use your own bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"We had the original version of the Diaper Champ for 4.5 years and 2 kids. It was getting a little smelly so I replaced it with the new and improved version. Yes, the wider opening is easier to use, but it does not contain the smell nearly as well as the old version. I used to put all diapers in it, and change it 2 times a week, for 4.5 years. With this one I can't even put the stinky diapers in it at all, they just have to go right outside. I put one stinky diaper in it, and came back to my son's room 2 hours later (he'd been asleep with the door closed) when I opened the door to his room the smell almost knocked me over. For the people with 3 month olds who rave about this diaper pail. Write again when your baby is eating solid food and let us know how you think this one does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't anyone tell me about this?","review":"My daughter is 6 months old and I finally had had enough of the diaper genie. I can't say enough how much easier the Champ is. It makes so much more sense. It holds a more diapers, you don't need a special bag and it keeps the smell in. I just wish that someone had told me about it when I was registering. So for all you new moms - get the Diaper Champ, it will make your hectic life just a bit easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy To Use","review":"I've had two of these and have hated them both. An older version with a smaller hole and bought a newer one, with a larger hole, hoping it would work better. The problem is that if you toss in a wipe or two, alone, without a diaper, it doesn't allow you to pull the handle up and over. It gets stuck. I have to use my foot to anchor it and shove the handle up and over. I hate mine and am happy to sell it! I am having another baby and will be buying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one stinky diaper pail!","review":"I have been using the Diaper Champ for over a year, and I HATE it!!! My entire upstairs stinks like diapers, and I don't know how to make this thing contain its stink (as it claims to do). It's AWFUL. I've taken to putting my son's diapers into freezer bags and sealing them up before putting them in, and I'm hoping the smell will go away. I clean the diaper pail every time I change the bag, as well, but it does not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Smelly Smelly","review":"We found that this product only lasted about a year before it became useless for keeping out the smell. We change it twice a week, and it still stinks up my son's room (a normal sized room). My husband takes it apart and scrubs it, still the smell comes back right away. We even bought deoderizers, etc. I got a Dekor from a friend of mine when my daughter was born, and I love it. I am going to buy 2 more Dekor's tomorrow for my son's room and the playroom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bearable with a little creativity...","review":"I read alot of reviews before getting this item. I don't understand how it's supposed to NOT smell when you empty it - there's no type of seal or whatnot. My baby girl is only two weeks old and I dread the really stinky toddler diapers so I came up with a workable solution. I put her diapers (especially the stinky ones) into Ziploc sandwich bags and drop them in. Seals in 'freshness'. :) It's an extra step, but well worth it. With my extra solution, it seems to be working rather well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Diaper Pail","review":"I registered for the Diaper Champ because a) I loved the simple concept, b) I was pleased by the reviews and c) I knew I HATED the Diaper Genie. The Champ is extremely easy to use and I love that it takes regular trash bags. It only takes one hand to flip the lever, so I can keep one hand on the baby at all times. When it becomes a little more difficult to flip, I know it's time for a replacement bag. The only time there is a noticeable odor is when I'm changing the bags. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and poorly made - pail gets stuck all the time!","review":"We tried the Diaper Champ for 3 weeks. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap plastic. The diapers were constantly getting stuck in the opening making it impossible to throw them out. First we thought it was the tape on the diapers, so we had to make sure we stuck the tape on the diapers the right way in order to make sure we could throw out the diapers, but the stupid pail still stuck. We called Baby Trend and they were absolutely unsympathetic. They said it was either the gaskets in the pail that had to be replaced (on a 3 week old pail!) or the diaper tape had to be put in place before throwing out the diaper. We went to the store and were able to return it without the box and were told that it's a pretty common problem. We got a Diaper Dekor and so far it's been super easy and worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like it!","review":"I researched which diaper pail was better when i was pregnant with my first. This one seemed to have the most positive reviews so i added it to my registry. I got mine 3 1/3 years ago and i'm still using it (going on baby #3).I like the fact that you can use regular trash bags, even the cheap ones! It's very convenient to use as well. Lifting the lid can be a little tricky if you have long nails but it's not a big deal once you get used to how it works.The only thing i recommend is to make sure you wash it out and sanitize it at least twice a month because it will eventually starts to smell if not. And if you have two kids in diapers like i do, it fills up fast and I have to change the bag twice a week. With one baby i only had to change the bag once a week.It is now 2008 and i've had 2 more children (4 total) since I originally wrote this review. I am still using the same Diaper Champ and I still highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!!!","review":"All I have to say is I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! This product is far better than the diaper genie or any other similar product on the market!!!! As for the reviews regarding the odor, if you buy the scented garbage bags and change the diaper champ on a regular basis (i.e. at least once a week) there is no odor!!! I love it and I highly recommend it. Plus alot of money is saved by using regular garbage bags!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the convenience...but","review":"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that's why I rated this so high. However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter's diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid. Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting. Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail. The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night. Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A FAN OF THIS ONE!!!","review":"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE CONVIENCE OF THE PAIL IS GREAT, AND UP UNTIL MY DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS IT WAS OK!

I HAVE EVEN SOAKED THE PAIL IN BLEACH THEN AGAIN IN AMMONIA AND THE STINK WILL NOT COME OUT! I HAVE TRIED SCENTED BAGS, I HAVE TRIED GLAD TRASH WITH NO LUCK! ALSO, I CONSIDER MY SELF NEROTIC ABOUT BEING CLEAN SO I WILL END WITH THIS FOR NEWBORNS IT IS GREAT, THE CONVIENCE THE ODOR, BUT NOW FORGET IT!!! GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS TO ALL THE NEW PARENTS! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Genie vs. Diaper Champ!","review":"Much easier to use than the Diaper Genie. I ended up throwing away my Diaper Genie after only 8 month because the blade broke that cuts the bags, and it was too hard to use. The new bags that I bought for it weren't working right, and I couldn't do it with one hand. My sister-in-law had this Diaper Champ, and it was so much easier, and more economical since you don't have the special bags to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stainless Steel Step can Worked Better","review":"My cousin recommended this and said it kept out the smell so I was excited to use it and then all I smelled in my daughter's room were smelly diapers. Not sure why but this plastic thing didn't work for me. Now I just use a vintage diaper pail stainless steel step can with a paper bag on the bottom to absorb the odors. I replace the paper bag every once in a while and now it's fairly odor free."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST HAVE!!","review":"Thank the lord for whomever designed this fabulous thing! I did lots of research when registering and went with this because of friends telling me how they hated the Diaper Genie. I LOVE IT!! It is SO easy to use and keep clean. It doesn't let one stinky odor creep into the baby's room. You'll get some odor when you open it to change it but come on, there are poopy diapers in there!! How do you expect it to smell?! It takes tall kitchen garbage bags that we already use so there is no added cost to use this. We only empty it twice a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a baby!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a few months, hard to use with large diapers","review":"Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore. Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston. Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly. I gave up and got a diaper Dekor. Much more hands off and takes any size diapers. Also much less stinky. Don't buy the diaper champ. You will be sorry after a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first","review":"The Diaper Champ worked great for about the first eight months. After that, it started to loose it's ability to contain the stink. We have resorted to placing the Diaper Champ on the back patio. I hope it doesn't attract any wildlife!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient, but stinks!","review":"The diaper champ is very easy to use and relatively easy to change the bags (which are regular kitchen garbage bags ... nice!), but my son's room stinks because it doesn't really get rid of any of the odor. I'm going to try something else ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old design","review":"Ok, I have not used the new & improved version but I can tell you: seek out the old version! It has been great! No expensive diaper genie bags to buy -- you can just use the plastic bags from the grocery store. On the new version, I do not see the tabs to loop the plastic bag handles over...I hope that doesn't mean you can't use them anymore!!! Also, the old version seals well and does not allow odors to leak into the room. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!","review":"I too agree that this diaper pail is the best!! Forget about having to buy special bags for your diaper genie that create little diaper sausages...this pail is sealed so tight that you don't smell a thing until you open it to dispose of the REGULAR KITCHEN BAGS you use in it. That to me was the feature that sealed the deal. My son is 8 weeks old and when he first came home I went out and bought a box of kitchen bags, threw them in the bottom of the pail and I haven't even gone through that first box of bags yet. Our baby shares a room with us and we have the Diaper Champ about two feet away from our bed and can't smell a thing...and I have a power nose - I can always smell everything and have never even gotten a whiff. BUY THIS ITEM - it is the best!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I got the diaper champ after hearing it needs no refills to it. I thought it was a good bargain... I WAS WRONG!

I opted not to because of the expensive refill bags. I'm glad I didn't buy it. We live in an apartment and have the Champ set up in his bedroom. I don't smell any odors unless I open the Champ up to change the bag....which is expected when you have a bag filled with wet and soiled diapers. We use scented Glad bags to help mask the odor, which helps. I don't know how it will perform when I switch my son to formula and when he starts solids, so I give the Champ 4 stars. I'll probably just put the wet diapers in it and take the soiled ones out to the garbage can. I would definately recommend this diaper pail to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product !!!!","review":"The first thing I have to say, is that I like that you dont have to purchase special bags for it. Who the heck as time for that, when you have a newborn at home. I have to say that since my daughter has been born 7-14-04 I have only smelled her diapers twice. It is so easy to clean up, just pull the bag up and throw it in the trash. This is a must have for new parents ...The one thing I dont like, is that it should be a alittle larger in size to fit a few more diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Champ Hits Hard!!!","review":"This thing really hits the mark!!! Inexpensive, economical, effective and super easy to use!!1 The best part about it is it uses REGULAR kitchen bags. No special bags or canisters.We really love this diaper system...

Using normal bags is a big plus!Having only had breastfed poopy diapers (which aren't as smelly as regular poopy diapers) in this up until now, i really cant' comment on its complete and total efectiveness against really stinky poops, but for the breastfed diapers it has been low or no maintenance and odor free!Easy to use, inexpensive and odor free are why this reviewer feels that the Diaper Champ, for now, still stands as an Undefeated Heavyweight!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly","review":"I thought the Diaper Champ was the best thing ever...for the first 6 months. I loved it so much I bought two. Too bad after 6 months, I would go into my son's room and think he had pooped, but no..it was just the Champ. My living room one also smelled disguisting. My sister-in-law and two friends have encountered the same. We all bought them on each other's recommendations because it was easy and we did not have to buy special bags. Well, we were the suckers because we have all gone back to the Diaper Genie or the regular trash. Do not make the mistake we did. The editor mentions an order here and there but believe me, it is much more than that. It is embarassing.

When she was strictly breastfed her poop had no foul odor. Once her poop started to smell the smell started leaking out. She is 17 months old now and we are off to buy a Diaper Genie. Sure, it may be more complicated and a bit more expensive, but right now we are having to change the trash bag in the Diaper Champ every time she poops. It's such a smelly hassle!

In the long run you'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad , bad, bad !!!","review":"Don't waste your money... The smell is TERRIBLE everytime I open to change the plastic bag.

The flip top is easy to use and can be done in the dark at night with no problem.The only problem I have with it is it is a bit difficult to open when changing bags. You really have to pull hard on the handle to get it open.Overall I've been really happy with this.

I don't have any problem with odor. Of course, you have to clean it once in a while (maybe once every week or 2), well, it's a garbage disposal! What do you expect? Honestly, I rarely even clean it. It's easy to use (no turning and changing of liners), easy to clean, much cheaper than the Diaper Genie as you can use regular plastic garbage bags, and it is a good size. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe nothing is perfect and because of the size, it takes up more space than the Diaper Genie. Despite that, I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing is EVER fool-proof, but...","review":"...this IS a great product. Most people who LOVE this and report that it has no smell have only used it a for a few months. I have 4 kids and am pregnant with number 5 so I have been using diaper pails for 6 years now. I originally got the Diaper Genie and had the same complaints as everyone else--too small, too complicated, too expensive with special refills, smelled bad after extended use, etc. The Diaper Champ is a better bet because it is larger, simple to use, cheaper, no expensive refills to buy--BUT, as with ANY diaper pail, after a while, it WILL smell. No real way around it except to try hints that have worked for other people--scented bags, double bagging, weekly cleaning with Lysol, Stick-ups, etc. All in all though, I am quite pleased with Diaper Champ and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a champ in our house!","review":"I received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift for my first child (now 6), but it was the original model (i.e., narrow opening), and I had difficulty finding refills. While shopping for a replacement diaper pail for my second child, I was sold on the Diaper Champ. It is so easy and convenient to use, and it requires only one hand to use. No worry about a wobbly pail as you insert and store the diaper thanks to the pail's broad-based bottom (and it will be difficult for my son to topple this one over). Many customers have complained about diaper odor, but I have found using Glad scented kitchen garbage bags nearly eliminates this problem (however, cheaper scented bags don't work as well). The cost of these garbage bags is negligible compared to the cost of Diaper Genie refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Champ","review":"I bought the diaper champ because I didn't like the diaper genie.

We keep it upstairs in her room, so it's not like many \\"soiled\\" diapers even go in there, but when they do, her whole room smells every time you turn the handle. We recently went away for the weekend and I soaked the whole thing in bleach, thinking that would help, but a couple of days later, the smell is back.

My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks. Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room. It penetrated into the room. Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside. I was changing the bag on an every day basis. This is by far the worst product out there.

The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy. No parts to break unlike the other leading brand. It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag. Here's a tip: Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ. NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No smells / Convenient product","review":"We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers. It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day. Highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Champ Blues","review":"I have to say I'm very disappointed in the Diaper Champ. I agree it's easy to use, but the first dirty diaper and the whole room stinks. Isn't one of the big reasons you have it is to keep the room smelling fairly good? We have the air freshner that goes with it, a second air freshner and odor guard bags and it still stinks! This is our first baby so I have not tried any other product yet, but I would NOT recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid choice.","review":"I've only been using this product for a couple of weeks and I am completely satisfied with it. It has a locking top feature which is not complicated to work, but is safe for keeping my child out. It works great for my cloth diaper system. I don't use any bag with it, just keep the cloth nappies inside. All smells are retained. Cleaning is a snap.The only minor draw back is that the top piston-style mechanism is heavily weighted and it can surprise you, falling shut while you have it open. Knowing that ahead of time, I have yet to pinch a finger.All being said, I'd buy it again - given the choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Duper Choice","review":"Works great, easy to use, no odor (if used properly). Using plastic kitchen bags with draw strings, solves many possible problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT Diaper Disposal System!","review":"We love the fact that we can use our tall kitchen garbage bags with our Diaper Champ instead of having to buy special refills like Playtex's Diaper Genie. Diaper smells are contained well. The capacity seems to be slightly larger than the Diaper Genie, too. (Less trips outside with bags of dirty diapers equals less work for Mommy and Daddy!) Wouldn't trade this diaper disposal system for any other! 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Chump not Champ","review":"My husband and I purchased this on our own (no shower to help us out) because we thought it would be easier to use than the Diaper Genie. We quickly learned that althought the Diaper Chump is very easy to use, it STINKS, literally. We had to move it to another room less used by people. I have since thrown out the Diaper Chump after a very long 4 months and bought a Diaper Genie which actually is very easy to use. Don't buy this under any circumstances, unless your baby doesn't make stinky diapers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product!!!","review":"The diaper champ is very simple and easy to use. It keeps the smell out. Unlike other diaper pales, you are able to use regular household garbage bags. It holds quite a bit of diapers, only needing to be changed every 4 days or o, with a newborn. I would definately recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No smell, no capacity","review":"The first thing this product is meant to do is suppress the smell of diapers. Our son is only 5 weeks, but the Diaper Champ does seem to prevent smells from getting out.But.After the third diaper in the bag, the Diaper Champ jams constantly. Only the most tightly bound and compacted diapers then have a chance of not jamming the mechanism, and even then it's a 50/50 shot. The result is that we often wind up opening the whole top to get the diapers in, which totally defeats the purpose of the item.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only way to get rid of the smell is to buy a diaper genie.","review":"I am surprised the product has so many good reviews. Perhaps in the beginning when baby poop stinks less (before they start eating food) it isn't as bad, I can't remember. All I remember is the constant smell. I tried everything to get it to smell better. Finally, I went and bought the diaper genie and have never looked back. My in-laws currently have the champ for my nephew and I won't even put a diaper in it because when I turn the lever to dump it, the smell is unbearable and lingers in the room. You do have to buy the bags to go with the diaper genie, but they last long enough that I have never felt like it wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly and not worth using","review":"I just bought this today because I was tired of buying refills for my Diaper Genie II, especially on a tight budget. After using it for just 4 diapers, I packed it back up and am bringing it back to the store for a refund.Each time I flipped the handle and the piston moved, it gave off a huge waft of diaper smell. And the smell lingered and it was all I could smell in the room. Not ideal for a diaper pail.And when the piston is down it leaves a large hole where you put the diaper. But my 3-year old thought this would be a great place to put her toys. Yuck!I will stick with my Diaper Genie II. I've been using it with regular trash bags with it and it still works better at containing the odor than the diaper champ did with just 4 diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for newborns, awful for toddlers","review":"This is a good concept, easy to use, no special bags etc. BUT, when the diapers get bigger they get stuck very easily and very few fit even though this thing is much bigger than the diaper genie. ALso, watch out for the smell. I feel like the plastic has permanenely absorbed the poop odor and no amount of cleaning or bleaching can get it out. I'm expecting another baby and don't plan on using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loooooove the Diaper Champ!","review":"We originally thought we would register for a Diaper Genie. Forget that! Those bags you have to buy!! We just re use the bags you get at the grocery store. And who doesn't ahve a zillion of those! Works great! It doesn't smell! (We empty it about every 3 days with a newborn!).The only problems? When it is is full--no way of knowing, so sometimes when you flip the shoot down, it gets stuck. Easily solved--openit up and take out the diapers. Opening it could be a bit easier too. Broken a few nails. BUT I'd rather it be a bit hard to open than to have a curious baby get into the diapers! EEWWW!The Champ is a champ in my stats book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy with the Champ.","review":"I've never had a problem with the Champ sticking or the closing mechanism not \\"rolling\\" correctly. The best part is, you can't close it once the thing is full and you are forced to change it. If you are like me, if you can't smell it, you're not going to do anything about it until it's gross. This thing makes you keep up with the diapers.I've got a 4/5 month old and we have to change the bag twice a week. We just use our tall kitchen trash bags. I give the thing a quick wipedown and we're off and running again.It is also small enough that my baby's tiny room isn't overwhelmed by a diaper contraption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Stinky Poo","review":"I used the Diaper Genie for 4 years and had no problems with odor. After 4 years and 2 kids it was starting to fall apart, so I decided to buy a diaper champ. I liked the idea that I didn't have to buy the refills or worry about the twist and changing etc.. But, the trade off has not been good! My Diaper champ does not hold odor. I change the bag 1-2 times per week, but my child's room still stinks every time I enter. I use Clorox wipes to clean it and Lysol spray. I would not recommend this product to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never buy a refill again!!","review":"We had purchased one of those \\"other\\" diaper pails, you know, the kind with the refills. We found one whose refills were less expensive. Unfortunately, the brand went under or something, and we could no longer find the cartridges. Then we found this gem. No refill cartridges, any bag will do. We use scented kitchen trash bags. Our only complaint is that this isn't very airtight, and gets smelly quite quickly. Other than that, the best diaper pail money can buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this Diaper Pail","review":"We originally were going to buy the Diaper Dekor, with its own special refill bags, but then changed our minds and bought the Diaper Champ instead, as it could use regular kitchen garbage bags...BIG MISTAKE!!!!! when you turn the handle to dispose of the diaper into the pail, the wipes from the previous turn, are often stuck inside, so when you turn the handle, the wipes pop out onto the floor! we are now going back to our original plan of buying the Diaper Dekor, despite the fact that you have to buy special refill bags"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and Odor-Free","review":"This product is great! It's simple to assemble and use. There are no cartriges to buy and no odor leaks. We're very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have used the Diaper Champ for 20 months","review":"I have used the Diaper Champ for 20 months now and I love it. Yes my son's diet and bowel movements have changed, but it still works great. I just think some of you have gotten a bad one. There is always a lemon in the bunch. I will buy one for my sister-in-law when she has her shower next month. Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It, Love It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product... not large enough for cloth diapers","review":"I love this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers. It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their \\"mother's room\\". That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me. I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I used the diaper champ when my son was about 18 months old. It does not keep odor out, sometimes diaper gets stuck, making a big mess! After awhile it smell even when empty... I prefer using the DG, it's more sanitary and really does the job"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ is Great, Especially With Scented Trash Bags!!!","review":"ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods. Get over it. This pail is fantastic. We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap). There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Stinky here!","review":"My husband and I share a bedroom with our baby and keep the Diaper Champ in the bedroom next to the changing table. I have never caught a whiff of anything poopy. We change the bag once every week and a half or so. I wipe it down with a clorox wipe and spray a little lysol and the Champ is fresh and ready to go.We chose the Diaper Champ because it takes any regular trash bag which is convinient and cost effective.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because opening the Diaper Champ to change the bag is sometimes a little tricky (although my husband never has a problem, maybe it's just me). But in the long run, it being a little difficult to open will be a bonus when I have a curious toddler running around trying to get into things.I certainly reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets the job done","review":"i chose this over the diaper genie because i didn't want to keep pouring money into it for specific bags. it is very easy to use- you just put the diaper in and flip the lid. it only acts jammed when it's time to change the bag. for those who say it's not sanitary for poopy diapers- are you rolling up the diaper and closing it with the velcro pieces? my only problem with it is i can smell dirty diaper when i walk in the room. my child is 3 mo's old and his soils have become more potent, but the pale's job is to keep the odor in. it shouldn't matter how old the child is or whther or not he's eating solids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well when baby is young","review":"We have used ours for a year now. And its an overall good product. But when your baby starts eating solids at about 6mth, the poopy diapers get really stinky and even the diaper champ cannot stop these nasty smells from seeping out. We now have a carbon filtered fan to get rid on the smell of dirty diapers in addition to the diaper champ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The least stinky, but not stink free.","review":"This is a great diaper garbage can, but it still stinks. I don't think there is a diaper pail available that doesn't stink. I tried a stick on air freshener which then caused a stinky lemon smell. I have found that the best way to keep the smell away is to spray the inside with antibacterial spray every time you change the liner. This makes a big difference! I love the convenient one hand toss system. This is my 5th baby and the diaper champ is the easiest and least smelly system I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ K.O.'s Diaper Genie","review":"Love this diaper pail! I had had some experience with Diaper Genie in our church nursery before my daughter was born and could never quite get the hang of it. The Diaper Champ is wonderful. I'm amazed when I empty it at how much stink it is actually holding inside. And the fact that you don't have to buy expensive refills is an added bonus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ Wins most challenges","review":"We love that you can use any plastic bag for this diaper pail. The overall design is good, and easy to use.The few minor issues we have had is with the latch to open/close the pail, and a few construction issues.1. Latch: The unit can be hard to open with the inter-locking \\"layers\\" (Lid, Bag holder, Base)2. Construction: A) The sliding plunger can get stuck on an inner seam of the top, it can be pushed into alignment but can be aggravating at 3am.B) The \\"foam\\" pad that the rotating section rides on can become seperated from the plastic housing and the adhesive sticks to the rotating barrel making the top stick.Overall we like the Diaper Champ, but wouldn't mind seeing a couple design improvements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good for us","review":"I like this diaper pail for the most part. It does a pretty good job of keeping the odor in. I like that you can use any bag with it. I just bought a roll of cheap kitchen bags. The only complaint is when it gets too full the handle/chute part gets jammed and can be hard to un-jam, but I guess that's what happens when I don't change it often enough. I would recommend this product for its simplicity and effectiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"It depends on how much you use it","review":"When I was home for the first 8 weeks it seem'd ok. It was when I went back to work that it didn't work. It's ok when you change the bag alot. It fills up pretty quickly so it's not too bad. Now that she's in day care full time, I don't fill it up fast enough and the room would smell like diapers. so I used it for the first 8 weeks and now not at all. If I were to do it again, I would just buy the disposable garbage bags they sell for the diaper bags and just put them in my regular trash. That is what I do now and have no problems with smells. Munchkin sells awesome bags for dirty diapers, they come in a little duck for your diaper bag. Those are awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, but not odorless","review":"We opted for the Diaper Champ because of its ease of use and the ability to use regular garbage bags to dispose of diapers. We are happy with those chcracteristics of the Champ. However, it isn't as odorless as we had hoped, especially when it gets to be nearly full. One trick we use that seems to keep the odor away is to put a piece of charcoal at the bottom of the bin when you change the bag, and that absorbs the odors. Because of how easy it is, we would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better product than the Diaper Genie","review":"This diaper pail far excededs the Diaper Genie. There is no worrying about running out of refills. The bags are so easy to change. The pail can get a little smelly, but some lysol and the odor guard trash bags help a lot. Overall, a much more convenient and less expensive product than the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORLD CHAMPION \\" CHUMP\\"","review":"After reading how great this product was on the convenience of not having to but those expensive bags ( diaper genie) I registered for the diaper champ.

I didn't have to wait long before I was provided with a fresh offering. I bundled up the heavily laden diaper and hauled it into the Diaper Champ. Alas!

I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading all the reveiws here, I bought the diaper champ thinking it was a great deal. I liked that I could use any type of bag with it and not have to hunt down the genie bags. It does inhibit the odor from escaping the pail however there is one major downfall with this item. Opening it.I have broken off three nails on my right hand trying to get this thing open. The latch is hard to open because basically you have to use the tips of your fingers to disengage it which is tricky. If you have nice nails and prefer to keep them, I suggest getting a different pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ is the Champ","review":"I wouldn't use any other... The Diaper Champ is easy to use (unlike some others) you can do it one handed, which is nice with a little one, and the simple fact that you can use the garbage bags that you allready are buying is wonderful. Really you can throw anything in it that fits in the hole, so it is not wasting bags like you would with the genie to toss tissues or other things that you might need to toss, q-tips, cotton balls, candy wrappers, etc. and it is easy to change the garbage bags. I wouldn't have any other diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Odor Control","review":"We bought the Diaper Champ when our daughter was born in Dec. '01. It has performed er well, like a champ!

We have been very, very happy with it and are very glad we purchased it. I also agree with \\"Worth Getting Another\\" below.

This is the only diaper pail I've seen that will accomodate diapers that are going to be washed rather than thrown away, and still control the odor. I use a laundry bag rather than a trash bag. For those using disposable diapers, a pail that takes regular trash bags has simply got to be the better bet.

I then came across the Diaper Champ and read the wonderful reviews so decided to register for it. Well I can not say enough about how great this thing is. First of all, it uses REGULAR, ORDINARY garbage bags. No need for any special bags. Second, it does what it says it does. NO ODORS. It's easy to set up--just take it out the box and get a garbage bag! It's easy to empty once it's full--just flip up the top and take out the bag! It doesn't get better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"genie can give you three of these...","review":"I gave away my genie and bought one of these. This is so much easier and smells less.

I discovered it while changing my son in a Babies R Us restroom. They had one in there next to the changing table and I had to have it! You just drop the dirty diaper into the tube and flip the handle. It couldn't be any easier and there is no mess because the tube is wide. My 6 year old loves to flip the lid and watch the dirty diaper \\"disappear\\". My baby is now 8 months old and has some seriously stinky diapers, but there is absolutely no odor in his room. I think the key is that I use the GLAD deodorized trashbags. I used the Diaper Genie for my first child and there is just no comparison. One of my friends is having a baby in August and I plan on buying her a Diaper Champ and box of those GLAD deodorant trashbags. I know she'll love it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ beats all others!","review":"This is the best-designed diaper pail. All you have to do is drop in the diaper and turn the handle. There is nothing to push or twist. And because it is taller than most other diaper pails, you don't really have to bend over. It also traps in odors well. My sister-in-law had a Safety 1st diaper pail and my cousin had the diaper genie, but they both eventually wound up getting the Diaper Champ, which they love. Also, because you can use any plastic bag, there are no expensive refills to buy, so it's also a money saver. If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Pail Pain","review":"I researched ths diaper pails and actually returned the one I already received due to the ratings of the Diaper Champ. Though it does use regular trash bags, I use scented bags as it does not \\"twist\\" the diapers and I am trying to reduce any odor when I open the pail. The \\"easy to open\\" feature is diffucult to open and usually snaps so hard I hurt my fingers . The smell is minimal as my child is still a newborn and I do use scented garbage bags, I can only guess that as my child gets older and the diapers get more \\"smelly\\" I may be in trouble with odor control! The garbage bag does insert easily but doesn't lock in the system anyway to seem secure.

After about 2 diapers, the odor comes through which causes the entire room to smell bad. I must admit that the convience of the one hand handle is a great idea, however, after about 8 to 10 diapers, you can forget about the ease of the handle because it tends to get stuck.

IT STINKS so bad...it doesn't hold the odour what so ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Smells","review":"I have been through the Diaper Genie, the Safety 1st diaper pail, and this one. I've liked this one the least. The diaper genie worked the longest for keeping odors away -about 9-10 months.(I washed it with bleach once and it was never the same after that). But it was annoying to have to buy the refill bags. So we bought the Safety 1st pail next. That lasted about 4-5 months and the spring broke. I've had the diaper champ for about 8 months. One good dirty diaper and the room smells, even if you flip the handle twice. I've tried putting baking soda on the bottom and have tried the odor eating garbage bags and neither idea has helped with the odors. I also found that this one is the hardest to clean (especially the cylinder).My daughter also likes to flip the handle-and if that cylinder is not sitting right...the stench is awful. Truthfully I have found that none of these systems work 100%. I'm about ready to use my kitchen pail (at least the garbage is thrown out every day)."},{"rating":"1","title":"We like to call it the Diaper Chump!","review":"I would agree with a previous reviewer, Matthew. While the bags are cheaper because you can use your existing trash bags. The assault on your nose when you go to empty it almost blows you over, paticularly if its the summer and the room its in doesn't have AC. When we would empty it - we would take it outside first and then leave it oustide, open overnight. Not worth the savings in bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"diaper champ","review":"Thank goodness we found something better and easier than \\"genie\\"!!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ Review","review":"I have been using the diaper champ for a month now and am extremely satisfied. This is my second child and with my first we used a diaper genie. The genie became smelly way before it was time to empty it. Even with regular cleaning it still absorbed the bm smell. I like the fact that the diaper champ is enclosed well and the changing with regular garbage bags is much simpler than the genie. I knew with this child I was not going to use the diaper genie again. I read that the diaper champ was highly recommended in the American Baby magazine. For this reason and the price I wanted to try this product only. I feel very happy with my choice of this product.Denise Springer, Longview, WA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - no problems!!!","review":"This is great!!!

It says ODOURLESS on the box - but it does smell even when you drop the excess in the toilet! I read the instructions to make sure I was using it properly and still no difference.

So I am now satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH THE SMELL!!!!","review":"We bought this 3 years ago for my son when he was born in an effort to avoid the more expensive Diaper Champ and to avoid having to buy special bags for it. This was a mistake. After my son started eating solid foods, the smell was horrible! Despite keeping Lysol nearby, my husband and I were always arguing over who would take the bag out when it was full. Several times I took it outside and cleaned it with clorox to get rid of the smell, but it only returned. We're now expecting again, and this time we're going with the Diaper Genie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold your breath on this one!","review":"We were former diaper genie fans until after about 8 mos of usage it was nearly impossible to change out the refill containers. It seemed that the ring on the inside had worn down, and the refill wouldn't fit. We became frustrated and went immediately to the store and purchased this diaper champ. I so wished I had read the reviews on this product prior to my purchase. I loved the fact that you could drop the diaper in the small opening and it immediately vanished to the inside of the pail. However, the smells remained, causing our son's room to reek of waste. No matter how many times we changed the bags, the smell never went away. Nice concept, but a total waste of money. We ended up going back and buying another diaper genie. The one star I gave it is for the neat way you drop the diapers into the pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"this STINKS","review":"The diaper champ is only a champ when you have wet diapers or are breastfeeding (poop doesn't stink).

At first it was great. The only time we smelled something was when it was time to change the bag. Once my son started on solids I started smelling it more. So I changed the bag more frequently. That worked for a while, but now nothing works. I took the champ outside cleaned it with clorox clean up, sprayed it with lysol and left it open outside for two days. As soon as the first poopy diaper went in, the smell returned. We are on the look out for a new one.

With a 2 year old that wasn't yet potty-trained and another on the way, I wanted a diaper disposal system in each of my boys' rooms. I had this one in my two-year old's room and it was horrible. I thought that not having to purchase separate bags would be wonderful. I even bought those garbage bags with the odor removal in them and it still didn't work. My sons' room smelled terrible after about a week. No amount of cleaning the unit helped. At least with the Diaper Genie, you seal off the bag and there is a seal when you close the lid. Not with this system. It is easier to use, but the smell is awful. You might as well just put the diaper in a pail and remove it daily. Or, if you want, I've got a perfectly good one sitting in my basement and you can have it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross","review":"I hated this diaper pail.

It does not hold odors at all. I have read in other reviews about how you have to constantly clean and use disinfectant, etc. Why wouldn't I just use a covered trashcan then? The whole purpose of this is to keep odors out of the house. My wife, who recently had our second child, was overcome with the smell during her second pregnancy, to the point where she never put a poopy diaper in the Diaper Champ. We have another diaper dispoal system for our new baby (forgive me for forgetting the name), and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product out there!","review":"We bought this because it was recommended by Consumer Reports and I certainly regret it!

WAY too overpriced! I wish I had researched a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"New and Improved? No Way.","review":"We first had the original diaper champ, which I would have given 4 stars. It kept the odor in pretty well, was easy to use, used regular trash bags...etc. We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid. Since it was letting the odor out, we decided to replace it with the new and improved model. WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER. As soon as the diapers start piling up, the lid grabs tabs, wipes, etc and jams the top so you can't flip it. I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model. This is why things get jammed...also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it. HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this on Saturday because I was dissatisfied with the Diaper Genie. By Monday, I wanted it out of my house.

Our feelings for this product deepened even more this weekend after a run-in with the Diaper Genie at my brother's place--the thing was *so* much harder to use! With the Diaper Champ, you just place the diaper in the top and flip the lid. The diapers (and their odors) are well sealed in the main container. With the Diaper Genie, we had to open the thing, push the diaper down, twist the ring, then close it and twist the lid again--puh-leeze! Lots of our friends swore by the Diaper Genie, but after this incident with it, I decided to post a review for the Diaper Champ and encourage other Moms to go for the better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Version Not So Good","review":"I own the original Diaper Champ and it lives up to its name! However, I went to buy a second one and learned that they have a new version on the market. Great I thought -- I was wrong. The \\"new and improved\\" version is not so improved. The weight is not heavy enough to send the diapers into the bag thoroughly and there is enough space between the weight and the wall that diaper edges get stuck in between; both resulting in a clogged mechanism. Also they have designed the new diaper champ to be bigger on the bottom than the top, thus making it difficult to lift out the trash bag. If you can get the older one its very worth it, but the \\"new and improved\\" -- forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that impressed","review":"My son is now 11months old, and this is the only diaper pail I have had, but I would definetly try something else for my next child.The good things about this diaper pail are the price, and it is easy to use and change the bags. It doesn't require any special bags which is cost efficent.The thing I can't stand about it and the reason I only gave it 2 stars is because of the smell. My childs room always smells like I just changed his diaper.

While it's relatively easy to use, if the smell factor is what you want to avoid, go with the Diaper Genie model with the \\"wide mouth\\" instead.

A very disappointing item. I would definitely NOT recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinking pail","review":"We registered for this item because of the convience of the trash bags. We are now finally giving up on this item and purchasing the diaper genie. We changed the bags several times a week, bleached the pail regularly and used the odor control disks. Nothing works! On top of this, the foam seal came unglued and twisted making it usless and of course even more odorful. When you end up taking each of the diapers outside to the trash as they come, the point of having a diaper pail is diminished greatly and I would rather spend the money on the special bags. Needless to say, it was a waste of money since we are now going to by the other brand anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKY!!!!","review":"I don't think I would have bought the diaper champ if I heard how bad it smelled! I read all great reviews but I guess people must have left out how bad it stinks all the time. It does not keep odor out at all. I have scented trash bags in it and it still gags me when I walk in my daughters room. I think the way to open it is awfully hard too. I brake a nail every time or pinch my fingers. I don't think I would reccommend this to anyone. It helps save money because you don't have to buy special bags but for the extra money I would have gotten the diaper genie.

Contrary to other posters suggestions, we do change it about every other day, and the reek is so bad. Even after spraying febreze, or glade neutralizer in it... I have cleaned it with clorox wipes, sprinkled baking soda in it, and it still reeks.

But, once she started eating more solids and the poo starting smelling more it was awful. There was always an odor and my daughter's room began to smell. We decided to get rid of it and buck up for the Diaper Genie. I've been so pleased with it, well worth the money and the refill film goes further than you'd think.

I can't belive some of the negative reviews. Our daughter is 14 months old and we have used this since day one. To the reviewer who said wipes get stuck...WRAP THEM IN THE DIRTY DIAPER.

I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great. There is no diaper odor in our nursery. When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!).If you don't clean things, they don't smell clean.

At first it worked well- no major problems. It smelled when you opened it to change the bag- but what container storing dirty diapers wouldn't? After about 2 months of use, the smell got bad. I had been changing the bag frequently, cleaning it, airing it out outside, and finishing that routine with Lysol. However I could smell the thing in the hall outside of my daughter's bedroom. I changed the bag, cleaned it, etc (see my usual routine above) and it still smelled. It wasn't even open!To make an even longer story shorter- I bought the Diaper Genie and found that all of the \\"reasons\\" that I didn't buy it in the first place (refills being costly/annoying) didn't even apply to me. The refills are about $5 and are available at all of the stores that I go to on a regular basis.

My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine.

When you put a diaper in and flip it, all the stinky air comes flying out and it's horrible. The larger opening is nice but it certainly isn't as airtight as the older model. I'd keep looking for a better diaper pail rather than buy the new diaper champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather buy refills...","review":"... than deal with the odor from this pail. Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn't help. We've moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked...at first","review":"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ. It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn't contain the smell. Babies 'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again. I would say it's a product default. We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out. Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers. I'm pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ is a knockout","review":"Far superior than the diaper genie.

It is very easy to use, but my baby's room stinks from this daiper pail. I sometimes wash it but that doesn't help either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I've used one for disposable and then one for cloth diapers.The Good:1. It does contain odor well if you change the bag every two days or so. 2. It does not require special bags. 3. You can use with cloth diapers (in theory.)The Bad: 1. Impractical for Cloth diapers because you have to change them out far too often into another bag. No diaper service wants to pick up 7 bags! Cloth diapers are just too bulky for the champ. 2. Far too tempting a toy for a toddler. 3. Hard to clean the hole you put the diaper into which can become smeared with poop on a bad day.The Very Ugly and Frustrating: ***Wipes Jam it! It's easy to say \\"tuck the wipe into the diaper\\" but with babies and toddlers you can't always plan things so smoothly. The champ becomes jammedmultiple times a day from a lose wipe or one just not tucked into a disposable diaper well enough. It's truly maddening and the main reason I gave it only 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you get in convenience you lose in smell control","review":"I chose this diaper pail because it's so easy to use and it takes normal (cheap!) garbage bags (I use the tall kitchen ones, 13 gallon). But it doesn't contain the diaper smell as well as the more expensive, complicated diaper pails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for cloth diapers","review":"This is advertised as being compatible with cloth diapers. It is not. 90% of the time a diaper gets stuck in the mechanism, and you have to lift the whole top off to detach the stuck diaper, completely defeating the whole purpose. In addition, it fills up after only a few cloth diapers. Might work well for disposables, but stay away from this one if you use cloth diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks,Stinks,Stinks!!!","review":"We had this Diaper Pail in our laundry room and it always stunk, especially when you turned the handle. We would have to change it every day. We now have the Diaper Decor and love it. With a 18 month old and a baby on the way I have found the perfect diaper pail. Don't buy this one it was a waste of money. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"This was a great idea, however the diaper champ does not deliever on its promise. At first you think it's working well at 'trapping' in the odors, but in reality newborn diapers don't really have a bad odor. Once the baby starts to eat some solid foods, that's when the odor really starts to get bad and the diaper champ does not seems to be able to trap the odor well. Also, I had a difficult time pushing the lid from side to side because the blue rubber ring around the top started to pop up and catch on the bin. So, I had to use two hands to turn it instead of just stepping on the foot pad and pushing with one hand.I would not recommend this to anyone. It's a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Selection for me","review":"OK............. I purchased my diaper at a thrift store for babies. It was just like brand new and I only paid [...] for it. I like it. You do have to keep the bag changed in it or else you will smell dirty diapers, but it is housing poop!! I let it air out and keep Lysol sprayed and it works for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stinky","review":"I found the Diaper Champ to be VERY smelly. Not only did odors leak out, but when you take out the bag you are assualted by STANK. Just like when you take out a regular garbage bag, you have to pull up on the bag with it still open and the smell is awful. I much prefer my Diaper Genie II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a champ!","review":"I don't review products unless I think they're really great or a waste of money. The Diaper Champ is a waste of your money. While not having to buy refills for it and being able to use trash or plastic shopping bags is convenient, that's the only pro of this pail. It's okay in the beginning when your baby is on breast milk/formula and not much else. But once they start eating and really pooping, not only do you deal with odors every time you change the bag, you deal with them EVERY time you add a diaper to the pail. When you pull the handle to dispose of the dirty diaper the scents of everything inside come floating out. My son's room constantly smelled of dirty diapers. I bought the Diaper Genie II when my son turned a year old and I'll never use anything else again. The refills hold a lot of diapers and there is NO ODOR EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky!!","review":"My hubby and I have had both the genie and the champ (one upstairs, one down). The champ really stunk up the room. Each time you flip the lid, odor came out! and when you opened it to take out the bag, oh man!! The genie doesn't completly hold odor in either, but I don't see how any dispsal system could. However, the genie was better at holding the smell better than this thing. The only good thing (and I mean the only), was that it took regular trash bags. Other than that, you would need a nose plug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags. We have now used it for a year and it has been great! We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that. We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier. When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont over clean.","review":"I have been useing this for just about a year now with my very stinky son :) It works great. I keep a fabric sofener sheet in there to help nix the smell and when it dose get bab enought I can notice it when in his room I take it outside and let it just \\"air out\\" plus about every two months I scrub it down with bleach and there is little to no stink. I think alot of the problems People have is that overcleaning strips the protective coat on the plastic makeing it more like to obsorb the odors. The only problem I have is That when you flip the lid a little of the wonderful smell from inside \\"poofs\\" out at you but when just siting this pal dose its job well. :) 4 stars all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Champ is Great","review":"We've been using our Diaper Champ for 5 months now with zero problems.

After nothing but fustrating attempts to use it, I threw it away. The Diaper Champ came to the rescue. I wonder now why I attempted to use the other one for so long. The Diaper Champ is so handy and easy to use. You can dispose of dirty diaper with one hand. It is easy to take apart and clean, unlike the competition. No more spending money on \\"their\\" products for bags. The Diaper Champ uses an ordinary trash bag so saving money is just another benefit. To insert and remove the bag is simply. This is definitely a must have product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted Out After A Week","review":"I ordered this as a replacement for my husband's laptop.

If you talk like that in front of your kids, well then you will like the book.My kids repeat everything that is in these books, and this just reinforced the idea that speaking crassly is funny. The book could have been a lot better if the language was made more appropriate for a 3-year old. The impact could have been just as strong by saying \\"toot\\", or even by coming up with lots of creative alternatives.Instead of this one, some of Munsch's better books are Boo!, Stephanie's Ponytail, Kiss Me I'm Perfect, We Share Everything, Mmmm Cookies, The Paperbag Princess.

I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old boy, and I have enough trouble with them talking about things that I'd rather they didn't, so I don't know why I ordered this book. I know they'd think it was funny, but the last thing I really want to do is get them talking about farts all day. I'm sorry, if your kids are more mature I'm sure it would be fine for them.

There are no magic sparkles or complicated love triangles here. No, Blood provides a tense, well animated production that keeps you guessing even upon the conclusion. It could even be said that there is no true ending because there is no true begining or ending in the greater scheme of things. We are simply treated to a snap shot in the life of a girl who kills monsters. No more or less.The only thing that annoys me and prevents a perfect five stars, is the simple fact that it is too short. The director works on a lack of facts and information to keep the focus of the viewer firmly in place. But there are times where this leaves you feeling cheated. You want to know what happens in greater detail, and I found myself frustrated with the missing pieces. Thats probably why I liked the TV show and novels so much :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Tight","review":"Action up neat, horror back, with a twist of drama.\\"What the hell is this outfit?\\" brings clarity to the genre, as well the story.

Loud and clear, like a big flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look, and yet not","review":"This review is little difficult because I don't know what I can say that already hasn't been said. Like anyone else will tell you, unless you've seen the anime series \\"Blood+\\", your going to be lost. Because the setting in this show takes place in a time that is vital in the Blood+ series (just before the big incident in the Vietnam War). That's where the first three stars come in, for placing the main character \\"Saya\\" at a place and time in the Blood+ timeline. I give it an extra star for the fact that the ending is left open for imagination on the viewers part and left open for discussion over subjects such as philosophy, and existentialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but very sweet!","review":"I just \\"aquired\\" this movie and I was instantly captivated by it.

I found the vampires very scary when watching vs when I saw pictures of them which I found to be less threatening. THis I attribute to the sound design & lighting style.Compared to others, I will not reduce points for lack of backstory. I think it was great the way it was.

They used that obnoxious method of animating over live action, just like in the animated Lord of the Rings, only instead of having a creepy feeling to it, it feel more like a movie than animation, & that's bad. The color & texture are good; like the road & wood, etc. The character designs are overly realistic & very hideous. The story was really boring & it ended too quickly. It was like a short crossover of Eko-Eko & Vampire Princess Miyu, only dull & pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly flawed","review":"This is a fantastic movie. The artwork and animation is wonderfully saturated with color and fluid movement. Unfortunately, the story of Saya and her mission are nonexistant. We a treated to a glimpse of her mission, but we are never fully brought into the univers in which this story inhabits. Too many unanswered questions, but it is still a great watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it.","review":"I saw this Anime as a raw footage at last years Sakura Con, and was greatly amazed.

I was so happy when I actually managed to find this at my local video store - but I really wish I hadn't.

I'd opt for something more like Vampire Hunter D."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT MORE!!","review":"Yes, yes. Everyone is right. The anime is about 45 minutes long. It feels more like the first chapter of an anime series than a movie. It's still worth buying. The animation is excellent and the whole concept of a female vampire hunter (Saya) who carries a samurai sword makes for a very good story (did you know there's a PlayStation 2 game of it in Japan?). There are many unanswered questions in the movie. Buy it if you want to see a great anime, but be warned that this movie is a big tease.

Fun for tweens and teens only."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 - Such an anticlimax!","review":"Blood is a fascinating, beautifully animated short tale with a cold sterile atmosphere and seductive intricate imagery. It builds up a rivoting, mysterious storyline with a strong climax... and then it pretty much ends. I don't know why it's so short but they 'unfinished' story had potential to continue. I was just starting to get sucked into it and when the credits started to roll, I assumed there were two parts. No, there aren't. That's it. Maybe this was an experimental pilot for a planned series or feature film. If not, it's pretty disappointing that it's so short."},{"rating":"2","title":"ups and downs....","review":"When I went to a movie store one night I decided to rent Blood ( me being a HUGE anime and horror buff) When i got home and started to watch it I realized that the animation was not like any other I have ever seen. It was amazing, especially to add computer graphics into it. I just loved that art work. But the bad part about this movie was the story behind it. I understood everything else (except for the ending) but I wanted to know how she came to become a vampire, how the main character Siya became upon this little group, ect. There was absolutley no story behind it. The reason I give this 4 stars insted of 3 is bacause it didnt make me bored I happened to REALLY enjoy the action of this film. I just couldnt take my eyes away from the screen. So overall this is a good film! I would suggest you rent it and watch it first before you decide to but it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My taste for blood is not satiated","review":"The computer graphics and animation in this film were good and I like the idea that a vampire can only be killed by causing them to suddenly lose a large amount of blood, but that isn't enough to keep this movie afloat. The movie is far too short. It's quite slow and it's only 45 minutes long! There is practically no character development. When I saw the credits rolling, I actually thought that credits were appearing halfway through the movie as a artistic decision, or as an intermission sort of thing. I did not expect it to be the end of the movie. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"Sure... pretty sights... a waste money...

Production IG (from Evangelion fame) and the creators of \\"Ghost in the Shell\\"...going to be top notch, right? I'm glad Sputnik7.com ran the stream from it. It's more of a rental, show off to your friends-type movie than anything else. Nothing remarkable or substantial is presented (sans the visuals), the story is ok at best, and the extras are non exsistant. Best bet is to 1) Rent it, 2) Buy into the hype (as in get Ghost in the Shell or Evangelion), or 3) Just get Blue Sub 6. Sure it's more, but at least it's more enjoyable to watch as oppose to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of the effort","review":"I rented this anime, due to the fair to poor ratings other reviewers gave this DVD and I'm glad I did. The production values and artwork are excellent, but a movie they do not make.The story line always left you wondering whats going on and why. You learn toward the end of the movie (sort of) who the characters are, but not why they are. You learn that they're hunting demons, a weak reference is made to their affilliation with some governmental agency.The movie begins by placing the viewer somewhere in the middle of a story already in progress, but when it reaches the end, there really isn't an end. The movie leaves you to fill in the holes yourself.If you enjoy this genre of anime, I highly recommend the book this movie is based: Blood The Last Vampire 2002 by Benkyo Tamaoki, available through Amazon.com at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully drawn, but where's the rest?","review":"Blood was one that I picked up as my first anime purchase in over three years, and it has returned me to the fold. In my time away I had began to think of my collection as something from my childhood. Then I watched Blood and remembered why I used to like anime so much. The film feels like only half of one at 40 minutes long, and during the documentary I swear I saw extra sequences and bits that just aren't in the film. Which is a shame because the battle among the rafters looks cool.The animation is superb, it looks beautiful and the CGI does not make a horrible contrast with the traditional cell paintings.Blood is one dvd that every true anime fan should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood... hmm. Flows like Niagara...","review":"I have just watched the film about ten minutes ago (4:33am Saturday, Sept. 8th 2001) and I must say: No hype there!I am generous enough to give it two stars because of the special effects (which conduct 80% of the film) and because the mother of this film is the same as the mother that brought to life: \\"Ghost In The Shell\\". The story (what story?) begins in the middle of a first degree murder commited by a minor and ends in the exact same position (only without the girl, she... left town). The blood flows all right... Flows at the same speed my patience ran away about twenty-five minutes into the film. It lacks story (big time) and has nothing going towards it besides hopes for more blood and gore. Very unimpressive and I leave u with only one thing left to say: Please cover for this film with a sequel that makes sense! PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even comparable with the non anime movie","review":"We go from the impressive fighter in the movie to this pouty somewhat incompetent and socially graceless barely moving character with a crappy attitude?

It reveals enough so the viewer knows what is going on, but little else. (If you want more story, try the live action version.)

Of course if you buy this you won't have to imagine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't.","review":"Two words- TOO SHORT.I sat there for fourty minutes, waiting for the build up that never came. It just left me hanging, my first thought was \\"That's it? It's over?\\"Tha main character is almost likable... almost. There is no drama, only short action scenes that looked cool but you don't care about. The plot line is weak, settings are irrelevant and have no effects on the story whatsoever.When you missed 1. Character-driven story 2. Pure entertainment 3. Great plots, what do you have left? Nothing of course, just some pretty pictures. Perhaps if it was longer, they could make it work.I decided to give it a try because the DVD mentioned \\"Ghost In The Shell\\". Well, big mistake, this didn't even come close to the level of GITS. In sum, I don't recommand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically no plot","review":"As some of the other reviewers said, it is quite uninteresting and has no deveopment to speak of.The movie is also way, way too short for the story they are trying to tell.Anyway, i would probably skip this, unless you want to see some blood, and nice animation (the voice acting isn't bad either).If you want to watch what this should have been, go watch the BLOOD+ series, which is much more accurate to the manga, auctually interesting, and wow.. development."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is How Anime Should Be Done!","review":"This is a beautiful anime, with remarkably detailed CGI and cell animation blends, with clean art and stylish action sequences. The voice acting is incredible, too. Unlike most anime, where you have the option of watching either subtitled or dubbed, instead, the director went for realism, and hired English speaking actors to play the parts of American characters, and bilingual actors for the title character and a school-teacher. The result is very smooth and easy to follow. The mini-cd featuring the music video by the Mad Capsule Markets is also a nice touch, though not something to use unless you have a tray loading DVD player. The only real drawback is that Blood-The Last Vampire is not a complete story. There is no neat ending here. It feels like a pilot to a t.v. series with more to come, but sadly, there is no more. If there were, though, I'd gladly watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very awesome","review":"This movie may be short, but it's pretty awesome in the animation and the nice attempt at trying to make 3D backgrounds and objects move smoothly with the hand drawn animation. The first 5 minutes of the DVD will just blow you away!But then it's also the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. The action at that point gets a little confusing. I lost track of the main characters movements when she was going to attack. Other than this little stumble, the rest of the movie is pretty cool. Awesome hand drawn animation. At a couple points you can't tell whether the scene is hand painted or it's a 3D modelled.If you're a lover of Anime, this modern piece of work should give you a good idea of what to expect in the quality of anime in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's short, but very sweet.","review":"Plot schmot. Who wants a lot of explaining when you can watch a girl cut her way through demon after demon. Blood is intense and not recommended for your little budding anime fans, but us adults could dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost in the shell fans beware!","review":"This is from the same creators as 'ghost in the shell'. The hardest thing to do is to not compare 'blood' to it.The story line has some depth and you really feel it come alive. Maybe a little on the gory side of town but doesn't make your skin crawl like 'the puppet princess' or 'nightwalker'. Great action sequences as well as a 'macabre' coloration to the artwork for a distinct flavor.Overall, a very good piece. The story could grow a little and give some more background on the characters so they are more than just a stand in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give us more!","review":"Visually stunning with realistic animation (most of the time) and a very engrossing story. Pulse-pounding action and a few good scares led to a somewhat abrupt ending. I wanted more background on the characters, especially Saya, and the school nurse. Some of the movements of the \\"normal\\" people a little jerky. It looked a bit like the zombies walking around in the first \\"Resident Evil\\" game. Overall, the mood was set early on, it was consistent, and the story was great. It left me wanting much more and I was disappointed when it was over. Buy this one just for the art, if nothing else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pittifully incomplete","review":"This has got to be one of the biggest insult to anime since Pokemon. This 'movie' (it could hardly be considered a movie - it's only 45 minutes long - MUCH too short) has a shoestring of a plot, NO character development and is so DULL that it seems like 45 HOURS! It SAYS 85 minutes or however long it is on the box, but half of it is in the \\"Making of\\" feature. The 'real' movie is FAR too short! The creators tried too much to win the audience with good animation. Too bad it will look outdated within a few months at the rate technology is improving... Not to mention that the DVD is seriously overpriced for its content. I wish I could give this ZERO stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time AND money","review":"The only thing this film has going for it is its CGI. Too bad it's too obvious - you can tell when it's CGI and when it's not. As for the plot, character development and the other, more important aspects, they simply do not exist. Nothing is explained, the only thing we are left with are too many questions.

The worst part is Manga misrepresents this as a full length 83 minute film. The fact is its only 45 minutes long.The visuals are excellent and the two major battle sequences are action packed. The problem is there is no character development and no time is spent to really flesh out any kind of storyline. What could have been a masterpiece is reduced to a action fest that is over before it really starts.Its worth a rental, but I can't recommend it to any but the most hard core Anime fans. The film did not live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film brevity makes for huge letdown","review":"Don't be duped by Manga Corp. this movie is 45 minutes long!

Blood (TLV) is a sonic and visual feast. The computer generated back drops, the DD 5.1 soundstage have the beginnings of a great film. Its too bad the movie just stops in the middle of the story. No mention of sequel or anything.Manga Corp. did almost as good a job hoodwinking us with the film, as the Sci Fi channel did with the \\"Series Finale\\" of Farscape.Buy this used or discounted.

First, the quotes picked are often short, unrelated, or contradictory, including a couple which are simply theistic. Second,Williams iserts his own little exclamatory remarks throughout the book (things like \\"Oh Aristotle, how lucky we were to know you!). The format has the quote from the famous luminary on the right page, and Williams words, thoughts or praise on the left. With all due respect, William's words could have been kept to an introduction, rather then half the book. Especially considering he just acts as an MC for those quoted, he doesn't add any thoughts of substance.Were this book ($$$), I wouldn't be so harsh on it. But ($$$) for a book that's a not particularly well produced, undersized hardcover, it's ridiculous.

For those of us who remember that era, Mrs. Kennedy was nothing short of a saint in the face of tragedy. And the images of the pregnant widow with all those children made us feel deep sympathy for her situation. After reading Mr. Oppenheimer's book, it would seem that Ethel was not only a fiercely jealous, overly competitive barracuda, but also a terrible cheapskate. The Kennedy version of Leona Helmsly, with one exception, Leona was at least intelligent. It was obvious that the only person capable of controlling Ethel's behavior was Bobby Kennedy. Her treatment of staff and family after his death (including her own children) will leave the reader's mouth hanging open.

The truth? I wasn't there, but stories of Ethel being \\"difficult\\" aren't exactly new. Despite her uneasy relationships with sisters-in-law Jackie and Joan, she was fiercely devoted to Bobby and the Kennedys.

While trying to refit the tops back onto the cans, I realized they were all cracked off and could not be reapplied to the cans. Product in those cans were useless. I bought from Amazon since I have always had good experiences with them. This one was a DUD. Now, trying to get these cans back to Amazon with the broken tops is going to be a hassle I do not need.

At least this way I will be able to use what I purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard starter mouthpiece","review":"The Bach 7C has long been the standard for a beginning trumpet player. If you are just getting started, this is the mouthpiece to get. However, if you have thicker/bigger lips, a 5C (which is slightly bigger) might be a better choice. I have started students on both mouthpieces and have had success both ways. If you are not sure, ask your teacher or buy both and send back the one that is not as easy or comfortable to play. Mouthpieces are certainly a personal preference. If you want to save some money, I can recommend the Blessing line of mouthpieces as well.Blessing MPC7CTR 7C Trumpet MouthpiecePlease see my reviews of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I have spent thousands of dollars in these treatments for my son over last 3 years with no difference at all.

This book's genre should be classified as horror and the plot is just a small part of the horror.

I am glad to see that that author has never published again for Stargate novels. Anything but an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book !!!!","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of stargate and have read a lot of fanfiction.

I've lived in Berlin in the past but wanted a new travel book to help me see all of the newer sights. Even for someone who already knows her way around the city, this book was confusing and useless. The maps are all oversimplified to the point that they won't help you find anything, and the descriptions about where things are will get you completely lost or cause you to waste a ton of time. For example, the book's recommended ways to spend particular days are absolutely impossible to do. As someone who knows Berlin, I noticed that their sample schedules told people to go to places that are sometimes more than an hour and a half apart by public transportation and then travel back along the same route to get to another sight or activity.

I guess it was supposed to be funny and witty but it seriously was more annoying than humourous. Rebecca Lickiss turned a simple little conflict (of the princes needing a princess's kiss to break a spell) into a whole novel.

Collected here are prime examples of Monk in mid-career as an iconoclastic pianist, writer of jazz standards, and a band leader who attracted spectacular players to his sessions. Among the notable compositions are \\"Blue Monk,\\" \\"Ruby, My Dear\\" and \\"'Round Midnight,\\" and the sessions are highlighted by the talents of Percy Heath, Art Blakey, Clark Terry, Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Paul Chambers, John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins, Roy Haynes and many more. This is neither a full-telling of Monk's career, which also included key recordings on Blue Note and Columbia, nor of his entire six year run on Prestige and Riverside (the original albums of which are mostly still in print); but for an introduction to Monk's music, this is a good place to start.

The hospital staff had to pry the book out of my hands to wheel me into surgery, and my first thought upon coming to was not about the surgery's outcome, but whether Harold Crawford would win his battle against Del Grubb!I found the characters to be compelling and sympathetic. I was even rooting for the antagonist.

The Fallen is a good, engrossing story -- part suspense, part police procedural, part horror/fantasy, part philosophical thriller. Its characters are psychologically complex, doing what is understandable but not predictable. When the protagonist gears up for his fight against evil in the final pages, don't assume you know the rest. You don't. If Henry Sleep has trouble loading a gun, you can bet he is not the typical mass market paperback hero. And this is not the typical mass market paperback.

It was truly one of the greatest crimes in modern cinema to have cast Lucille Ball over Angela Lansbury, and listening to this album only confirms the fact that the world was absolutely robbed by the film makers shameful decision to cast Ball in this cringe inducing performance.

I may copy them to another disc, so I don't have to put up with the rest of this dreadful recording, so full of noise you're looking for the noise reduction button!!!Not for the timid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"This is even worse than the other Jerry Herman broadway show transfered to film-Streisand's Hello Dolly!

Although I didn't buy Vol. II, I'm sure I'd love it also, as it contains only about 3 or 4 new songs not on Vol. I. If you can buy the double-cd Vol. I, do it!! If you'd prefer the single cd Vol. II, do that then. I found the quality of the recordings just fine and thoroughly loved the good southern rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have volume 1 and I love it. So when I saw volume 2 I wanted it but when I say the songs, I was disappointed. Why do they need to repeat some songs? It's not like there isn't enough southern rock to go around. They could have done another CD with all different songs from volume 1. Whoever chose the songs for volume 2 should be fired.....along with the guy who chose the cover. Give me a break! Don't they think women love Souther Rock?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clutching at Sraws is one of my favorite ALL-TIME recordings","review":"Anyone who has had perhaps a bit too much to drink over time can relate to this deeply autobiographical masterpiece...Fish is one of the best vocalists and lyricists I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy....and the band is one of the tightest...the drummer and bassist set the tone complimented by savvy interjections of guitar and keyboards. I personally own at least 500 Cds spanning over 35 years of music and I feel that Clutching at Straws is one of my best. My favorite cut is White Russian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful to Beginners.","review":"Full of good \\"how to's\\".

I expected an encyclopedic book and didn't check the page count. This is a comparatively thin \\"Using\\" volume and covers the basics reasonably well with lots of screen shots. I was looking for advanced information on how to set up custom outlook forms and maybe some pointers on how to do it well. This is not covered.

The dialogue is virtually unintelligible because the soundtrack audio is so muddy, the camerawork inept, the lighting unprofessional...I could go on and on, as I believe this movie did, but I will do as I did when viewing it and stop early.I'm sorry, Jason--and I bet you are too."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Times should be ashamed","review":"This movie is horrible, the acting is contrived, the plot is looser than a crack (...), and there is enough cliche in this movie to make it an afterschool special. I don't know anyone who smokes and uses the word dude four or five times in a sentence. Why would high times use such cop out dialog? Were they making this movie for Pat Roberts or Tucker Carlson. High Times should be ashamed. Comedy is one thing, but this is as far from comedy as CURSED is from a horror film. Anyone who saw this pile of steaming crap will know what I am talking about. Not really too much to say about this film, except that just because a movie has pot in it certainly does not make it underground or cool.

Unfortunately, it is not. The transducer that comes with the 140 is not compatible with this portable case. However, I was able to modify the case by clipping off the external cable of the case, near the connector, and attaching simple connectors that I got from radio shack to power the GF140 and the transducer. The wire comming out of the carrying case contains just the leads for the batter, so this is an easy modification. So, this gets 4 stars (5 if it had been compatible, as claimed).This is an excellent unit, otherwise. The GF140 mounts on the case nicely and the suction cup for the transducer stuck firmly to the transom of the boat that I was using. Everything worked well. The transducer and cabling fits in the case when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation in bogus studie","review":"We read the book and its loaded with mis information, written by someone who clearly did reseach by simple internet downloads from unrealiable websites/ instead of really knowing the subject. makes us wonder if the other books by this author are as rediculous and as full as poor misinformation. laughfable book by someone out to make a quick book and forget to check her sources.

He seems to have created this book by thinking of a poker-related topic, writing a chapter about it, then doing another one. Whenever he runs out of something to say, he writes about...himself! Who cares? And who edited this book? Twice he uses the redundant phrase \\"old adage\\" and once the horrible \\"very unique\\". An exercise in the New Journalism that's not worth your time.

To compare this half-baked collection of Bellin's recollections of \\"characters he has known\\" to true poker masterpieces like \\"Big Deal\\" and \\"Telling Lies and Getting Paid\\" is an insult. That's why poker's a great game I guess... Ithink people who have never read about poker might think this book is fascinating and edgy. Everyone else will probably wonder what people see in this.

If these are the best stories the author has to tell, that is sad. I have more interesting things happen to me and around me at a poker room in an average day than this guy has had in his life. If you are a beginner trying to learn the game, this book won't help. If you are an expert, it certainly won't. And if you are looking for something to entertain you while on the can or something, you better look elsewhere too. A very disappointing book by a rather poor writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The book is mostly a collection of unrelated poker cliches & anecdotes that have been told many times before. What dissapointed me most was that based on the title, I expected more of a 'player's diary' if you will. It was far from it...in fact, there's nothing new here at all. Also, it seems to have been written for mass appeal rather than for players. If you play, skip this one but consider Jesse May's novel 'Shut up and Deal'; it's defintely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet It All On Poker Nation","review":"I snagged a copy of this book for my father, who loves poker. I myself have never been a huge card playing fanatic, but my Dad is. However, I started flipping through the book before I gave it to him, and found myself reading the entire thing. It's fascinating stuff, in my opinion more enjoyable than a poker game itself. I hope Dad agrees (although I don't think there's anything more enjoyable than an actual poker game to him, I'm sure he'll love the book all the same). I highly recommend it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for anyone","review":"For experienced poker players, it's an account of one man's experiences with the game. For novice players, it's... well, the same thing, though I suspect beginner players will enjoy it a bit more. However, I think people with little exposure to the game might enjoy it more than anyone. It offers a glimpse into a world you might only have heard about through movies. Truthfully, for serious students of the game, there are no great insights here you haven't already read in much greater depth from one of poker's great authors. So just take take this book as a quick entertaining read and little else. On the other hand, if you've never read any poker books, but are intrigued by the game, then this book is a light, easy way to learn nuggets of knowledge you may be able to use playing against your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Meat","review":"Here's another example why books about gambling are mostly a deadly bore. This weak book either insults the intelligence of people who know something about poker or fails to present a single new idea to hold our interest.

Mr. Kasdan managed to discuss some very controversial things in the Torah in a gentle and respectful manner.I did not totally agree with his explanations of circumcision and the kippah but it wasn't so much that the book deserved less praise.

She is a professor from Yale and very attractive. David Koechner co-stars as an anthropology professor. He is a sidekick that also has a \\"Big Foot Club\\".Luke Wilson could do so much more with his character, but was constrained throughout. \\"Tenure\\" has potential, but is a half-hearted try at comedy and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly funny","review":"Given Luke Wilson's starring role, I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this movie before. It's actually pretty funny. Maybe it's just because I'm in academia, but I thought some of the jokes were quite clever. The characters were also surprisingly real and relatively little cursing and nudity for a \\"frat pack\\" comedy. Overall, it's somewhat more mature, but no less funny.

This wasn't exactly what I bought these for, but I may have been presumptuous with what their capabilities were. They're not great for any exercises besides the individual finger exercises. I was hoping they would be effective at building calluses on other parts of my hand, but it's not the best way to do that.

After about 10-12 days, the callus development was very noticeable and consistent. Initially the soreness of my fingertips would be the limiting factor in how long I could use the Gripmaster, but now my fingertips have strengthened up enough that I'm only limited by the muscular fatigue in fingers and forearm. I use it with a light (blue) gripmaster and wouldn't recommend anything stronger to start. I think you would also see very satisfactory results using the extra-light gripmaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The skin on my fingers are naturally very thick, but not hard, and it's somewhat difficult for me to build up my calluses with these, but it still does the job. From the picture it kind of looks like guitar strings, but in person it's more like spikes made to look like guitar strings.

The DS can do close to the PSP, but NOBODY PUSHES IT! I swear the best done so far was the Super Mario 64 DS game. C'mon people, even EGM gave it a horrible ratin'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the innovation of the DS?","review":"Here you go folks, another DS Dud. 2D graphics, old and tired gameplay, nothing new to offer, and yet somehow Nintendo fans eat it up and call it candy. This game is pathetic and makes you wonder why Nintendo even made the DS when all they are doing is continuing the gameboy advance graphics on a new system that costs more money. A dual screen that is constantly unsued, and a stylus gimmick that is falling short of any expectations. Let's face it, Nintendo is no longer innovative. The PSP has the kinds of games that show real advancement and innovation in the hand held market. But you're a Nintendo fanboy, you won't care any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"old nintendo","review":"this game looks like a game from the very first nintendo platform or maybe super nintendo did not like it at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hate this game I do\\"","review":"This game was not really that great. I mean come on what kind of game is this? I thought it was going to be one of my favorite games but it wasn't! If you want the real game buy the Xbox or PS2 games for \\"Revenge Of the Sith\\". The PS2 game has fantastic graphics and great moves and it also follows the story very well. I have actully played the game and it honestly is not that great! The PS2 game is also alot easier than this one. In the PS2 game you can unlock bonus missions and duel characters. The PS2 game is alot lot better than this one!

Benebar's music is somewhat retro but nonetheless timeless and entertaining. He can swing through various styles of music like rock, jazz, French folk, and a little cabaret, but the album has a cohesiveness that's testament to Benebar's ability to write catchy hooks. My favorites are \\"Paresseuse\\" (Lazy Girl) and \\"Dis-Lui Oui\\" (Tell Him Yes) and \\"Les Mots d'Amour\\" (The Words of Love) but all the tracks are really good. I hope Benebar can do some shows in the USA, hopefully NYC."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTDATED INFO","review":"I have been using this book for the last 4 summers and have found it to have a lot of outdated information. We are fulltiming in our motorhome and this book is fine if you are in a smaller rv or tenting. Some campgrounds have closed from fires, closed from budget cuts or have been remodeled. The length limits are usually incorrect too. I want to know if I'm driving on a dirt road to the campground (how many miles in)or if it's paved. Is there water available? and if so are the faucets threaded, handpumps, or non-threaded where you need a water thief? Dump stations with potable water? What is the length and width of the site. Are there tight turns or dead ends with no turn arounds? What are the directions turn by turn and mileage?

The best part of this book is that it lists for each campground the type of camping unit best suited for the particular national forest campground. Tent and popups owners will appreciate this.

It's a wonderful book divided into various chapters centering on separate items which made up Tudor enjoyments. Chapters in the book include clothing, architecture, reading, dancing, theatre, and hunting & games, to name a few. Ms. Sim's writing is not the least bit dry and makes the facts enjoyable to read about.

This time he has turned his attention to a setting closer to home: growing up in New York's tenements during the days of the Great Depression and World War II. Clearly now an author at the top of his game, Merlin presents the horrors of a poverty-stricken childhood without the depressing and unremitting perspective of McCourt's Angela's Ashes. Though the heavy burden of life's tragedies withers many, Merlin's world contains a tone that puts these events into perspective. A modern study in Naturalism, this is literature at its finest: Though Johnny Weismuller shows up only briefly for a swan dive, he represents the hopes of the times and the expectations of an immigrant Polish family. This is a remarkable book, and in my opinion, the most accessible of all of Merlin's novels; it speaks to Americans about the American dream in a way people will accept and revere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a horrible movie.","review":"This is a scary, dark, movie. Children under 6 should not be allowed to watch this movie. The easter bunny brought this movie to my house for my 2 year old who loves trains. On easter morning he was so excited that i put the movie in to sit with him and watch. This is a really bad movie. It looks nice, there are some fun songs, however the story line is scary and evil. There are bullies who want to beat up a young boy, there is a nightmare train, there is kidnappings, and near death experiences. And the language the toys and trains use is even mean and angry. I ended up fast forwarding thru most of the movie. I feel bad for my son, cause now he knows this movie is in the house but will not be able to watch it.

Here's my suggestion to anyone with a 2 or 3 year old...Watch movies before your kids do or with them to supervise what they see! You should be the one to decide what your kids see, not the makers of a children's movie. I would highly recommend this advice to someone with a more sensitive little one. My son and I watched this together for the first time and I looked over at him while the Creepy Old Train made his appearance. My little guy watched the whole scene, looked over at me, smiled and said, \\"Sweet Dreams!\\" then laughed. He was not scared in the least bit and it he was enjoying the edge of his seat moment.

I'm not talking about a-hunter-kills-Bambi's-mother-which-results-in-dialogue-about-death, or a-scary-fish-eats-Nemo's-mother-and-sibling's type of scary. More like a fire-shooting-out-of-its-eyeballs-while-it-debases-you type of scary, as with the \\"Nightmare Train.\\" My son (2.5 years old) is amazing unfazed by this and would watch this movie back to back all day long if I let him, but it doesn't sit well with me (and as a parents I'm not particularly hypersensitive about things like this) for G-rated material.

Even this morning he said he was still thinking about the Nightmare Train and feeling scared. We hadn't seen the movie in two days at this point too, so it clearly made an impression.

The only reason this caught my eye was that it was a qwerty keyboard. Unfortunately, it brought nothing else to the table. We have a child's keyboard we connect to our computer and an entire library of learning software that is much more cost effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"mouse stopped working right away","review":"My son enjoyed this the first time he used it. It is a great concept, simple computer games that teach shapes/ colors/ numbers. However, the mouse started to malfunction the second time we used it and now (after 1 month) doesn't work at all. You can't even log on without the mouse. The toy wasn't damaged in any way to cause a malfunction like this. Also, there is no on/off switch on the keyboard, so you have to take the batteries out (which requires a screw-driver) to prevent them from running down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can do without","review":"First off, to be fair, I didn't buy this toy for my child and wouldn't have. It was a gift from a well-meaning relative.We're in the computer industry and at first it seemed like a cute idea. Now I don't see any educational value in it. I'm pretty sure it will make your kids less smart, not more, with it's repetitive and simplistic content.I'd be really worried, even with occasional use, about the physical effects of a child using a mouse.Oh, and our son has not stopped trying to play with our computers as a result. He wants to imitate us, so unless we're playing with his computer, it doesn't help.Graphics are terrible. Games are uninspired. Despite being in his playroom, our son never gets it out or asks to play with it like he does other toys (thank goodness!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Design","review":"The keyboard doesn't turn off. The light under the mouse is always on, leading to a quick drain of the batteries. It never goes in \\"sleep mode\\" either. I would understand if an A/C adaptor was sold for the keyboard and not only the console, as this would be a wise way for Leapfrog to make money. Unfortunately, there is no adaptor, so you must by four AA batteries every week, or try to explain to your three-year old that she needs to play with something else.Anyone who writes a positive review without mentioning this obvious failure in the product's design is a fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have paid less at Target","review":"I recently bought this for a xmas gift at the price of $45 - normally priced at $60. Only a week or 2 later, Target had this same gift on sale for $40 plus you could use their toybook coupon of $10 making the final price $30. Needless to say I was disappointed that I jumped on this deal too soon to only realize I could have gotten a better deal elsewhere. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.Shipping was fast and the product looks great - just wish I could have saved myself the extra $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality graphics","review":"The components work as specified. No problems with mouse. Unfortunately the quality of graphics is so poor that its painful to look at. I keep thinking something must be configured wrong, but based on other reviews it seems this is typical. Desktop machines from 10 years ago could do better. In retrospect I would have spent $100 on an old computer and had the option/access to much more robust learning software for my toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and it literally lasted 5 minutes before it refused to work any more. She is not rough with her toys, generally speaking, and was playing with the keyboard whn suddenly she complained that nothing was happening. Sure enough, the mouse was stuck in the bottom corner of the screen and would not respond to commands at all. Started the machine again and nothing. Took the batteries out and replaced...nothing. So, this toy lasted less than a few minutes before becoming useless. I am very disappointed in the quality of Leapfrog toys lately. The last 3 or 4 have not worked for more than a week or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I love Leapfrog toys and have several for my daughter, but this was a huge disappointment for us. She would love to play it but the mouse is impossible for her to use and just doesn't work well at all. What should have been a great learning toy is nothing but frustration for us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouse stopped working","review":"Like others have discovered, my mouse periodically will stop working all together. If I turn it off for about an hour, yes an hour, it will start to work again. This happens regularly, very frustrating when your 2 yr old kid is getting upset he cannot play."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought this product since I wanted to find a way to get my son away from my computer. The graphics were pathetic and the mouse was impossible to use. I would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my toddler occupied","review":"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old. He plays around on a regular laptop so using this Leapfrog was fairly easy for him. He is fascinated by the colors and music, and is learning to play along with the keyboard. The game console is easy to set up, and has so far held up well even after a few falls. All in all, we would recommend it for the 3-5 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea - poor design","review":"This is a great idea for a product - but the design and quality are absolutely terrible and the games are seriously overpriced and hard to find in stores.It has great educational value for the youngster just learning their letters and numbers, if only it worked properly! It also has an extremely limited range of levels so a smart kid will outgrow it quickly. The mouse, in particular, just doesn't function well. It is extremely frustrating. Also, it is battery powered ONLY and the batteries last about two hour which gets extremely expensive if your kid actually likes this thing and you cannot turn the keyboard/mouse off so the batteries run down even when you aren't using it! You have to remove the batteries to prevent this! My daughter enjoyed it and learned from it for about three months despite the flaws. This company either needs to redesign this product or someone else needs to come along and do it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great educational game system!","review":"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our almost three year old - and he was very excited!! Along with it, we purchased the Bob the Builder and Thomas cartridges. It was very easy set up - I would strongly recommend purchasing the adapter to save yourself from continuing to purchase size C Batteries. Although each cartridge offers only three to four games, there are different levels and it is amazing how much keyboarding and basic screen navigation he's learned already. The games all reinforce letter and number recognition, colors, shapes, following directions. He plays these games frequently - recently we also purchased the Finding Nemo and Go Diego games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and Fun","review":"Used for a 30 month old child. Two levels for each game. Uses the level 1 games but already is getting the idea how all the keys work. Knows letters already and where the keys are. Levels 1 is good for under 3 and level 2 is more advanced and faster games. We have the finding Nemo game which is fun and kinda advanced for a 30 month old but in time the game will be suitable. I would use this as a way to teach kids how to use the computer keys and to have fun while learning. If the child is over four years old I would consider buying a game or two along with the system.We keep the system under our TV stored so our child can ask to use the computer and we then set it up and it lasts for about twenty minutes at a time. BUY THE ADAPTER, WORTH EVERY PENNY.Update- 12/26/11>>son still uses at age 4. He likes the game puppy pals and now has the explorer which has this same game on an advanced level. Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We now own our THIRD Clickstart!!!","review":"I bought this for my daughter 2 years ago for Christmas. Within 9 months the thing just wouldn't work anymore! It wouldn't turn on and off using the button on the unit, it was just stay on anytime the adapter was plugged in. Then I would just get a white and black screen, with AND without cartridges! The great Target in my area decide to let us exchange it, just for it to do the EXACT same thing about 4 months later!!! So on Black Friday, and after my daughter pleads, I bought a new one for 19.99. Looking at the keyboard it appears it has some upgrades (on/off button) so HOPEFULLY they fixed whatever is causing it to completely break down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This has not been a good product for my 3/4 year old. The games leave much to be desired and the mouse is a PAIN. He prefers educational games that we can find online and this did not make him want to use our laptop less (which I thought it would do). Frustrating to use, low quality games, I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst value for Money- Not reliable","review":"I bought this product for my son but was disappointed when I saw the images in the screen. There are only very few inbuilt games and they do not look good. There are lot of better free games available in the internet. I bought 2 more cartridges but they were also horrible.I just believed the brand value of Leaopfrog but I was wrong.The mouse did not work properly after a week and I returned this product to bring back my peace.Please check the images of games before you buy it. They look very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"My daughter got this toy for Christmas 2008 and loved it. We played with it maybe once a week and now it won't power up. We have tried new batteries, a DC-10 plug and cleaning the system, but nothing works; it has been dead for a month now. When I got on their website I looked up warranty information and LEAP FROG only guarantees the product for 3 months! We loved the toy but are extremely disappointed in the lack of quality and assurance from LF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressive","review":"My son got this as a Christmas gift when he was three and a half years of age. The games were too easy to master and there are not enough of them. The games that can be purchased to go with it do not increase in difficulty. I would not recommend this for any preschooler. This will not keep their attention for very long and the games are expensive for the length of time they would be able to use them. I returned mine back to Amazon. I hope you all have better luck with yours then we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is way over rated","review":"We bought this for our daughters last Christmas. The games that this comes with and the games you can buy for Clickstart are very poor. There are much much better games online for free that you can have your child play with. My kids (4 and 2) quickly lost interest in Clickstart.Please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This toy is a piece of garbage. We've had nothing but problems since our 3 year old got it for Xmas this year. The keyboard must be aligned exactly with the box or the sensors won't connect and the cursor won't move on the screen. Our daughter is constantly frustrated because the cursor freezes all the time. The cord on the mouse is too short and quite stiff, so the mouse wants to flip off the keyboard. She easily mastered the two games that she got with it (Dora and Nemo). I would definitely pass on this toy and choose something more durable with more games"},{"rating":"2","title":"toy","review":"would like to see the keyboard rechargeable, and some higher age range games become available, but otherwise in moderation my 5 year old daughter loves to play w/ this and I credit this toy solely on teaching her to use a mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun","review":"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. It keeps her occupied for hour stretches. It is amazing how well she has mastered using the mouse after only 3 weeks of playing the games.I'm not sure how well the keyboard/mouse are constructed. Ours has not had any problems yet, but I've noticed that my daughter does have a tendency to carry it by the mouse. I make a point of taking it away and putting it up as soon as she is done playing.I recommend this toy for anyone who's child is showing interest in playing on their personal computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapfrog ClickStart My First Computer","review":"We have a computer at home and my grandson loves to play on it but has issues because it is not kid friendly. I have heard many positive thing about the ClickStart and wanted to try it for a Christmas present. He has hours of fun and really enjoys it. Now our computer is available again and he has his. I highly recommend this toy for the education as well as teaching him how to interact with a real computer, and lets him have fun doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All fluff, no stuff.","review":"What a disappointment this toy is. Although it was easily set up the so called wireless keyboard and mouse require \\"line of sight\\" with the controller. Do they really expect small, wiggly children to sit still with the keyboard on their laps, keeping it pointed in one direction? Additionally, the mouse has a short, stiff lead wire and the mouse pad is far too small for the mouse.The user must constantly pick up the mouse and relocate it onto the pad.Worst of all, is how boring the \\"games\\" are. Our 5-year old mastered each game within minutes and is no longer interested in them at all. Yet another device that will never get used again.We expected more from LeapFrog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censorship at it's worst.","review":"My child's name is Cassandra. Nicknames: Cassie & Cass.The Leapfrog company won't allow her to spell her own name on this keyboard because her name contains the letters a--s--s...I've tried calling them over 20 times ever since Christmas and they refuse to explain to me why they are censoring words on this keyboard and deciding for parents what their children can and cannot spell.I can honestly say, this is the most ridiculous toy I've ever purchased. They've eliminated thousands of words from the English language by blocking such letter combinations. How dare they???I'm going to return it. In the meantime, if anyone has any suggestions on a toy we can buy our kids that helps them with their typing skills, I'd love to hear about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first computer","review":"I was skeptical but my three year old twins (almost four), love this computer and it's amazing how much better their mouse control is in just three days! Comes with four built in games but you need extra cartridges for better games. Minus one star for forcing you to purchase the AC adaptor separately! Cheap move!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"It seemed that this video was targeted more for the elderly -- over age 65.

Consistently practiced, it should make a difference in how one feels and in strength gained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my money","review":"Now and again we buy useless products, and this was definitely a waste of my money. Geared towards the elderly (80-90 years old)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW - ONLY FOR BEGINNERS","review":"This might be a good video for an older person who is just beginning exercise. It is definitely not for baby boomers who want to strengten their bones, and are in good shape. While the instructor is clear, and the exercises are very easy, it moves too slowly for someone who wants more strenuous exercises. I was very disappointed by the background music, and repetitive instructions. If you already have knowledge of osteoporosis, and are in good physical condition, I don't suggest you purchase this tape because you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this sounded like a great video but it was very boring. The person who was in the video had no personality and any inflection in her voice. The exercises were fine and am sure they would help but it needed better music or something to make it more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Beginners","review":"This video is great for beginners or people with limited mobility. It is too slow for anyone with even the slightest amount of energy.

I am a pharmacy technician and I am on my feet all day. By the end of each shift, I have back pain. I have also been diagnosed with osteoporosis. These exercises are just great for me (not too slow, not too fast). Mirabai has a pleasant voice, speaks clearly, gives you reminders like-remember to breathe, keep your shoulders down, etc. She also gives you alternatives if you can't do the exercise exactly as she does. I have only been doing the exercises for a few weeks but my back pain is already gone. I have noticed a significant difference in my posture, as well. I feel better and if I am loading my bones at the same time - mission accomplished!! Thank you, Mirabai."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well-good beginner exercise DVD","review":"I used this video for 6 months after illness make me extremely weak. Doing these exercises made me stronger and much more flexible, without causing any damage to fragile bones - severe osteoporosis. A good video for someone just starting to exercise - instructor is excellent and supportive - tells you how to do the exercise safely and explains what muscle groups and bones are being used. I have graduated to more strenuous exercise DVDs, but this DVD provided an excellent start."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST FOR BEGINNERS","review":"I was VERY DISAPPOINTED after watching this video. It was very boring, and while I got a couple tips on how to strengthen the hips and back, I would have a hard time watching and listening to it more than once. The background music, and instructors voice almost put me to sleep. There was lots of information about osteoporosis which seemed repetitive in the beginning. The exercises moved slowly, and the instructor used a towel which seemed very cumbersome, instead of bands for strengthening and stretching.This might be a good video for beginners, but what about boomers who have exercised and are trying to find the motivation to maintain their strength? I wanted a video that would inspire me, but this one only put me to sleep. I'll take a couple exercises from it, find my own music, and send it off to my grandmother."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one to buy","review":"I bought a few DVDs geared for people with osteoporosis, and I think this one is the best of the bunch. Is it exciting? No. Is it fast paced? No. You will not be entertained, but you will learn how through slow stretching and gentle isometrics, you can help reduce osteoporosis and perhaps partially restore bone growth. The quality of the dvd is excellent in terms of voice, position, camera angle, and ease in understanding correct technique. I will be curious after one year's time to see if my DXA scan results will improve as a result of implementing the exercises and eating more healthfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bone Loading Exercise Video","review":"When I was diagnosed with Osteopenia last month my doctor told me to do some bone loading exercise.

These drives are made in Germany, so when I emailed the service department for assistance in getting it to work with my other 4 computers, it took 2 weeks to get a response and then it was in German.
