People who complained about the mat being slippery probably did not use the right side of the mat. That's my guess, at least.It's heavy, but it's also thicker and slightly longer than most, so I don't expect anything less.I only wish I'd gotten the next size up, because apparently doing yoga had straightened out my spine and given me an extra inch of height.

This mat is made from natural materials. I learned rubber is dense, it stores cold well. In winter my body has to warm it up first, and that is unpleasant. I cannot use this mat in winter. With yoga you need to feel warm, not chilly. I even put it on a carpet, not a bare wood floor and that does not help in winter. I think you could use it nicely if you have radiant floors for heating, but I don't. I use a cheap $4 yoga mat during winter time. Very expensive for this rubber mat, and it fed on my environmental ethics since we are destroying the planet (and our human health) with myriad petroleum synthetics. Too cold to enjoy in winter, even with a cloth facing that is melded with the rubber. Would not recommend where there are cold winters, I am sorry to say. A positive: In warm weather, it is awesome!

I am a small 5'2\\" 112lb girl and I slip around like no tomorrow. I've also been practicing yoga for nine years. Today, when coming down out of a backbend, my hands slipped out and I landed on my head. This is the last straw. I really don't get what all they hype is about. All this mat needs to do is not move around, not let ME move around, and provide some cushioning. It's not that tough and for the $65 or whatever I paid for this, I'd figured the mat would deliver. What's more, when I unwrapped my mat for the first time, I noticed long 1\\" fibers coming off the edges of the mat. Are you telling me this company can't even afford sharp blades to cut the mats? They're using dull blades? I mean, c'mon. I'm done with Manduka and for now going to back to my ghetto mat. It performs much better than Manduka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery and expensive","review":"After being advised to spend the money on a good quality natural rubber mat, I purchased this. If you are practicing any kind of hot yoga, or are a person who sweats more than others, this is NOT the mat for you. It is hopelessly slippery, even with a yogitoes, as the texture is smooth and does not grip the towel at all. This mat ruined a few classes for me, and I am still looking for a good quality mat that is sticky enough for me to sweat through my class and maintain contact with my mat. I'm currently using the rental mats at my studio. It's a bummer that I wasted so much money on a mat that is useless to my hot practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this mat","review":"This is the third yoga mat i have purchased!

If you are serious about yoga I highly recommend this mat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy as lead and slippery","review":"I bought this mat because I wanted an eco mat and Manduka was supposed to be the best. I knew it was going to be heavy, but not THIS heavy! Also, the natural rubber seems to make my feet and palms sweat and I keep slipping on it far more than my old one. I find this incredibly frustrating and it takes away from my practice. I actually bought it as I had read the natural rubber mats were less slippery. Not the case it seems. I am hoping with time this changes, but I must confess that I've gone back to my regular yoga mat.On the plus side this mat is wonderfully long and gives good support. Sadly, I still find it fairly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mat","review":"Enjoy the Mat. Quality, smell fades, comfortable, non slip and thick.

I ordered this mat in February 2011 and by November 2011 I am ordering a new mat. I read a lot of great reviews on this mat but I guess mine was a lemon. I contacted Manduka a few months back when I started experiencing the sliding and they were not helpful at all. They simply recommended turning it over or buying a spray they sell. I tried flipping it over but after a few weeks that doesn't seem to work anymore. I do not recommend this mat if you practice hot forms of yoga. Manduka will only ripe me off once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot get past the odd smell","review":"I was so excited to get this mat. The instructions said to unroll it to help dissipate the smell. That did not work for me. I also tried a mat freshener to no avail.

Following is Isaac Asimov's footsteps must have scared the daylights out of Brin, but I think he has done a good job. Foundation's Triumph is well-plotted, presents a theme consistent with Asimov's legacy, and fulfilled most of my expectations for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"The trio of Foundation sequel books not written by Asimov are terrible and don't even come close to the originals. I could not follow this book and found myself just skimming pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Killer B Foundation book","review":"First, I believe that the Foundation novels by Isaac Asimov are one of the best novel series in all of modern SF.Second, I liked the later Foundation novels by Asimov almost as much as I liked the orginal three novels.Third, I didn't like Gregory Benford's first novel expanding into Foundation terrotory. I did like Greg Bears second novel of this newer Foundation series. And I like this treatment by Brin the best of the new series of Foundation material.Now... It really isn't the good Doctor's writing style. But then, the Good Doctor had that styleless style that never gets in the way of the Story. But, Brin has one of the better writing styles in modern SF/F. Which makes this very much worth reading. It is pretty much required that you have read both Benford's and Bear's books in the series first. But then, that is why it is called a \\"series\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foundation's Fluke","review":"The Second Foundation Trilogy is a total disgrace to Asimov. It offers nothing new and builds on the ridiculous Gaia concept, which I think is full of new-age pretensions and stubborn ambitions to be perfect. Brin tries desperately to redeem this shameful trilogy but turns it into an allegory about Communism and democracy, stuff that's so cliched already in sci-fi literature, and turns abstractions like chaos into a virulent disease, which I think is totally preposterous. Don't waste your time with this, read the original trilogy again. Giving it one star is being over-generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad, really.","review":"I was expecting a continuation of the events that occurred in Asimov's \\"Foundation and Earth\\". I was eager to see how Gaia factored into the situation. Instead, I got more about Hari Seldon. This isn't a bad thing, but the former would've been a better topic. Despite not having my Foundation hunger satisfied, I think David Brin did a decent job with the book. While I agree that the pans and the memes and whatnot brought in a non-Foundation element, Brin's explanation at the back of the book helped me to accept them. Of the three books, Brin's \\"action\\" style was the closest to Asimov's writing. However, the constant thinking on the part of the core characters kind of got annoying. Brin's Hari seemed to be dead on, but the \\"new\\" Dors was frustrating. And having read the Robot series, Brin's Daneel seemed a little too human. Overall, however, I found it hard to put the book down. Brin kept me riveted despite the drawbacks and in the long run, that's what matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad I finished reading this series!","review":"Book One of this series was lousy. Book Two was decent. Book Three was the final one in the series, which is probably the best thing that can be said about it. I feel that the writers' goal in getting involved with this project, other than making money, was to attract Asimov fans to read their other works. In my case, at least, they have failed. If there is anything that can break a deeply-ingrained habit of finishing a series once it is started, this series is it. There are some decent moments in this book, but it is confusing and filled with pointless activity that ultimately accomplishes very little. I gave it 2 stars only because it does tie everything together and because of the timeline in the appendix. I checked this book out from the Library. I absolutely cannot recommend that anyone pay hardcover prices for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"expected better","review":"To sum up quickly this book I would say I am very disappointed with it. After the riveting foundation's fear and foundation and chaos, i expected this sequel to be excellent. Instead, I was in disbelief through most of the story at how unAsimov some of the things being written about were. The parts the characters palyed didn't seem to fit well into the established Asimovian universe. And I found it hard to believe that the robots, with the future of Gaia ahead of hummanity, would do what they do in the book (without giving away any spoilers). Also, I felt Dors Vanabili part in the book was way off character. The ending was a let down to me. It left me with the same feeling I had when I watched I claudis- that I've invested a weeks worth of reading, only to be disappointed. I don't normally flame any writers work on Amazon.com, but i feel this book was such a letdown, I want to let others know of the potential for disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it for any Asimov fan","review":"While I will generally never read additional novels not by the original writer, I decided to give these a shot because I also had read Benford, Bear, and Brin (Brin being one of my favorite authors).

Brin's novel I feel was the best of the three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarro","review":"This book is the most boring and bizarre of the 3. If I hadn't read the other 2 I would've just stop reading this one. Several times I just wanted to hurl it across the room never to be picked up again. I should've because nothing happens requiring anyone to read it.Brin just repeatedly re-hashes everything I already knew from Asimov's books, and then turned eveything around so that Daneel and Hari (and, to a lesser extent, Wanda), once the good guys, are now megalomaniacs. If that's not enough to turn anyone off, how about this: Dors falls in lust with another robot. And these are just a couple of examples of the nonsense in this book. I've never read Brin before, and I certainly never will again.This book couldn't be further from Asimov's Foundation in every way except for the use of Foundation in the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid Sunset publication","review":"Who says mass market can't be good?

I am listener who has extremely critical ears, because I myself am an operatic tenor (17 years of age and in the Atlanta Opera). My criticisms of Aria (& Viaggio) are in that Bocelli is NOT an operatic tenor-- he is one that uses pure sotto voce and/or falsetto in the high range -- he is a true baritone with \\"fake\\" high notes. For this reason, when on stage, Bocelli uses microphones (A BIG NO! NO! IN OPERA). He is a WONDERFUL pop singer however!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"???????","review":"You people make me sick. How can you say that Bocelli is greatest opera singer EVER. I fell sorry for him that his blind, but did someone who gave this CD 4 and 5 stars listen to other tenors. Ever listen to the golden voices of Nicolai Gedda - hear his recordings of Faust and Turandot, Franco Corelli - listen his Tosca and Trovatore, Di Stefano - his recordings of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci, Mario Del Monaco - listen to his Carmen, Carlo Del Monte - his recording of Traviata, Ion Buzea - hear his Rigoletto, the list is endless. All of this opera singers are better than Bocelli. He isn't in the Top 100. Don't get me wrong I don't have anything personal with him. His voice is not bad. But like someone said in an interview of Bocelli's performance of Puccini's Boheme in 1998 in Cagliari: Bocelli isn't good enough for opera. Everybody understood my point. Now I wait for the contradictory and offensive e-mails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad very bad","review":"I received this album as a birthday souvenir. It is insurmountable to be heard.

Doesn't it make sense to mount an event with the Three Blind Tenors?Talent isn't a problem - everybody sings better than Bocelli - the blindness aspect would seem to be a problem. I propose that we have a singing contest for tenors and the three best are blinded. Some people will probably object to this but that should just add to the publicity.We should all thank Mr. Bocelli for establishing this new venue - the blind tenor.

Signor Bocelli's publicists have declared that he has 'the most beautiful voice in the world' and people believe it. I agree with the reviewer who described listening to this cd as painful. Everything sounds the same---like sandpaper. If he were not adorable and blind, this fellow would not have a career even as a pop artist, never mind opera singer. If you want to hear what opera sounds like at its best and most real today, check out Ramon Vargas, Juan Diego Florez, Rolando Villazon, Marcello Giordani and discover the difference between creme brulee and instant pudding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Bocelli: The Opera Album","review":"Andrea Bocelli is not an opera singer?

The two from la Boheme and Tosca are regarded as two of the most beautiful arias for tenors. I love all the arias and they are so soothing when one has had a bad day at work!!I have all Andrea's C.D.'s and operas and just love all of them but the more I play the opera C.D.'s the more I love them.

I agree that Mr. Bocelli is not the greatest tenor of our time. Actually the \\"Big Three's\\" talents far surpass Mr. Bocelli's. The one thing that makes this CD worth buying is the choice of arias. I think these selections have made this a worthwhile choice for anyone who enjoys opera. Although new to the genre, I own several CD's of opera, and find myself listening to this one quite often.

Then, a few minutes later, I heard Pavorotti singing the same aria.I was blown away.Try it. Compare Bocelli with Pavorotti, or Carraras or Domingo or even Lanza, for that matter. Compare specific arias, side by side, and you will see why \\"classical\\" critics don't warm up to this fellow.It is not that he is \\"bad\\". It is that there are many others who are, quite simply, great. So, why settle for not bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's a key, anyway?","review":"Bocelli is a source of great debate in our home.

Unfortunately, most classical tenors since Gigli, including in my opinion all of the three tenors, shout. They satisfy those looking for technical skills, but sacrifice the soul and therefore the real beauty of the music. Bocelli's voice and deserved popularity will help restore the beauty back to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to see why anyone thinks he is an opera singer.","review":"Let's see, you have listened to: Schipa, Caruso, Gigli, Tagliavini, Corelli, Bjorling, Distefano, DelMonaco, Bergonzi, ..., Pavarotti, Carreras, Domingo. Very hard to see how Bocelli fits in this group; you can even hear him breathe before hitting high notes, and he is not as lyrical as Pavarotti or as sweet as Distefano. No doubt he will remain popular with the general public, but that's only a measure of selling lots of records."},{"rating":"2","title":"great voice, great music","review":"this CD contains the greatest arias that i have ever heard, the words of those arias are so emotional and romantic. i would like to thank andrea in person for that cd if i ever got the chance to see him.

Bocelli is bland, boring, ill-equipped for opera. He doesn't give a clue that he understands what he's singing about. He got slaughtered for his performances as Werther, and no wonder. This guy is just a creation of hype and PR. Miller knows what she is talking about better than most. Anyone who thinks Bocelli's a real operatic tenor should first clean out their ears and then listen to some genuine artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Real","review":"Bocelli has a nice voice. Better than most pop singers. Even more pleasant in some superficial ways than some big Operatic singers. But he is NOT a tenor in the class of Bjorling or Pavarotti (in his prime).

But thanks for the chuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah Bryan Miller was kinder than I would have been...","review":"Okay, it's better than Charlotte Church or Sarah Brightman, he does have some nice moments. But conservatories are pumping out undergraduates every day who could do the same thing.

The sooner this \\"opera lite\\" craze ends, the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Bocelli remain a POP singer!","review":"There is nothing wrong with indulging Bocelli's passion for opera, especially since his blindness precluded him from the stage career. But why exaggerate? I'm assuming that Bocelli is a talented pop singer (for I am blissfully unaware of what he sounds like outside of his \\"Opera Album.\\"). But why does it also follow that he is a great OPERA singer? Why not evaluate his singing in two separate genres separately? Please, stop carping on SBM; and please stop referring to anyone who dares to be unimpressed with Bocelli as a snob. If a three-year-old came up to you and criticized you for something you did (something you're really good at: e.g., what you do for your career or a hobby), how would that make you feel? Would \\"snobbism\\" be the word to describe your reaction? Or perhaps \\"professionalism\\" would do better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the libretti","review":"Besides the crystal clear singing voice of Andrea Bocelli, this CD comes with the libretti AND the English translation of every aria.

I wonder why people are so critic about you. Does they bother so much with your way of Singing an Aria.They are very Good Andrea Bocelli. There are now-a-days other Tenors in the World, but your interpretation appeals much more to me than others. Whether to the reviews say you do not possess a voice, I only ask them a question? Why the great Maestros conduct and record a record with Andrea Bocelli? If you are so unimportant in the world of Arts, Why there are so many queries at the Metropolitan Opera House, if Andrea Bocelli will take part of the Opera Season? A Beautiful record, as any of the records you do, in whatever style you wish. Once again to compare your voice to others, its ridiculous. There is no comparison. You are Andrea Bocelli, and others, are others. Why one has to read comparisons? I dislike profoundly.

Perhaps it was because I have developed such expectations based on his past works. There were too many segments where things just dragged on and situations that just repeated themselves. Lily and Pete were too shallow and neurotic for my tastes, although somewhat improving by the book's end. The ending was a nice twist but not enough to push the overall rating of this book higher.

I am not a fan of war history, so actually learning something while enjoying the suspense of the novel was a bonus.

But what the picture doesn't show you, is that the gray armor plates are like a hard foam rubber. They're not flexible like in the photo and on our costume they are dull dark gray, not silverish. The belt is even worse, frankly it's a kind of gross brown rubber. Even though I was pretty sure we ordered the \\"deluxe\\" version with the full helmet, it's still just a half mask.

The ad for this figure and other figures in the line are misleading as they are supposed to be Borg assimilated characters, when actually they are just an artist's version of the famed villains. These villains do not look like this. Keep your day job guys; this collection isn't worth the plastic it's made of. I'm very disappointed with my purchase.

I much preferred the interaction between father and son in this second film as well.Now something else to enjoy in this film is the editing. It was a difficult film to edit especially with some rather violent clashes amongst the animals. By the standards of the day this was a very realistic film. The color quality was excellent even by today's films.This is better than \\"My Friend Flicka\\" but not as good as the remake \\"Flicka\\".

I also wanted a digital camera that had some pretty nice features. Features that would grow with me, so once I learned how to use different features I wouldn't have to buy another camera so soon. So, for a newbie like me, this was the perfect digital camera. It was so easy to learn how to use and my prints are gorgeous! Even the pictures I took at night with little light came out awesome! The Image Stabilization is great, because I don't know how to hold a steady hand just yet. I chose black, because I wanted another camera color besides the usual silver.

No such luck. They claimed it was an impact injury. There is no way this is possible...even if it was, a camera at this price should not sustain such injuries so soon after such light use.

Maybe it is the particular one I have got, but I do see some very negative reviews. I grew up in a photo studio and know enough about cameras. Only ~1 out of 3 pictures I took with this camera turned out reasonably good. Majority of the pictures were blurry and grainy, sometimes even in well-lighted settings. Overall quality of the pictures are not nearly as good as my ancient Canon G2 (3 or 4 MP? I bought it 8 years ago, unfortunately battery died 2 years ago). What a waste of many cozy moments! I have decided to trash this piece of junk and get a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5, which I hope will work better.

So far I'm glad I purchased it. It comes with a rechargeable battery which is great - the first sony cybershot i had ate through batteries causing me to buy expensive lithium ion AA and instead of eating through batteries it ate through my wallet.

But it is impossible to take a good picture indoor, no matter which setting I use. Even automatic setting doesn't work. All the pictures come out red and blurry. I can only use this camera for outdoor pictures and for video filming. I'm a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality in medium to low light, hard to avoid blur","review":"We bought this camera as smaller alternative to our Digital Rebel SLR which is roughly 7MP as well. We wanted something smaller to take on quick trips, snapshots of the kids, etc... We were very dissapointed with the image quality, especially indoors where less light is available. Most of the images came our red and grainy, many were blurry. I have experience with photography and tried multiple settings, but the image quality still suffered. We are going to try to return this camera and get a point and shoot Canon and maybe spend a little bit more. The convienence and form factor are not worth it if the image quality is terrible. We should have stuck with Canon in the first place. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this is just NOT a good book.","review":"It's written in a breezy, \\"I know you won't believe this, but...\\" manner that overlooks basic character motivations. It is filled with stereotypes. How does the heroine know, for example, that the t-shirt seller she gallops past in Central Park on a Park Ranger's horse is \\"a little Filipino man\\"? Sorry, but I cannot recommend a book where ALL African-American women wear door-knocker earrings. If you're looking for an adult book about horses, try BARBARA DIMMICK, or JODY JAFFE if you want a mystery. Props to Banks, though, for quoting \\"Heads Up, Heels Down\\". Now THERE'S a book I'd rather read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story development, boring","review":"Very weak plot, weak character development, just all around weak. The paperback is only 178 pages, so at least it's a quick, boring read. The story jumps all around incidents that don't build to anything, they just seem disjoint. The climax writing left me with the impression that the author was just tired of writing this story and wrapped it up in a hurried, ridiculous manner. Even though I'm addicted to horses and love dressage, I was bored by the sappy, shallow references to attempt to showcase the author's knowledge. Don't bother to read this book, I imagine the author's friends wrote the 4 or 5 star recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine piece of art","review":"This fountain pen is in itself a piece of art. Classic in design and color, it provides the smooth and exquisite experience of writting. The nib flows on the page without a delay and ink is evenly spread. The only down side perhaps for me is that it is not as 'fine' a line as I have expected, and anyone with a less powerful grip should be warned that the pen is a bit heavy when the cap is attached to the top side during writting. However, this can be getten used to; after about 20 minutes of fast writting I found the heaviness to be a perfect balance that constantly kept the pen nib on the paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just would-be Tarantino","review":"This is one of the most original films to come down the pike in quite some time. While initial scenes would appear to borrow from \\"Reservoir Dogs,\\" \\"Phoenix\\" quickly establishes its own tone. The dialogue is great (the King Kong speech itself is worth the price of admission), and the actors have the skill to bring it all off. Liotta is one of the most powerful, charismatic actors working today, and here he finally gets the kind of material that actually gives him a few challenges. \\"Phoenix\\" is more than just a well done entry in the noir genre; it's a spectacular, witty film with a great cast and many, many great moments. Liotta forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful collection of cliches","review":"A boring, predictable film with every plot and visual cliche in the book. I simply got tired of the pointless, meandering plotline. Halfway through the film, I realized that virtually every single scene change began with someone lighting a cigarette, and it then became humorous and ridiculous to watch the cliched cigarette lighting routine every 30 seconds.A yawnfest, I only watched the whole thing because there was nothing else on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't rely on a single translation","review":"(Kitto edition, Kindle). I am not an expert on translations and don't read the original Greek. But my conclusion is that it is a good idea to not rely on a single translation to get the full meaning. This is not a fault of any one version, since it is impossible (probably) to cover every point. However, I was disappointed in the some aspects of the Kitto translation and the editor's notes. For example,in the famous Chorus' Ode to the Human Being in Antigone, the human being is apparently described by the Greek word \\"deinon\\" which has (apparently) the double meaning of both wonderful and terrible, so the praise is ambiguous, but this crucial point doesn't really come out in the Kitto. But then I assume Kitto does other things right that others don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bookstore is horrible","review":"This bookstore made sure that the book arrived at the latest possible date. I tryed to contact the owner the only way possible, e-mail, 3 times and never got any responses with regaurds to my order. I will NEVER order from this place again nor would I ever recommend them.

Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning quickly, but not fond of the people in the recordings","review":"Michel uses two students and effectively you are the third one, repeating things back with them and learning as they do. One student understands concepts and pronunciations quickly. The other student is much much slower and has TERRIBLE pronunciation. You have to sit through Michel fixing this student's pronunciation and grammar until he gets it, which sometimes takes a while. If you are a complete beginner, you may like the pace of this second student, if you have some previous experience, like me, you may find this student's pace a little frustrating. Also, there are no native Spanish speakers in the recording, which may be something to think about. All that being said, my Spanish is coming back to me very quickly and I am really pleased with the progress I have made in a very short amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best all-audio learning method","review":"One might think that this program's advertisements are exaggerated and hyperbolic, whereas in fact the program does just what it says. The main advantage of these CDs is that one builds confidence in speaking the language. Even if one does not know all of the langauge's vocabulary (impossible after so short a course), at least one has gotten one's feet wet and had a good introduction to the structure of the language and forming one's own sentences. This is a truly excellent way to make productive use of the time behind the wheel! This course facilitates effortless learning and retention of the material. Truly a breakthrough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish with a French Accent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Michel Thomas's intro French cd's. The Spanish set was a huge disappointment. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I think there is an advantage to real students making real mistakes. We can learn from their mistakes - many of which we might have made ourselves. The annoying thing is that Michel Thomas makes his students repeat their responses 3,4 or even 5 times because they are not pronouncing the Spanish words with a French accent. The listener has to sit by and endure the tedium of the repitition and the lecturing about the students' mistakes. Most of this should have been edited out.Michel Thomas Speak Spanish For Beginners: 10-CD Beginner's Program (Michel Thomas Speak...)I played a bit of one of these cd's for some Costa Rican friends who were hysterical listening to the Michel's accent. Not a purchase I would recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish CD Set","review":"This is a nice set for the price. It comes in a nice black zippered case and has a small card with key words that correlate to the cd's. The only negative thing is that Michel Thomas has a german (I think) accent.

But after working with the tutorials in this book I've finally gotten a very good idea on how to use this medium. The artist does a great job in telling you how to apply the colors in layers and how you should handle pastels and the tools/items you work with when you use them.The artwork in this book is adorable and the wolf & Horse paintings are simply gorgeous.This is a great book even for the beginner or even perhaps thinking of using pastels.You could easily use most of these techniques with watercolor pencils or colored pencils as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildllife artist","review":"I purchased this book not knowing that it was all in pastel medium.

Not only the tracks are confusing, but also the fragments that are presented as finished pieces do not have a proper explanation. Two examples: Tristan Tzara's poem is a fake version by the group \\"Ex voco\\" which has little to do with the original one, whose \\"score\\" is perfectly and clearly written throughout. Schwitters' \\"Ursonate\\" is just an arbitrary fragment of a work lasting in its complete version around 50 minutes.

This is not so much a novel as a disjointed collection of vignettes and short stories that cover the centuries since ancient Phoenicia to a bizarre future where everyone is immortal.

If it starts bad, I can hope for a smashing ending or a pickup in the story about the middle of the book. Unfortunately, I saw no reason to continue this book past page 100, a rare occurence for me. Don't get me wrong, Ive read Anderson for years. Brain Wave, Tau Zero, the Flandry saga are all classics. His award-winning short stories are examples of what a good sf short should be. Here he lost me. The immortal race hidden among us humans has been a staple of legend for centuries. More recently it was popularized by The Eternal Mercenary series and the Highlander. Here he adds nothing new and it just a long journey through history. I notice that star travel is supposed to come into play near the end, but I can't make it.

The detail and (at least apparant) acuracy of TBOAMY really did make it a rich story. The way you are with charachters for such a long time really makes you feel you know them and when it finished I felt as if there was still a part of me that was still there with them, coasting off into infinity.Along with the creators of Babylon 5, Luc Besson, and George Lucas Anderson has inspired me and my writting.END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice guide, well-organized","review":"Living in California, I don't get a chance to hike in New Hampshire as often as I would like. But when I do, I always take this lightweight guide along in my car and in the pack. The best part about the guide is that hikes are described in detail and directions to each trailhead are given in exhaustive detail. This is especially important for out-of-towners who aren't familiar with the back country roads. The authors have hiked each of the trails and they offer pithy comments on trail conditions, the possibility of seeing wildlife and other pertinent information.There is a separate section on the magnificent Cohos Trail, the 200+ mile hike which runs the length of the state. My one slight criticism is the photos, which could be of better quality, but the text, route descriptions and ancillary material are of high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiking New Hampshire: A Welcome Guide for NH Hikers","review":"This is a fine book, with much to offer the novice and dedicated hiker alike. Pletcher's work offers guidance for hiking throughout the state of NH. He has somehow managed to narrow his analysis to 100 fine hikes, which promise adventure into all levels of hiking. While it in no way matches the depth of pure trail knowledge one finds in the AMC guide, it instead offers unique, intimate and eloquent analysis of 100 hikes. Each hike is highlighted with its own map, as well as a chart to graph elevation gains. Also, each trail's difficulty and length are assessed and special attractions unique to the hike are noted. Pletcher is clearly proficient in his knowledge of these trails and, more importantly, adept at putting that knowledge into compact summaries for the benefit of would-be hikers.

They've managed to use the studio to create space in an already swiss cheese like piece. But the key difference here is the space is much more stark than Eno, thanks to the startling presence of their instruments, which rattle and drone and twitter expressively. The quiet becomes the space for anticipation of the instruments. so rather than the steady rolling pulse of Eno's, you get more up and down with BOAC's version.It doesn't improve on Eno's piece.

First, the handlebars (assembled by myself as per directions) are not in a comfortable position for me to ride in. Second, when the bike came the threads for both pedals were stripped. I needed to to re-bore (?)new holes and get bigger pedals so that the rebore threads could be used. Third, make sure that you grease some of the bike parts before riding or you will be having metal on metal grinding that will shorten the lifespan of the bike considerably. Overall it isn't a bad bargin for under 140 bucks, but my advise is to have it checked out by a bicycle shop before riding it long distances for your safety.

So what creates the Tupac mystic?In Tupac: Resurrection 1971-1996 edited by Jacob Hoye and Karolyn Ali, with the original concept hailing from his mother Afeni Shakur, you are taken behind the scenes to read Tupac's writings. To get a feel of what was on his mind.These writings pin point to a creative mind who continually worked on developing plays, songs, and other art forms to express the inner turmoil that Tupac faced. Even with his success, he had set backs, being shot 5 times, going to prison.Throughout his life, Tupac depended on his mother and the women that he loved and loved him. This beautifully designed book is an ideal part of the legacy that Tupac left behind in a life that was cut short due to unexpected tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kpo","review":"Very reliable and trustworthy.

If Tupac were here to tell the story from his eyes I believe it would be close to the words spoken throughout the book. Looking at the pictures, it made me sad, seeing him as a bright, talented, black male who is no longer here today. Tupac, was really misunderstood in my opionion. I do believe he had a strong faith in the Lord vs. what everybody else says because God is mentioned a few times throughout the book. And I feel his pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book around about Tupac","review":"This is the best book out there about Tupac, You learn about his life and why he did the things he did.

I can not believe people make money doing movies like this, they should go bankrupt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric at best","review":"This film is rated \\"R\\" ostensibly because of the off-color language, yet probably the only audience that would really see any comic value in it is the under-18 set, so it fails there. The gags are predictable and repetitious. The best I can say about it is that the leads play nicely off each other and both have good camera presences and are oddly endearing. If the filmmakers had cleaned up the language and snagged a PG or a PG-13 it would probably have fared better.

It has it's moments, a couple of small laughs, but the same stupidness over and over is irritating and annoying after a while.Cheap jokes, cheap laughs and a lot of failed humor. It could have been so much better with better jokes in it, but it falls flat.

The jokes are expected, and the pairing of actors is just superficial and forced. However, there is a rare breed of comedies about that don't focus on 'tell a joke' humor. These new films focus on the nostalgia, little things, and reactions to silly events. You are not laughing at the joke, you're laughing at the person, or the peoples reaction to that person. *That* is the comedic gold that The Brothers Solomon presents. This, along with movies such as Hot Rod, Grandma's Boy, Talladega Nights, etc.. focus on how absurd these people are acting, and it's just funny. If you're looking for obvious humor, don't watch these films; they will be stupid beyond belief.

The ending was so disappointing that I gave up on Malamud. The metal rods that he stuck in the ape's head is so corny that I was disgusted through the entire novel. Not his finest by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, but not as pictured","review":"If you like Parker Jotters this is a fairly nice pen. The bottom is much darker than pictured, and the outline looks corroded at the edges. Rather than a nice light blue, the bottom is more of a cobalt blue, with navy/almost black outline. The texture of the bottom isn't consistent with the top.If this was $7 or $8 it would be worth it. List at $35 is outrageous. Even at more than half that, it's just not worth it. If you like the jotter, you'd be better off with a $5 standard silver or colored base. If you're looking for a flashier unique pen, you'll probably be disappointed by this.That being said, Its still a Jotter, has a nice balance, feels and writes nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Heritage Scrapbooking","review":"This book is full of helpful ideas and suggestions.

It's useful to read to get an overall view, but much better books exist on the subject and it seems to be catered primarily to the non-technical. The book uses a lot of buzz words, wraps the topics in \\"wouldn't it be nice\\" scenarios, etc. but provides no real meat or content.All-in-all, decent to read, but provides no insight for business and/or technical decision making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I have been very keen to read this book and to learn about CEP and event-driven architectures. However, I found the book rather disappointing. The introduction to CEP for global enterprises is weird, after so many years after the dotcom-bubble burst. The examples in the first parts of the book (electronic media stores) are not convincing, because they do not really need CEP or EDA. Sloppy explanations and definitions are embarrassing; several definitions are self-referring (e.g., significance and event pattern) or inconsistent (e.g., event pattern on page 114 and 116)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly boring to read","review":"I tried to read this book. I have it on my book shelf and I can see it right now, but I really couldn't get past the introduction. For a supposedly technical book, the first chapter reads like a 1995 introduction to the 'information superhighway' and about how wonderful it will be. This sentence on page 9:\\"Another example is automated trading Web sites, or \\"eMarketplaces\\" as they are called.\\"Then followed by the word \\"global eCommerce Web\\". It just reads like a bad commercial from IBM or BEA telling you how to 'accelerate your eCommerce to web speed'.In theory the book should be good, but this kind of treatment really offends my technical sensibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Dog Lover, get this book!","review":"As usual, the late James Herriot has brought us into his life to share his favorite canine stories and experiences.

Other than the funny hairstyles, the techniques and drawings still apply.Hamm does a really good job presenting dozens of viewpoints and angles with step-by step instructions. He teaches perspective, shading and how to draw different body shapes.

Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your wondering where to start....start with Jack Hamm","review":"I have just begun to explore the world of art. Drawing has become my passion, and although I have had no formal training this book has sharpened my skills a great deal. I love this book, and I am currently ordering every book written by Jack Hamm. First Lessons in Drawing and Painting is my newest purchase, and i am confident that it wont be the last of Jack Hamm's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"This book seems a bit old-fashioned in it's exercises and drawing suggestions. Even the examples of women's faces look like heads of women from the 50's. Maybe it is from the 50's originally. Anyway, it is dated.The layout is messy and the faces cartoonish.I am hoping to find some helpful tips on drawing the human figure but I am not too optimistic so far.I'd say skip this book as I am sure there are much better ones out there.If you don't have it check outDrawing for Dummies, it is a MUCH BETTER instructional guide than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Anything by Jack Hamm is extremely educational. Ive ordered a few of his books and didnt pay more than a dollar for each. I am a fairly accomplished artist and I learned alot from these books, yet they are also appropriate for beginners. I recommend this book and any other Jack Hamm drawing book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamm is without peer in this area of teaching","review":"Whether you are a novice or a well established draftsman or artist, this book will be a treasure for you. Hamms drawing is solid and he stresses construction and form analysis. He teaches you, in an utmost pedagogic way, how to BUILD your drawings, which will lay a foundation for you to draw anything in your imagination. I am an illustrator and also have a sound foundation in technical drawing, and I have read many books on drawing, but Hamm's books (worth to check out is Hamm's book on animal drawing, that even surpasses this one), at least for me, are without challenge. There is an ocean between his way of teaching and the other's I have read. I am sure that if you are serious into drawing and aim to be a good draftsman, you will cherish this book for as long as you live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best drawing book I've ever found.","review":"I've never been confident with drawing faces and the human body/form, but this book offers techniques that are simple to understand and to put into practice. What's more, the techniques actually work! After a few days of just browsing through the book, I decided to try to sketch a face using his egg shape diagram, and I was surprised at how easy it came. Using the triangles diagram, I drew a human figure better than I thought I could.The author's inclusion of bone and muscle structure never overwhelms, and only aids in your understanding of how to create more realistic illustrations. This was probably one of the most helpful aspects, and I'm usually turned off when it focuses too much on underlying anatomy.Practice is always the key, and with this book, Jack Hamm has made the process easy and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE AWESOMENESS FROM JACK HAMM","review":"An light, undaunting, unpretentious and clearly-written/illustrated guide that illuminates about core truths in a way that somehow only Jack Hamm has done. If you don't already have Hamm's \\"DRAWING LANDSCAPES & SEASCAPES\\" then I very highly recommend that you add it to your life... Things I always sortuv intuitively knew about composition and spacial design are laid out in a fashion that is immediately comprehensible and useful. And these are thin, friendly books that have little bits of writing amidst tons of very very clear illustrations, so if reading chapters and large blocks of text makes you nervous, this will be a real treat. Jack Hamm wrote these with pure communication in mind -- no showboating or ego exists in these... they are pure gold, and he manages to only empower the interested artist. Plus, these are cheap. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The figure, broken down","review":"Hamm's classic book on the subject is still one of the best. I have recently been teaching myself drawing (specifically figure drawing) through books like this and online tutorials, and I have to say this is the best resource I have found. He covers a varoety of techniques, plus breaks the body down to parts and has different sections on how to draw speific regions, with lots of examples. My challenge in drawing the human form was figuring out where to start, and how to draw the individual areas. I have found that this book and the Xua Taptara's online resource [...] have been my best allies for growing as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Concise","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best book on figure drawing that I have ever seen. Most books get muddled trying to teach you anatomy, and muscle groups. They are also all written by teachers who know the one way that works for them. Jack Hamm, on the other hand, has no problem showing you multiple ways to draw a head, body, hair, etc. The drawings are clear, with only enough detail to get the point across. No extra shading, or different drawing techniques to confuse the issue.To those people that say the book is dated (it was originally published in the 60's I think), people haven't really changed. How can a book on drawing the human body get 'dated'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best Out There!","review":"The only book that is close is Jack Faragasso's Mastering Drawing the Human Figure. But it's a bit too complicated. Drawing the Head and Figure is far simpler and gives better examples. The best I've found so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had picked this up about a decade earlier","review":"Great book. Tons of reference pictures. Simple enough drawings to follow, not so simple as to leave you hanging. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to improve their figure drawing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many wonderful compositions.............","review":"This compilatory album by David Wright gathers 18 of his most legendary compositions from the years 1991 to 2004.

Absolute krap","review":"As the other reviewers pointed out (and somehow enjoyed) Satie's most famous, almost minimalist pieces here are played slow. Really slow. Watching paint dry while waiting for a bus slow. Granted, these pieces are intended to be slow but not THAT slow. Satie's famous Gymnopedies are played at about 38 bpm. Unless you're heavily sedated you're likely to find yourself screaming, \\"Play the next note, damn you!\\" When I bought this I had the option to return it for a full refund but chose to destroy the disks instead. For the love of God, PLEASE listen to the samples before even thinking about buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satie as you have never heard him !","review":"Reinbert de Leeuw is the most original piano interpret I have ever heard ! His versions of Eric Satie's famous Gymnopedies are unique, because his plays them so slowly that it is sometimes difficult to recognise them; you re-discover them as you hear him play. This is the perfect approach to play some famous pieces people have heard so many times in a refreshing way. Of course, this is different from the \\"classic\\" way to play Satie, as Philippe Entremont did in a definitive way. But Reinbert de Leeuw is really original : it is the slowest interpretation of Satie's pieces. There is a few seconds silence between each note. Reinbert de Leeuw has recorded Satie's pieces twice : his first attempts in the 70's (in ADD) were even slower than the recent (DDD), all made for Phillips. The 1998 Phillips 2 CDs package contains the slowest versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of piebald","review":"totally travis as some of you may know is the acoustic side of Travis from the wonderful band piebald!

Neither transforms nor data compression issue has been comprehensively addressed. One can easily fand better chapters on transforms in many image processing and coding books, including the non-sinusoidal ones - which are missing in the book. Editors seem to contact with authors who apparently did not want to write tutorial-type texts, but who had some rather specific things to say (Eg. Comparametric transfomrs for transmitting eye tap video with PTP). That might be OK, however there are so many basic things which are not here. If transforms and compression is considered together, the book still fails to serve since many issues such as coding gain and other analytical analysis, as well as many popular methods have been superficial.

I love the pieces for their vibrant colors (especially the way the big, bright stars stand out against the brilliant shades of blue).Sadly, the posters I received were very dull and drab. The vivid colors were muted, and the stark white stars were light gray. I threw both posters away, rather even than give them to a friend. (What kind of a gift would that be?) It was a sad waste of money and paper -- and a poor representation of two of my favorite paintings.I see now that both posters' prices have been knocked down to hardly anything at all. They're still not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge hit!","review":"Perfect price and quality product. This is my daughter's \\"gateway artist\\" into mature artwork.

Big mistake - the thing was bulky, difficult to steer, and took up almost the entire trunk space of my car. After two months we switched to the SnapNGo which we found at ToysRUs instead. This basically became our travel system which we actually used with two different infant car sets (Century and Evenflo). We used the SnapNGo exclusively from age 2 months to about 10 months. We even used it indoors sometimes to motion baby to sleep. Pros: compact, easy to fold/unfold, sturdy frame, good parent tray, and large basket. Cons: my wife says it's still kind of heavy, front wheels cannot be locked from turning, switching between certain types of car seats require you to unscrew one support bar and reposition it, and faster growing babies will most likely outgrow their car seat (and hence the SnapNGo) in much less than our 10 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect - No problems at all with this one","review":"This is the best stroller I have ever bought! I wish I had it when my first child was born. I bought this when my son was 1 month old and it made running a lot of little errands easier. The brakes are good, the parent tray is good, and even the valet at the hospital knows how to close it! It's easy to steer and has proven to be very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better and can be dangerous","review":"I first purchased this stroller because it is light. After using it for 6 months I find that it is in fact dangerous. I was taking the car seat out of the stroller when the support bars which hold the seat in place fell to the ground. The screws had come out and keeps coming out. I found that the basket is useless. When the car seat is in place, there is hardly enough space to access the basket. The parent's tray keeps coming off and I often find parts that had come off in the trunk of my car. I'm purchasing another stroller because the one I purchased is dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent timekeeper, great crystal, with one flaw ---","review":"I bought this watch 5 years ago, and it has run within a second or two per month of perfect time every since. The crystal resists scratches extremely well. The case and band look like new also when cleaned with soap and water. The clear window back is neat. The only problem is that these watches were until recently sold with a capacitor for power storage instead of a battery, and the capacitors fail after a few years and have to be replaced at a cost not far short of $100. The repair consists primarily of installing a rechargeable battery instead of the capacitor, and this should last longer -- I hope -- since I just paid for the repair. I think Seiko goofed, but the watch is great except for that problem, and the price relative to other high-quality watches is much lower, so it still is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko Titanium Watch","review":"I've had the watch for 3 months and am very happy with it. The watch is light weight and looks nice. I've brushed the watch up against a few objects but cystal remains unscratched.

Unfortuantly this album is a sad money wasting album. Scott Bond is an excellent Dj and I've heard much better than this from him. This CD mainly contains a few good tracks that I like to listen to occaisionlly but for the most part this CD contains no solid feeling trance and you'll get tired of listening to it after several tracks. Gatecrasher puts out an excellent series so if you are looking for something good try Gatecrasher Red, Wet, or Black. These are the true pieces of art and are worth every penny spent. All in all, stay away from this album and disappointment will stay away from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accept yourself, Buy this allbum. A head trip","review":"Riding the roller-coaster of emotional intensity this album gives you an unexpected ride. Firsty I had been entertained by the 'merry go round' - like spin of \\"Global Sound System\\" which contained modern music methods and some orignal samples. But with DTG. I was taken un-aware by the psycologicaly structured beats and refined sound of original mixes of this pill-on-a-disk. This is music that takes you on a pleasure trip higher and higher, suddenly dropping your thoughts and emotions on a seemingly one way trip back to (your) reality... And when you stop. At the Bottom.

With retailers not giving the option of listening to or returning CD's, Amazon is a good place to find what you like. Unless you have DSL and can download everything, your like me and need to rely on those real player clips and these reviews, and so, for you, heres my helpful view of this album. Don't buy this CD! Every track you wait and wait for a melody to spawn or build to a climax. Trust me, it never happens. (...) Don't let this review turn you off of Gatecrasher however. (...) The second CD of Gatecrasher limited is good. It's the one with the green griffon. Hope this helped all you trance listeners out there.

There are a few movies that are technically even more incompetent, but this one is just... so.... boring. (The only one that can compare to it is 'Monster A-Go-Go'.) They dance and dance and dance and dance and dance and dance and dance. And oh the voice over. The heartless, anemic voice over designed to replace the lost soundtrack. Uhhhhh. The episode itself is pretty good, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even MST3K can't save the day.","review":"Far be it for me to knock MST3K, but even they can't make this garbage watchable. Honestly, there's just nothing there to work with. As already described, the film for whatever reason, eschews actual dialogue in favor of toneless narration, and the pace of the movie matches the monster: it creeps at you. Now, the boys on the Satelite of Love can do ok with plot wholes, bad acting, bad directing, etc., but they're at their best when they rip on the cruddy dialogue found in the films they watch. Without that, most of the jokes seem forced, or just aren't as clever as they should be. I can't even think of one really great line from Mike (or Joel) and the robots as I can in other episodes. The numerous flaws make \\"The Creeping Terror\\" unbearable to watch on its own. But those same flaws make it an unmockable film, even by the experts. Skip this one, and get \\"Eegah!\\" or \\"Pod People\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giant Carpet Monsters Attack!","review":"Well, I'll try to write a review: A giant shag carpet/caterpillar monster from outer space lands on Earth.

It is a look back at a simpler America back in 1870. One where the frontier of the west was still to be won and farming was the best chance to make a future.The author tells quaint stories of the toils of everyday farm life with a humorous touch. Their family moved to Illinois when that was the end of the known world to Americans. He talks about his youth at the farm with his brothers and parents. He described the work, school, friends in the neighborhood, and religion. This is a must read to look back at America.FG"},{"rating":"2","title":"The End is Near!","review":"The End is Near! reveals a strong spiritual kingship between these brilliant minds of today and major luminaries of the past like Hieronymus Bosch, William Blake and Emmanuel Swedenborg. It hints at shared understanding between self-taught contemporary visionaries and such ancient prophetic traditions found in Classical Greece, Aboriginal Australia and the seers of the Holy Scriptures. Included in The End is Near! is the entire Revelation of St. John the Divine, perhaps the most influential and widely-referenced- yet rarely read -work on the ultimate fate of humanity and the universe.

The CZ's are beautiful, well set. The metal part of the ring-I don't know that it is really silver-appears to look like Silver.

It just look like a well polished clear glass or crystal.Picture it's just too sharp and the real one is just \\"too fake\\" to be a diamond one and at the same time with too big pretentions to be a simple silver ring to wear with casual-sport apparel.

LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect stone size for smaller hands","review":"It's not too obvious and looks believable as a real diamond ring on any budget. I'm not a fan of round stones but I just got this as a back up ring for work anyway. It's still very pretty and looks great on my small hand. I ordered two rings at once and just like the other one, this one is not a true size. It is 3/4 size bigger than the size I ordered. I'm wearing it while I'm typing this and have to stop and pick it up from the keyboard where it's fallen off my finger. It's very annoying. Order yourself a size smaller than what you normally wear and you will be happy! It's not worth the trouble and cost to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!!","review":"Gorgeous ring!!

I used them for years and now that I have 2 teen daughters they use them too. I just asked my oldest daughter which brand she wanted me to order - and out of the three brands she has used she said the Natracare is the best. :) I never had a leakage problem (as other posts have claimed) til I hit my mid forties and after three kids. Now I just use Natracare pads. They even make one for thong underwear. Great stuff. Pricier cost is definitely tolerable compared to caustic conventional tampons that add even more hazard with their chemical perfumes. Yuck! Who wants that in their body?! My one daughter plays competitive sports year round, and the other is a pre-professional advanced level ballet dancer 18+ hours a week and neither of them has ever complained about leakage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"never ever works!

Do not buy any Sylvania products. The DVD player will break several times before and after the one year warranty has expired.

Same problem: the DVD player malfunctioned, but not at the store. I resorted to videotaping the problem. When I received this TV I thought they'd given me an open box item - the packing was damaged and there is no product registration card. BUT - that's how they all come. I buy widescreen movies and switch back and forth between letterbox and full screen. On this TV that feature doesn't work at all! Followed the instructions to the letter with no success. However, I did buy a warranty for this one, so I am doing research before this TV (inevitably) malfunctions, and I'll ask for a reliable replacement.PROSNice picture, headphone jack, and maybe it will last a few months before I have to go back to the mall store. The Toshiba malfunctioned monthly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money! I read that this unit was a reliable although not top-of-the-line DVD burner, but after having it installed for a week, it is hard to tell anything about this drive is. The Nero 6 Memorex Suite that ships with this unit literally crashes my computer with every fifth or sixth click of the mouse - something that other reviewers have reported. I really don't see how Memorex can expect to sell units with this software package. Similarly, I don't see how Nero can expect someone to purchase an upgrade to a buggy program - its throwing good money after bad. Two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Drive, Bogus Software","review":"I like the drive. it works well for my simple needs.but most of the included nero software expires and they want more money. all that works now is the simple burning tool. i would rather have a 'lesser' version of the nero software than a full version that i cannot use after couple months.so be warned if you want to author dvd's and many other things, the software will expire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift Idea","review":"I ordered this in black for my mom for Christmas.

My only complaint was that I only paid 14.99 for it but paid 8.00 for standard shipping. But on the other side, I ordered about 12 items from different companies on Amazon at the same time and this one was the first to arrive.I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't complain","review":"The only bummer is sometimes the applicator will get stuck so you have to push a little out before you insert to make sure you can. My periods have really been less of a flow since using them. Highly recommend them.

After researching this brand and reading about how the expanded shape is superior to the typical store brand, I was a bit disappointed that I did not notice any difference between this brand and the typical store brand I normally purchase. Note, I did not say 'the leading national brand', I said 'store brand'. I'm not so sure their claims are legit, and I'm not sure it's worth it to pay a premium for this product.

I put 30 legal file folders on it, and it sways front and back with the legs slipping under and the whole thing caves in.

What decade is this, the 1950's? If marriage is so great, how come so many are divorced? Marriage is good for some, not needed for others. Mr. Rauch's view that you must be married to be part of the social fabric of this society is an insult to all single people, gay or straight, or those in a relationship who are not interested in getting the government involved in their lives.

Most people will buy things if it pertains to them, much like poeple who sale all the silly over-priced souveniers at sports events. People will spend money to show their support. The people selling the items probably do not even care WHAT they are selling, just that people buy.

This is a pointless, self-indulgent romp in a sandbox very far away from anywhere else. The alien presence is not very believable, and the conflict is not particularly engaging.

Infuriating to the literalist, but excellent fun for anyone with imagination.

It is this kind of lifestyle that opens up the culture to him. But it's a culture that is easily recognizable to almost any foreigner that has spent significant time in the Philippines.

This series of Chronographs from Seiko (SNA411, 413 & 414) are the most exciting watches I've seen in years. The photos don't do it justice. Fit and finish are impeccable.

I used to like the golden one better because it looked more classy and white hands on a black dial are easier to see than white hands on a white dial (SNA413).However, the golden color rubs off and as a result, after only a couple of years, the watch is no longer very presentable. I hardly wear it anymore.On a positive note, I shower and swim and dive with my watches and in about 5 years of use I have not had any water in either.Mechanically, this watch is on the lower end of the quality spectrum.Overall, I don't recommend gold tone stainless steel for a watch that is worn daily, because once the gold wears off it makes you look like you wanted a golden watch but couldn't afford one."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, women do like this watch!!","review":"Guess what, I'm female and I love this watch!!

Yes, this is a well-written book, but it's no masterpiece. A book that proclaims to be the first \\"inside story\\" into a culture that the author is not a part of is a shame. I'll just quite Wendy Rose to sum up my feelings on this book. \\"The European-derived American public does not seem to be interested in the works of Leslie Silko and her colleagues; they want the childlike, distorted stereotype offered in the lie of Hanto Yo as interpreted by the white woman who wrote it. They do not want to read works by Lakota authors to learn Lakota history; the bookjacket of Hanto Yo itself claims that it is the first time the \\"inside story\\" has ever been told--thereby denying the existence and validity of hundreds of Northern Plains Indian authors over a century...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"Intelligent readers should read Elizabeth Cook-Lynn's \\"The Relationship of a Writer to the Past\\" before paying $.01 for this book or even borrowing it from the library.

To me, the initially awkward-sounding phrasing eventually became an important part of both the story and my understanding of the characters and their actions.I was thoroughly impressed with this book. It's not history, but it is an impressive (and I believe honest) attempt to make accessible a culture about which many of us have admittedly shallow or misinformed understandings."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"Hanta Yo....an unforgettable experience.

Yes, Ms. Hill includes a few \\"Lakota\\" words in the \\"dictionary\\" in the back, but ask a Lakota what he / she thinks about it. TODAY'S Indians are NOT like the ones portrayed in this book. There is also great doubt that a \\"wasichu\\" , and a woman at that, was given such careful consideration by any \\"holy men\\" or Elders. It may have happened , but maybe not. Like Dances With Wolves, it is simply a romantic fiction, well written, moving, but not representative of modern Indians who do not , for the most part, see it as a great work , and certainly NOT as a \\"Bible\\" of any sort.

However, on page 26 the Bible started including things not appropriate for really small ones. The dream of the baker whose bread was devoured by birds was a foreshadow of his execution. The dream of Pharaoh that predicted 7 years of famine with dying cattle. Dead cows lying in piles and boils all over one's skin in the plagues.

From nice 15 degree sunny days on the slope to -3 with 30 MPH wind, this did not disappoint me at all.In fact, I liked and used mine so much that my husband who was very hesitant had me order him one as well, he used it every day we went skiing and has the same feelings as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for many uses","review":"his thing looks great and is warm but not hot.

I wear this mask, a cycling jersey, arm warmers, cycling shorts or tights, and socks and shoes for clip ons.This cycling mask reduces the runny nose by damn near 100%. I wear it just like the picture, with my nose covered. No problems at all with breathing. And because you don't have that awful fleece material inside, your mouth and nose never get uncomfortable. Perfect material. Lightweight, so it's no big deal if you're wearing it while the weather warms. Easy enough to pull down while riding if you want to spit. Easy enough to put on some sunglasses through the hole on the sides (though I don't ride that way, considering it's still dark when I ride in the morn).If you're looking for something to shield your face, ears, nose from the cold and you don't want fleece innards, get this mask!

The seller ships a Benchmade 740 Dejavoo (plain edge, satin finish) when you order this particular knife, not a Benchmade 730 series Ares knife as is described on the screen. They then blame Amazon for the issue. The knives are not similar at all, so I have to assume they know very little about knives. This knife was on my saved list or in my cart for months, it could have been corrected if they would just take the effort... They did offer to reimburse via Paypal if I ship the knife back, but since I don't use Paypal that doesn't sound very appealing. And given their recent 1/5 star feedbacks recently I'd rather hang onto the $100 wrong knife and at least have something for my money than risk losing both and having to post a 1/5 star feedback myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"good collection of harp works","review":"Nice collection that encapsulates famous works for harp.

First, my first inclination is to tag this album as rock ballad. I'm bewildered by any reference to metal. The melodies of this band are refreshing.Second, I don't understand why this band hasn't enjoyed more success. Perhaps part of the reason is that it has been somewhat mis-labeled. Certainly part of their audience must be avoiding the genre they are in because of its generally heavier image.These are beautifully melodic rhythms and I encourage folks to give them a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"AND YET ANOTHER BAND...","review":"THAT SOUNDS LIKE TOOL/APC...ONLY UNMEMORAble AND THIS GUY TRIES MORE TO SOUND LIKE THE GUY FROM EARSHOT.

All I can say is that its an awesome debut album that keeps getting better each time I listen to it. This band has REAL potential. I was fortunate enough to see them in concert with Taproot when they played here in Grand Rapids and they were amazing. You'll find many bands that sound great on CD, but when you get them live, they're not so good. Evans Blue was awesome and they had a great stage presence. I'm really looking forward to seeing what this band does in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing New, But There's Potential","review":"As far as rock bands of today are concerned, Evans Blue isn't anything new or different. Aside from some rather complicating lyrics at some points, TMATENOV is pretty much your typical rock cd. Lead singer, Kevin Matisyn's voice isn't unique but it's not the same dull sounding stuff you hear nowadays with other bands. The album's strong start through the first six songs is impressive, but it slows down too much at the end. While still enjoyable front to back, Evans Blue's debut attempt is nothing ground-breaking, but probably still worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised the heck out of me...","review":"I don't know exactly how to classify this band. Nu-metal? I don't think that term really applies so much to the heavy music scene anymore.I would say that they would be alternative metal, not emo or nu.First off, the vocals are just amazing. Not only the leads, but the backing vocs and harmonies are excellent. Haven't heard better since maybe Alice In Chains.Every song on here is worthy of being a single, and I think if they got the proper backing, they could be huge. There are hooks galore. I think I almost OD'd on catchy tunes. There are a few tender moments on this disc, but it rocks pretty hard while keeping true to the melody in it's title.If you enjoy bands like Taproot, 10 Years, godhead, etc., you'll love Evans Blue. No, they are not hardcore or anything, but I'm not ashamed that I like a broad range of rock and metal. I listen to Lamb of God and In Flames, too. I can appreciate great music when I hear it, and these guys are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This ball is very disappointing.

There wasn't anything too fancy about this one. I didn't care so much for the texture of the brush. I have pretty sensitive skin and so it was a little on the rough side for me. It was a nice sized brush and the fan style was fine, but again, the material of the brush was too harsh. I don't think I would recommend this to a friend. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Problem","review":"Is there anything more futile then the synoptic problem? A professor of New Testament at a Theological Seminary should certainly realize that the problem is not a literary one. Let me explain. The synoptic problem, as defined by the book, is why luke, mark, and matthew look so much alike. Many possible solutions exist but none have been proven. My concern is what will be gained if this problem is solved? Maybe we could better ascertain the theological preferences of the evangelists but then we will have a bigger problem harmonizing those idiosyncracies then we do now. Beyond that, there is no advantage. For what it is the book does introduce and explain the theories and such, but don't devote your life too it.

The main conflict is that a mother can't support her children and makes a decision to give them away. The five children are the antagonists and don't want to leave their mother. The mother is the protagonist and believes it is for the best that they are to be given away. The setting first starts off in New York but most of the story takes place on their journey to the west. I thought this book gave a realistic look at what life is like for orphans. I didn't like that all of the children were separated from each other. I would definitely recommend this book to eighth grade students. It is very suspenseful and exciting. I would also recommend this book to teachers.

Helpful chapters include setting up a secure server, integrating the Solaris native LDAP client with the iPlanet server, and some recommendations for server sizing and tuning. I was somewhat disappointed that the book did not go into greater depth about key issues, such as integrating with other LDAP-enabled products.

Hasbro makes great toys but lately they have been getting worse. Hasbro's build your own lightsaber, which came out in August, wouldn't even let you make a two sided blue lightsaber and it didn't come with a purpe filter. Now this is just a piece of crap.

The laser pointer only generated a tiny spotlight which sometimes was not sufficient if used with a bright projector screen.2. The USB receiver was so designed that it could be inserted the wrong way when placing it back into the hand-held device. This happened quite frequently when I lent it out to others who need to use it. The newer versions seemed to have addressed this.All in all, it did work rather well. I think it is rather pricey, given that you can't use it to move the cursor on the screen. A powerful tool and a good investment considering that appearances are necessary to upkeep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good functionality, but a bit flimsy","review":"I've had my Logitech presenter for about three years, and I've used it about thirty times. The buttons are raised and are easy to find by touch, the laser pointer is bright, and it works even if you're twenty feet away from the receiver (probably even more). I've used it on five different computers, and they all recognized it quickly and automatically. The LCD screen on mine stopped working after about six months, probably due to being bumped around in carry-on luggage. I suspect a lot of people travel with their presenters, so I think Logitech should have made it more sturdy. No big complaints, though; the slide advance and the laser pointer still work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"I am highly disappointed in this product. First, the laser pointer does not work. Second, the presenter does not opperate on a \\"plug-n-play\\" type of system.

I would like to have a couple of spare USB receivers so I don't have to worry about loosing them. Too hard, I'll have to contact the USA guys and see if that can be arranged from there. Or just get another, cheaper brand and forget about the Presenter all together.

Though the Logitech is more expensive than most, the timer feature was the selling point. If you have timed presentations than this one is for you. The remote counts down after you set your desired time and vibrates at 5-minutes-left and 2-minutes-left. If you do not need this feature, it may be worth going with a cheaper version???However, I found that the remote worked seemlessly and quickly updated when I used it on new computers for the first time. I felt the laser pointer on mine was not as sharp as I had seen on a couple of my colleage's (seems to have a slight separation in the beam so the \\"point\\" is not as sharp, but it works just as well).I highly recommend this product for those avid presenters."},{"rating":"2","title":"as promised","review":"A great experience from beginning to end. Plug-n-play compatible, with instant and smooth integration into my powerpoint presentation. The laser point is bright, the usb plug stores easily inside the unit (and therefore is less likely to be misplaced) and the timing feature for a 5 minute reminder is a great addition.

I first bought an MS Presenter 3000, without consulting any rewiews, I stumbled over it in the store and on the package a suitable range was promised. I found myself restricted to about 1.5 meters around the laptop for reliable use. I nevertheless used it for some time but got annoyed more and more. I found out that I am not the only person having troubles with this device. So I did not even gave the MS Presenter a second try through replacement, but - before bringing it back for cash refund, to be able to make a 1:1 comparison - I bought a Logitech Cordless 2.4 GHz Presenter for about double the price. It was worth it. With the same batteries, the Logitech Presenter has a reliable range of at least 10 meters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good presentation remote","review":"This remote is a pretty good presentation remote. I like the fact that it uses regular batteries -- no special trips to the store when they run out (which hasn't happened yet). I use it for a two-hour lecture once a week and haven't had any problems. I don't use the timer feature - all I use is the slide fwd/bwd and the laser pointer.The only downside is that the laser button is nestled in between the fwd/bwd buttons. Its raised a bit so its easy to get used to pressing the laser button without pressing the fwd/bwd buttons, but on average, I'd say I accidentally move forward or backward on accident about twice per lecture. This is better than my previous remote though, which - used a rocker switch to change slides, and would advance farther than I wanted (and it used watch-style betteries).Overall - I'd recommend this remote. The laser pointer is very visible, and it fits in the hand nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity","review":"Simplicity at its best. I will never do another presentatin without it.

It is not a particularly sleek or cool looking device... the picture truly is what you get so if ya like the picture, you are in business!

No software to install, virtually no learning curve at all - you just plug it in and it works.From other reviews I had read, I was a little concerned that the laser pointer would not remain sharp over a long distance. But I gave a presentation in an auditorium last week, and, from about 75 feet away, it was fine.Since the Presenter has no remote mouse function, I did have to go over to my laptop to right-click on the screen in order to go directly to a slide that was 10 slides back from where I was in my presentation. (I did not want to step sequentially back through 10 slides on the screen, which I could have done with the Presenter.) So, next time I would put more importance on buying a presenter with remote mouse function; but, I'd also want it to have the compactness and ease of use of this one.Overall, an excellent, high-quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use","review":"I ordered this presenter right before my company's Annual Review so there was no time to learn anything.

The wireless receiver for the remote fits nicely inside the body of the remote, which has its own protective case.

Furthermore, determining the function of each button is instantaneous...more so than other wireless presenters I have used in the past where you have to determine the functions of the buttons by \\"trial and error\\"...not a good thing for a presenter.

They fit great, they don't slip off my face when I'm running or mountain biking, they're light, they don't fog up when it's humid, and the lenses are good quality. I've owned 3 pairs of Native Dash SS glasses in the past 5 years. Now for the bad news. I sent the first pair in for warranty service 4 times in 2 years before I lost them. The nose pieces kept falling off. The second pair went in for service 3 times. The pair I have now -- I've had them 4 months -- and one of the nose pieces fell off yesterday. Native is nice enough to fix them \\"under warranty\\", but that costs $30 each time I send them in. If you do the math, I've spent about $300 on 3 pairs of these glasses and have spent $240 in warranty repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"warranty\\"","review":"Read the fine print of Native's warranty policy.

At first glance, the book appears helpful, but upon closer inspection it is a disappoinment. The text is set in large font and is graphically arranged to cover up a lack of substance. When the author actually pulls research into the discussion, it is superficial and not adequately explained. Although many of Rutherford's strategies are effective and applicable to various levels, the majority of the material presented in this book appear to be rehashed versions of what effective teachers - and anyone who has gone through a college ed program in the past ten years - already know and do.

I consider Space Cat as one of the most impressive artists of this style of trance. Shapes of Sounds seems to me a brilliant, high energy album. Each song creates an experience, working as I think trance should, to help the listener loosen their imagination and discover the marvels that lay within.If you like electronic music, but are sick of the candy-coated product that is being sold under the disguise trance, check out Space Cat, and Shapes of Sound.

Of course the instruction manual (which is confusing and not written in a logical sequence) only says that you MUST use DVD-R or DVD-RW discs.

It would not dub to dvd the second time I used it so I dropped it off at the factory auth. service center and have not gotten it back yet.(I got it for Christmas) Funai Corp ( the owners of the Sylvania name) have questionable service reps on their toll free customer service line and their factory authorized service center was so busy that they did not start the repair of my unit for two months. Spend a little more and hope for better service is the lesson I take away with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - the discs this machine uses are hard to find!","review":"I ordered this DVD recorder/VCR from Amazon recently. I took note of the reviews warning that the machine is very fussy about which types of DVD-Rs it will record to. Apparently, it only records to 4x speed DVD-Rs (and only certain brands). Well, after spending the day searching all over town for specific brands of 4x DVD-Rs, I came home and cancelled my order with Amazon. The 4x DVD-Rs are being phased out. The manufacturers are now making either 8x speed or something called \\"downward compatible 1x-8x\\" speed. Apparently neither of these two types work with this recorder. Anyone who buys this machine should be warned of this limitation.If you think you want to purchase this DVD recorder, make sure you can get a big supply of 4x speed DVD-Rs before they all disappear. Read the rest of the reviews here to find out which brands of 4x DVD-Rs work.Of what use is a DVD recorder if you can't find discs to record on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD playing","review":"I bought this sylvania DVD/VCR recorder/player last year for my husband and lately all the DVD player does is scramble the DVD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even DVD-R 4X Don't Work Well","review":"It took me a while to figure out I have to use 4X disks for this unit. Now I am able to record a disk. However, almost every disk I record plays back decently in the unit until about halfway through. After that point the playback pauses for 1/2 to 3 minutes and then skips over much recorded material. After that happens the playback keeps pausing, skipping and exhibiting other weird artifacts.I have bought a third brand of DVD-R 4X (top of the line Taiyo Yuden) to try. If these fail, I will pitch the unit and stop throwing good money after bad. Perhaps a Panasonic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden Secret on DVD Speed","review":"I just spent an hour on hold with Funai because this unit was not recognizing the 1X - 8X DVD-R that I had bought. Nowhere in the manual does it say you can't use anything beter than a 4X DVD-R. But when I finally got a technician he knew exactly what the problem was and I couldn't believe that someone would produce a machine with a limit on the quality of the DVD media. I just went to BestBuy and they had exactly one pack of 25 DVD-R at 4X. So this could very well be a machine with a limited life because no one seems to be making slow DVDs. I am going to recommend to my girlfriend that she return this unit to Amazon. My guess is judging from the other reviews that Amazon should add the 4X limitation to their product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was able to make 20 or so dvds from this machine, none of which will play in any other dvd players, despite my completion of the \\"finalizing\\" process.Also, although I'd already made 5 or so dvds out of a 25-pack, it is suddenly giving me an error message.

This limitation can only be discovered by trial and error, as there is no mention on the box, in the manual, or troubleshooting guides.

As one reads, the mind can capture the very situation being described.APO 96490 takes the reader on a journey through the life of Stahl as he experienced Vietnam.

But it's still great to finally hear Ernani with the lighter voices which the opera calls for, rather than the Aida types who too often mangle it (although Price is excellent on RCA). And Pavarotti and Sutherland in decline are still better than most singers in their prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Age Ernani","review":"Ignore all the naysayers who are unlikely to have actually heard this recording anyway. Sutherland is amazing here, and not just for a 60 yr old. The coloratura and trills are all in place and used to expressive effect. This is the art of bel canto, and Ernani is a late bel canto opera, although it is not always approached that way. Her middle register sometimes sounds a little covered, but that is an easy fault to forgive when so much else is so right.Pavarotti is in late prime voice and sings the role heroically, with plenty of squillo. In 1987 he was still very much at the top of his game. Nucci is near his peak also, singing with passion and that gorgeous burnished baritone sound of his. Burchaladze completes the cast, making much of a smallish role and letting his rich bass ring out admirably. Bonynge conducts an exciting performance, and the digital recording is flawless.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swan song for a prima donna","review":"I agree with the other critic about this Ernani. Dame Joan Sutherland is without question the voice of the century. The Prima Donna Assoluta. And she is discredited with this recording. Go and purchase her Art of the Prima Donna and be dumbfounded instead of disappointed by wide vibrato and belting as you will hear here. Pavorotti is only decent here, to hear him in the prime, order the \\"Daughter of the regiment\\". ( Bonus: a prime Sutherland in that recording as well ). Hearing the two divine singers in their prime is to hear two of the greatest singers in the history of bel canto. Sigh...the age of bel canto died with the retirement of the great diva, Dame Joan Sutherland."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad recording","review":"This is truely very sad that Decca chose to release this Ernani which features the decline of two of the greatest singers of our time, Dame Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavorotti. Dame Joan Sutherland, the vocal wonder of our time, the greatest coloratura in history, was near retirement at the time of this recording. She should have retired as the greatest Prima Donna of the twentieth century, but to attempt this dramatic role at the age of 62 was just disastrous. Please refer to Dame Joan's earlier Lucia's, Semiramides, and Puritanis as the true samples of her miraculous voice. Pavorotti fares a little better, but to have heard him in Turandot makes this a disappointment. Yes, the conducting is very good indeed, but we need two different singers for the leading roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ernani to avoid","review":"I had high hopes for this Ernani. This work never gets the attention it deserves, but this recording falls flat. Pavarotti was past his prime in this 1998 effort. Pavarotti fans wishing to hear him nail this part should turn to the Met DVD avaiable on this webcite. Nucci lacks the elegance of a Warren or a Milnes (he too is on the DVD). Joan Sutherland is one of the greatest sopranos ever, but this recording was ill advised. Her sound is a shadow of its former self. I relished the opportunity to hear her Ernani Involami and instead literally crindged. Your money would be better spent on the Opera d'Ora release with Mario DelMonaco and Ettore Bastianini or the DVD mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am dame joan's biggest fan","review":"I am dame Joan's biggest fan. But she is awful here. It's like comparing Elizabeth Taylor's breathtaking beauty in \\"Cat in the hot tin roof\\" to her these days at age 70 as short and fat. There is no comparison. The voice is old, and the trills and scales are no longer there. If you are so die-cast fan to Sutherland that you can deal with this, by all means, get it. But if you're a new opera buff, stay away from this, like the plague. Sutherland is a far greater artist to be degraded by this pathetic performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity!","review":"A wonderful Pavarotti as Ernani, a superb Nucci, an horrid Burchulaadze as Silva and ....Dame Sutherland... at the moment of this recording she was 61 and the voice is always trembling and the beauty voice of the Primadonna is vanished... with another soprano and basso would have been a better opera!!! a missed oppurtunity!Massimo Canini"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sutherland well below her prime","review":"While I am a huge Sutherland fan, i must say I am very disappointed with this recording. Her name draws up images of a huge, soft, brilliant voice, which are not evidenced in this recording because of her age. I have a brilliant recording of her singing \\"Ernani, Ernani, Involami!\\" which I assumed was from this recording, but unfortunately was not. It's hard to imagine giving her two stars, but this recording was very lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downfall of a great Prima Donna","review":"I have to agree with all three of the other reviews regarding the poor vocal condition of Dame Joan in this \\"should not have been release\\" recording. Dame Joan was over 61 here, and her voice a meer shadow of the glorious sound she used to make during her legendary prime years of the 1950's, 1960'and the 1970's. Pavorotti is not much better. Alas, the great diva should have retired after her historic 1985 Convent Garden Lucia's. Instead, many young listeners, hearing the aged diva's voice here, is probably wondering in their mind, what phenomenal voice? The Emperor's New Clothes? To that new generation of opera lovers, I would agree with the critic from San Francisco who suggested everyone to purchase Sutherland's \\"The Art of the Prima Donna\\", and be floored by the most amazing singing on record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good recording","review":"I'm sorry, but I heard this recording at the library, and am stunned! As a Sutherland fan since the early sixties, I can't recognize her voice. She is shaking all the time. And there is a definite beat to all of her sustained notes. Also a fan of Pavorotti's, I'm also shocked at the decline of his voice. I know that these two singers are considered legends of the 20th century, but I don't understand why they continue to sing after they've lost their voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS 'ERNANI' SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RELEASED","review":"There's no sense in going into any great detail here. Sutherland and Pavarotti were two of the greatest operatic giants of this century. Their recordings of \\"Daughter of the Regiment\\", \\"Maria Stuarda\\", \\"I Puritani\\", \\"Traviata\\", \\"Sonnambula\\", \\"Beatrice di Tenda\\", and \\"L'Elisir d'Amore\\" are object lessons in the art of bel canto. But to have attempted an opera as difficult and \\"vocal\\" as \\"Ernani\\" at this point in their respective careers was sheer folly.

So far I have seen books on everything from the iceberg's history to cookbooks taken from Titanic's menus. With that in mind, one should always be careful when selecting a book on the subject.Bonsall's work covers the history of Titanic and her two sisters, Olympic and Brittanic. It is very short, but well written and interesting even to someone with extensive knowledge of the ships. The jacket describes Bonsall as a top historian and the writing would seem to justify this description. I found the chapter on the Titanic inquiry to be especially good.

After all the hype and build up, The Rock was in the event for about 10 minutes.2. No substance whatsoever. Most of the matches were poor, even Taker vs. HHH. 5 minutes of action, 10 minutes of resting, it was a real drag, not to mention the way the WWE over souled both their finishing moves.3. No atmosphere, no crowd energy.4. Backstage segments were increasingly bad for a Wrestlemania event.5. Main event was just awful, it got worse after the Rock showed up.Edge vs Del Rio was ok, but just felt like a RAW! match, the 8 man tag match lasted 1 minute and the rest of the matches were either too short or lacked flare.4.5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst","review":"ok this wm was a joke and i was sooo pissed off whn i sent the org themes for hhh and takers entrances was edited like i took the damn cd out wtf wwe y would u edit out the org theme music for that night yet the chairshot 2 the head of taker wasnt edited out guess the themes were not pg but the chair shot which is suppose 2 be banned that was alright wow wwe is just full of shtt more times than not dont buuy this dvd the show regardless ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good Wrestlemanaia, edited music","review":"There are plenty of reviews for the event so look else where for that, it was good not great.

I could forgive editing the music on the lesser PPV's or on collections but for the biggest event of the year why couldn't they pay the royalties to get the real songs for the event or never use licensed music to begin with. I was going to give it a 3 since the HOF had my favorite wrestler, Shawn Michaels, in it and Wrestlemania had a couple of good matches including Edge's last and possibly Undertaker & Triple H's last but nobody ever reads 3 star reviews. Most people want to see what was good or bad about the item so they'll read the 1's and 5's.

HHH came out to Metallica's \\"From Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and Undertaker came out to a perfect Johnny Cash song that went with his \\"Last Outlaw\\" gimmick. So what does the DVD do? It replaces HHH's music with some generic crap (totally killing what made his entrance so awesome to begin with), and replace Undertaker's with his original theme.Overall the Blu Ray edition is crisp and does the best it can with a mediocre WrestleMania.

Was anything really that good except for HBK/Taker? No. At least this time there was no Kid Rock concert for 10 minutes.You want to talk about bad: Wrestlemania XI. The main event? Anyone remember?

My suggestion is that you start with Ron's latest, \\"Retriever,\\" his best and most satisfying album ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ron Sexsmith sounds like a mix of Kermit the frog, and a man struggling with a speech impediment.

If it doesn't quite get there, hopefully it might come as at least some consolation that (if there were such a place) it would now be No.1 in heaven, and the likes of Buddy Holly, John Lennon, Cole Porter, Roy Orbison and Harry Nilsson would be touring together playing \\"Blue Boy\\" and spreading the gospel about a most remarkable talent named Ron Sexsmith.PS: I don't know what album the two people behind the poor reviews below were listening to.

I'm sure if you listen to it though, you'll quickly understand what I mean. If your not already with Ron's music, you might also want to check out his first, self titled record, which since its release around 5 years ago, has already become a classic, and is simply one of best bodies of music going. His other two are almost just as good. Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Elton John, Paul Simon, Cheryl Crowe and Sarah McClaughlin are some of Rons biggest fans, and it's easy to understand why. Do your heart and mind a favour, break open your piggy bank, and join the club."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Hear Terry Gross and Ron on the web","review":"Dear reader:If you'd like to hear a 30 minute broadcast of Ron talking with Terry Gross on Fresh Air, all you have to do is go to npr.com, do a search for Ron Sexsmith, and you'll be there. It's a great show, all about this album, with him talking about why he wrote the songs, with some live performances.

The price of this leather tie case sure beats what you can get from Brooks Brothers or Coach etc. The product is well made and can hold 3 ties in each half = 6 ties in all. I'm sure you can stuff an additional tie in there if that is what you want. The interior is cloth lined and the ties are secured with 2 elastic bands in each half of the case, secured at one end with snaps. Only gripe (and I am being picky) is that it is a bit narrower than my Coach tie case, so if really broad ties (anything larger than about 4\\" wide)come back in fashion you might be out of luck. Zippers work well and for the price it is a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and it provides a lot of valuable information in an easy to read format.

I was hoping it would be a quick read and full of thoughts I could use to convince others of the benefits of raw food. It does not do that. I agree with another reviewer who said this was an outdated walk down memory lane. There are so many benefits to raw food. Can't someone organize them scientifically and convincingly? This book goes off on many tangents and is completely and utterly unconvincing. It is not a good book for new raw foodists, experienced raw foodists, or those considering raw foodism.

His writing style is fun and easy to read...he keeps it lighthearted and to the point but alot of the info presented was just opinion and not based on scientific evidence which I find disappointing. I know that the raw food diet is not mainstream therefore scientific evidence is probably scarce because of the lack of popularity but I still expected more...so I felt like I didn't really learn anything from this book...he does mention many different authors that deal with diet and what books were worth reading which I guess opens the door to other opinions and allows you to explore the raw food world better but other than that this book was kind of pointless for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like anecdotes, you'll love this book","review":"If not, there's not much useful here.

As a stand-alone novel, though, the extra length isn't justified in supporting the formulaic plot.Not to say that this is a bad book; Pike does a good job of adapting the modern thriller and romance genres to a young teen audience in the same way that a slate of WB tv shows have mastered that sleek package.If you like Pike, you'll probably find this trilogy as good as his other novels. If you don't, this one won't change your mind any. If you're about to give this author your attention for the first time, I would recommend Chain Letter, which is a much better example of how good he can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have to say this is a good book","review":"At first when I started reading it.

And it all ends up being that at the party people that weren't invited showed up and one of them died. I'll let you figure that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"This book's main plot was okay. It is a murder story, and in that aspect, was done pretty well. On the other hand, it had a bunch of superficial characters that weren't developed at all. There was alot of cheesy romance going on in the backround. None of the character relationships were believable or anything like reality. Read this only if you can find nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"{review}","review":"{my thoughts} - This book is about a couple of friends. Alice and Polly two sisters, Jessica, Michael, Sarah and Nick. It begins with two High School having to merge and classmates and friends having their lives turned upside down. It talks about the trial and error of friendships, getting to know one another and learning who you can and cannot trust. The book is mainly about Jessica and Michael but near the end it changes it's focus. This book ends with an odd twist but if you have read {pike} books before it shouldn't come as a huge surprise to you.{reason for reading} - I am a big fan of {christopher pikes} books.

I read the reviews diligently, and several people wrote that this vest would fit over coats worn in the winter time. Yet, to my dismay, when I opened the package and did a trial run over my shirt in the house, it was a snug fit. I am 5'11, 180 pounds. My 5'5 wife tried to put it on over her coat(at least oncoming traffic would see one of us). Nope, it's not big enough. So, I ask who is kidding who, because CLEARLY this will not fit over any average sized persons coat! I question the reviews that said they would.

Some readers may find the stories difficult to read due to frequent gaps in the text that have resulted from damage to the original cuneiform clay tablets, but it is a small price to pay to ensure accuracy and authenticity in the translation of ancient texts over 4000 years old. While all the translations are based on the various Akkadian versions of the stories, it would have been nice to read the Sumerian versions of these stories where they are extant. Each story is preceded with an introduction and historical context followed by copious technical notes. A detailed glossary is also included to assist the reader. A chart showing a timeline of the stories would have been helpful especially when making comparisons to other ancient stories from biblical, Greek, Middle Eastern, and Arabian traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one scholars quote from . . .","review":"A collection of the major Mesopotamian myths translated by a respected scholar. This is an excellent source for those desiring an authoritative translation. Even so, these myths can be somewhat awkward to read given Dalley's use of square brackets to indicate gaps in the text and omission dots to indicate an unknown word or phrase. No doubt these are accepted academic techniques for translating ancient texts, but I do hope someone will come along and render these myths in a more enthralling format. For just such an example of how ancient texts can be made to come alive for the modern reader, see \\"Gilgamesh: A New English Version\\" by Stephen Mitchell .

I was ecstatic to receive this in the mail, then 10 mins later I felt differently, the songs were all covers which wasn't expected (and since the previous game didn't stoop that low) I feel that they shouldn't have made a sequel to such an amazing game, its false advertising. Stick with the first one, unless you like Kidz Bop type music.. and I guess some people do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...could have been Great!","review":"Look. I like the donkey kongas. The first one was great. The second one has been a bit of a letdown. Oh sure it's fun and delivers that but, for instance, in the first game I knew 85% of the songs. I can only recognize 30% of the songs in the new game because the others are just horrible drek I wouldn't listen to to begin with! There were a few surprise songs on there that I was glad to see, but the song that \\"sampled\\" the music from the \\"Young and the Restless\\" is, well, just HORRIBLE! It should have been better; at least better songs to choose from and Nintendo failed to pick those. I still have fun with it irregardless of some of the C\\"rap\\"py music.

Also, it's too small. With such a small quantity of chocolate in the pot (it will hold 12 oz of chips), I would have needed to melt 2 rounds of chips.

The 'MOR Pop' alarm bells have gone off before with some of her work, but with this effort Trisha launches herself into pop/rock territory like never before, assisted by Mark Wright's full-on overblown production! It's not that the songs are bad - it's just the treatment they've been given. Many fans and Trisha herself might think that this is a bold experiment, but I think it's just plain boring. Had she stayed with Garth Fundis as Producer (as on her previous album), kept the strings to a minimum, and gone for a more spare sound, the whole thing could have turned out great. As it is, I've sold my copy and gone back to 'Real Live Woman'- now that's a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit picking on Trisha - she can still bring out the hits!","review":"Yes, I too believe that this new album has more pop to it than country. SO!? It's still Trisha Yearwood! I congratulate her on her trying new music. If she were to follow the same traditional country that all country fans expect then she would be no different than all those teeny bopper pop sensations out there. My favorite albums of Trisha's are Real Live Woman and Everybody Knows, and yes this album doesn't measure up to those two, but it is still a wonderful album, displaying Trisha's excellent talent. She can sing so many different ways, and this album shows it. What's wrong with that!? A true Trisha fan would love all of her albums, because it's her voice and her emotion that you should pay attention to, not the style or type of song she picks to sing! I recommend anyone, country listener or not to go out and buy this album and any other Trisha album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yearwood-better and better","review":"Again Yearwood has made a great album. and she keeps on growing and developing in her style. just as the album she made before this one, Real live Woman, she just keeps getting better and better.

There are too many slow songs on here which could have been done by just about anybody. The title track with Don Henley was just annoying altogether with no feeling or sense of fun - it sounded like they both just did it to record a duet together and nothing else. \\"I Would Have Loved You Anyway\\" is an ok ballad, but it doesn't stand out from similar songs done over the past 5-10 years.If you are looking for travelling music or some uplifting tunes, avoid this album at all costs.

The fact that she goes back and forth from country to rock and back again shouldn't really bother the fans. The fact that she has THE most wonderful voice in country (yes, better than Shania....Faith and so on...) should be the reason people listen to her. Her new cd \\"Inside Out\\" should be no exception. Even though she turns away from country a bit in this cd shouldn't deter new and old fans to her music. Her voice has been the key, with the musical lyrics being the reinforcing factor for her immense popularity. In short folks, enjoy her voice for what it is...not for the lyrics she sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a songwriter and new producer","review":"Big Trisha fan, but this album is in dire need of better songs, and the production is horrible. Some songs sound like there is a 1970 vintage beatbox on it. Some sound like I want to go to sleep. Duet with Rosanne Cash is really good (although you can not hear Rosanne as much as you should - hello production???), and is \\"Would have loved you anyway\\", but the rest of the album is bleeech! Bring back some good songs! Too many slow poor me ballads. Cheer up! She is extremely gifed vocally, but this is like listening to Eddie Van Halen play the Bunny Hop on his guitar. Wasted effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one in over a decade!","review":"I wasn't a big fan of country music until I heard Trisha Yearwood. This is the best trisha cd yet in the 10 years she has been in the music industry. I love the song \\"I Would've Loved You Anyway.\\" She has one of the most beautiful country voices in history. I can play this cd over and over and never get tired. I recommend this cd to any country music lover out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trisha's Style","review":"First off, this CD is beautifully done. As usual. The first two tracks, \\"Love Alone\\" and \\"I Would've Loved You Anyway,\\" are for me the best tracks on the CD-the former almost rocks and the latter is just plain beautiful. \\"For Awhile\\" and \\"Seven Year Ache\\" remind me of \\"Everybody Knows\\"-upbeat song about something not quite so good. And it goes on strong the rest of the CD. Mournful, rocking, or just having fun, Trisha always gets a good mix of songs and comes out with better and better CDs all the time. Keep up the great work, Trisha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flame Dragons of the Korean War","review":"As a fellow former Marine I found this to be a facinating book. Jerry and Jack recorded the first hand accounts of the battles and day to day lives of the men who manned the 9 flame tanks used in the Korean War. They have many facinating stories such as trying to get Luke the Gook routed from his ridge and then attempting to back down an icy and snow covered road after using their napalm and explosive rounds on the target. As often happens in combat and the field, things go wrong, the tank slides down the hill only to be caught by a tree. It takes several days to get the tank out and not only do they have to deal with the weather and terrain, but an enemy dropping hundreds of mortar rounds on their recovery operation.It is one thing to be shot during battle, but the Flame Platoon instilled the fear of being burned alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Author, bitter experience","review":"Finished reading the book, \\"BITTER PERSIMMONS\\" by A.S.

So, when you fail to learn from mistakes, you repeat them, or have them repeated on you. What comes around, goes around or so the saying goes - sorry you were so hurt, but then again, were you sorry you hurt me? I doubt you even noticed you are so wrapped up in yourself.

Also in the mix: Topher Grace as the young store manager secretly in love with Bosworth's Rosalee. The supporting cast includes fine performances from Gary Cole, Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes, and while the plot itself is predictable, the dialogue is quite good.DVD extras include 16 deleted scenes, a gag reel, stills, cast and crew information and production notes.

If you're shopping for your kids, buy them \\"Sixteen Candles\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You have six smiles...\\"","review":"Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! isn't the best romantic comedy but it's good enough. This film stars Kate Bosworth, she plays a Piggy Wiggly employee in West Virginia who enters a contest to win a dream date with her favorite actor, she wins the contest and falls for Tad Hamiltion played by Josh Duhamel. Topher Grace also stars and boy he is such a great and talented actor, his character is secretly in love with Roselee (Bosworth) but she only has eyes for Tad. A love triangle develops and who will Roselee pick after Pete finally declares his love for his childhood friend, guess you have to watch and see. Happy viewing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!","review":"This is a very good movie. It's very sweet and charming and refreshing to finally see a romantic comedy where the leads don't wind up in bed with each other. All the new fresh faces of all the new stars add to the enjoyment. Not quite as good as the director's earlier effort (Legally Blonde) but still funny, sharp, and witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!","review":"When Rosalee wins a date with her favorite actor, Tad Hamilton, her secret admirer and long-time friend Pete is not too thrilled. When Tad pursues her back to West Virginia, Pete is even less thrilled. Tad quickly realizes that he is not the only one who is after Rosalee's affections, and thus a battle of sorts for her affections ensues. Both funny and sweet at times, this movie was very entertaining, even though it was fairly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I usually love the average 'Chick flick'... but this was horribly lame and cheesy.

I watched this movie against my will, and was forced to see it start to finish. To save money, why use lethal injection..jus buy a DVD player and pop in this. Is ten times for cruel than anything humanly possible. I know what they means in the bible where the bible they say \\"and Jesus suffered indescribable torture\\"..funny, I thought this movir came out recently...In a rating of one to four stars, I'd rather be flown into burning hot star than watch this again.

As much as just didn't wasn't all that great.The saving grace of this movie was Topher Grace who is just an amazing gifted actor from Traffic,Ocean Eleven, and so on. Made it worthwhile to see this movie. Not to mention the talented actress who played Kate Bosworth best friend was underuse in this movie. Josh who is great in the series Las Vegas not so in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too clever romantic comedy","review":"When I saw that the movie was from the creators of Legally Blonde, I figured it would be original and hilarious, boy was I wrong. It is so ridiculously predictable, I mean they should have put a twist somewhere in the plot. The plot wasnt even that great. When Topher Grace was trying to show is affection for Kate Bosworth he was being too mean and way too obvious. I mean Kate Bosworth's character had to be stupid not to see that Topher was in love with her. Plus Bosworth's character was quiet annoying. Her hair was bothering me the whole movie, and that whole retainer thing at dinner was such a weird part. I agree with another review who said \\"what 22 year old would wear a retainer let alone take it out on a date with a moviestar\\" let alone on a date with a human, it was gross. I would not recommend this movie , entirely too predictable and too lame to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just So Predictable....","review":"Ok let me get this straight. This is one of the most precdictable movies I have ever seen. Win A Date With Tad Hamilton!, guess what happens? She wins a date with Tad Hamilton. Thats all! Robert Luketic has gone from one of the most funniest and enjoying films (LEGALLY BLONDE) to this crap! The casting is apalling except for her friend (manager of the piggly wiggly). The first date is sooooo boring and pointless and some of the deleted scenes should have been put in (eg when Paris Hilton lands in the pool). This movie has probablly copied every romantic-comedy there is with its OH SO HOLLYWOOD story and ending. Kate Bosworth has talent but none is shown here. If you have found that this review has said nothing well thats whats in the movie NOTHING. Or at least it seems. I REMAIN DISSAPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just watched this boring movie.","review":"This movie was pretty lame. I gave it 1 star but it actually doesn't deserve that!!! It was drawn out, stupid and (yawn) boring!!! Thank god it was just a rental and not a purchase. I will say that Toby from \\"that 70's show\\" was pretty good. and the guy who played Tad was very good looking but that's about it... kate was very average. kinda like another kate (Hudson) who is so over rated too. Oh and look for the guy who plays Tad on a show called \\"Vegas\\" on NBC. That is where I remembered seeing him before this movie. At least on that show he isn't just a pretty boy, he actually acts too. (lol)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Win a Date with Disappointment","review":"I wanted to love this movie. Honestly. But after about 30 minutes of horrid acting and predictable plot lines, I have to be truthful: The movie is awful. And for me to say that about a romantic comedy, that's pretty rare. I just kept wanting Kate Bosworth to loosen up. I wanted to believe one thing she was saying. I got to the point where I didn't care what happened. All I wanted to see was the credits. I'm not sure whether to blame the director, actors, or writer for this poor film, so I'll just blame them all and call it a day. If you want a good romantic comedy. Try Serendipity, Kissing Jessica Stein, or Shallow Hal."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenience","review":"I love not having to chase things up and down the truck bed. Nothing gets banged up or damaged.

You and your spouse will be able to sleep in peace. No, not that kind of bed! A truck bed, silly...This fit in by Chevy C10 stepside just barely (bed width about 48 1/2\\") but I'm glad it did. I have it installed by the tailgate so it will keep grocery bags upright and secure while driving home. It won't damage your bed as long as you install it properly, it has two rubber skids on each end that should wedge in nicely. It was simple to assemble, and has a very nice looking spotted grey metal finish. The pouch will hold small items, but they may come out if you hit a big bump.This is a great solution to organizing your truck bed better!EDIT Apr 8, 2010: The rubber end skids fell off and got lost.

This clip works great for me, it only adds the minimum of bulk to the already large Treo. I've used this clip for several months in a manufacturing environment, and it only dropped the phone once (and I immediately felt the clip get caught and open when it did). I also like the fact that the keyboard and screen face inward to protect them. I have only two minor criticisms. First, I found the belt clip was uncomfortable until I started wearing it upside down (the end of the clip is hooked, so it's never slipped off my belt this way). The second criticism is that the spring loaded clip that secures the phone occasionally contacts the sd card and partially ejects it.

I have the greatest respect for John S. and wish him lots of good fortune from the airing of the original series, as well as for his efforts in making this movie, - however it is one I would not watch more than once. If you've seen all the Dukes of Hazard series and are looking for something more, I would encourage you to check out \\"Moonrunners\\". It was the original movie that the Dukes of Hazard series was later loosely based on. I know some will say I shouldn't be comparing \\"Collier & Co.

There is a lot to admire in this film. Schneider proves that he knows how to direct a scene and he gets the most from his amateur cast (Schneider's family and friends fill many of the rolls). At times the film feels like a very elaborate home movie. There are a couple of truly humorous scenes and Schneider's mother steels the show in her cameo role. There are also a lot of technical flaws that take the viewer out of the action. Let's hope that such a lazy approach is not taken in the next film.

But, not very far below is a story of a protaganist who is deeply wounded: by her upbringing, by her present, by her faith. This book is MUST read for all Anglicans to grapple with how the Church is made apparent to the world and for individuals. It is very relevant in the 'emerging church' discussion. This is a challenging read for any who dare to question themselves and their belief system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Dick in the desert","review":"This is a friend's favorite book, and I tucked into it out of respect for her judgment. She's not the only one -- it seems that many people treasure The Towers.

If disliking his opus disqualifies me in your eyes as a reviewer, fair enough, but Ishmael and Laurie should get together sometime and bore each other to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem","review":"I would love to write a review if the items had ever arrived which they haven't.I found the book in Paris. Captured by its famous opening sentence, I bought it. Then I became amazed at its tone-- whimsical humor and tragedy juxtaposed as they are in life.

Like Wodehouse, MacAuly's character has an eccentric aunt, and unlike wodehouse, owns a camel and is on a mission to bring Anglicanism to Turkish women (as implausible as it sounds).MacAulay weaves between lyrical, humorous, philsophical and plain old top notch travel writing into a delightful story. Was sorry to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's witty and erudite","review":"Macaulay's Towers is clever and generally a joy to read. A familiarity with classical near east history helps but is not absolutely necessary; an appreciation of strains of high church Christian theology is almost essential. I especially liked Aunt Dot, who appears in the bulk of the book. When she takes a sabbatical, I found my attention wandering; the fantastic bits with long camel rides and driving monkeys did not appeal to me. The underlying theme of the book deals with how ones religion is manifested in ones life, and the author's views are sophisticated. Much is made of interplays between traditional Christianity and Islam; evangelical Christianity makes a minor appearance, and a few basic issues of feminism are sprinkled throughout. The book does a fine job in identifying many of the troubles which continue to plague the Levant in the present era. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty insipid","review":"Although book was highly reviewed as a \\"rediscovery,\\" I found the descriptive material too weak and not engaging enough to be a good travel account.

Altogether disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of an old favorite","review":"It's always good to see an old favorite returned to print after many years. This always helps a new generation of readers to enjoy some writing that interested their previous generation. This book is touted as a very funny work, but I didn't think that it was all that humorous, at least to my mind. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the book, because I did, very much. The characters were well-drawn, and the travelogue portion of the work was first-rate. I thought of the book as more of a meditation on religion and its meaning to various people in the story, and I just loved the word pictures that the author painted on almost every page! Humor is in the mind of the beholder, and some of the book was indeed humorous; not in a laugh out loud vein, but rather in a quiet chuckling way. The work shows its age a bit, being almost 50 years old, but that doesn't make any diference in the story line. This is a good book to read, whatever your reason, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit on vehicle it said it would fit on.","review":"In general, I'm sure the product is fine.

As you might expect from a critic who doesn't \\"get\\" the genre, his readings are shallow. M. R. James, for example, is portrayed as merely a skillful purveyor of gore. Worse, Kendrick reads all the works as having the same meaning. In his view, an attachment to such literature is puerile.I did learn a few things from this book--for example, the history of horror in the theater was mostly new to me, and probably will be to many genre addicts.

Intelli Sys recycled like 60% of the content from FE1(7 in jpn)? The only \\"new\\" things here are what you'd already expect in a sequel anyway: a new plot and new character designs.Why would anyone pay full price to play exactly the same game all over again? It boggles the mind. On the pc we have what are called \\"expansion packs\\". This \\"sequel\\" does nothing new what the previous game hasn't already done. And the previous one, which I've reviewed, wasn't that impressive either.In short, go ahead and buy this if you liked the first one and want more of the same.

And while this is great, Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"This was my first Fire Emblem game. Though I had no clue how to play, I learned very quickly. This game is a battling game mixed with a LOT of strategy. There are also three different difficulty levels to challenge more experienced players.The basic game play is sort of a giant chess board. You move your characters around this field and battle enemies. Each battle lasts at least 20 minutes, and there are 20 story battles. The is another feature called Creature Campain, where you battle more monsters and unlock more characters apart from unlockable characters in the story. It's not know as a fact, but in my game, I have maybe 40 different soldiers.The one thing people may not like is that afer beatin the game once, some people may not be encouraged to beat the game a second time.Overall, this game will keep you busy fo awhile, and you'll have fun playing it, but it may not be the game you would like to play over and over again. 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bike for Amatuer Bicyclist","review":"Really great bicycle for an amatuer bicyclist for the price I paid.

When these two collaborate, you'll get music-making of the highest order. That said, I had a bit of trepidation when I first became aware of this recording. I'd heard some of Yo Yo Ma's recordings of transcriptions for the cello from the original violin sonata, and while he always produced exemplary work (after all, he IS Yo Yo Ma), I wasn't convinced that the music survived the transition from violin to cello. Here, in the Franck, Maisky proved to me that this music is just as gorgeous and passionate when played on the cello. The notes tell me that Franck himself did the transcribing, but I'm sure that Mischa Maisky is the reason I was so taken with this recording. Needless to say, the Debussy sonata is also played as if it were the premiere work for the cello literature.

Swallicsh's conducting is very similar to Solti and Nilsson is still in great voice, it's amazing how long her voice lasted but then eveything about her was near miraculous and she sounds almost as good here as on the Solti recording. Everyone else is good to although I think I still prefer either Regina Resnik or Astrid Varnay as Klytamnestra. If you like this opera you should have this in your collection. My only negative comment is the choice of cover art which I think is putting a lot of people off from buying this set.

My biggest regret is that I bought this book and the next one in the series together before reading any of them.

I enjoyed the minor characters, but occasionally got lost because there were quite a few of them. I think fewer surrounding characters would have been better.

I won't get into too many specifics, as other reviewers cover them pretty well. I simply found the story very boring and slow-paced. The entire story seems to be an agonizing buildup to the highly anticipated clash with the wizard lord - a true anti-climax covered very quickly. Very unsatisfying! I also couldn't appreciate any of the characters. This is so uncharacteristic of LWE's other work whose characters normally create a great deal of empathy within the reader.

I actually laughed out loud at the grand finale that the whole book leads up to, which to say was anti-climactic would be grossly overselling it even. Characters constantly restate the obvious, and what little plot there is, when so little happens that you could not possibly forget and the \\"twist\\" could only be surprising to someone that has never read even a children's book before.

There's a beep and a little red light blinks, letting you know it's working. After the alarm sounds, simple flip it over to zero. If you can't get to the alarm, it will turn off on its own.The on/off switch is located on the bottom along with the countdown screen. Unfortunately, the numbers aren't easy to read.

It is really hard to know how much time you have left to finish something. There is a little on on one side, but it is very hard to see and is sideways or upside down depending on which side you place it on. It really needs one on each side.

All the straps on the Burley are still intact, and the inside was still useable for transport. The only problem was the outer covering was getting beat up from being out in the weather all the time.

After hearing her powerful, exciting, clear and beautiful voice sing the title song its hard to come home and have anything but dissapointment when listening to the recording. After seeing the show I'm sad to see someone so talented and far superior... as just a replacement. Maybe the producers will think about capturing her voice in a live recording? Patterson is destined to be the next big thing. I feel this CD hardly portrays the live show. It is over produced and lack luster at times. Mr. Cumpsty is a superior actor, but Jerry Orbach is truely missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Recording Holds a Dim Candle to the Original","review":"Before listening to this album I already had a rosy picture of the flashy new revival version of one of my most sentimental favorites. When I did a production of \\"42nd st\\" it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. With great anticipation I waited for the sounds of over 40 pairs of feet tapping out the rythyms of the opening number. My joy was more than dashed when it sounded like two people tapping lightly on a tin roof! Besides that, old orchestrations are not made better, but worse! Except in the case of \\"Dames- Keep Young and Beautiful\\" which was the splendid point of the recording. There are better song selections in this new version, but they are put together poorly. And even someone who never tapped in their lives could tell that the tap sounds were dangerously off the beat in more than one number. If you want to hear 42nd st at it's best, buy the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Alive The Excitement Of the Show","review":"I bought this CD before I went to see the show on Broadway. At that point, I liked it, but not that much. Seeing the show definitely made it better. I can picture the dancing in my head now. Some of the songs on their own are not the best (although most of the score is great), but after seeing the show, they now contain the magic that the production had.Particularly good is Christine Ebersole's rendition of \\"I Only Have Eyes For You,\\" slowed to ballad-speed, and beautifully but simply accompanied.A very up-beat score, with great orchestrations, great voices, and (mostly) great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to feel good, this is for you","review":"I just returned from New York City where I saw \\"42nd Street\\" at the beautiful Ford Theater for Performing Arts which is ON 42nd Street. What a wonderful energetic show it is, and the music is so joyful and good old fashioned charm. The energy in the dancing and the beauty of the costumes all comes to life again when I listen to the CD. This is a story of love and friends and happy endings, and not a swear word or sex scene in the whole thing.

It seems to me heavy on genes, and somewhat lighter on people and language, so I would not recommend it unless one is interested in the science involved. I also found a persistent mismatch in the amount of explanation given. Some concepts are explained redundantly throughout the book, but other explanations are, in my view, too brief or unclear. I also didn't care for the chatty digressions in some spots, like the introduction to the Chapter 5. The story this author has to tell is a fascinating one, but he hasn't written a very readable book, at least for the layman."},{"rating":"1","title":"No original thought here","review":"While Genes, Peoples and Languages is written in appealing,informal narrative, the engaging chatter fails to disguise that there isn't much original thought here. The information he's dealing with is exciting and ought to provoke speculation and new directions of thought, but the author contents himself with forcing the findings into the same old nineteenth century doctrine we've been laboring with all along. He tells us about the astounding genetic similarities between all peoples,but barely wonders how current thinking, which he reviews, on human evolution and global expansion can be reconciled with the new genetics. I've been hoping for someone to ask, given these findings, Who really are we? What was our past?

One day she absent-mindedly left her tea kettle boiling away on the stove (it became part of the stove). Now if she forgets about the kettle, there isn't any danger of the house burning down as these kettles automatically turn off after the water boils. Which brings me to my gripe with this kettle. The base is so light weight and unstable that it can easily move around when one tries to replace the kettle. The last thing you want is an unstable surface and a kettle full of boiling water.

The commentary by famous comedians is only slightly more tolerable. I did not find anything that the comedians said to be articulate or informative. I thought the DVD would either be funny with comedic experiences or possibly an analytical look at comedy, but it is just a bunch of random bad jokes, clips from stand up routines, and interviews with famous comedians.

Literally, the picture quality of \\"The Pinballs\\" episode is, and I am not exaggerating here, the same as a third generation VHS cassette as if the show were taped off of broadcast television. Without the benefit of cable.The extras are actually worse. The extras consist of still frames from the shows that have been blown up to fill the screen. The images are completely blown out and pixelated. I would have preferred no \\"extras\\" than something this bad.I don't know if it is a blessing that these shows are available at all or if it is just plain insulting that this company is asking people to pay for these horrible reproductions.

I'm no big fan of rats but I met a guy in Russia who loved and studied them (unfortunately he was bitten by a rabid one and died of fever later). He taught me that rats are just animals in the diverse natural world. He lived with thousands of them and they were very lovable. Of course he wasn't the best smelling guy.

The product I recieved is exactly like the picture you see here, but mine (from Target co.) has a green tint to it- which isn't bad, it's still a nice, neutral color.Beware, though: If you have it sitting upright, you'll never get any tissues out without it falling towards you. But hey, you won't get the full awesome effect of it if it's just facing up so, I took some string like the Handy Hundred and taped it to the inside of the hollow if it and then taped the ends of the string to the wall. (I know, but it gets the job done) It also came with some sort of fastening thing to attach it to the wall, but it doesn't work because there's no where to attach it to on the box cover itself.It's lightweight, not very heavy and well made. I really like it and it would look great anywhere.Bottom line: Recommended- but remember to be weary about its whole falling situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tissue box cover","review":"Very unique, Makes a nice gift for the Mailman, Paperboy, Garbage man and boss.A conversation piece for all ages.Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAKES THE FLU A BIT MORE TOLERABLE","review":"I ordered this full knowing from other reviewers (by thew way, thank you ladies and gentlemen) that this tissue-box novelty cover cannot be used in the upright position. It can stand but once you start pulling the next tissue it will topple over.The solution I came up with was to attach a small pin on my bookshelves back panel and tie the top of the box to it with a nylon thread. It works and it is not too much hassle when it comes time to change the tissue box inside; however, it would had been so much easier to simply have an (attachable?) stabilization stand.Also, make sure to remove all the sticky foam from inside the nose when using for the first time. It is there to hold the mock-tissue in place but it will mess-up your tissues if not completely removed.Overall,a fun purchase. If the Easter Island Giants can have a runny nose, who am I to complain, right?RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color not right","review":"This item came from Target and was more bright mossy green than brown.

Starting around 6-8 months, when they can really pay attention to a book, they LOVED opening the flaps to see what noise the animal would make. The pictures are bright, clear photographs of real animals and the pics inside the flaps are different from the ones on the main pages so you get two views of each animal. It's a sturdy book - the flaps that you lift are the same size and thickness of the regular pages so they sure aren't going to tear off after a couple of reads like so many other books. Even so, after four+ years of solid use our book is now in several pieces and our 14 month-old is confused about why her favorite book doesn't work anymore, so we're buying another one!We also have Baby Talk from the same series. It's equally high quality but not as interesting to the kids as the animals in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this ENGLISH?","review":"This band, Coquettish, is clearly a band made up of Japanese members.

Unplugging and resetting the unit took the problem away temporarily, but after two more days of use, noisy calls again.

After using the replacement unit for some months, now two columns of keys on the base unit are inoperative. No relief, even temporary, from resetting.

When the Voice Enhancement is on it is like shouting into a barrel, and with it's off it's more like shouting into a large pail, better, but far from acceptable.

I called Panasonic and they said to unplug & plug the phone back in. This works but I have to do it about every other time I use the speaker. If you return this phone you do NOT get a new phone. You get a refurbished phone. Also you have to go without the base unit until they send you another unlike a lot of companies who send you a new one with a box to return the old phone.

Its a very light hair cream that gives you a messy look without the wet, gelish look. However, in a matter of a few weeks, the appearance and texture of the cream gets pretty dehydrated and hard to get out and rub into your hair. On my first can, I thought it was just me being careless about tightly closing (not easy to do with wet hands.) On my second can, I was nuts about closing it tightly. It didn't make much of a difference. I think this product would do well with a better container, and at the price you are paying, I think its fair to ask for that.

Great show ruined.","review":"After raving to my friends and family about how Damages was the best drama on TV, I finally get to see season 4 on DVD and what do I find: a once-great show cast into the very morass that the US is sick of (and for good reason): Afganistan, Abu Grav (sp), torture, and everything else that Dick Cheney holds so dear. If people are fed up with our involvement in MidEast wars, sickened by waterboarding and other acts that we have punished armies of other countries for, and all the related bullshit, why on earth would we want to pay to see more of it on TV.

I thought the previous 3 seasons were great, but season 4 was so boring.....!Glenn Close is hardly in it at all, and the sub-plot(s) with her little girl's illness and then return of Patty's estranged son seemed unnecessary and tedious. John Goodman gives a great performance but for me , the allure of Damages is watching all Patty's scheming and plotting slowly being revealed and her twisted relationship with Ellen.I was bored by all the flash backs to Afghanistan , and all the repetitive scenes with Sanchez in his cell. Way too much time was spent on this and I just didn't find it interesting enough.Hopefully season 5 sees a return to Patty Hughes at the center of the show!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy story","review":"This series has gone downhill since the first season, which was terrific.

At that time, Aikido was literally all but unheard of, as this was before Seagal Sensei's first film. Larry Reynosa Sensei was already a first disciple of Seagal Sensei, and practicing and teaching a very traditional Japanese art to Americans, so he knew what problems we were experiencing. This book filled those voids very well. To date, I've not come across a better book. It's unfortunate that the book is now out of print, but there are still used copies available. I just purchased another one, because all of mine seem to disappear after students borrow them.:) I'll get ahold of Reynosa Sensei and see if they can make it available in Kindle format. Meanwhile, get yourself a copy and memorize it. Aikido is a wonderful art and way of living. Embrace it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of information... no precise order!","review":"Positive Qualities --- This book does have a lot of interesting information for the time period it talks about.Negative Qualities --- There is no organization to the chapters (if thats what you want to call them) of any kind!!! It's hard to understand everything that happened within these 300 years when the author goes from talking about 1250 to 1113 and back to 1270 within 2 paragraphs. It's also hard to keep track of what year each event happened in. Then he goes from talking about one specific person to talk about a whole new person, but 4 pages later drops the new person and returns to the other person again for a few more pages... NO ORGANIZATION OF ANY KIND!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse toaster oven I ever owned","review":"I agree with everything all the other poor reviews have mentioned. This oven burns everything on the bottom with its uneven heating while the top is still not cooked. The items placed in the back cook MUCH quicker than the front so you have to stand and watch everything as it cooks. Not to mention that this oven gets soooo HOT that you better not touch any part of it of place it close to anything. The door is heavy and falls open and hits the countertop unless you hold on to it all the time. I have used toaster ovens in my home for 25 yrs and this is the worse thing I ever bought.

Contacted Amazon, who gave me sellers phone number. Even though it was still within return period, seller refused return and said I needed to work with Euro Pro to get unit repaired. Called Euro-Pro, who was very nice, but learned I have to pay freight to return -- which considering this unit arrived defective/not working, the idea of paying freight really irked me. I contacted Amazon to file a claim under their A-Z Warranty plan. Bottom line, Amazon said, \\"too bad, so sad\\".

The pictures that the authors did themselves are spetacular! The text is also above average. I however must warn you it is not worth $135.00 which is the book's retail price. The book's length was a huge dissapointment. It is only 208 pages (not 224 as they say in the book description) which includes the table of contents, index, bibliography, etc. The authors did not fill the pages with as many illustrations and text as I would've liked.If I had it to do over again would not pay the retail price for this book.

I was disappointed to see almost half the recipes involved a box cake. I buy cook books to make things home made not via boxed cake mixes.

I will keep buying this. Works from the inside out and much cheaper than buying all kinds of acne products that don't work.

However, the look into life in a sanatorium in the 1930s, when there was no known cure for tb and doctors barely even understood what it was, is certainly an interesting slice of life.Also: I read my uni library version of this book, which was personally inscribed by Betty herself, to \\"Bernice, who has been through this in all its phases -- Love, Betty McDonald\\" The two doctors who the book is dedicated to have also signed the book.

And, the cord is several feet long, probably 10-12. For some this may be a selling point. I probably paid for the phone jack and extra long cord but didn't need it, so, I probably would have gotten a different one.

Having been raised with a dog (golden lab, too!) in the house might have contributed to my enjoyment of the story, but regardless if you had a pet growin' up, it was goodreadin'! I imagine that Owen Wilson did a stellar reenactment of the author in the film (I haven't seen it). I had read this book almost as soon as it was put on the shelves, especially since the story takes place not 20 minutes from where I was living and attending school at the time.

It was humorous and full of mistakes that first time dog owners make. It was sad, and the end made me tear up. Marley is a yellow Labrador Retriever who has what is now called ADHD. However, his owners did not know that. They thought he was just exhuberant and full of zest. Marley promptly became a household terror. He ripped cushions and was scared to death of thunderstorms. He would break out of crates and would jump all over people. He was in a movie for about 2 minutes but was hilarious in that little segment. \\"Marley & Me\\" is truly a story for dog lovers, young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's best friend","review":"Man's best friend has never been showcased so well.

I'm sorry Mr. Grogan, but I have absolutely no interest in the fact that you had a dog that you and your wife couldn't control. What made you think there was a compelling story there is beyond me. As was stated in a review below, this book is more an attempt at an auto-biography than a heartwarming book about a beloved Lab as the publishers would have you believe.If you want to read a great book about a dog and his family, get \\"The Dog Who Wouldn't Be\\" by Farley Mowat. Mutt will definitely steal your heart!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"World's worst dog OWNERS!","review":"This book was very upsetting as the owners of Marley repeatedly show their ignorance and cruelty when they repeatedly abuse him and then they had the nerve to make money from it by writing this book. The Grogans even get to a point where they are inviting friends over to kick poor Marley in hopes of training him not to jump. One day Mrs. Grogan is found beating on him after he did something wrong and had to be pulled off of Marley and on a regular basis Mr. Grogan would choke the dog in hopes of getting him to behave. Even as years and same behavior went on they refused to take the dog for proper training. Why? This is the question that is never answered. When a dog misbehaves it is because of improper or lack of training and not because the dog is bad. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash.

With this in mind, of course, this book is more about Mr. Grogan's family experiences before, during and after the ownership of Marley. Unfortunately for the reader, but probably fortunately for Mr. Grogan, the author's family life is not particularly exciting, either. This book is unlikely to appeal to the non-dog-owner, and quick perusal of the positive reviews here support my claim. Although I do like dogs, Marley and his family do not seem very different from any other dog-owning family out there. Unless you have a Fido in the family, I recommend you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"What a disappointing book. There's no question it will bring back happy memories of bringing a puppy home as well as the heartache of watching an older dog age even more. But this isn't a story about Marley. It's a story about an uninteresting couple who happen to own a dog. If you like watching reality tv and reading blogs you'll probably like reading about the daily lives of a couple of ordinary people. For the rest of us I just don't think their lives are interesting enough to read about.

A sentimental book about his wife, his babies being born and a dog described as the World's Worst Dog in the title, but who actually sounds like a typical Lab. The humor is so mild, I had a hard time finding it. Give this a miss. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah","review":"My Labrador Retriever is cute, too. And was fairly incorrigible for most of her life. However, that is not worth a book. Not even worth an article.This is just more drivel from another self-indulgent baby boomer who managed to find an audience for his self-indulgence. Oh, how the world will be a better place when that Beatle-loving lot march off this mortal coil.Cute Lab, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so bad about Marley","review":"Folks, before you read this book please consider this review. My wife and I nabbed this book expecting it to speak to the relationship we have with our 85 lb. lab/rot mix. Sadly, this book failed to connect with us in any meaningful way. The author, renowned for his writing skills, spends most of the time describing meaningless details about the cost of a rug, the history of laborador retrievers, and numerous other useless items. He fails to depict this animal as bad (at least to a fellow dog owner). Most of this book is about the relationship between two over-expectant, self-centered, middle class Americans who are trying their damnedest to be materialistic. It's apparent that my wife and I possess a quite different value system than this typical American couple. Just a bit of advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD and not a real dog lover....","review":"I had hoped this would be about a great dog lover but it was the average joe dog owner. I read everything .. you won't find me without a book. But i was a bit angry to end up having to hysterically cry at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marley Was Not a Bad Dog","review":"I don't know how John Grogan can classify Marley as the World's Worst Dog. Marley was full of love, life, loyalty and excitement. He wasn't cruel, didn't want to hurt anyone, didn't have a mean bone in his body. He just wanted to serve his owners and be loved! How is that bad???? That being said, the book was ok. I could have done without hearing about Mr. Grogan's insufficiencies in the bedroom. Finally, I know quite a few dogs that go absolutely crazy when there are loud sounds (thunder/booms) - and they are by no means mentally unfit and their owners have NEVER thought that the only way to deal with them was to put them to sleep. that is just ludicrous. Marley was a great dog - I just wish that his owners realized this while he was alive, not while he was dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical bad pet owner book","review":"The first sentance sets the scene \\"labs are calm and good natured\\" I wish everyone in America would get over that miscomception. I am a professional dog trainer, and todays labs are mouthy,pushy, and not good for yuppie families. This week I had a client family with a another nasty lab puppy,, nice family, wish they had some sense and bought a better breed for kids. Poorly written book, lots of dog abuse passed off as training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it really that great?","review":"I dont understand why this book is still on the bestseller list. It is a good book but I really did not think its all that. Maybe its because I am not a dog lover..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious Language!","review":"I only read 80 pages and returned it because the language in it totally turned me off. The author is very descriptive, but TOO DESCRIPTIVE about things that have NOTHING TO DO WITH MARLEY! He talks about gynecological exams, sex, and his dog's sex organs. He even nicknamed his first dog trainer \\"Ms. Dominatrix\\" of all things. For me, a big-time eye roller. I never got how Marley is the world's worst dog because he sounded like any normal puppy, so either this guy is a total novice or he couldn't think of a better title. I never read even half the book, so maybe the dog goes balistic or something by chewing up some more shoes (that's as bad as it got in the first part of it), but it's a warning to potential buyers...go to a book store and read some of it yourself first, then decide if the language is too obnoxious for you. For me, it made me cringe. I couldn't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"This book is a must for anyone who has ever owned a dog. I laughed out loud page after page, identifying with the author's experiences with his best friend. It is a wonderful sory of how much crazy joy our pets can bring us."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll read it again and again","review":"One of the most touching and entertaining books I've read in a while. I couldn't put the book down. John Grogan details and describes his pet's behavior so well and in such a descriptive and funny manner that you can literally envision Marley doing this and doing that, as if he were running around or playing right by you.I will no doubt read this book again. You finish the book feeling that Marley was indeed the greatest dog ever and that he had personally touched you in so many ways. Even if you don't own a dog, you're gauranteed a fanatastic read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The World's Worst Owners.","review":"I can't believe all the positive reactions to this book. The owners were abusive to this dog, never got help from behaviorists, used choke collars, and hit the dog.Then they blamed the dog for his fear.Please don't use these tactics for your dog and abuse is not funny.Marley was just being a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"4 1/2 stars??!! I have to at least do my part to bring down the rating of this book. If you love animals and don't like to read about them being abused then you will not like this book. Also, the book has an excess of extremely boring filler with nothing whatsoever to do with Marlely. The one good thing I can say about Marley's life is thank goodness he wasn't owned by someone even worse than the Grogans. Even though they abused and neglected him, they were nice to him sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably love this book","review":"It's all in the marketing. If this Grogan dude told his publisher he wanted to write a book about what an amazing husband and father he was, how daring to live in a tough neighborhood, how clever to move to the backwoods, and how funny and witty and talented he was, the publisher would have laughed him out of the office. The same book, framed as a story about a misbehaving dog, is welcomed.Most of the American public fell for this too. This book was so poorly written and the language was so stilted and flowery that after about half the book I was just flipping through to get to the inevitable manipulative tear-jerking finish.I have a dog, I like dogs, I like stories about dogs, I just thought this book was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Marley....","review":"I only made it half-through this book because I got so annoyed at how ignorant the Grogans are. To be honest, there are some things in this book, i.e the story were poor Marley was kicked in the chest to \\"teach\\" him not to jump on people, that are plain and simple animal abuse.I really do not understand how true animal lovers could love this book, because it seems quite obvious that the Grogans were not very good pet owners. I don't recommend this book at all. These people made enough money on a book about a dog that could have had a more loving home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's hyped up to be","review":"I was truly disappointed in the book. Yes, there are heart-warming moments and with the predictable ending, of course there were tears. Simply having a heart enables a reader to feel what it's like to live through that fateful moment.Frankly, throughout the book it was tedious as John Grogan tried so hard to use imagery and analagies to make the reader laugh. Over all it was a pitiful attempt at humor. Yes, Marley is clearly endearing and any pet owner can relate to the antics. Still, there were several instances that I was astonished to read how mistreated Marley was. Clearly my heart goes out to Gracie and i can only hope the Grogan family has learned that an animal is not an accessory but a true member of the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read","review":"This is more like a personal history of the author with dog stories weaved in. That being said it is a great book, if you don't like dogs after reading this book then......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr8 book!","review":"I love this book! This book made me really wanting to own a puppy again. My puppy is nothing like Marley except his appetite lol. I would recommend this book to all dog lovers. My only complaint is that the paperback's text was too small and it a bit difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley and Me","review":"This was one of the best books I have read. It made me laugh alot and also cry alot. Having had two dogs,one that reminds me of Marley, and the other one who was the exact opposite, it was very enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"My own dogs could have written a better book","review":"I had heard all the hype about this book and how \\"heart-warming\\" it was, so on a whim, I bought it. I want my money back. I could not get over the fact of how sorry I felt for Marley, having to put up with these people! Being an avid dog lover, I take my dog's care very seriously. I was cringing with the whole \\"if we can take care of a dog, we can take care of a kid!\\" feeling in the beginning, and obviously they couldn't take care of Marley. And I don't care how tired or strained you are, you DO NOT beat your dog and have to be pulled off by your husband. I'm going to admit, I didn't finish the book. I just couldn't. I already wanted those hours back that I had already wasted on it getting to the middle of it. Maybe it got better, but eh, I highly doubt that.I threw it against the wall. That's how much I cared for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed, cried, laughed and cried some more","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for a few reasons. The tone and tempo was light and inviting. The stories told reminded me much of all of the times with my own dogs, the ones in childhood and now my own. I realize the pain they felt losing him and can empathize with many joys and frustrations he had explained so clearly in this book. I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I just wanted to be with my 2 dogs, who-by the way-are in my garage everyday, paintently awainting my return. After all, they are DOGS!Before I read this book, I also read some of the Amazon reviews and when I finished the book, I failed to see why so many people were so upset with Grogan and his family. It seemed like a very light hearted account of a family who loved their dog because he was so crazy-didn't neglect or abuse them. I have 2 dogs now, one who is a crazy spaz and the other who is very mellow. There are perks to both, but we love them just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful Book!","review":"This was probably the best book i have ever read. I did not like to read much before i read this. I was at work and a co-worker gave me the book to read and I could not put it down. I loved being able to relate to his problems with Marley because I have a four-legged one that is a handful. It made me realize that Lily wasn't so bad and she could be worse, and to not pick out only the bad things that my puppy does but the good also. This will make you laugh and cry. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes animals, we are the only one that can understand the bond between a human and an animal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncontrollable Laughter","review":"This book reminded me of my saintly dogs (labs included) and my wacked-out, insane dogs (labs also included). Grogan outrageously captured instances in our (mine and my dog's) lives that didn't seem too funny at the time. As I read this book at the gym, I uncontrollably laughed out loud to the point of tears and curious stares from others. If you are a big dog lover, this book is a must read. I've recommended to all of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Anyone Who Loves Dogs","review":"This is a very touching story about how a dog can absolutely steal your heart. At times hilarious, at others very sad, this is the story about how Marley, a Yellow Lab, came into the authors life and completely turned it into chaos. Any one who has ever loved a dog can relate to how Marley becomes more than just a pet to the Grogans, he becomes a child and a protector. Along the way, he destroys several rooms and pieces of furniture. This book will absolutely make you laugh and cry. Anyone who needs a good laugh will especially love the chapter about Marley's obedience training. I could not stop laughing at the instructor's comeuppance! It is a fast read and will make you wish that it was longer. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"I enjoyed this book. Having raised dogs I could really relate to all the trial and tribulations. Many a good laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you are a dog lover - and are familiar at all with labs - you will love this book. I laughed out loud at the antics of this animal - I own a yellow lab. I cried myself silly at the end of the book. It is very well written, and I would highlyrecommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed the book, anyone that has or has had a dog will certainly relate to many of the situations. I highly recommend it. As a matter of fact, my brother has a lab and I'm going to send it to him to read, I know he'll get a big kick out of it (after my son reads it). All in all a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter and Tears","review":"Have just finished this book and found it enteraining and a real tear jerker - some of Marley's antics are familiar to all dog lovers. I smiled at Marley's effervecent personality and traits which I see in my own lovable dog. I cried all the way throught the last 3 chapters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart warming story of man's best friend","review":"I loved this book and could definitely sympathize with Grogan. I once had a Dalmation who lept from my car and dashed through the doors to the ER. Very well written, touching, and funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog lover's book","review":"This is a enjoyable book for dog lovers. It is thought provoking regarding the true nature of dogs and their thoughts,feelings, and whether they may even have souls. Mr. Grogan writes with style and emotion allowing the reader to laugh at the situations that Marley created. If one has ever had a dog or has a dog, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional heaven","review":"This is one of those books that you just can't put down. John Grogan writes with such honesty and humor, I love his style. Of course, if you own a lab such as myself, you can relate to so much of his story. Even if you don't, it is just a great piece of non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"For any dog lover","review":"John Grogan tells his story with such a familiar ease that you fall into the story like it's your own. If you've ever had a less than perfect dog you can sympathize with Marley's owners. Through his destruction and neurotic behavior you cringe as if it was your couch he destroyed or your necklace that he ate. You laugh at his crazy behavior and you cry when it all becomes too much to handle. I have no higher recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect tears...","review":"This film tugs at the heart strings. All dog lovers should definitely watch it. There are few films that bring tears to my eyes but this is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all pet owners and lovers","review":"I don't normally read books like this, but I just got a new puppy and decided to read it for my girlfriend. I was very pleasantly surprised when I finished Marley and me. It is a must for all dog owners and will truly teach you to appreciate your dog. For me I found some parts to be boring, but for the most part there were parts that made me laugh out loud and reminded me of my puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales Of The World's Worst Dog","review":"My Mom got me this book with the warning that a lot of the content would be familiar ground. The fact is, so many families think they have one of the world's worst pups. But Marley actually had my cocker spaniel beat. Flunking obedience school, tearing the house up after a storm, swallowing romantic keepsakes--the whole round robin of misbehavior. But through it all, Marley becomes family. They get close to him, despite his faults. That's why the ending is so tear jerking. I don't want to spoil it for you, so just suffice it to say you shouldn't finish this book up at work in the break room like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for True Dog Lovers","review":"I read this book a few years ago and at first did see the humor in it, though I do agree with another reviewer here that these people were to dumb to have a dog, especially a lab, well-known for their kind disposition but difficulty with training. My real problem with this book is the ending, and *warning*, this is a spoiler for those who haven't read it yet. After years of putting up with these two idiots as owners, Marley who becomes old and ill (as old animals will do) also becomes inconvenient when the family decides it would like to take a vacation. Yes, they put the dog down because he is now in the way of their fun time - pathetic. I'm not saying that eventually if an animal is in pain decisions like this need to be made, but that was not the case in the book. It's just another example of the throw mentality most humans have when it comes to pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love dogs but bad writing","review":"I kept getting bogged down in the bad writing, but Marley was an awesome dog; wish I'd had him (from across the street)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about the dog.","review":"I thought I was going to read a story about a wonderful, if difficult, loving dog. Turns out Mr. Grogan seems to be more interested in telling us how special HE is. I got bored with his self promotion in the first chapter and quit reading half way through the book. I was not interested in learning any more about what makes his wife and him so much \\"cooler\\" than the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guys are kidding, right???","review":"A best seller??? This book, although fairly cutesy, is so void of substance. Grogan thinks he's much cooler than I would ever describe. What a waste of time... and I am an avid dog-lover! With such obvious embellishments and dramatizations for the sake of the 'idiot masses', I was truly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the hype","review":"John Grogan seems like a nice guy, a good father, and someone you wouldn't mind having as a neighbor. But this book read to me like someone's tedious, overly long, self-involved cocktail party chatter about himself. This guy's life and dog were just not that interesting. I am a lifelong dog lover, but I could barely make it through the whole thing. I just don't get the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrendous typeface & paper","review":"don't know about the content of the book since the readability of the paperback version was so bad I won't abuse my eyes by reading it. I compared the font with those in other paperbacks of the same size and the letters in this book are half the size of others. Very poor quality, drab thin paper with show-through and too little space between lines makes for an overpriced piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book for dog lovers","review":"I loved this book. It was an easy read and made me laugh, cry, and smile. It related very much to my life with my dog and after reading it I didn't feel that he was so terrible after all. It made me appreciate him more. It is a touching story that I would highly recommend to any dog lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good pet is not always well-behaved","review":"This ode to a destructive Labrador Retriever is one of those alternately laugh-out-loud funny and tear-inducing books. As all of us who have pets know, though, you can't have one emotion without the other, since we usually outlive them. It's not just about the dog, either. Grogan bares all in his recounting of his wife's miscarriage, the unpleasant effort to get pregnant again, and her plunge into postpartum depression after a difficult pregnancy with their second child. Fortunately, one day she finally wakes up as her old self, and even Marley is back in her good graces. In one of his better moments, Marley stands sentry while Grogan comforts a young stabbing victim. Mostly, though, it's about Marley's many screw-ups and escapades, and it made me appreciate my cat, whose worst faults are chewing up shoelaces and noisy bathing at ungodly hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"Marley and Me is a story about life and love with the world's worst dog, Marley. It's no wonder why it's popular, it was written to be that way. We are talking bland city. Lots of the stories he tells I find annoying rather than interesting. It's also hard for me to relate to the woes of child rearing, especially the budget crisis involved. Don't complain to me about not being able to afford anything because kids are expensive, I didn't make you have the kids. I can see why my sister enjoyed it, it's very suburban. Apart from being bland and unrelatable, the dialogue is so stiff. He will describe the look that the dog will be giving him, and the context and everything will completely spell out the implication, but he insists on explaining what the look means. It's like he's writing for seventh graders or something. I find it almost condescending. Additionally, I don't really find it very, \\"cute,\\" which I'm sure others do. I find it tedious. Why am I reading this book again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please sort and read all 1-star and 2-star reviews! Wretched book.","review":"Rather than read all the fuzzy-headed blatherings from non-serious unknowledgable people, be aware that this is written by a truly stupid and uncaring man of appalling ignorance about dogs.There was nothing wrong with this dog that a decent owner with some mental discipline couldn't fix real fast. This owner is a self-indulgent fool, and his dog deserved far better. Pitiful book. Despicable man. There is no point in my repeating what has already been written, so read the 1-star and 2-star reviews.DO NOT buy this book as a gift for any seriously informed dog guy. He will be horrified by the mindlessly ignorant ruination of a good dog herein portrayed. As dog books go, you can't do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me laugh until tears rolled down my cheeks","review":"Wonderful true story about a family and a naughty Lab named Marley. This dog was kicked out of obedience school, careened through screen doors, ate everything that he could fit in his mouth, but managed to comfort his people at a difficult time in their marriage. The story made me laugh until tears rolled down my cheeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, poor edition","review":"This is a great book, capturing the complicated relationship between man and dog.

Marley has personality and energy. This book is an easy summer read that is touching and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Lover Loves Book","review":"If you love dogs, if you love human drama or if you just like to laugh than this is the book for you. John Grogan's amazing vocabulary really brings you into the story and makes you feel as though the events are unfolding right in front of you.

The author also reads the book for the cd. He has one of those nasal, effeminate voices, and after 30 minutes, you want to plug up your ears. If they had only gotten a professional to read it, it would have been perfect. Josh Grogan is a good writer, but has a terrible voice! Just get the book, and get another audio cd to pass the time in your car.

Even Howard Stern is now a fan of Marley.John, thanks for helping me to remember that we allow animals into our lives to enrich both lives and to bring joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Rover, Marley is here!","review":"In 4th grade, our teacher read \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\" aloud to us in class. It was a diabolical torture device, designed to break our hearts right in front of our classmates.Well, 20 years later, I read \\"Marley\\" in the privacy of my home and laughed, cried and cried some more.Grogan expertly, perfectly captures the journey dog owners experience with a pet. As the co-owner of two rescue dogs, a springer-pointer mix named Daisy and a parti-colored cocker spaniel named Derby, this book rekindled many memories, and yes, horrors.Grogan isn't pretentious and frankly, his emotionally raw book is at its best when describing the worst times. As the new mom of a one year old, \\"Marley\\" also painted a nice portrait of what life has in store for us.Grogan really crafted a wonderful story that you will devour as quickly as Marley devoured his leash on the movie set. Seriously, folks... it is a great book and I think it is wonderful that Marley lives on in his own special way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Prepared to laugh & cry!","review":"I LOVED this book! Just be careful when driving and listening to this in the car. A book for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley & Me","review":"All I can say is that I know exactly what John Grogan is going through. My year old Chocolate Lab, Zoe, is almost identical to Marley. She tears around our house just for the heck of it, tells you the second she gets her mouth on something she isn't supposed to have so you will chase you around, and her newest 'game' is escaping when we let her outside. She somehow figured out how to get out of her collar AND a harness, both without unbuckling it! We call her 'The Great Dogini!' But for the book, I really enjoyed reading it. Grogan describes Marley's behaviors in such a funny way, but you know he loves Marley. I finished the book at about 12:30 on a Wednesday night (not the best of choices), and I was crying so much I couldn't read the pages! 5 stars all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love?","review":"My husband brought this book home for me as a gift, and I devoured it.

I knew the waterworks were going to be turned on by the end of the book and I was not wrong.As I read the book I could picture myself having Marley run towards me and knocking me down. I have a Golden Retriver that does the same thing to me. But no matter how I look,or how down I feel, that dog LOVES ME, just as Marley loved his family.It makes me wonder how any family can have any great memories without the love of a family pet. Thank you so much to Mr. Grogan for such a wonderful read.Donna K. Reed- Illinois"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain BORING!!!","review":"Forgetting about what you think of the Grogans' pet care style, this is a bad book because it's poorly written and boring as hell after the first 50 pages. It's predictable, too long, and has essentially NO PLOT. Without spoiling what little thread there is, the book is more like a series of diary entries in the 13 years of Marley's life in the Grogan family. The fact that it is a book much more about the Grogans than Marley would be acceptable if it were interesting, but it's NOT.And for heaven's sake, what happened to the editor? This book should have been shorter by a third, if not cut by half. The writing is so overly explicit as if the reader is seriously dumb and can't understand the slightest insinuation.Bottom line: are people so stupid they like this kind of third gread level of writing? Otherwise, if you like good literature, evocative passages, a good plot, and/or complex characterizations, then don't buy this book--because it isn't happening here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the AUDIO CD- Go for the book instead!","review":"Even though I have not read the book, I advise you read it rather than listen to it. The author's voice is whiney, even gratingly so; hard to listen to without cringing at times, especially when he half-heartedly attempts to imitate the Irish woman at the B&B, and various other characters. Even though the story is ok(I am a dog fanatic and like pretty much any story involving dogs) it was hard to get past Grogan's voice. Also, and I assume this is because of the fact it is abridged, there are many overused descriptions, and certainly no wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley & Me-a Must Read for Dog Lovers","review":"If you've ever had a dog, this book is a must read!

These people do not deserve to share there lives with one of these noble creatures. It broke my heart to read how this dog was treated - - and then BLAMED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book in many many ways!!","review":"This book captured my heart instantly. I recently met and instantly fell in love with a energetic yellow lab. As I was telling a friend about him they recommended this book and even though it took a while I finally picked it up and couldn't put it down. Grogan does an amazing job of combining humorous anecdotes about Marley with his family and beliefs. This is an incredible book that will change the way you look at your pets, family, and your priorities in life. Once you've read you'll want to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"Are You stumped on getting a new book? Well, this realistic fiction is the book for you! I just finished Marley and me by John Grogan. This book is about a dog named Marley who is the world's worst dog, who shows how to live life fun and full of love. The book shows even if you're old you can still act like a kid. One time Marley's owners decided to go on vacation without the dog and they gave the dog sitter a three page list of all the stuff Marley needed. When they came back he had forgotten all the tricks he had learned and he had to relearn all the basic tricks. I liked this book because it was full of funny moments and it was an animal story. The author did a good lob painting a mental picture of Marley and his funny ways. If you are an animal lover and love action in your stories this is definitely the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book on Tape","review":"I had this book given to me as a gift and really enjoyed lisening to it so I thought that my Son, Daughter-in-law and Grandchildren would all enjoy it while driving on vacation - they all enjoyed it - so I would say it was a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY - QUICK READ","review":"This book was actually a gift for my 78 year old Mother. My Mother has two dogs of her own and said she enjoyed the storyline a great deal and it made her laugh and cry. She has passed the book on to my daughter who has a chocolate lab with much the same behavioral problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming","review":"I am currently reading this book and loving it. I especially enjoyed the intro about the author's perfect pooch he has as a youth. It reminded me of my childhood dog Sandi, the golden retriever who was the envy of our friends due to her well behavior.This book is so funny it that it seems impossible for it to be true.Marley is by far the worst behaved, although also the most intelligent, dog I have ever heard of.Besides the hilarious antics of the lab are also touching stories about the dog's owners who are devoted to each other and their children. They are a good example of what families should be like.I have recommended Marley and me to several people.It's definitely one of the funniest things I've ever read. I hope the author keeps writing.Another good read of a similar genre is A Dog's Life by Mayle. Gotta check that one out, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT, TIMES FIVE","review":"I find dog stories usually inspirational and a credit to their masters. This story left me flat. Retrievers need room to roam about, and they are social and friendly critters. Marley's life was not usually like that. The Grogans should have taken dog obedience classes as well as a lot of lessons in general parenting. Thank goodness I didn't put out the twenty bucks to be irritated and wanting to give the Grogans some worthwhile tips in raising an animal. A dog-owner friend gave me the book to read - she enjoyed it totally. Dogs are a big responsibility and shouldn't be brought home on a whim. For all that, Grogan is a good writer and I enjoyed his work...maybe this one shouldn't have gone public. PS - I have been a dog-owner for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"Laugh, Cry, Learn about life ! Anyone who has ever had a much loved friend called a dog should read this book. I got it for my wife, she forced me to read it, and now I'm trying to decide who I like well enough to give it to. Perhaps I'll just keep it and read it again every year - its worth it. Brought back my beloved old \\"Lara\\" who once ate the chicken moments before the guests arrived. It's been years and I still grieve for her. Guess a lot of us have been blessed with a Marley. If you have, do yourself a favor - read this book !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me Sob","review":"So many others have already written so much here about the book, I'll just say that, for a dog lover like me, this was a tremendous, wonderful read. And yes, it made me sob like a baby. And I rarely cry from a book (though when I do, it usually has to do with an animal).If you love dogs, read it. You will not be disappointed, I can promise you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Excellent - Excellent","review":"If you are an animal lover you will really enjoy this book - it made me laugh and cry - I read alot and it is very rare when books can do that to me! Must Buy!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All dog friends should be so talented","review":"Any dog owner could write of the escapades in this book, except that not all dog owners can spin their funny anecdotes into a tale as charming as this. That is why dog lovers of all kinds are so taken with this book--because any one who has ever had a pet can identify with so many of the antics of Marley. Even though he is difficult, Marley still gives more than he takes.And while Marley and Me doesn't have the gravitas or literary quality of ,say Shakespeare, there is the universality there that makes good writing so memorable. Marley and Me is about undeserved love--that redemptive quality we all seek even though we don't deserve it. And it will make even the most stoic person give their four-footed friend an extra pat or squeeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply perfect in an imperfect dog sort of way...","review":"I have to say that this is one of the most delightful and heartwarming books I have read in a long while. Anyone who has ever had or loved a Labrador knows that they are terrific dogs but they can have endless energy. Take that tendency to have batteries that won't run down and add in a dog that might just not be \\"quite\\" right and you have a recipe for disaster. John Grogan takes this potential disaster and masterfully turns it into a long and loving relationship with this pooch. Ultimately writing a story that we can all relate to and understand. I laughed, I cried, I had all the emotions in between. As I neared the end of the book I started rationing pages so as not to end it to quickly. If you are an animal person, you really must do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this most hysterical record of the \\"world's worst dog\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"What a sick society we live in when the world's worst dog owner can not only write about his animal neglect and abuse but make a fortune through a nation that lauds his ignorant selfishness as \\"amusing\\" and \\"heart-warming.\\" Oh, and his wife? She repays this dog's love and loyalty with a beating. The text includes very little material about Marley other than his abuse yet drones on and on about how the owners want children. PLEASE DON'T SUPPORT THESE IGNORANT, UTTERLY SELF-ABSORBED, PEOPLE. DON'T BUY THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can relate","review":"I just lost my beloved Golden in November so when I read this over the holidays, I could have sworn it was written about my Cody Jasper.

You know the old saying, \\"there are no bad dogs, just bad people\\"? Well, this could not apply more to the author of this book.The fact that at the end of the book John Grogan actually keeps Marley's \\"chocker chain\\" in his underwear drawer as a way to remember this dog is painfully disturbing to me.Ugh. Don't read this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring, and just plain silly","review":"Sad for the dog it wasn't properly trained from day one. And I, too, could care less about the sex life, pregnancies, blah, blah, blah. Nothing unique from anyone elses life except you let a dog rule you and destroy your home when it could have been avoided with proper training - and unfortunately even that's probably not all that unique. The humor is geared maybe to a 5th grader? Yuk. May you all live happily ever after and since I didn't finish the book I hope you got out of what you referred to as the \\"working class\\" neighborhood, oh horror of horrors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"world's worst and misleading book!","review":"shame on me that i didn't read/listen to this book before allowing my children to listen! always do yourself a favor and thoroughly review materials before introducing them to your children! i thought i did my homework when i reviewed the comments made by others about this book. there wasn't anything that lead me to believe this book inappropriate, so we started to listen. the very beginning was cute and funny. however, the story quickly turns sour. it is peppered w/ insignificant information about premarital sex and other sexual information; discriptive miscarriage and gynecological visits that are at most insignificant. this is grossly an inappropriate read for children. we have cut listening in its entirety. what a miserable disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Get to the Book","review":"This is Exhibit A for why authors should not read their books. Mr. Grogan may be a fine author, but he is not a reader. Beyond his voice, which he cannot help, he reads like a seventh grader in a school play. To indicate spoken words, he merely lifts his tone a half octave and has little inflection. I got this for a long car trip and shut it off after the first tape. I tried again when my daughter got in the car, but she could not take it either, begging me to turn it off.The book may be good, even great, but I will opt to read it rather than force myself to listen to more of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe even the world's worst book...","review":"To be fair, I never finished this book. Who knows? It could have really picked up after page 13.But unless you can deal with \\"Jen-Jen\\" and John's soft-focus romance in \\"the pulsing ethnic stew of South Florida\\" (hey, you CAN get Jamaican Jerk AND cuban coffee there), and Jen-Jen saying naff things like, \\"You're a cutie-wootie-woo, Marley!\\", you won't make it much farther.The dog on the cover, though, is bee-yoo-tiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The love of my life - by JNY","review":"I have always wanted a dog as my companion, but my dad refused.I came upon this wonderful book of Marley & Me, and I was so movedby the crazy & loving acts of Marley. This story has given me greaterunderstanding behind the mind and psychology of our canine friend.This has also given me new reasons to ask my dad for permission ofhaving a dog in the house. And I did, and I made it. So, now mypuppy became the love of my life, just like Marley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley is a must read.","review":"Everyone will truly enjoy this amusing and heartwarming book. Mr. Grogan has the gift of bringing us into his home and making you feel a part of his family. This book is very readable and a great upbeat tale in today's turbulent climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing wrong with the shipping just a really awful story","review":"shipped to me in timely manner, but the story line itself is really badhope the movie did better. won't bother to see it though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous and awful","review":"How anyone could find this a \\"touching\\" or \\"cute\\" story is quite frankly beyond my comprehension. The author obviously has very low opinions of dogs, as \\"lower life forms\\" and repeatedly says he doesn't value them as highly as humans or nearly so. He abused the dog terribly - if I were a neighbor God knows I'd've called the ASPCA on this person. I was upset at the end when he told his kids Marley went to heaven - but explicitly stated himself that he doesn't believe dogs get an afterlife. No, I just can't see the charm. I want my money back - nobody should make money off this story. Would you write a book about how you beat your own child (his wife beats the dog), try to make it sound \\"cute\\" and then profit off the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO BOOK HAS MADE ME LAUGH AS HARD AS I DID WHILE READING IT","review":"I rate a book by how quickly it takes me to read it and how much I ignore the other things going on in my life, and in the case of Marley and Me, how hard I laughed. Gut-wrenching laughter, not a tee-hee. Laughter that brought tears to my eyes. Having said that, I cannot believe there are a couple of negative reviews. My first response is \\"are they living on this planet\\" - who could lack such a sense of humor, empathy and love for this dog after reading this book. The author was brilliant in his descriptions of Marley's subnormal condition (as Evelyn Woodhouse may have described him). For the negative reviewers, I have this comment for you: if this book doesn't warm the cockles of your heart, nothing will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rich off your dead dog!","review":"A \\"true\\" story about two yuppies who buy a dog because they think it will be good \\"training\\" for them when they have kids and it goes from there. The dog is incredibly destructive and seemingly untrainable. I have been around dogs my whole life and never seen one that behaves bad enough to even be comparable to this one. I am normally the worlds biggest sucker for a dog story but I really didn't care for this. The humor seemed a bit forced and while it is always sad when a dog dies the ending seemed contrived. To be honest I think the author loosely based this on reality with the thought of massive book sales and a movie deal in mind from the beginning. For great dog stories I recomend Call of the Wild, White Fang or Where the Red Fern Grows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious animal rescue people find this book disturbing","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of some pet owners in the workplace. The more I read, the more uneasy I became about the story. I felt all along that the Grogans got a dog for all the wrong reasons. As an animal rescuer, I know that they are not unusual. I have very little interest in the Grogans' sex life. I don't care about Mr. Grogan's issues with his own masculinity. I care only that people who get pets treat them well. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and the Grogans were careless, thoughtless people who are inappropriate pet owners. The Grogans would not qualify to adopt a pet from me and most of the rescuers I know. I am also disturbed that my coworkers thought this was such a great book about the joys of owning a dog. Now I am worried about the pets of my coworkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grogan has a way with words & this book was very well written","review":"If I had written this book, or an average author had written it, even with the same experiences Grogan wrote of than it would have been an average read at best. But, Grogan somehow was able to take an expierience that should have been slightly humerous & word it in such a way that made it very funny. There were some instances where I was laughing at the authors own outlook of the situation. The thing going on may not have been that funny but the authors words sure were. Great book & one I will re-read someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Every Dog Lover","review":"Marley & Me made my husband and me relive our life with Duke, our Golden Retriever. His life paralleled Marley's in many respects. The book should prepare any future dog owner, what to be prepared for -good and bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For dog lovers and people lovers alike","review":"This book is not just about a dog, it's also about the inner-workings of a family. As you see Marley the dog grow up and mature (well at least physically), you see John and his wife grow as individuals, a couple, as professionals, and as parents. John Grogan put enough chuckles, tears, and gasps in this book to make it a worthy read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Molly more now.","review":"I have seen the light!

Did people read the same book I did? Where the owners basically abused their dog because he was reacting to THEM not meeeting it's needs? Sorry but it's not a dogs bad behavior if it is not cared for properly or not given enough exercise. They should have gotten a fish. Grogan's wife sounds like a selfish, self centered harpy. She should be ashamed of herself. Disneyworld is more important then a dying animal you claim to love so much. OH and punching the dog because your depressed. If you punch a child, even if you're depressed, it's a crime. To bad it isn't a crime to abuse a dog. Not sure how this translates into a feel good tale.People like the Grogan's make me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! More about human relationships than dog.","review":"I am so disappointed. Why:1. I expected so much from this book based on the amazon reviews.2. This book was composed of around 70% human relationships/wife/baby issues.3. The doggy issues he described were normal, nothing that unusual.4. I was actually mad at him for not understanding some dog behavior. For example, when his dog went deaf, the author did not understand that the reason the dog came for dinner was his sensitive nose, not his ability to hear the owner pounding the floor with his foot.5. The only part of the book I liked was the end, because it made me cry. I only finished the book because I wanted to see if anything unusual ever did happen. It did make me more aware of what to expect when my dog gets older.Overall Conclusion: Boring and somewhat maddening for those of us who are more in touch with dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For All Dog Lovers","review":"This is the story of Marley, an exuberant yellow Labrador retriever and his people John and Jenny Grogen. It is a very well written book and tells of Marley's life from puppyhood to his last days. I laughed and cried (I sobbed uncontrollably at the end of chapter 6). Our family has been blessed with three labs over the years and it was easy to relate to many of Marley's adventures. There was a little more about Grogen's life than I was expecting, but it was interesting and didn't detract from the life of Marley. This is a must read for all dog lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Keeper!!","review":"I bought this book with the intention of reading it, and then trying to sell it on Ebay. That didn't happen!! I put this on my shelf of books to keep. I absolutely loved this book and had a hard time putting it down! It made laugh and made me cry, and brought back memories of dogs I've owned thru the years and their antics. It especially made me think a lot of my beloved lab, Jake, who just went to doggie heaven a few months ago, and made me long for another Lab. This book captured the essence of living with and loving a big old oaf of a dog. I think any dog lover will see bits of their own dogs in this story and should find it an amusing story, especially those who believe that our animals aren't disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring read","review":"Hi. This book seems to get the attention of animal lovers and owners but it probably would appeal more to people who like animals but don't live with them. I'm sure Marley was a wonderful member of the Grogan family but this pooch was sedate compared to tales I could tell you about my own animals. I was hoping for something more engaging and entertaining. I found it difficult to finish (I forced myself) I was left with asking, \\"and then what happened? That's it??\\" I met a woman on vacation who was reading it and I asked her how she liked it - she said, \\"I keep waiting for something interesting to happen.\\" I guess that summed it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"So....????","review":"I am definitely in the minority here, or so it seems, by giving this book so low a rating. Anyone who has ever owned a puppy or dog am sure can relate to what the writer relates. We've gone through it all. And because we have, Grogan adds nothing new or interesting to the saga. This is a humorless, boring, ill-written long essay about nothing new under the sun. What's Grogan's next book: \\"Stoned: The Pet Rock Owner's Manual\\"? \\"Knitting My Way Through Suburbia?\\" I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley and Me","review":"I simply loved this book! I couldn't put it and down and read it nonstop until I finished it. I've never read a book that made me laugh so much.

Reminded me a lot of the book by the British author John Donoghue (Shakespeare My B**t!) and his adventures with his own Labrador called Barney (which also includes the infamous \`10 Commandments of Dog'). Another fantastic dog's tale.... (pun intended!) along with an insight to British humor...(The Office / Benny Hill etc...there are shades of them all here)Will raise a smile as you remember the traits in your own dog and make you laugh at some of the incidents these dogs encounter.Not to be read on the bus or train unless you want strange looks from your fellow travellers as you stifle a giggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop this book","review":"this book is unreadible. it's horrible! i bought it because of the cute cover and i love dogs, but the writing is soooooo bad and the stories of the dog are soooooo ordinary. the author goes way too much into his own boring life that has nothing to do with the dog. the writing is from a newspaper guy from south florida and it feels like it... it's full of cliche's and very flat jokes. it's unbearable. stop this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How NOT to Raise a Dog","review":"A dog dominating his cowed humans.

This dog was not meant to live in a garage and a house with a small yard. If the owners loved this dog as they professed, they would have sold/given him to some one who had a farm or at least lots of land where the hyper dog could notget into so much trouble. The owners thought only of themselves and had noreal feelings for this poor animal who was not the brightest light on the Christmas Tree. To ever assume they could train him to be a \\"house pet\\" was sostupid I can't even think of the words to describe their actions. And if it was notbad enough to keep this poor animal confined, they then bring babies into theworld. Can't imagine how the children will turn out.......hopefully not like either stupid parent. I have read parts of the book and find it to be disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and Boring","review":"Marley was a horrid dog, not a heartwarming story at all, when he finally died, it was a \\"so what took so long\\".I fail to see the wonderful and heartwarming story of this reprobate and fairly rotten dog.This was a major waste of money...and yes, I have dogs, cats and horses...this dog would have been gone in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, another book about a dog...","review":"I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I've always thought that dogs are over-rated. This one is no exception - lots of hype, but where's the beef stick? (To coin a phrase). This family had this dog Marley & it wasn't good at even the usual dog stuff like getting the newspaper, fethcing my slippers or keeping the hamster out of the lard bucket. Pass this one up & get a real dog book like White Fang."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! My heartstrings were broken!","review":"I have never laughed out loud reading a book like I did this one.

Who would have thought that a persistent, inconsistent and incorrigible Labrador retriever could so well capture and summarize all of what is life? Who would have thought that from the eyes of his master ... Marley, the imperfect pet, should be the depiction of what acceptance, loyalty and unconditional love should be all about? Being the best friend and owner of a hyperactive Labrador retriever myself, every anecdote ... every snapshot of the life of Marley seemed like a Youtube capture of my life with the only creature on earth who gave me unwavering love. Who would have thought that a book about a dog should bring tears to my middle-aged eyes and made me realize that indeed ... for all his imperfections, a dog can so well illustrate that life can be so beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lab Lovers Unite!","review":"If you've ever been a guardian to a Labrador Retriever, this book is a must read!

I wonder if they did more research about having kids than they did in selecting a labrador retriever. It's true that labrador retrievers are the most popular dog in the United States. They are also the SECOND MOST EUTHANIZED dog due to idiots like this. So many labs show up at shelters that the sheer numbers cause them to be labeled \\"unadoptable\\", even for many no-kill shelters. People get labs only to \\"discover\\" that they don't have time or patience to take care of them. So they dump them at a shelter and wash their hands of the problem. Have a heart and do a little research before you adopt a pet to find out just how much \\"trouble\\" it will require. If you don't have the time, don't get the pet. Unfortunately, I fear this book will only encourage the popularity of labs and perpetuate the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"I received this book on Friday and had it finished by Saturday night...being an avid dog lover, I found myself relating to the author in quite a few of Marley's antics. Like many readers, I laughed and I cried and it brought back many memories of when I had to put my own lab down due to health problems brought on by 'backyard in-breeding'. (and yes, my next dog was a 6 year old rescue form the Humane Society)One thing I truly don't understand of the author -- if you love your dog so much, why would you put him through YEARS of being barely able to walk? Just because they don't hold up a sign that says \\"HEY MISTER - THIS HURTS\\" doesn't mean they aren't in pain. I see that as a selfish owner who needs to think of what is best for the animal and not himself. Like many readers agree, poor Marley should have been put down long before he was. That's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggie Hijinks to the Max","review":"Marley & Me is one of the funniest true stories I've read in a long while!! Grogan's descriptions put the reader right there! My first \\"child\\" was a Golden Retriever named Kelsey who lived to be 15 and a half; she would have been a great partner in crime for Marley. I laughed until I cried at many of Marley's shenanigans and just what the Grogan's went through \\"raising\\" this big baby. I am also aware of who was the real boss of their home. Hilarious! I could completely picture every event and I know all too well how much Marley meant to them and how they loved him no matter what the costs. I was still laughing and crying as I read the last word. Excellent book - especially for those of us who believe our pets are human at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few laughs","review":"This was recommended to me and I thought, \\"okay, why not?\\" Now I know why not....a few chuckles and that is all.

Marley reminded me of so many of the antics I've lived through. The special relationship between a dog and his family is lovingly captured in the pages of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely memoir of of a dog","review":"\\"Marley & Me\\" is a sweet, funny, sad, and warm memoir of a beloved family dog which was also untrainable, undisciplined and out of control. Any dog owner can identify with any or all of the quirks and behaviors John Grogan ascribes to Marley, yet the author clearly loved his dog, warts and all. That is a hard thing to do.Equally hard is hanging in there with a dog with so many issues. Shelters around the country are sadly overpopulated with dogs whose owners gave up on them. Grogan and his family stuck with Marley because, even with his behavioral problems, he was a loyal friend.Grogan writes in the vein of that other stellar dog memoir, \\"My Dog Skip,\\" by Willie Morris. As a long-time dog lover, I now rank \\"Marley\\" a solid second behind \\"Skip.\\" Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for quck reading","review":"Light reading,good book, sometimes very funny, sometimes very sad.

The dog is so funny espesically when they got kicked out of dog obediense classes( it's funny becouse we took our dog to classes and she was bad). The book is funny and heartwarming.

A definite favorite for the library!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"As an avid dog-lover (who may sound fanatical, but I am not), this book bothered me for a couple of reasons. First, Mr. Grogan says how much he loved Marley.....but on the other hand, his wife and kids left for Boston and they took a family vacation when Marley was on death's door. I have trouble leaving my dogs enough......but they mean enough to not to me to not drop them off at the vets for a week when they are very ill. Also, you keep on saying \\"just a dog\\"....well my faithful companions are a true member of the family and would never be referred to as \\"just a dog\\" when referring to me emotions. Try reading \\"The New Work of Dogs\\"....that is a book truly for dog lovers. I questions the motivation for this book....was it for money or a tribute to your faithful friend. Also, I thought it was inappropriate to call Mr. Rodale \\"eccentric\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, simply awful","review":"All I can say is don't buy this book. My feelings echo the others rating this one star (I'd give it no star if I could). What I cannot understand is how this book got to be a best seller. No true dog lover that I know liked this book. It's a good example of bad dog owners who truly failed their dog.The end got me the angriest. And why did the author continue to leave a choke chain on this old, arthritic dog (even tugging it as he brought him to the vet the last time)?If you want to read a book about the love and bond possible with a dog, read Merle's Door by Ted Kerasote. While I don't agree with everything Ted did with Merle, he truly loved this dog...He wasn't 'just a dog', he was his friend.I'm even angrier at myself for buying this book and helping Grogan profit from poor Marley."},{"rating":"1","title":"How NOT to Treat a Dog","review":"I agree with so many others who were disturbed by this book. Is Mr. Grogan an educated man? Really? He didn't even consider neutering Marley until the vet told him he should and even then he was reluctant. With millions of unwanted dogs wasting away in animal shelters, why on earth would anyone be reluctant to neuter their dog?He stated that he liked this vet because he believed the man \\"maintained a healthy sensibility about a dog's role in the human world.\\" Huh? You mean like being locked up in a garage all day alone? Is that a dog's \\"role\\"?I believe that many Americans - like Grogan - think they love dogs when really they see them more as a form of entertainment. They are living, breathing creatures equal to human beings in the suffering (and joy) that they can feel.Grogan exaggerates Marley's \\"bad\\" behavior for laughs, but when you look at how Marley was mistreated in so many instances, there's nothing funny about it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'd love this book!","review":"I bought this book for my husband as a gift, after having heard about it from a friend of mine. We have a 16 month old yellow lab mix and Marley's pictures inside sometimes looks like our little Oscar! The book has made us laugh out loud so many times as we could relate to our 'adventures' with Oscar. I would recommend this book for anyone with a dog or love for dogs! We've only read 1/2 the book, and can't wait to finish up. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy and Me","review":"I loved this book. Marley reminded me a lot of my Sammy who I lost last August. He was also afraid of storms and fireworks going ballistic just like Marley. He and his sister, Susie were always into the garbage so it had to be put away when we went out. He tore up curtains and blinds, walls and doors. He broke out of kennels/crates. We even sent him to doggy daycare when my husband was still working. I love him dearly anyway.

There have been days that I thought I was the only one in the world with this crazy dog and then I read Marley & Me. This book made me laugh and cry harder then anything I have ever read.

Could be shared with your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marley and Me not really a good \\"dog tale\\"","review":"Surely no one can resist the picture of the cute puppy on the book cover. Reader beware, this is not really a warm and fuzzy dog story. While Mr. Grogan is a talented writer, dog lovers may feel a bit cheated reading Marley&Me. It seems the author was more intent about writing his own memoirs than writing a tribute to his beloved dog. Many of the stories regarding Marley are merely typical experiences any dog owner has shared. If you are looking for a more sincere and heartwarming dog tale, read \\"Amazing Gracie\\":A Dog's Tale written by the owners of Three Dog Bakery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel Humans","review":"Terrible book. I wish I had not read it! This book is not about dogs, but about the life of a mean-spirited, self centered, materialistic couple. J. Grogan knows absolutely nothing about dogs. Marley deserved love and understanding. He was a typical Lab. They are full of fun. Marley needed puppytraining. Instead Grogan used cruel abusive methods, read page 144-145, beatings!!!Marley lived a long life, but in the final years he was in so much pain, he cried trying to get up and lie down. Grogan writes that he had not realized Marley's hips were that bad. Wouldn't the crying have been an indication to bring the dog to the Vet?And do you leave a dying dog at a kennel and go to Disneyland?This is the worst human possible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dog Lover's Delight","review":"I stumbled upon this book in the bookstore and was hesitant in buying it. Afterall, what kind of book is this for a mid 40's sports junkie? I've got to tell you, Marley & Me is exactly what I needed. It's about an adventure with mans best friend -- his dog and the development of life itself. From getting married, to choosing a puppy, to having kids, to career changes to watching your \\"best friend\\" get old. Marley & Me touches on all of this with the dog being the subject. Marley & Me is a fun and fast reading novel. It is easy to read and expertly captures the emotions of the dog owners. If you looking for some light reading reading this holiday season and a book guaranteed to put a smile on your face and possibly a tear in your eye -- then read Marley & Me. It surely makes me appreciate my two cocker spaniels that much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial trifle of a book","review":"since a less than one star review is not allowed, this book gets the single star for the cute cover picture of the dog. that's the only redeeming quality this paltry, overrated book has. this book is touted as being ideal for dog lovers which is nonsense since no love of dogs is displayed anywhere in the book. the biography is really about a family of boring mediocrities who just happen to own a dog. the dog crops up in the story once in a while when it does something grogan or his wife are displeased with and one gets the impression that marley is nothing but a frustrating burden to them. after reading half of this book i was convinced grogan was incapable of having a loving relationship with marley or any other dog and felt angry at being taken in by all the brain dead, extravagant, gushing reviews here. check this one out at the library if you must read it and save yourself the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book!!!","review":"I could not put this book down.

This is a must have book not just for lab lovers but all dog lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a dog!","review":"I have had dogs all of my life and think they are one of God's greatest gifts. When I began reading this book, my first thought was \\"Why would anyone keep a dog like that?\\" But as I read on, I too fell in love with Marley. It does take a certain kind of person or family, to love a dog as wild as Marley, that's for sure. As far as the book, it is very well written and one of those gems I wish I'd written myself. Marley's story is one that so many of us have lived through. Even though all of our dogs are unique beings,there's an underlying current that dog lovers know and share. Everyone has a story to tell and this was told very well. I thought I'd stop before I reached the end of Marley's life because I knew basically what to expect, but I couldn't..and yes I cried my eyes out, partly for Marley and partly for my own losses.I do recommend this book not only because of the wonderful dog \\"tails\\" but also because it is well written and brings Marley directly into your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated Book","review":"I have just finished this book and found it to be a predictablecliche.

It's just a fun read about life with a dog. A dog that I don't know that I could have tollerated as well as this family.I laughed out loud more than once reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who has a dog or plans to buy one soon. It will either steer you clear of buying one, or help you make a more informed decision.What I liked is how the author related life and how we either embrace it and enjoy it or lose it, to the life of this happy go lucky dog. Life is short and Marley teaches us that. It's not just a story of a dog and it's family. It's much more.If you looking for amazing literature, then you may be in the wrong place. If your looking for a light read, with a poignent message and a few laughs...this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"I purchased this book on a whim but I'm sure glad that I did. Marley & Me is a heartfelt and honest story that will leave you touched. I laughed, I cried (don't read the first few pages or the last hundred around others if you don't want them to see you tear!) and I remembered my own beloved pets from days gone by. Even if dogs are not your \\"thing\\" Mr. Grogans writing alone is worth the read. He gives tons of detail and you can't help but feel like you are there, standing by, as an onlooker into the wonderful life of Marley and his family. If you want to see examples of Mr. Grogan's great writing go to [...] and look up his column in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Again, I loved this book and I'm sure you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuppie \\"practice baby\\"","review":"I felt bad for the dog, especially the way he spent his last days.

I will henceforth be wary and watching carefully whatI purchase here after a long time of being completely satisfied.I think Amazon could have noted this small print edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Having raised several Labradors from puppyhood to senescence, I was quite taken by Marley's hilarious and ultimately tragic tale. Grogan perfectly describes the incredible stubbornness and insanity of a Labrador's temperament. As for the rest of the book: I'm sure in the author's mind, the story of the his marriage/family/career is inseparable from the story of his dog, but... it was totally self-absorbed and utterly banal. His thoughts on mortality and the legacy of 9/11 were one of the most trite, sentimental, unoriginal things I have ever read. He'd do well writing for the NYPost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even non-dog owners will love this book","review":"Let me start by saying I'm not a dog owner. I'm not even particularly an animal lover -- or even liker. But I had to read this book just to keep pace with the rest of the American culture. And I am glad I did.Grogan paints a picture of his family's relationship with his incorrigible curr, Marley, that goes beyond mere pet ownership. Through trials and tribulations, Marley forges an irrevocable place in the hearts of the Grogan family the same way he ripped through their carpet, floors, drywalls, and socks. You couldn't help but love this incredible dog that seemed to be more angel than canine in a furry body.Anyone who's ever owned a dog and felt that indelible paw mark on his or her heart will identify with Grogan, and I challenge even the most dedicated dog disliker to read the final chapters without shedding a tear -- or a bucketful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh until you Cry","review":"I read Marly & Me just because I love my own dog, even though she's not a lab. Mr. Grogan made me laugh outloud so many times, in this book. With that, I also knew I'd probably end up crying outloud too, which I did. To live with, care for, and love a dog, even one as unique as Marley, was so poignantly portrayed in this book. I was deeply touched. Wonderful, wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me entertained the whole way","review":"I loved this book because it made me laugh out loud in the beginning, this is a normal guy using humor to retell the funny adventures he had when this dog was a puppy. Theres one part that will have you rolling, when the dog eats an expensive peice of jewlery and the owner searches for it when it comes out the other end. I laughed out loud at all of Marley's antics.Then when he gets older, you feel so sad. Howard Stern actually reccommended this book on his show and said he read it on the plane and he was crying like a baby. I figured if a book could have such an impact on Howard that its worth checking out. I too was cring like a baby, I'm talking tears streaming down my face, eyes red, the whole thing.Its true what some of the people are saying down below about some of the owners tactics, I did feel bad when the owners went to Disney when Marley was sick, but he still was a great owner, and the book shows that he is. See for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for animal lovers.","review":"You never know what you're going to get with a dog or a book, and this was no exception. When my friend saw this book in my car she immediately advised me against reading it. She claimed it was \\"Too sad.\\" This book wasn't sad, it was a true celebration of life. From the viewpoint of someone cursed with horrible (but lovable) family pets, everything Grogan wrote was perfectly on point. A great read for anyone, this book will be truly appreciated by an animal lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"this book was really good! i did it for a book report and i couldn't put the book down.

Petey was a stray we found who's owner would not claim him. We had surgery done on him several years ago for a herniated disk (which he bounced back from) and he had several happy, healthy years with us, still having to make the final decision to \\"put him down\\" was a killer. Marley really touched me and his owner captured the true essence of a dog's undying love for their owner (and vice versa in most cases). They can really win over your heart. I highly recommend this for all dog owners and potential dog owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book.","review":"I purchased this cd book for a friend who has a \\"naughty\\" yellow lab just like Marley.

I had no idea I'd be so moved by the relationship between Grogan and his lab.Plenty has already been said about this book, but perhaps not enough on Grogan's style. Yes, Marley was a wonderfully flawed dog with enough personality to fill five books. But the joy of this book is Grogan's wit and writing style. There are other Marleys out there, but there's only one John Grogan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley & Me","review":"I'm a dog lover and like to read books about people and their relationships with dogs.

It describes how much emotion we animal lovers go through from hole digging, shoe chewing and then when pets get ill and need expensive life saving medical care. While I may have disagreed with the way The Grogan's made decisions about Marley, in the end it was well worth the read for anyone who loves a well written story with heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written book about the Grogan Family, and how they know very little about dog ownership","review":"After reading this book I came to the following conclusions:-John Grogon is a great writer. He managed to \\"keep my attention\\" through a book that is really about his wife and dog-The fact that he admitted to some of the \\"training\\" techniques he used on this dog tells me that he has STILL not invested time into learning how to bring up a dog.-The overall ratings of this book prove that most dog owners are just as clueless as the Grogans.With all that said, I do understand that he loved his dog and I admire him for writing a book about him.When I became a first time dog owner,I bought 3 dog training books, 2 medical books for dogs, 1 book on the breed and signed up for training classes. It is very obvious that the Grogons did not take dog ownership this seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story","review":"Well written and a MUST READ for dog lovers.

He's well within one standard deviation of the norm for male American Labs.The author, on the other hand, is a columnist for a regional (read \\"not major\\") Florida newspaper. Three times a week, he has to troll his trivial life for 250 words, and viola! We have \\"Marley and Me\\". You get intimate details of his marriage and efforts at home decor along with his rabid recounting of every time his dog ate poop. Trust me. If you found yourself trapped in a corner with this guy at a cocktail party, you'd suddenly realize you need to run out and check whether you rolled your car windows up.Marley was a nice and worthy dog. There are lots of nice dogs. Fortunately, most of their owners are not provincial hacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book you'll read all year!","review":"Marley and Me is, in a manner of speaking, a coming-of-age story. I laughed out loud, giggled, laughed til I cried, and then cried til I had to laugh at that crazy dog again. Marley and Me is written from the heart of his owner, John Grogan. A heart-warming and delightful tribute that is written with love for man's best friend, who he obviously was. After reading this book, I have hugged and loved on my dog even more. This book definitely inspires us to love our four-legged friends with all the love they unconditionally deserve. I guarentee you will LOVE this book!Sue"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful example of animal abuse","review":"I cannot believe this book was a number one bestseller. The techniques used by Grogan and his idiot wife are downright abusive. This is a case of two selfish people who got a dog to fulfill their own needs. Worst of all they didn't do breed research and got a Lab, a dog that is high energy and needs a great deal of activity and exercise. The dumbasses then proceed to lock the poor thing in the garage and are surprised when the dog becomes neurotic and destructive. Locking an animal in a garage all day is cruel and inhumane treatment. It made me sick to hear Grogan describe kneeing the dog in the chest, using a choke chain til the poor thing gagged and finding his wife beating the dog with her fists. All those idiots had to do was start with basic obedience training from day one and give the poor dog the exercise it needed. Marley deserved a lot better, I hope he's in a better place now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read with a full box of tissue!!!","review":"The book was a fabulous read.

A New York Times bestseller, Marley & Me, written by John Grogan is fantastic. When John was just a boy, he had the most amazing dog ever. Now he is a grown man with a young wife. Wanting a baby, they are not sure they are ready. So they decide to get a puppy, Marley. That was probably the worst decision, but in other ways it was the best.I enjoyed this book so much. I just couldn't put it down. This book is full of joyfulness, love, and man is it crazy! Like when the Grogan's try to put Marley in dog training school, well that was not the best idea. Marley got kicked out!I would recommend this book to middle school students and animal lovers of all kinds. I would even suggest this book to adults. It is for anyone who is in the mood for a good laugh. Not only is it interesting and funny, but it also shows that a wondorously neurotic dog can change a family's life forever.-Lauren Price-"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised . . .","review":"This memoir by a newspaper columnist of his life--from his time as a newlywed to his time as a father of three--with the \\"worst dog in the world,\\" the family Labrador, is exactly what you would expect.

To say I'm an animal lover is the textbook understatement of the century, so I buy anything and everything that involves a critter of any kind.John Grogan's exceptional story is one to which almost any animal lover with be able to relate. When he says a dog does not care if you're rich or poor, clever or dumb, etc., he speaks the truth. \\"Give him your heart and he'll give you his,\\" applies not only to dogs, but to just about every animal I've ever encountered.I can't wait for the DVD. After reading the book, I had to see the movie. It did not disappoint, either. When it was over, I couldn't leave my seat for ten minutes afterward. I couldn't stop crying.

This book is a quick and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful surprise","review":"I laughed, I cried, then I cried again reading this book. I must admit to a bit of apprehension when I first saw the book, having recently read some pretty poor books about dogs, but this was a wonderful surprise. Although I do not own Labradors, I could readily relate to the antics of Marley, as our own dogs are equally creative in finding ways to test us every day. Anyone who has gotten a dog for the first time can't help but relate to John Grogan's innocence at the beginning of his experience, and I'm sure can relate to his feelingly rendered parting with a best friend. I have recommended this book to several fellow dog lovers already."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Overrated* would be too large of a compliment","review":"Let me first say that this book had its touching moments, especially if you had or have a dog. You can relate to the happiness and sadness that a dog brings to your life.

I thought that it would be just another cute dog movie. So I saw it. But it was better than that. Once I finally got around to reading the book, I realized that the movie was just skimming the surface of the life of a lovable but unruly dog named Marley. Now that I'm a dog owner, I can see what Grogan went through, except he hadit waaaaaay worse. Five stars for a lovable story about a golden named Marley, a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"I saw the movie first but I think I like the book better, it was enjoying to read the full story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog","review":"Marley and Me: Life and Love was a very good book that is about the love between a Dog named Marley, and his owner John. John starts off as a writer for a newspaper who is making low income. When thinking about whether or not to \\"Try for a baby\\" a friend suggests that they instead get a dog. Marley in fact. Marley not only is a loving companion, but he completely turns John's life around. Marley is one of the most misbehaved dogs that I have ever heard in my entire life. Some of the things Marley does is just hilarious while others are just down right crazy! The suspense of constant the \\"What Marley is going to do next?\\" question was keeping me reading. Marley's mishaps gave John something to write about which eventually gets him up to great paying job. But will having Marley help or hurt the family? Well, I guess you are just going to have to find out when you read the \\"Biography\\" about a man and his best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I bought this book for my husband for Valentine's Day.

I'm going to read it when he's finished reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This book had me crying (mostly from laughter, but also some sad moments). I've shared a home with three dogs in my lifetime and I could really relate to a lot of Marley's antics. Dogs can be expensive and a lot of work but what they give us in return is two-fold. They are the most loyal, forgiving, and loving creatures. Anyone who has ever adopted a dog knows this and should read this wonderful book. Thanks for writing it John Grogan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Works Cited Page","review":"While this book was intriguing, I find its credibility lacking. A lot of what Greer says seems to be made up off the top of his head. While he could be accurate, he really needs to go into more depth about how he found his information instead of assuming we already know his sources. The closest he comes to a works cited page in this book is a further reading page, which really doesn't help his book at all.An interesting book.

The example programs (the list class especially) do not compile without the reader revising the code quite a bit. As a textbook, the start of the book is quite a good one. It is good how the author describes how you can implement data structures using the boiled-down versions of the STL classes. However, this method breaks down soon as the author moves into more complex data structures: trees, sets, etc. The book tends to spend more time dealing with explaining how you can widdle around in STL than to delve into the basis and use of the fundamental data structures. If you are looking for a good reference on how to program using the STL, look elsewhere. Much of the book deals with the author's version of the STL than the (Un-?)Standard Template Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good!","review":"This book did provide some usefull expamples of C++ STL, but overall it is the worst C++ book I have ever read!

Particularly penetrating is his \\"excursus on influence\\", in which he argues that participants in an artistic tradition shape and change how their predecessors are understood.

Baxandall begins by developing a scheme for the explanation of concrete historical objects in general.He takes the Forth bridge in Scotland. Baxandall, more than it makes it beautiful, he shows you that it really is beautiful. But wait, there's more. He takes Picasso's Kahweiler and shows it to you as beautiful, and damn well you believe it.Baxandall shows us how to interpret art.But he claims modesty: he is a historian, he says, and is only offering one method of many to think about pictures. I think this is the only place where he has gone wrong. After going through his method of understanding art, you will know there are no others. All the other ones are wrong.

You really kind of have to be there and feel the drums, as opposed to simply hear them. That being said, there are many great taiko recordings, and it is nice to hear one that sounds different and distinctive. This album, originally released in 2002, is from a tradition-oriented group from Hokkaido who prominently feature flute melodies as well as drums. Indeed, the flute is often the lead and while this may vex listeners who expect thunderous percussion, it is in keeping with many traditional taiko songs.

I can only say that I will never trust the amazon recommendations again. This album starts off strong with Paramont, the only good song on the album. After that it quickly fizzles. None of the other songs are memorable. And the lyrics are trite, mundane and boring. Most of the chorus' are sappy and forgettable. For example, the lyrics of the 2nd track are: \\"Sooner or later, I think you're going to find out, we should be together now, Sooner or later, I know you're going to find out, might as well be right now.\\" Yawn. This band wants to be 3 Doors Down, but they are apparently too influenced by bad 90's bands which were themselves too influenced by bad 80's bands. This is especially true with track numbers 8 and 9.

When I can't stand flipping through the radio stations any longer, I know that I can count on \\"Trip to the 13th\\" to give me great songs.

The Bliss boys are doing what they love and doing it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent alternative record!!","review":"Bliss 66's record, Trip to the 13th, is one of the finest alt/rock records released in recent years. On one hand, it's an excellent deviation for those who despise the \\"retro-rock\\" movement (The Darkness, Jet, The Vines, etc.). On the other hand, it reaffirms the fact that alt/rock can be both melodic and catchy, and edgy at the same time. Songs such as Defense, Paramont, and If We Could reflect this. If you're the type who's looking for a \\"middle-ground\\" between hard, crunching rock acts and jamming mainstream acts, Bliss 66 is the band to catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise","review":"On track 8 lead singer states \\"It's not quite paradise\\", however this cd is just that, paradise. The opening track has a hook that will have you humming along by the second time it rolls along. Sooner or Later shows of the gust of the band. Songwriting has finally came around to rock again. It is about time that a band with qulaity musicians can actually right meaningful quality songs, with infinte melodic hooks. My personal favorite is Defense. This somber track starts of with a simple piano riff which the song continues to build around. Once the whole band is chimed in power anthem has been re-born. Amazing Cd.

If yopu want to understand, to have a clear view, and then decide and may be judge Opus Dei, better forget the lies and uncorrect thesis that this book try to present as truth. One's perception is strongly distorted by one's own beliefs: this is the comment that any reader of the hugly book can make. The author just want to prove is personal vision of Opus Dei and he just look for everything that can prove his own position. This is how this book has been built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparative Political Science For What It Is Worth.","review":"I did not read this book because I thought it would be fun, but rather was forced to read this book because it was supposed to be an exemplar of comparative politics. The idea is that comparative political science is not as rigorous as other portions of the discipline, and that this book disproves that fact. Well, I do not agree because Moore's evidence is skewed, even though the comparative method that is used is useful in illustrating differences between units of analysis. The method is nice in that Moore finds differences between different countries and then illustrated how these differences matter or where brought about. Like I said before, I disagree with some of the evidence used, but not the method. It is a dense book, but not all that bad for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complementary readings to Moore's interesting book","review":"There are already several fine reviews, so I will only add that Moore's is a masterful work, which, in my opinion, is enlightening. Perhaps, because of the author's style, the book is no very engaging, but it is not dry either. In any event I think that the professional historian and the educated layperson alike can savour it. So I add my review, my rate being between 5 (content) and 3 (pleasure, sometimes falling to 2, sometimes raising to 4). I highly recommend it.Other interesting books I would recommend would be the following: 1) \\"War in Human Civilization\\" by Azar Gat (war explained, not just narrated); 2) \\"History of Government\\" by S.E.

I am physically handicapped, yet can walk and lift only the lightest of ofjects. This Shark is fairly light weight, but is difficult to get a good rurning radius on. I find that I have to go over areas at least 3 times in order to make carpet look clean. Well, not clean as it does NOT dig very deep for dirt. It is handy for light touch-ups, when you hear that the in-laws are going to drop in soon. The foot on/off switch makes it easier. It is cumbursome to get it to manuever. For picking up pet hair - forget it !! Yet, it is easy to empty the concents, once you have copletsed your job. Overall, NOT the best such product on the market.

This is the worst one I have ever had!!! It doesn't pick up well at all. The battery dies quickly!! The no touch empty bottom is worthless. Hair and fuzz get stuck in it and when you use it for awhile the trap door becomes weak at closing and dirt gets in the bottom of the machine. I have had it for about 6 months and this week it died. It sounds like the motor froze up so the brushes won't turn even though it has been cleaned out. I would not recommend this model for anyone. The best model they ever had was the professional the battery lasted 90 min. and being used several times a day they lasted about a year & half. Wish they would them back!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Disappointing. I bought this for a simple task: vacuum hair and nail clippings from the floor of my master bath. It does it very poorly. It pushes hair around without picking it up, and takes three times as long as my old Eureka the Boss Lite, which lived a very long life. There's no filter, it gets very dusty, and requires a lot of cleanup. That's a lot of touching for a no-touch dust cup. Can't wait till it breaks. A previous poor experience with another Euro-pro product makes me unwilling to buy any other products from that company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for almost everything. Do not buy.","review":"My husband purchased this for me when I asked for a lightweight stick vacuum to manage the dog hair and dirt tracked in on our linoleum floors. The size, light weight, maneuverability, and relative quiet of the product seemed promising, but when used (after a full charge) it failed to pick up half of the dirt and dog hair on the bare floor. Running it over the same spot ten times produced no better results, and actually seemed to make the mess worse by clumping the dog hair. It has a brush but no suction to speak of whatsoever. It wouldn't be worth the money if they cut the price in half. I plan to return it as soon as possible in exchange for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"My broom works better...","review":"I wanted something that didn't require me to bend over and sweep sweep sweep every single day because of dog hair. I figured this electronic sweeper would be the answer to my prayers. WRONG!

Plain and simple: I do not recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first day...","review":"I just wanted something for quick pick-ups on rugs and bare floors. This product really disappointed me. Aside from the fact that one of the plastic parts broke the first day (rendering it completely useless since it's a part that needs to be sealed in order to keep suction), there is little to no suction to begin with so basically all this thing did was push the hair and fur around into little stripes.The dust cup is poorly designed - every time I emptied it, I had to reach down and push the flap closed to get it to fit back in. Plus, I couldn't figure out why they designed it so the cup would empty into the base of the thing whenever I used the release button.The only positive worth mentioning is that the brush did seem to rotate strongly enough to pull pet hair out of throw rugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle Broke!!","review":"We saw this vac being used in a restaurant and was highly recommended. We bought one soon after. After a short time - about 2 months - the handle broke off right above the base. We thought it was our fault. We liked the vac so we bought another. Bad move on our part.

The touch-free dust cup is really nice because for these smaller vacuums you have to empty them a lot. The handle got broken and we got an electrolux because that was at the store we went to, but we're going to return that and mail-order another shark.

It's a good compact step up from an old fashioned carpet sweeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 time owner, not worth the money","review":"I loved this vacuum so much when I first got it that 2 of my best friends also went out and bought one. It picks up alot of dirt and hair on carpet and wonderful on hard floors. But it has not even been 2 years. I am on my second one, and my best friend is also on her second one, and the church nursery's broke also within 6 mons. The problem? The stupid handle breaks off if you so much as very lightly turn it wrong. You hardly have to touch it for the long black handle to break off at the bottom, real helpful! Then you have a working vacuum with no handle, what a joke! So this is 5 vacuums within the course of 2 years that have bit the dust, all the same way, the handle broke on every one. Not worth the money!I'm gonna try another brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this sweeper to use on my hardwood and tile floors to pick up dog hair. You would think that would be the perfect use for this product, but it does not work at all.

It litteraly pushes the hair around the floor until it clumps up. Might as well buy a broom for 5 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think ...","review":"My purchase of the shark sweeper was not good. The product definitely does not perform as was led to believe. Tried to use it once. Definitely easy to use (with the exception of taking the pieces back apart to put back in the box). Item did not meet needs (get dog hair up). Want to return item, but since I do not have the plastic wrap for the pieces, the company told me I cannot return it if they cannot sell as new. So, now I'm left with an item I can't use and I can't return it. I do not recommend this item - not enough suction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly worth the hype","review":"I've owned the Shark Sweeper for about a year now, and it stopped working after about 9 months. I was very careful with the care of it - not leaving it plugged in for extended periods of time, etc. I clean out the brush/roller and canister regularly, but it just won't suck anything up anymore. When it does run, it only runs for about 5-10 minutes and barely does anything. Now when it was brand new out of the box, it was wonderful - very thorough. But if I spend more than 20 bucks on something, I would like it to last at least a year, I don't think that's too much to ask!

I have two dogs and the hardwood floors in our house need swept twice a week. It didn't really matter whether or not it was cordless, but I chose to go for a bag free easy to dispose model. After charging it 24 hours (4 more that suggested, just to make sure) the suction was very poor the first time. I had to use the floor/carpet setting on my hardwood floor! Needless to say, extremely ineffective on carpet as well. I noticed I would have to run the sweeper a couple times in the same spot to get it to pick up everything. Even then, I would find dog hair pushed right in front of me. The suction is so weak, the sweeper itself needs to be dusted off. I would imagine this would work for someone that doesn't have pet hair to clean up. It seems to pick up items in the kitchen fairly easy.

One question to all the reviewers of this movie? Have you seen a different movie that I did? I mean, don't get me wrong. I LOVE Pavarotti - the greatest voice of the 20th century for my money - but SERIOUSLY. This movie? It completely lived down to my expectations. I saw Pavarotti onstage many times and understood that he could not act - and didn't care! But in a huge house, his voice and presence and the whole ambiance of Opera made it unimportant. But on film - he has nowhere to hide - and all his acting flaws are exposed.Now, having said that - I REALLY want this movie on DVD - because along with my full MST3K collection, there is nothing I'd enjoy more than a nice evening with some pasta, a bottle of wine and GIORGIO!Enjoy it for the right reasons, people - but don't make it into something it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pavarotti can't act in a movie, either!","review":"Fortunately for us all, in this \\"romantic\\" comedy (the story of a philandering opera star and the doctor who inexplicably is willing to dally with him), Pavarotti undresses no further than a massive shirt and shorts.

Florescent lighting makes the pictures yellow orange. Face recognition does'nt work all the time. Most indoor pictures are blurry and soft. Red eye does not work all the time. I own a 4 megapixel sony and it takes better pictures than this camera. Flash is dissapointing making pictures dark if not close (5-10ft).

Its compact design looks great, its big bright display on the back is excellent, and it even takes great movies.However, this is a *camera* so what ultimately matters are its photos, and here it really disappoints. If all of your photos are outdoors on bright sunny days, then you'll be happy. If you take photos indoors (even on a bright sunny day with lots of ambient sunlight filling the room) or in low light, the images are stunningly awful. Lots of color speckling and distortion, and unusably blurry - even if the camera is completely steady (like on a tripod or setting on a table).The photo quality of my Sony Cybershot DSC-P100 5.1 MPixel from a few years ago is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"The photos that the Sony DSC-T100 camera takes on auto mode are usually fuzzy.

The Kodak pictures are clear and crisp. The sony pictures are fuzzy.The only good things I can say about this camera are the 5x zoom and the nice display.

Easy to use,it's just so very user-friendly. No problems with the settings- dialog boxes describe what effect each setting will have on the image. There are plenty of scene options, really great Macro ability, Image Stabilization is noticeable and makes for excellent pictures and the auto ISO up to 3200 allows very minimal lighting without too much noise in the image. Nice 3\\" smudge and scratch resistant LCD screen with 230 dpi which gives an excellent view of actual shot. Very quick start-up. The only thing I think could be a problem is the placement of lens--you can get your finger in the way so for those with large hands this camera may be too small. I have not had a problem with it, just something I noticed. I bought this camera for its small size, IS, 3\\" screen and 1cm Macro ability and am not disappointed! Sony has packed a lot of camera into a little body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive looking, fantastic screen---horrible pictures","review":"At first glance this camera seems like a good buy---it looks great, feels comfortable in your hands, and even has a nice user-interface. We tested it out at a local retail store and it even seemed to take great pictures (or at least they looked good---on the display screen).Downloading the photos onto your computer revealed the true nature of the T100, however: every photograph was awful. The \\"8.1 megapixels\\" is a joke because your pictures come out looking like an impressionistic painting. Colors bleed, images are grainy (not sharp), and this is totally unacceptable for a $400 camera. Even adjusting ISO settings and manually configuring picture-capture modes can't reduce the issues we had. Do not buy this if you're looking for something that takes decent pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Disappointed!!!!!!","review":"After doing some research, I went with Sony Cybershot DSC-T100. Normally, I am really against Sony because I have had really terrible luck with Sony products. But I thought I would give Sony another chance. I really loved the features this camera had to offer.I bought the camera 3 weeks ago, and started shooting pictures of family. When I went to review the pictures I have taken, I noticed for some of the pictures I was getting a blue screen with a \\"File Error\\" message. Also, some of the pictures were were split in half. The top half was sharp and the bottom half was blurry.I called Sony, and they were not able to help me at all. They were not able to tell me why this was happening to my camera. They said I would have to send the camera for repair and I would have to pay for shipping. So, I just decided to return the camera at the store where is was bought. NEVER again will I buy a Sony product. I have learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Grainy Pictures","review":"I am disappointed with this camera.

On that list of requirements, the DSC-T100 scores 5 stars. If this is what you're looking for, get the camera.Downsides are as mentioned elsewhere: changing modes is a pain; there are two menus and I never remember which one to use; and I hit the flash mode button by accident fairly frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile purchase","review":"I have had a sony cybershot before (T7), and the T100 is much improved.

Sure the T100 has 5X zoom, has face detection (which is more of a gimmick BTW---and doesn't work half the time), and has 1 more megapixel than my T30---which really doesn't matter much. The BIG problem with these cameras are the critical indoor shots....it's still terrible...I see no improvement in the T100 over my T30....the shots are still very grainy, underexposed, occasionally out of focus, and red-eyes galore. The menu system in the T100 is also needlessly complicated compared to the T30....too many button presses to get to the right setting. All-in-all, too much $$$ for a camera that underperforms when things get a little tough. This thing is going back. The search for the perfect point-and-shoot continues....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 8 months, then stopped working","review":"I watched the reviews for this camera, and picked it up since it was so well reviewed. While it was working, it was a great point-and-click camera that we used regularly for travel and real estate work.However, just recently, about 8 months after we bought it, the camera just stopped working. After sending it in to Sony, they claimed it was corrosion damage and not covered by warranty.Given that we are very careful with our cameras and keep them in cases unless they are being used, I was very disappointed with Sony's product and handling of the issue.

It is such a good camera and since I have all the accessories, I wanted to replace it. Both cameras that I bought used should have been listed as \\"Abused\\". But, the camera itself that I had was really easy to use with excellent quality photo and movie modes. The tiny memory stick makes it easy to carry extra memory.

The later generations have higher resolution images, and improved software. But this older model delivers better pictures, and more pictures per charge. In the end isn't that what you get a camera for?Its sad, but true, that the photo journals and consumer report articles on the newer cameras consistently report them as disappointingly inferior to this older model. This explains why this old model now sells for more, sometimes twice as much, as it did when it was in production - or as the newest successor sells for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Camera","review":"Wow! This camera is amazing. It's really hard to make a bad photo. You can have it adjust everything for you, or you can tweak it on your own without spending hours reading the instructions. Menu system is superb, easy access to everything. Screen is brilliant, pictures really look as they should and you can always see them, in bright light too. Macro function is also top notch. Individual grains of sand and the intricate texture of an insect's wing are both no problem for this quality camera. Face detection works great and really makes faces so clear and alive. In some shots this camera even bested a friend's digital SLR with a thousand dollar lens attached. This friend who is an amateur photographer was always taking my new DSC-T100 with him for photos and begged me constantly to use it. This camera is well worth the price and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, terrible, crappy pictures!!!!","review":"Ok, if you want to admire the looks and design of a camera, you find none more beautiful than this Sony. If you want to actually take pictures though, PLEASE LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! Heed my warning! I was sucked in by this camera's beauty and ignored the poor reviews. They are all correct! This camera hands down takes the worst pictures ever! This camera takes worse pictures than my 3MP from years ago! Especially noticable in low light conditions. If you take all your pictures in bright daylight outside, you may be able to live with this camera.Form, function, and feel were second to none, but a camera is supposed to take pictures.

The main reason is that the touch-tone keys have a delay between when you press them and when they make their sound. No telephone should act like that.The other major thing to be warned about is that while the LCD is legible when the phone is placed on a table-top, it's not good when the phone is wall mounted. When wall-mounted, the LCD only has full readability if your eyes are below the phone. Normally on a wall, the phone would be below eye level, in which case the LCD isn't so good, and it only becomes legible when the room is brightly lit.On the good side, the software user interface is very nicely done.I will be relegating this unit to a location where it'll only be used as an answering machine, not as a telephone. For my main home answering machine / telephone, I've gotten a competing unit from AT&T;, which is better as regards both of the issues mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primarily a desk phone","review":"This telephone has attractive programmable features for those so inclined, and performs well, provided it's located fairly close to an electric outlet. If used in a home that has a DSL internet connection, you'll probably have to install a filter between the phone and the telephone jack. Relocating a segment from the back of the plastic body enables the phone to be wall mounted. This is not too easily done because of the long telephone line that must be packed into the interior of the bracket. The DSL filter will make the phone hang farther out from the wall as well. Panasonic tells me they do not sell a longer handset cord to replace the short cord which they supply, so if the phone is mounted on the wall you may have to buy an off-color aftermarket cord. As a wall mounted phone I should downrate it a bit because of these factors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective-Returned","review":"I was initially pleased with the phone, except that the caller ID is not backlit so hard to read.

(kind of a cross between Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine and Jimmy Brown of Deliverance).Progressive is defintely the word I would use to describe the composition-elements of Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Savior Machine as well as some of their old sound is infused to make this one hell of an impressive album.The lyrics are much more openly Christian than their last album, which was full of abstract dichotomies and analgoies, lyrically speaking. but the music and new vocalist are so impressive that I don't even notice that as a bad thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away...","review":"Downloaded this album by accident on my Napster...Haven't stopped listening to it since.

Just go down to the right corner of the menu screen and click change player. This feature allows you to even have multiple games for either you, or other members of your family. It will set you up with a brand new game. Happy breeding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chirps after two months of Use","review":"I bought this from Amazon to use on my calphalon wok.

It does a very good job in introducing the history of Kyoto and the local custom. This is not only useful for traveling but also for gaining a better understanding of an interesting and graceful culture. The book also covers widely all of the points of interest, which includes a good selection of hotels and restaurants. One weakness of the book is the organization. The book separates places of interest and maps into two different section and this makes it difficult to cross reference. You have to make your own plans in connecting all the interesting places into one walk. It would be better if the book can organize a few walking tours that allow us to visit all the highlights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to use","review":"Kyoto is a city famous mostly for its ancient temples. The Lonely Planet Kyoto guidebook does a good job listing them, but it is almost impossible to determine which are good to visit using the minimal one-paragraph descriptions.

Horyuji contains the world's oldest wooden buildings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shoes ever!","review":"I bought these shoes a couple years ago. I hesitated because the price seemed a bit steep.

It seemed less a novel than a disjointed series of semi-scenes. The characters are all indistinct, with the exception perhaps of the narrator, who seems more interested in philosophizing or coining aphorisms than telling us what's going on. Even the supposed subject of the novel, the narrator's disabled son, barely seems to materialize.

I am disappointed to read that the Doorman model is not of the highest quality, but would recommend the Pro-Series. The price difference is negligible, and the quality is superior to that of any other brand. This umbrella really is windproof!

I've had it for about 4 months. In that time, the wood handle has split, come unglued, and falls off the shaft. If I were to hold the umbrella simply by the handle, a good updraft would see my umbrella floating away with a wood handle in my hand. Secondly, the velcro tabs on the closure straps have ripped away from the straps and I need to sew them back on. Thirdly, the plastic tip is very soft and I expect it to wear out before the umbrella. Lastly, the umbrella has a tendency to not stay closed, unless you use the velcro straps, hence the velcro failure is a real pain.

This umbrella made my list because I've read some decent reviews on it, plus it's affordable but I guess you get what you pay for. The first umbrella came and the tip was split. I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day (nice service) however, I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon's service, because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged. Except this one is far worse; the entire tip is missing. Since this is the replacement, Amazon will only do a refund.

I should have learned my lesson as this one just died 5 weeks out of warranty after I just put another $200 into additional handsets for it.

The base station stopped working not long after the warranty period expired. Rather than lose the hundreds of dollars we invested in expansion phones, we bought a second base. The second base stopped working ten months later. Same problem: the display goes blank, the phone unit charges when placed on the cradle, but we can't make or receive calls because the phone doesn't register the base unit. We swapped power cords, tried different phone cords, tried different phone jacks, tried different power outlets. Conclusion: the bases are both defective. Buyer beware!!!

The black face and white hands make it easier to read than other watches of this size. I like to wear a watch loose like a bangle, so haven't removed any of the band extensions, yet the face of the watch stays on the top of my wrist. Instead of the flat black shown in the photo, mine is a glossy, dark, warm charcoal color, which I think is even prettier than the photo. It's nice having a choice other than silver or gold watches. Two two golden links are just the right touch. The description says \\"dress,\\" but I wear it all of the time.

I may seem a little judgemental but once you've played the Halo series, you have a natural instinct to compare every game to it. take my opinion, buy halo and halo 2 first. both those games have better music, multiplayer, storyline, A.I. and gameplay. although Doom 3 may have better graphics, all you ever see is demons and blood. halo and halo 2 however, take you to tropical islands to snow-capped moutains to metropolis citys, and every where between.just my two cents"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTMENT","review":"Worst FPS this year.I play alot of FPS and this is the worst I have played this year.

The graphics were there, the action was there, but it just lacked something... As i could play Doom 1 & 2 for hours upon hours, I couldn't stand another 10 minutes of this game.

After sailing for 5 years I looked forward to kicking back and taking in some of that life through an others words. He is billed as being a good writer on the subject of sailing and world cruising so the hopes were high. I thought there would be either powerful story telling or some kind of insights into what make up a good journey. It is often difficult to explain the nuances of being out on the big blue reading about it is certainly worth the price of a book if the reading is good. In reading, I found he is most impressed with himself his boat and his abilities more than anything else. He spent so much time about him that he forgot to talk about the journey the awakening and the discovery that goes on.

(note: this is the nutshell version of the story--I tried different cords, different outlets, several other different frequency phones but nothing worked)It also has great reception and holds its charge better than any other phone I've owned.

The view is decidedly superficial, the author being unable to comprehend that faith is a wonderous mystery, not dialog from a sit-com; i.e picturing Mary asking Joseph, when they are to flee to Egypt, just where he expects to find a donkey at that time of night. What nonsense! The Mother of God isn't a snappy one-liner; she is a profound gift, as evidenced by the late John Paul II dedicating his pontificate to her, and, writing extensively of her during his 26 year tenure. For true food for thought and meditation, any of John Paul's books will satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"363 days with Mary","review":"Great little reflections that make Jesus' mother more real to the reader, paralleling some very credible and delightfully surprising days in the typical woman's life experiences.

Should a seller choose the BUY NOW method or straight auction? Should an auction last the default of 7 days or should it shorter? Or longer? Should the auction stop on a weekday or weekend? This book is good if you want to know how to fill out the eBay form. It's really not much of a help. Also, there are numerous little editorial problems in this book.

Little did I know that this is not the high quality, sturdy pair of tongs that I had expected it to be, considering it's made from Calphalon.

Screaming For Vengeance and Ram It Down, in my opinion, are better. The first side is better than the second. The songs are less commercial and more hard-walloping. Rapid Fire, the opening track, is the perfect metal anthem with the line \\"Pounding the world like a battering ram\\". The next song, Metal Gods, is slightly less heavy, but still great. Breaking The Law is a great song with an awesome video. Grinder and United are cool, too. This is a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Judas Priest","review":"I'm a Judas Priest fan and own many of their albums but British Steel has always bugged me. The songs are not bad and the album did produce two of their biggest hits in Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight. But there is no energy to this album as if Judas Priest was just going through the motions of recording. Absent are the emotions of Stained Class and the power of Hell Bent For Leather and the angst of Screaming For Vengeance. Because of this the songs all blur together with none of them being a standout...making British Steel a very forgettable album. If you are new to Judas Priest, or are looking to finish your collection, I'd skip British Steel and move on to better efforts by the band like Stained Class, Hell Bent For Leather, Point Of Entry, Screaming For Vengeance, and Painkiller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Hard Rock Album - Not Judas Priest's Best","review":"If you were to put together a list of Judas Preist's best 5 albums, British Steel would definitely NOT be on that list. The songs on this album lack the dynamic musical talent you find on their earlier or later albums, such as Stained Class or Painkiller. The album itself seems far too contrived and comes off sounding bland to my ears. This album doesn't really showcase Judas Priest's talent.If you're a new listener to Judas Priest, then I would avoid starting out with this album, otherwise you might be turned off from them altogether!

Just about any Priest album seems to be a classic. One of the few covers by them I actually like. The sound, I guess, is not as heavy as Painkiller, but more distortion than their 70s stuff. Fine British Heavy Metal being served here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good metal album","review":"The album begins with Rapid fire -> a very heavy song with an adrenaline dose. Next comes Metal Gods -> its between just ok and i like it . then Breaking the law -> its one of the most known songs in this album but i don't like it at all (its a little immature). Then we have Grinder which with Rapid fire are the best songs in this album and of course i like it. Then united sounds a little wussy , thanks but no thanks. You don't have to be old to be wise its just ok . Living after midnight is another wussy song. The rage is a very good song with very remembered music. And then steeler its a nice songs with solo (yeah). I don't like the fact that there are no solos (only in 2 tracks i thinks and very small) . The production is not for 2011 but lets say we don't count this. So we have a 4/5 star heavy metal album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Columbia remasters not worth it","review":"Columbia is not too great about remastering. The sound is not improved to any degree. The running order is altered and the album dosent sound right with the current running order. The original discs are superior. They have sound that is just as good, and who really cares about bonus tracks? I know this review will be torn to shreds by Priest fans, but keep in mind, I am a huge Priest fan. If I was not, I wouldn't have written a review. I would seek out the first edition discs. Remastering rarely improves sound from cd. Cd is already as good as it gets. Remasters are just ways for record companies to revive slagging sales on artists back catalogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live Priest!","review":"I've had an love affair with this album from my high school days and still do 20+ years after!! Classic tunes like \\"Breaking the Law\\" and \\"Living After Midnight\\" but my personal favorite is \\"Steeler\\". It is so uplifting I can't help but stand up and move up and down as if it was being played live! Must have for classic heavy metal music fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal","review":"\\"British Steel\\" is totally immortal!This album is about P O W E R. It simply spells it right through. Every song is a total classic. Every riff commands you to shake, every chorus you find yourself singing along. This is blood, sweat, tears, and steel.This album is pure genius. I imagine, if I were in a band, making an album like British Steel, would be the ultimate challenge. Write a killer riff, base the song around it, adding timeless hooks and an utterly catchy chorus. Repeat this procedure ten times. Very, very seldom does bands accomplish this. Pure genius, and alot harder than writing non memorable songs where riffs are all over each other.I originally bought this album 18 years ago. Earlier this year I got all the JP re-masters, and British Steel sounds better than ever (actually they all do). I really think changing the track list was beneficial as well. Ive found myself putting on British Steel, and just soak in its P O W E R. Totally engulfed in it's genius. Pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 really- Classic metal","review":"This is a very good Priest album but I like \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" better. Then it's this, \\"Point Of Entry\\", \\"Screaming\\" and \\"Painkiller\\".Alright, about the album. Anybody who claims to listen to good rock stations HAS to know \\"Breaking The Law\\" and/or \\"Living After Midnight\\". The overall sound of the album is relatively simple; I can play \\"Breaking the Law\\" on guitar. At times, \\"Rapid Fire\\" almost sounds like a more commercial Motorhead (!) because it's so fast.Overall, recommended for beginners. If you liked \\"Breaking The Law\\" and \\"Living After Midnight\\", the album's sound is very similar so don't be afraid to dig deeper into the realm of heavy things, my friends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"I think this album is great, breaking the law is one of the greatest 80's rock song I think I have ever heard. The guitar riffs, and head banging hard rock sounds just make me want to mosh. And that is just one song, wait till you hear the others, they will nock you out of your chains and ear rings. This is an excellent album, if you like Ozzy and Twisted Sister, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm....","review":"I wouldnt waste my money on this, the picture isnt even of 2pac, this is a definite buyer beware situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Lemper Fan","review":"I discovered Ute Lemper years ago and love her interpretations of Weill's unique music. However, I was sadly disappointed with this DVD for two reasons. Firstly, Lemper's approach to the music is as much acting as singing, therefore the lack of English titles is unforgivable. Trying to watch/listen to her performance while reading the translation from a booklet simply does not cut it. Secondly, although the piano accompaniment was first rate, it definitely wasn't \\"piano\\" but drowned out Lemper's singing in the softer passages. The production could have used a better sound engineer.The Michael Nyman section was just plain awful. The orchestral \\"overture\\" sounded like a noisy Phillip Glass knock off. The songs were repetitive and boring, lacked any kind of original musical ideas, and used Holocaust photos to (unsuccessfully) add \\"gravitas\\". I'd rather stick pins in my eyes than to experience that travesty again."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind-boggling","review":"Bellydancers looking for a change of pace from the traditional orchestral numbers should definitely check this out. Click on the sample of track #4 for the fastest, most surfer-psychedelic karshilama you can imagine. Many of these songs have traditional Turkish rhythms, and make a wonderful change from the ubiquitous techno-Arabic pop. The cover of the album says \\"vol. 1\\" and I hope there are many, many more to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this show","review":"Loved this show before I ever had kids! Wish there were more episodes. It's not about love interests or selling junk with the characters faces on it. It's about building good character traits and making the right decisions. There are no true \\"bad guys\\" in this show. Much more realistic, the antagonist is usually the \\"friend\\" that also looks down his nose at everyone else (like I said far more realistic everyone has THAT friend), but even he knows when he has crossed a line and tries to make things right. Most shows are about balancing your needs/wants and your friends' needs/wants and about making decisions to be true to your moral compass when it would be far easier to just play along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claudia and a weirdo","review":"A new girl called Ashley is in Claud's neighbourhood and she is one awful little weirdy thing.She makes friends with Claudia and demands that Claudia be JUST like her and that she stays away from her other friends!!Ashley is extremely eccentric and nasty and is obsessed with fire hydrants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Share it with your friends...","review":"I bought ten copies to pass around our local diocese.

I use disposable bottles which this is supposed to be compatable with. It seems that the bottles are usually not warm enough or hot enough to really scald someone. I don't recommend this. I usually just warm water in a cup and warm the bottles that way. I feel bad that someone spent money on this for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always makes bottles too hot","review":"We bought this bottle warmer two weeks ago because our little one recently switched to formula and we thought maybe we would keep this in his room to make night time feedings easier. We've tried it several different times during the day and every time the bottle come out scalding hot and we have to soak them in cold water to make them drinkable for our little boy! I guess we'll just go back to heating his bottles in hot water in the sink! Way more trouble than it's worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok, but...","review":"This bottle warmer is OK. It is difficult to figure out how much water to use to get the correct temperature if you are heating less than 4 ounces. Also, it does get that gross brown stuff on the inside and all over the base - which is hard to clean up. My husband is still battling with it - I am staring to use a cup of hot water more often now. But, for the price I guess it's not a bad deal. It should be better when we routinely need to heat more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"So far, I am not too impressed with this warmer. Using the exact amount of water suggested with the level, I find that the Avent 4-oz bottle of breast milk is still COLD. However, scalding water drips off the bottle as I pull it out of the warmer (be careful not to burn yourself!). I plan on trying different amounts of water to see if I can get the right ratio - but for something that is supposed to be a help, it is just creating more work for me...thankfully, Peanut doesn't mind his milk a little on the cold side."},{"rating":"1","title":"bottles never warmed","review":"Unlike other reviewers, we could never get the bottles warm even when we used the maximum amount of water. The milk was still cold and we had to run the bottles under hot water. I returned this piece of junk and bought the First Years brand warmer which works like a charm. Best advice: save your receipt and packaging until you try this item a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will wake your baby up when it's done","review":"The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING BURNS INFANTS!!!!","review":"I purchased this and used it to warm my sons bottles when he was one day old and it burned the back of his throat!!! He had to stay in the hospital for 6 days in the NICU because they thought he had a viral infection when they realized that it was a burn from the bottle warmer DO NOT USE!!!!!I thought it might have been my product but I was so glad to see that others reported it got too hot!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is horrid!","review":"I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up.Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny !","review":"We love this bottle warmer. I was a little skeptical about getting a bottle warmer after reading some of the reviews of the other brand names of warmers. But I decided to go with this one since its reviews were good and I am so glad I did. I love the automatic shut off function and the beep when it is finished. Like anything else, you have to use good sense and adjust the amount of water according to how much in the bottle and check the temp before giving it to baby but I have easily learned to estimate the amount of water needed based on the amount in the bottle. This is definitely something you will want if you are heating bottles !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bottle warmer!","review":"I read many reviews before purchasing this bottle warmer. Many others are reported to heat unevenly, too hot, or too cold. We've had no problems with this one! Of course I do swirl the milk around after it's heated just in case, but I works wonderfully! If you need a bottle warmer, get this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Buying This!!!","review":"I bought this bottle warmer to use for my in-home daycare. I liked the fact that it would fit any size bottle. I tried using it for a few weeks and finally ended up puting it with my rummage sale items. First off it's totally inconvenient to use if you don't have it set up by a water source as you have to put water in it every time you use it. Next, it makes the bottle burning hot almost every time and causes condensation on some bottles, such as the playtex vent-air and disposable bottles; so when you take the bottle out of the warmer they drip scalding hot water from the bottom of the bottles. Last, I experienced whether you use distilled or tap water in the warmer after a few times it burns the minerals in the water causing a disgusting brown film around the inside bottom of the warmer and emits a nasty burning smell while it is warming the bottles. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BABY ITEM, IT'S DEFINETLY NOT A MUST HAVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for bottle liners","review":"We have been using the bottle warmer and have found that it works best for regular botles, not ones with the bottle liners. The milk gets too hot with a four ounce bottle. It is fine for warming 8 ounce bottles. We've used plastic bootles as well as the little glass distilled water bottles and they seem to heat okay. I always stand right by the warmer and usually take it out before the timer goes off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !!!","review":"We purchased this before our little one arrived and soon after she was born we were using this...it has been great...yes, you do have to sorta fiddle with what water amount is best for the type of bottle and the amount of fluid you are trying to heat...but, for us it has never been too much of an issue. I am so thrilled I purchased this one as I have tried many others w/ our 1st daughter and didn't like many of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long","review":"We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off.Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE!!!","review":"I bought two of these. One for home, one for work (my baby comes with me). The one at home stopped shutting off automatically after just one week of use, and the one at work gets the bottles SO hot, even though I follow the directions to the letter, and it literally boiled the formula. Between not turning itself off, and boiling things, there is no way i want one in my house. I am returning them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I finally broke down and opened this shower gift after my in-laws kept complaining that I was serving the milk to cold. Either the bottle is still too cold, or I have had several bottles where it has heated them so that the milk burned my hand. I am glad I did not believe the product information about no hot spots and tested the bottles first! I only wish I had saved the packaging and got my money back. Save your money, a cup of hot water works fine and my daughter does not mind if it is slightly cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't shut off after just a handful of uses!","review":"We bought this on a Saturday... we used it for the first time on Sunday morning. We only used it, maybe 2-3 times per day. We unplugged it after each use. Went to warm up a bottle on Wednesday evening and the switch glows red permanently now, which means it does not beep or turn off. We haven't touched it since then... it technically still works, but not properly. I'm ticked, because we didn't use this much at all and were very careful with it, yet it still died out on us.My daughter prefers her bottles warmed, so we are going to invest in another warmer, but so far, not sure on the brand... especially since this one was \\"highly\\" recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough for me","review":"This isn't the greatest product ever invented, but it's cheap and it does its job. We have bottles of all shapes & sizes and they all fit. It heats bottles VERY quickly, though I do recommend using a little less water than it says to avoid overheating."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"terrible knife and is hard to flip out. bad blade wobble and plastic handle that will break very easy.i dont recomend buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This movie is great if you either understand Korean or don't mind R-language subtitles. The plot was really good and they couldn't have picked a more attractive girl to play the leading role. I don't understand why the people that do the subtitles for these things though, don't use a little more mild language. This was a movie obviously targeted towards a more family audience with no innapropriate scenes while still managing to have a great love story. Why do they have to put f words into the English subtitles in every other sentence?But like I said, if you don't mind that kind of language or understand Korean, this was an awesome movie. Great story, great characters and really funny, even though it was in another language."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish","review":"I purchased this dvd to brush up on my Korean. I guess it did help me with that. Unfortunately it was childish and lacked any substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Good Stuff","review":"Craig Taubman has always been one of my fave singers. And I'm usually skeptical when my favorites try something totally different. But, this album actually works. The track 'Dayenu' is a great example of why. It keeps the traditional melody but turns it into this dance-pop fusion song that sounds like Radiohead with religion. A great idea carried out with skill and style by Taubman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so lounge-y, not so hot","review":"Good intentions, but fairly bland results. Take the title with a large grain of salt. This is not lounge music - by any definition - for the most part. Indeed, several tracks tend toward bland soft rock, including the usually boisterous Passover favortie \\"Dayenu''; the version here is a curiousity just because it's so laid back. Children's entertainer Taubman's voice, heard on several but not all tracks, may be the weakest element."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef??","review":"I ordered this item from amazon also.

As I giggle with incredulity, I see profiteers continuing on their way, preying on the undiscerning, feeble-minded, anti-intellectual.obviously, there's a market, and the market responds. Such is the life and journey of this book -- recycled principles from self help guides, common sense ethics from the Book of Proverbs, and a touch of inspiration/perspiration sloganeering. The tragedy, though, is the debasing of Biblical theology and disorderly exegesis (if you can even call it that). God help those who put down the $10-$15 for these.

The stories are superbly told and really capture the flavor of the time through liberal use of original documents. This is a scholarly work that manages to still have fascinating stories within. Pirates who turn themselves in after escaping jail after completing a mysterious \\"mission\\" or the sad tale of a pirate whose kindness to those captured by his ship didn't spare him the hangman's noose are all part of this well documented book.

Then the 20 Amp circuit it is on blows. We reset and restarted. Now the compressor does not start. We try it in another 20 Amp circuit. Same thing, my little Lasko fan was better than this. Tried everything stated on forums and in manual. Nothing. Seems like it was the compressor that shorted out. Brought it back to Lowes. At the return counter there is 7 other Frigidaire Air Conditioners, all brought in on the same day according to the lady at the counter.

Millie, the author, has had to face an amazing number of changes as she and her husband move into their 'later years'. This book is a touching and personal account of that transition.

So excited, in fact, that I somehow ordered two copies of it. On one hand, it is a great look at Ms Fleming's career, how she handles life as a mom and a world-famous artist, and has some interesting biographical details. But somehow Tony Palmer was able to take such a great artist and make a boring film out of her. The shining moments are clips from rehearsals, where the viewer can see how music affects her, both to tears and to laughter.The most valuable portions of the DVD are when she sings, and my favorite part is Korngold's aria at the end. But some things were left out that would have been great to see; for example, we see footage of her walking on stage as a young competition winner to sing Dvorak, but they break away to a clip of her singing it today, in a similar dress.The vignettes are also nice. Overall, a good buy if you love Renee. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I was really disapointed with this film about Renée Fleming. She deserved a much better film. This one is not well done, the sequence of images is almost non sense and the whole thing is quite boring. Even most of the arias (or parts of arias as Renee is not showed singing any full aria at all!) are almost painful to see (you better close your eyes!) because they seem to be sung in play back.I have seen Renée Fleming live, I've listened to many recordings of her and always enjoyed a lot. Unfortunately this time that was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"tarnished, live","review":"fleming is best known for the silvery quality of her instrument. for cd recordings, i couldn't agree more; putting aside her un-musical penchant to stretch rubato past its effectiveness, the (edited) quality of her voice is warm and intensely provocative. however, on dvd, ms. fleming sounded confused and unfocused, even wobbly and shrill at times. i could have done without ms. fleming's flat and pushed additional footage, as well as the flat and contrived filler segments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me laugh...at what a sucker I am","review":"I've never seen Fleming live and after enduring this horrible DVD, I don't ever plan to in the future. Let me blunt, this horror flick is non-stop torture from beginning to end. It starts with her singing with the muppets and steadily gets worse.If content such as Hugging the Clintons, The Preperation of a special desert from some fruitcake chef, endless dull rehearsals, and an incredibly tacky 911 tribute is up your alley then by all means buy this embarrassing informercial. If you're looking for real content such as opera clips, etc. then you're SOL.

Since it was my 1st I did not know what I was missing. It doesn't operate quickly. Because of a delay between flash and picture taking, my subjects always moved believing it had taken the picture when it actually didn't take it for a second after. Imagine those shots! Also, a delay in trying to take 2 or more pix right after another. Had many wait times. Not fun when you're trying to capture that shot! Also, burns thru batteries often. And there is no audio on the movie fuction.My camera was just stolen on vacation, so I went shopping for a new one. I got a newly refurbished Sony Cybershot dsc-w100 with 8.1 mega pixels one at [...]for [...] and it completey out performs the coolpix.

If you start to have this problem, get it fixed under warranty, else it might make you wish you bought something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"This camera is worth every penny. I just recieved it today and so far I like it a lot. Seems to be well made, has a nice size LCD screen, and takes good pictures from what I have seen so far. Battery life seems good. It has 15 scene modes which you would not expect with a camera in it's price range. Macro mode is excellent! The only downsides really is the time it takes from when you take a picture to the time you can take the next, it takes a second for the flash to charge. The camera only comes with 10mb internal memory, so unless you are going to invest in a bigger memory card, you will only be able to take about 6 pictures. The video mode is good, but does not have any sound. Overall I give it a 4.5. Price paid: $116"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats Up Batteries ...","review":"The optics are not too bad.

My last camera was a Samsung 1 megapixel and it stopped working after a year so I bought the 4 year insurance plan just because I am a bit jaded after that experience. No matter how many megapixels camera you order, keep in mind that you will have to edit the size in order to email them to people. So, the mega, megapixel cameras appear to appeal to those people who will actually print the pics or view them on their TV's. When I tried to upload some pics to myspace and yahoo mail and I discovered that I had to edit the size of the pics down to 50%; each and every one. good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth, bad image quality","review":"This is a cheap camera in 4 MP and can cost around $100. This is an attractive price, but the image quality is so terrible that this camera is not worth. I have used 5 other digital cameras (mostly Olympus & 1 Canon) and I am a hobby photographer (landscapes & cityscapes). This camera features are not useful at all and any pictures taken inside rooms or party modes were shaky and blurred. Its museum mode works good. I have been fighting with this camera for last 5 months, and theneventually stopped using it.Its flash charging time is too long and you have to wait to see a picture after taking it.There is a long time gap & effort in clicking, holding the click button and whole camera firmly while taking pictures.Pros:Small, Easy-to-navigate Menu, Lot of picture modesCons:Terrible picture quality, No image stabilizing, Modes are not effective"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my uses","review":"I bought this camera because of the small size, megapixles and zoom + digital zoom.

I have had to take it back to BestBuy 3 times now to get the lense fixed. The lense refuses to open and after they have fixed it, it will work for two days then stop again and this is with it not falling or anything like that.

The image doesn't even fill the whole page, either--there are quarter-inch margins on each side and entire half-inch margins on both the top and bottom.

He then flies off to Rome where he enjoys the respect and admiration of the Italians for all things German. The freshness of these diary entries are equaled only by their jaded candor. Never does the author seem to hold any hope out for a German victory. Also remarkable is how his observations fail to include any mention of the concentration camps or the plight of Jews.

Kathy was strong in the begining and she was strong at the end. Think about it, she had to marry a guy she didn't know and barely liked, because of they're son.

She reterns to the man who abused her. To me rape and kidnapping is not an attractive quality.

I thought that the character would grow and develop from this experience but in the end she is still a victim! The ending of the book was terrible as well. It was as if the author had five minutes to write an ending and just wrote whatever came to mind. My eighth graders would have come up with a better ending.

You have to realize when this book was written. In the 1970's and 1980's there was a subgenre of romance novels called boddice rippers. Most romance readers couldn't get enough of them. They usually had a rape scene and after awhile the heroine would come to fall in love with the man who raped her. Some of the authors who wrote these books were Katherine Woodiwiss, Jennifer Wilde, etc. Apparently Victoria Holt figured she may as well try her hand at it, too.Pop psychology at that time said that many women had rape fantasies. It's true. That doesn't mean they want to be raped in real life. It's just an erotic fantasy. Most people know the difference between reality and fantasy. These bodice rippers are fantasy, and a lot of women got off on them.

Because that's all it does. It explains in detail the most common cartoon character stereotypes and how you should use them. it tells you what is normally done and tells you to do the same. cartooning is not about following paths that have already been followed. i enjoyed The Naked Cartoonist by Robert Mankoff, cartoon editor for the New Yorker.

It starts off well enough but then only gives a brief glimpse into his journey to Mecca. The story drifts from the past to the present and seems to just drop off leaving the viewers disappointed. Some of the scenery is very nice and well-photographed of that dramatic landscape but the story line is quite disappointing. From the interviews at the end of the DVD, it seems that creating a film there was not without its challenges so the producers, directors and artists do have to be given some credit for the attempt and credit must also go to the authorities, who have only a small film industry, for working with the filmmakers. If you do buy it, just know that it isn't a robust story of his journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey to Mecca","review":"Watched twice and loved the cinematography.

Instead it was filled with fear-mongering rhetoric, expressed in a very disorganized and shoddy fashion.

J Neil Schulman seems to continually deliver his message with a ball hammer, where for this sensitive issue, a scalpel was needed.Lastly, how hard it is to proof read your manuscript, Mr Schulman?

Now, I already feel like I'm one of, hmmm, maybe 1000 people who have some idea of what that word means (a derogatory name for a group of early Protestants who denied all human knowledge, including speech) and was amazed it'd be in a song shortly following the word \\"wisteria\\" in a gorgeous, tense epic about a serial killer.I couldn't get the song out of my head, so the next day I bought the album and, seven months later, I'm still listening to it and still discovering new ideas, themes and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless","review":"I bought these figuring I'd put them to good use as I'm always struggling to find funnels when I need them.

There is no quality without a purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality control","review":"These funnels seem to be well made, but they do not all nest together as they lead you to believe. The two small ones do nest together, but the big one will not, which in turn will make them hard to store as they will not all fit in the same space. I believe if they had better quality control, they would have been fitted before being packaged.

I was quite shy before, but reading it really increased the problem. Also, forget about psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. I have yet to meet one who knows anything about people. There are drugs that are supposed to help as well, but they actually have no positive effects.Instead, get involved in social activities along with friends - in my case, it was ballroom dancing with group lessons that helped. I'm still shy, but not as painfully shy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"Philip G. Zambardo obviously wrote this book for the 70s generation. A lot of the theories that he offers about shyness have not stood the test of time. His self-help methods are overly simplistic, and he doesn't really have a handle on how shyness affects people. Especially disturbing is his praise of Synanon, a 70s cult that eventually became mired in controversy over forced vasectomies, beatings, and attempted murder. Very little to offer to the modern reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"The book is *outdated*. It was written in 1979. Some of its theories really freaked me out. I thought there was some thing seriously wrong with me. And it's not that informative. The impression I got from the writer is shyness is not normal and it's some kind of a character defect that needs to be treated. I read a part about shy people tend to become perverts, rapists or killers. That's not true.If you want a great book about shyness, then you should buy \\"Shyness: A bold new approach\\" By Bernardo J. Carducci, Ph.D. His book is recent and the information provided is totally up todate. He doesn't think shyness is a character defect that needs to be treated, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't we come further?","review":"As a parent and teacher it breaks my heart to know that anyone who is labeled as shy would read this book and think there is something psychologically wrong with them that needs to be fixed. Modern society and the educational system focus way too much on extroverted preferences and performance. So many productive, intellectual, insightful people are introverts who prefer to be in social situations that don't demand that we be something that we are not, extroverted. Shyness is a label given to those who don't fit into the behavioral expectations of extroverted parents, teachers, and bosses. We would not be where we are in civilized history without inwardly focused thinkers, writers and problem solvers. We used to call quiet, reserved, thinking people wise, now we call them shy, lacking in self-esteem and not team players. Not only is the book outdated, so is the term shy and so are the expectations that everyone in school and society should fit into the same mold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is NOT a good cd; Song choices are not that good.Would not buy this again.

The Big Gundown is a much more formulaic movie, and although Run Man Run does not have Lee Van Cleef, Donal O'Brien holds his own in this movie and is not overly derivative of other spaghetti western characters. This movie is pretty funny and is more effective as a comedy than the Trinity movies. In addition, the theme song has a beautiful rousing melody that provides Run Man Run with an energy that it maintains throughout. So, I disagree with other reviewers, I do not think this movie dragged at any point.I think this movie would appeal to just about anyone who enjoys the movies. It really provides a light-hearted, good time at the movies, and this print of it is also very clear and clean.

This is allegory to be sure, but too often allegories like this end up with characters who feel like nothing buy puppets instead of people. That never happens here. Hammer and Nailles are fully formed characters with their own fears and phobias. The book reads quickly and ends with a great knockout climax that stuck with me for days. More so-called \\"literary\\" novels should follow Cheever's example and tell a good story with precision and tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are not as they seem","review":"What's lurking just next door, around the corner, down the street? Those nice couples that you meet at the playground, at church and at parties, there just like you and me, right? Or can you sense the insanity bubbling just behind the facade of polite scotch and water cocktail parties and rotary club meetings?That's the theme behind Bullet Park, and Cheever explores it deftly and accurately. Some of the characters here are content with their place in the world and their neatly manicured lawns. Some are desperate and psychotic, and some are deeply depressed. Their interaction is the crux of the novel.I see alot of Cheever influence in David Lynch's work, although admittedly Cheever's stories are much more lucid. This is my first experience with Cheever, and I am off to the library to get all the Wapshot stuff.

These films were excellent but Come and See was terrible. I realize that atrocities occurred on both sides of the Eastern Front but this movie is pure one sided propaganda. \\"Defiance\\" is a much better movie in this genre.

Nothing is further from the truth! I hope I save at least 1 person from wasting their time like I did when I saw this film. It is cartoonish in it's depiction of the Germans. It has that artsy foreign look throughout, clumsy and juvenile, while pretending to be a statement on the brutality of war. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.

This one is so tepid and outlandish, it borders into self parody. To avoid that, the director then tortures and slaughters animals -for real! Oh, and last but not least, many among the nazis wear Polish uniforms; an ill attempt -my guess- to justify the (in)famous Katyn atrocities committed by the Red Army.Made in the last years of Soviet cinema, after glasnost it should have been retitled \\"Stalin meets Pole pot\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come and See","review":"Crap. This is a ridiculous movie. Not even worth a watch in my opinion. Outside of the basics of what is occurring, the plot suffers. Boy goes away to join partisans. Partisans leave him in camp when they leave to fight the Germans. Camp is destroyed by Germans you don’t really even see. Boy hooks up with pretty girl. Boy goes crazy before, and more so after, his family is killed by Germans. Germans and Romanians torch village. Boy is spared - somehow. Boy sees partisans kill surrendering Germans and Romanians after a mostly un-scene battle. Boy is still crazy. Movie ends. Unbelievable scenes and too little battle action. If there was some other thought to leave the viewer with other than you can go crazy when someone kills your family - I didn’t get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"I watched this movie based on the positive reviews on this site, but was very disappointed. I found the acting, directing and storyline to be atrocious. I kept holding out that the movie would improve, but it never did.

You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment!","review":"This simply isn't a very good movie. Although a well-intended, anti-war, anti-Nazi movie, it is far from mesmerizing or extraordinary. First, the look of the film is grainy, dark, poor sound, and is not particuarly well-edited, with choppy scenes and missing continuity. The characters are stale--the villains are stereotypically evil, inhuman Germans, being resisted by noble, people of the earth Russians. The acting is over the top, although Alexei Kraavchenko, as the youth through whose eyes the movie is played out, is good (he is the only reason for the one star). There isn't a single idea in the movie that hasn't been better explicated in other movies, and nothing original to recommend it. Yes, war is bad and it is necessary to try to retain one's humanity in the face of war. This movie isn't engaging enough to even sustain this message. Sorry, this is one to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for the DVD - 5 stars for the film","review":"The film is superb but this is the WORST DVD I have ever bought. The 5.1 mix is appalling and there are frequent pauses in the pictures.

Buy the video version instead, you get the same film with no interuptions and without the sound being messed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come and See.","review":"COME AND SEE, is perhaps the best war movie ever made.I'll admit that this is a highly charged statement madeabout a genre that has produced more than a fewimmaculately good films like DAS BOOT and APOCALYSE NOW,but this film is easily my favourite.COME AND SEE addressses the madness that is war in dreamlike stream of consciousness and tells the story of a young boy (12) desperate to see the adventure that he thinks that the Nazis invading his motherland Russia will bring. The war that he finds is not anything that he expected. This war has no form, no control, no.. order. Civilization ceases to exist and eventually our \\"hero\\" embraces the essence of war and exists purely for hate. The message is simple. Hatred is contagious, even the innocent succumb.Simply magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely best film on the horrors of war","review":"I still remember the first time I saw this film about 15 years ago in Kiev. I was shocked, shocked at the film's honesty that was so rare in Soviet cinema. Come and See was there before Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line. I do not think it represents the Germans as evil beasts but rather it shows the view of a young boy trapped in the evils of Hitler's New World Order. With the seeing of this film I hope people can realize what the Great Patriotic War during the fateful years of 1941-1945 was all about, how different it was from the gentlemanly Western Front, and how savage it was in its conduct. Besides in the Republic of Belarus, it is well known that 25% of the population perished during the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for the action...","review":"but it never came... very slow pace movie, I could barely stay awake. Why would anyone give this a 5 star? There are so many better movies that tell the same story with a lot more action. It's like all the scenes just dragged on forever... make the point and move on. It's like the story was never really developed - plot is weak. They could have centered the movie around some famous battle and still showed the harshness of life. I just rented it from amazon and it was not worth even $3."},{"rating":"1","title":"russian cinema stinks...","review":"I saw Defiance some time ago, and when I bought it I read an opinion in Amazon of someone who was strongly recommending this film. So, I decided to purchase it too and give a (new) try to Russian films.But, when I started watching this movie I thought I was in the tunnel of time and that it was Eisenstein rolling Potemkin. The performances didn't contribute also as the actors are terrible and the style of filming is typical of the russian school: loooooong scenes with no meaning at all, looooong takings of the faces which pretend to be expressive but are completely over-performed, ridiculous dialogs, plagued of symbolisms which can have a meaning only for the director but do not contribute to the overall story, etc...In summary, don't waste your bucks in this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Foreign film with a capital F, then it becomes amazing.","review":"The first half is so drawn out, slow and culturally weird it was hard to sit through. I kept waiting for the action. The story picks up half way through and is shocking if you are not familiar with the Eizengruppen SS.I watched this movie to see the depiction of how the Nazis came upon a town and then commited their atrocities. They come out of the fog and the scene is very creepy. You may have seen the grainy WW II footage of shootings and executions in documentaries before, but here you see how the SS laughed and joked and were drunk and commited rape. There are a couple of good books to educate yourself on how sick the Nazis were. Try Masters of Death and Hitlers Willing Executioners. This movie is the only depiction of the Eizengruppen SS I have ever seen. The documentary footage only scratches the surface of what the SS did. This movie shows it in greater detail and disgusting reality, even though only a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all the people giving bad ratings...","review":"All you people who rated this movie bad. You're saying that this movie is pure propaganda, let me ask you this do you even realize how the Nazis treated the Russians and other Slavic people? For every 1 dead German soldier killed by a Russian Partisan, 100 Russian civilians would be shot. Also keep in mind that these Nazi soldiers in the movie aren't the Wehrmacht. They are part of the SS Death Squads called \\"SS Einsatzgruppen\\" Their main task was to murder \\"Sub-Humans\\" \\"Jews\\" \\"Communists\\". This is possibly the best movie ever made, and it's really hard to watch. If you are a person who knows a lot about the Eastern Front, you will definitely love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:One of the most disturbing and powerful war movies ever made, Come and See is somewhat unstructured but incredibly haunting; if you can watch the last half an hour or so of this movie and then want to go out and fight a battle, then you have my sympathies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Realistic War Movie","review":"This is the most realistic war movie ever made.

The books are getting so far out that I do not believe I will read the next one. I remember Hitchcock talking about suspense. He talked about 'the bomb'. If you just blow the bomb up then the impact is a sudden shock. If you show the bomb and show the bomb, you create suspense. But you can never blow up the bomb because the audience will never forgive you. Tanenbaum shows the bomb and shows the bomb and then blows up the bomb.

I like books that push the edge (intricate serial killers, semi-super private eyes etc) without quite going over. This book does that. A pedantic terrorist, a crazed/possessed serial killer, a courtroom giant, they all all here. I liked the plot and the characters, except for Karp's wife.

Those that enjoy watching Buffy will enjoy watching this mini-series. It's got some action, drama and romance all mixed together. It can be a bit gruesome at times, but it is tolerable. The cliffhanger at the end still bugs me, but in all honesty, it would have been hard to continue production without Mark Frankel(?) aka Julian Luna, the main character, who had died unexpectedly in a motorcycle crash.

Great stories, great acting, and a good amount of action. If you like Vampire, things vampiric, or just a good story this is an incredible purchase.The only thing I didn't care for was how it kind of made some of the clans generic power-wise (in the game, each clan is a bit more ability-specific) but it did make up for it in obvious clan rivalries and the like, so it is easily gotten around.Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shows","review":"I rememeber when this series hit the airwaves, the successs was off the charts.

I remember Aaron Spelling commented that continuing it with a replacement would not be the same. It seemed as if the actors were made for their parts even though Thomas C. Howell was a little too cheezy.Kindred the Embraced - The Complete Vampire Collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vampire series!","review":"This series is wonderful, the reason I am only giving it four stars is becouse of the to few episodes made for this series so it is sort of cut off in mid story. Yes pepole this is one more great show canceled before it can really pick up.This series is based on the role playing game Vampire the Masquerade by White Wolf game studio. The main character Julian Luna is San Fransisco's Prince, the leaders of the city vampires, and there is a soap opera style plot with love affairs and betrayal that go on with him, and the city vampires and the humans they involve themself with.The acting is top notch, the storyline is great, though be aware that while there are a few fights this is more drama than action. I have nothing bad to say about this series. If you like vampires you will most likely like this, the only negative thing is that is was canceled before it's plot got to run it's course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring this show back on-air!","review":"I originally saw this program back in 96' & I loved it & missed it.

I have a feeling if it had been released today, and not in 1996, it would be an Emmy winner!!It follows the \\"families\\" of four vampire clans and their struggle to co-exist amongst themselves and humans. Their is a sweet/hot love story between their leader and the female reporter investigating their kind. As well as a love story between the leader's ex vamp love and a cop, (C. Thomas Howell).This is a great, diverse collection of gothic vampire shows.A genre one rarely sees done, much less done well on t.v. It definatly rivals any movie on the topic I've seen on the big screen! Rent it, Buy it...Watch it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"K:TE is great*","review":"*For any who follow Vampire: The Masquerade. If you have at least a passing familiarity with the subject matter, than this collection is a wonderous work of filmfiction. Even if you don't, this tale of vampires and their struggle within their own intricate politics is intriguing to say the least! The story is basic enough so as not to confuse new veiwers, but subtle enough so that V:TM's hardcore fans will not feel left out in the cold. Also, a slight note of warning. Even though this series was shown on television, I would give it a definite PG-13 rating- it's not for everybody.

Great stuff, so well written. A real trail blazer, especially for network TV.The death of Mark Frankel left such a hole, the series couldn't possibly continue, but here you have a nugget of what could have been.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aims for two crowds, finds neither.","review":"Aaron Spelling, Mark Rein-Hagen. The two should be mutually exclusive. I loved the original Vampire: The Masquerade RPG which formed the basis of this show. It's dark. It's gothic. Not \\"facial piercings and black make me Goth!\\" gothic, but \\"take an ordinary person, put them in extraordinary circumstances, and watch their decline from human to monster\\" gothic.HOW does \\"Beverly Hills, 90210\\" come to mind, here???? I mean, I can put up with poor acting. This is a little out-there to attract serious talent. Watered down setting? Sure, if the writers decide that they need to lose a clan or two in the translation to TV, I can tollerate that. But making it into a poor soap opera is unforgivable. I kept watching, hoping it'd pull through and come out well. I was sorely disappointed.There were times when I was impressed, when I could see that Mark finally got his way and said, \\"THIS is the flavor I'm shooting for\\" and didn't get stomped on. For those moments, I add a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD release without all the extra's...","review":"For those of you familar with the cancelled TV series Kindred: The embrace, excitement must have taken over when news of the DVD release hit the streets.

Never mind the hokey angst ridden dynasty ripoffs pining for human existance or posing as they discuss the masquerade. The writing was on par with bad,bad web fanfiction ('ohhhhh to never see the sun again my love!') and is considered by many to be one of the most emabarrassing and blatant projects white wolf has released. The cutscenes for Vampire:The Masquerade, Redemption have more convincing acting, more pathos in the voices, and more expressive characters...and you won't have to sit through every regurigated cutscene or soundtrack from every other vampire movie in recent history to 'enjoy' it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I is dumber for watching this.","review":"After being a huge fan of the White Wolf genre, this was enough for me to quit just so White Wolf would not have the money to authorize anything like this ever again.

DO NOT BUY IT, it is a waste of money.

The restaurant guide is adequate, but I think Bangkok is simply too hard a city to have a restaurant guide that is either current or comprehensive.On the flip side, at least one of the maps was very misleading at best or incorrect at worst. On the way to Hua Hin, the map states the highway (No. 4) goes through town, but it fact, it is a limited access expressway some 10 kilometers west of town and there is only one exit to get to Hua Hin. This caused us to take a 20+km extra trip to reach town.Overall, the guide is a compact and surprisingly effective.

The premise, a detective hired to locate the soul of a burnt out rock singer, is handled in a very mature and different way. The author takes a theme as old as the history of literature and puts a spin on it that has never (to my knowledge) been done before. His narrative style flows so beautifully that you'll finish the book after a few short hours and ask for another like it. What happens when you sell your soul? What happens if you want it back? Is there life after death? Can disillusioned people learn to love again, even at the twilight of their lives? Can an alcoholic cab driving private detective beat the devil at his own game?

I have yet to hear a collection of \\"singers\\" who warbled as badly as these people did.This album was released in the late 90's yet sounds more appropriate for the \\"hair metal\\" 80's. Why this is even called a \\"tribute\\" is beyond me. In fact, I'm not even sure why I've wasted my time including it here.About the only fun to be had is the cover of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" by Lemmy Kilmister (of Motorhead) and Ted Nugent. They sounded as if they recorded it after a night of drinking, playfully changing the lyrics around, etc.Regardless of that, this release is a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this exist?","review":"Firstly, let me clarify that this one star does not reflect my opinions on Patrick Doyle's original compositions for the Goblet of Fire, or any part of the Harry Potter series. But I don't know why this CD exists, because it has no purpose in life.For those not in the know, 'Global Stage Orchestra' is just a bunch of computers reproducing inferior synthesised renditions of their counterparts. While the original counterparts are world class compositions, performed by professional musicians on real instruments, Global Stage Orchestra just pops sheet music into a computer and robs the music of its integrity.Two stars from me, one because that's the lowest grade you can give on Amazon, one for Doyle's original score.

Yes, it has not been revised since the original printing in 1966, but the basic methods and experimental results still apply, just like they did then. The book is aimed very much at someone with a background in aeronautical engineering. It is not for the casual reader, and has nothing about the history of V/STOL flightAs an aero engineer working on the design of VTOL airplanes, its exactly what I was looking for. I give it a 4 star rating just because I dont think any textbook is worth 5 stars! ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"1967 science book republished in 1999 with no content update","review":"Warning! This book was re-published in 1999. It was first published in 1967 and there have been no updates to it's scientific information. This book has no updates for modern VTOL aircraft and modern design techniques.There is a preface by the original author, that does nothing to counter the fact that the book is way out of date in its style of presentation and lack of photos and quality diagrams.Republishing this book seems like more of a money making scheme than to provide information on V/STOL aircraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped it would be.","review":"If you're looking for some useful information on VTOL aircraft, keep looking. McCormick derives hundreds of equations, making it difficult to establish which, if any, are relevant or useful. And good luck finding the meaning of the symbols in the equations, which may have been defined several chapters earlier. This book would be best left in the classroom where an instructor could guide the student through the theory. This isn't the practical, nuts and bolts information for the hardcore VTOL enthusiast or designer. All information refers to 1960's or earlier aircraft. The V-22 is only mentioned in the preface of the new edition stating that some of the theory applies. The book has some useful information, but it's not what I hoped it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good video to use during the winter months...","review":"A good video to use during the winter months, but I prefer the RIDES North Carolina video better.Its definitely a good video for use with a spinner and helps maintain athletic motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique planning aid","review":"Although out of print and out of date, this is still a superb and unparalleled picture guide to the terrain of New Zealand.

So the day after the time frame was up, they emailed me with a confusing message about how sometimes it will take longer to ship than Amazon says, but it will take 1-3 weeks. So, I chatted with a representative who said that their warehouse could get it sent out within a week because they only have 6 left. Ridiculous. I cancelled my order. Why are they selling furniture that isn't ready to be sent out? Wouldn't have bought it if I had known that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice overview","review":"The strength of this title lies in its presentation. It earns at least one bonus star just for the example involving \\"Marvin Enterprises\\" and the production of gargleblasters. (If that statement confuses you, order Douglas Adams \\"The Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" now. It's better than Brealey-Myers, and cheaper.) The writing is truly exemplary for a 101-level text.The weakness of the book is exactly that, though: it is a 101-level text. That's fine (I guess) if you're buying this for a class, or in preparation for the SOA Finanace VEE (as I was); If you're hoping for detailed explanations of CAPM, Black-Scholes, or even the efficient market hypothesis, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This is the worst finance book I have ever seen. For a book used for a MBA finance course it is not very helpful at all. If you are not a finance genius this book is definetly a no no. The examples leave you clueless and the theory is very general. Dare to try and solve the unrealistic sample problems at the end of the chapters, and a lot of the solutions in the solutions manual are WRONG! The professor who taught the Finance class, who has been in the field all his life and has a doctorate degree in finance admits this book is garbage and not appropriate for the MBA; beacuse of this we did not even use the book for his course. This is a very expensive and huge book and so not worth the price. I learned nothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is one of my favorite of the Shadows books. If you've never read one before, this is a great place to start. I wanted to disagree with the earlier review. The heroine is not a doormat at all! Everyone around Victoria treats her like trash, and she simply exists above it all. Why bother fighting back? She knows she's a lot better than anyone gives her credit for; why does she need their approval anyway? She displays the kind of inner strength and confidence that I truly admired. She's cool, confident--to heck with all those others! Loved her, but I also loved Noel's reaction to how people treated her. A great book, a great heroine. For a heroine to admire, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine wine, Godiva chocolate, and a hot tub--need I say more?","review":"Not only was this an outstanding example of supernatural fiction, it was also an outstanding example of a romance novel. There are many things to like about this book, its quirky narrative style, the descriptions and sheer detail about werewolf nature, the fact that the heroine is \\"handicapped\\"--but probably my absolute favorite part about the book was its \\"love scene.\\" This is as non-traditional as the rest of the book, but anyone who does not melt when they imagine themselves in a jacuzzi tub having Godiva chocolate smeared on them and then licked off by the sexiest man on the planet has a harder heart than I! This is definitely not a book for people who only like formula romances, but if you're willing to take a walk on the wild side, then this book is definitely for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the three","review":"This is the second in Rebecca Flanders' (Donna Boyd) series of three, and easily the best one. The others were good, and I'm glad I got to read them (after I finished Donna Boyd's other books, I was craving for more of the same), but this one stood out as a really great read. I can't say if you have to have read her other books to get it, since I already had.

Griffin sent me another one claiming it was a fluke and the replacement didn't perform and better. On the second call to Griffin they claimed it was my car. Sure it is. I have other cigarette lighter accessories and none of them cause line noise.

It shows that it is charging my ipod and then the ipod shows that it is fully charged, but once it is unplugged it dies a few minutes later. The ipod can still be charged from other sources so it's not the ipod's fault.

What made the show great is character development and taking out 2-4 minutes of every episode takes away from that tremendously. I can even remember some of the scenes that were cut.

Some edits even cut lines that were very important to the overall storyline of the epidsodes!When buying expensive DVD sets such as this, I expect to get the entire series content: not incomplete episodes. It is more annoying to me as the syndication 'thing' doesn't happen here in the UK.I don't really care about extras, deleted scenes, interviews: all I want is to be able to watch the complete episodes, commercial-free!These edits make irritating viewing I'm afraid.

The valve has broken again after just occasional use. I am not going to replace it, I am going to get a stove top model. Also, there is about a 1/4 of an inch groove around the whole unit between the outer rim and inner liner that gets gross because it accumulates food particles and oils however it is almost impossible to clean.

I've done several Temari balls from Diana Vandervoort's first book, and had no problems. However, even doing the first one in Diamond's book left me very frustrated. She does not tell you how many rounds to make of each color, so you're left to try to count the threads from the photos.

I am currently trying to do something called a herringbone stitch, but the only reference to how to do it are very simple line drawings of the preliminary stitches. At this point I have decided to just make up my own method that will look as much like the completed ball as possible. If I was going to have to just make up my own method, though, why did I get this book?!This text would be improved significantly if the author would be more clear in her terminology (e.g. what exactly does AH refer to??) and including photographs, at least for the first pattern, of someone going through the process of making it, especially with regard to this herringbone stitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Temari","review":"I needed a book to help me with learning the techniques for this form of thread work.

Then see this movie. The characters *are* sterotypical, with the grumpy old senior editor and the zany columnist, but you know what? That's exactly what real newspapers are like.Some scenes are classics, like when Michael Keaton's character is constantly scrounging for quarters to buy a coke, or when one of the editors is complaining because he wants a specially-designed chair because of his bad back.I was a reporter when I saw this movie, and I instantly recognized all these characters as variations on the folks I worked with every day.

It's a great flick. Keaton is awesome, probably one of his better performances. Quaid, Duvall, Close, Robards and Tomei are all terrific as well, as is Howard's direction. My problem is with Amazon's description. They list it as being available in Widescreen format. It's not. It's the same version you can buy at Wal Mart for $5.00.

Finally, the story is a wonderfully energetic and often very funny account of 24 hours in the life of a New York tabloid paper--sort of like His Girl Friday updated for the 1990s.But NOBODY saw this film. Inexplicable. The Insider was similarly overlooked, and it was considerably more acclaimed. I have a theory.

The story and the writing are both excellent. However, putting these three stories in one book and saying \\"Now in one magnificient omnibus edition\\" is a crime. The first story, \\"The Pride of Chanur,\\" naturally stands alone. It should have been left as a stand-alone book. The other two stories, \\"Chanur's Venture\\" and \\"The Kif Strike Back,\\" should never have been sold as separate books in the first place: each requires the other. However, the biggest problem is that \\"The Kif Strike Back\\" requires (at least) one more book, \\"Chanur's Homecoming\\" to tie things up. So, don't expect this \\"magnificent omnibus edition\\" to complete the story. You'll definitely have to buy at least one other book.My apologies to Cherryh on this. Her writing is excellent. It's just her publisher that [is bad]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need more Chanur novels!","review":"I'll keep it short, as this is more of a \\"vote\\" than a \\"review\\".

They are addictive, as, I find, are the novels of the \\"Foreigner\\" Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!!","review":"There is really no need to review this publisher's mistake. Though it is noted that there were some revisions in this edition, they are minor, and unnoticeable and in no way make up for the lack of Chanur's Homecoming. C. J. Cherryh said that Chanur's Venture, The Kif Strike Back, and Chanur's Homecoming actually make up one book, and were broken by the publisher into three parts. To print only part of a book and call it a Saga is lying to the public. My recommendation is to pass this up and buy the whole series on the used market. You will be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic !!!!","review":"This book represents the first half of one of the best stories around. The most interesting twist for the reader is you are so immersed in the alien culture that the one human in the story is the dialog that has to be translated. The incredibly original idea of the cultures. What if Lions were the evolved species on a planet... What would they be like, what would their values be etc. To try to compare this work to any other author would be pitiful for example the Nivens stories about the Tiger men (Man Kizn Wars)pullleezz! No other author is in the same league when it comes to world building, and making plausible cultures and belief systems.Another amazing thing is Ms. Cherryh is able to keep her many books to the same universe. All the stories can eventually be patched to an understanding in another. This book is also a great essay into the aspect of lonlines of responsibility, and of being culturally alone. If you have not read this series you are in for a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great again, but should include Book 4!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading this addition to Cherryh'sUnion-Alliance universe, but was also deeply disturbed that Book 4,Chanur's Homecoming, was not included..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely outrageous and unacceptable publishing [practice]","review":"The three books combined into this single volume are part of alarger whole. Why has the publisher reprinted these three, which werealready available, and failed to reissue book four of the series, \\"Chanur's Homecoming\\"? You cannot even tell that the anthology is incomplete unless you are already familiar with it and know that the final page will leave off in the middle of a plot for which you CANNOT BUY the next chapter.This is not a criticism of the books themselves. They display Cherryh's extraordinary ability to visualize an alien society that is both skewed from and a somewhat critical commentary on our own.

These tales are a wonderous amalgamation of a bit of reading of the poorer end of Arthuriana, New Age literature, a liberal dose of odd drugs, and a sense of light fantasy.

There's a section on animal totems for midsummer but I've found better books on totems (check out Jamie Sams). Of the differnt Sabbat books, this one seems to have more spells, potions, divination and magic.

I enjoyed this one because of its twists and turns. Good insight into the politics of running the government. Pretty hairy if it's really like this and it probably is. A few inconsistencies in the story line makes me wonder where the editors were? The main one is when they emphasized how Rapp drove his wife to work and then later in the day the assassins tracked her by finding her car in the parking garage where she worked.

It is that kind of book.Since reading this, I ordered all the prior Flynn books and started in a logical release date order to come up to speed, just finishing the Fall 2008 Extreme Measures.

(Memorial Day was first) There is some need to get the sequence of when you read them right, but it is not critical.

For those of you who ahven't met Vince flynn's ultimate hero yet, shame on you. From the first page to the last, this book will keep you glued to its pages. Once again, Mitch Rapp takes politic garbage and throws it in everyone's face as he works to save this country from itself and its politicians. He is a man committed to keeping America safe, and when personal tragedy strikes, the same dedication takes him on an amazing journey to exact retribution. Vince Flynn has an unmjatched skill with words that makes you, the reader, part of the plot.

It was action packed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flynn Gets Better and Better","review":"Vince Flynn is one of those rare authors whose writing has progressively gotten better since his first successful book, not worse (cough...James Patterson...cough). His writing has become tighter, the plots never to bogged town with the always present love story and despite being deemed as sort of an espionage/action writer, he never gets carried away with an exxagerated amount of action or ridiculous plot twists. Consent to Kill is evidence of all of these characteristics. Excellent book. A few loose ends that will undoubtedly be tied up in the next addition to the Mitch Rapp series. Hope the movie rumours are true, would love to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting well written","review":"As always I enjoyed my Flynn novels.

If you like the previous works of Vince Flynn, you'll love this one too.Another good book I can recommend... Arthur Bradley's \\"Process of Elimination.\\" It's a different kind of read... about a world-class sniper out doing what we've all wanted to do on occasion... kill a few politicians. If you're looking for something really fun to read, and definitely different than the same hum-drum, give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder, revenge, and second chances","review":"Mitch Rapp is the best counter-terrorism agent in the U.S. There is no wonder that there is a twenty million dollar price tag on his head. The hired gun almost succeeds at the job. One of the killers is irrevocably changed by the job and tries to make amends. The political gamesmanship in Washington, D.C. does not stop; especially when Mitch Rapp is concerned. Mitch is an assassin but family and friends are able to glimpse his softer side. With frightening speed and efficiency, Mitch does get his revenge. An astonishing twist at the end leaves you anticipating what Mitch will do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consent to Kill was awesome!!!","review":"I just finished reading Consent to Kill and Mr. Flynn continues to impress me. I absolutely could not put this book down. It was full of twists and turns all the way through, and one particular twist was pretty surprising...;-) Most authors kind of fall off a little and their subsequent books don't fully measure up to their first, but Mr. Flynn doesn't have the problem. His books keep getting better and better and richer with plot twists and great story lines. Keep up the great work Mr. Flynn and I'll definitely keep reading. Now I'm going to download Act of Treason on my Kindle and read that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republican Propaganda","review":"This novel gets my \\"Razzz!\\" of the year award. I see all of the 5 star reviews and can only explain them by supposing that the people reading Flynn's books are looking for this particular sort of nonsense.The hero is a HERO and a one of those bully boys for the President that take care of business that can't be left to those pinkos in Congress. If you have a loose sense of reality, and are among the 29% who still give Bush a positive approval rating (perhaps a redundant statement), this is the book for you. If not give it a miss and try some Lee Child, or the new novel \\"Volk's Game\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing","review":"Since when does someone who wants to take revenge by killing his enemies have to do that by forcibly converting those enemies into living bombs? Even if they murder his Beloved Chosen, then if he wants to kill those who paid the assassins, he should do with some vague restraint, or else he is no better than they are. He could simply shoot them. But he didn't, he was ruthless and savage. The creature Mitch Rapp is nothing like my honored friend, Mr. Clancy's fictional character \\"John Clark.\\" Mitch Rapp, by contrast, is incredibly argumentative and hostile. So he spared TWO people. From this I am to conclude that he has a soul? He is little more than a ravening beast. One should not read stories about beast-people, but rather about interesting people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, dark, disturbing","review":"Consent to Kell is a re-read for me. I have read and love the entire Mitch Rapp series.I picked up the audiobook of CTK after reading Act of Treason in print. This one shows a darker, crueler Mitch Rapp, especially in the latter half of the book. No spoilers, but some of the later scenes in Abel's chalet were squicky--I squirmed listening to the chalet scene. This book is not for those who are into due process in their thrillers. But the ending quite made up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Author","review":"Ever hungry for good speculative fiction, this book was recommended to me by our Base Librarian. Starting with new (for me) authors is difficult, but not in Flynn's case. The book is believable, fast paced, and very hard to put down. Those of you who are fans of Tom Clancy will enjoy this book as well as Flynn's other offerings. It is alway gratiflying, to me, for our side to win over the bad guys and that definitely happens in this book. Consent To Kill is an excellent novel, I hightly recommend it. Don't take my word, get the book and read it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vince Flynn sets the standard","review":"If you have never had the privilege of reading one of Vince Flynn's novels, you are truly missing out. From Term Limits to Consent To Kill, Flynn has finally proven to the world that he is a force to be reckon with in the political/espionage genre. From the streets of Washington D.C. to Afghanistan, Mitch Rapp, America's top counterterrorism operative (assassin) is on the hunt to find out who took a contract out on his life. He will stop at nothing to rid this world of pure evil and with the help of an elite team, he takes the fight to his enemies and shows what true 'diplomacy' is all about ). If you enjoy a good read, this is it! Not only does Flynn weave an entertaining story, but it will also wake you up to the realities of Islamic extremism and gives you a unique insight into the minds of these terrorists. Flynn is at that top of his game and has now set the standard for what a political/espionage thriller is all about.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch Rapp Does It Again!!","review":"I recently saw Vince Flynn interviewed on television and I now know why I enjoy his books so much. He talked of the research he did for Consent to Kill, and his grasp of the world situation makes me wish he was a real director of one of our intelligence agencies with a non-politically correct congress behind him. That's a real dream. . .Mitch Rapp goes through a personal crisis in this book and it relates to his CIA activities. Director of the CIA Irene Kennedy plays an important role, as usual, as does President Hayes. I'm wondering what will happen when there's a new face in the Oval Office, and I'm assuming that is addressed in future books.Thank you, Mr. Flynn, and I highly recommend all of his books to those who love a good book with some of the real world thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start But Hooked Mid-way","review":"I have never read an VF's books before. A friend (a non-reader) couldn't put this book down, and he passed it along once he finished. Mitch Rapp is a man's man and appeals to a wide audience. VF's research into covert operations, assasins, etc. is intriguing. It's hard to explain the complexities while retaining a reader's interest, and VF does it well.The first half of the book did not have me hooked. At the midpoint though, I could not put it down. Stick with it. I will definitely get his next book once in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consent to Kill","review":"I am reading Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series in order. Consent to Kill rates very high. I enjoy the author's view of Washington Politics and the bureaucrats. Mitch Rapp's total disdain for the Washington scene together with the despicable pols portrayed in Consent to Kill and other Flynn novels mirrors our dysfunctional government."},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual...One of the BEST","review":"Vince Flynn writes better than most. If you are Politically Incorrect, then this is NOT the book for you. However, if you are an american with even the smallest amount of pride in your country and or the men and women who fight and die to preserve your freedoms, then this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Road Book","review":"This was an excellent book. I bought the audio book for a long Thanksgiving drive, and it seemed like the ten hour trip took only a few hours. It's interesting to see Rapp as the target rather than the hunter. I confess I haven't finished, but am really looking forward to the trip back home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adios Vince Flynn","review":"This is the second Vince Flynn book I couldn't get through. Memorial Day was great. Then, Term Limits was a disaster. Consent to Kill was absolutely atrocious. It seemed the entire book consisted of the assassins going back and forth trying to decide how much money they would get for killing Mitch Rapp. It read like drivel that Flynn put out to try and keep squeezing the Mitch Rapp machine. I've given him enough of my time. Mr. Flynn, I bid you farewell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"The book is very thrilling and exciting.

I HAVE READ THE PREVIOUS MITCH RAPP NOVELS AND FIND THEM GENERALLY FAST PACED AND ENJOYABLE IF NOT A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE.FLYNN IS NO NELSON DEMILLE AND RAPP MORE ONE DIMENSIONAL THAN DETECTIVE COREY BUT LATELY BETTER THAN JAMES PATTERSON'S DETECTIVE CROSS SERIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I borrowed my first Vince Flynn book from the \\"library\\" at work. I was hooked. Vince Flynn writes about the same subjects as Clancy. I have liked Clancy from the start but he is often too nitpicky about the minutia of his subject matter, often to the detriment to the story. Whereas Flynn gives just enough detail to lend credibility to his writing.Nobody doubts Clancy is an insider in the community and Flynn leaves no doubt he is one too.His stories are fast paced and a VERY good read. I recommend ANY book by him. Clancy writes about the Russian cold war, Flynn writes about the war on terror. His main character, Mitch Rapp, is undeniably a complete Bad***, I loved the Jack Ryan character, but time to retire Jack, Mitch is in town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story built on current geopolitical events","review":"With Consent to Kill, Vince Flynn presents his readers with another very compelling geopolitical thriller. Mitch Rapp and Dr. Irene Kennedy are back, along with the other characters from his previous books. The book picks up where Flynn's Memorial Day left off. Amidst another fast-paced page-turner filled with plenty of action, suspense, and geopolitical intrigue, Flynn again challenges the reader to think about how the US needs to deal with the war on terror. What rules of engagement can or should be employed? If you are a fan of Flynn's previous works, you likely know which side of the debate that Mitch Rapp occupies - especially in the wake of the attack on him and his wife. You will also not be disappointed with the latest effort. It is a great read that will keep you up at night turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vince Flynn is the BEST at this!","review":"Vince Flynn has written the perfect political thriller....you won't be able to put this one down, not even once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!","review":"These heels were one of my favorite pairs of shoes.

I read the premise of the book and thought it would be great. Instead the book is confusing and plotless. I found myself being quite bored reading this piece of fluff.

Not only does it teach me about Dale Earnhardt, it also teaches me about his competitors and how they lost to the champion. Like all biography, this book has information about his life as a child, like where he grew up, how his childhood was and. It also teaches you about his racing career, tells you about all of the championships he won, and how his family was with him racing. Believe it or not, thanks to this book I have a new person to be a fan of, this book told me about his two sons who also race. Another thing is that this book helps me under stand the racing that he did, like what the flags were, penalties, etc. All in all this biography of Dale Earnhardt teaches me about the legendary Dale Earnhardt and then some.By, Andrew"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"\\"All the Tricks...

What the book does contain is a collection of esoteric writings concerning the study of the apocryphal acts of the apostles. For example, the first real \\"chapter\\" of the book is a 35 page description of how the major editor, Francois Bovon, researched the apocryphal acts of the apostle Philip. He assures the reader that he will soon publish the subject of his research, the actual acts of Philip, in another book. The rest of the book is similar containing summaries of PhD desertations concerning the research of the apocryphal acts and very little description of the actual acts.

It's not worth 30 dollars, I wish I would not have purchased it and do not reccomend it.
