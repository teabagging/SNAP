I got a book with dull black and white line sketches of a few B&Bs and the author's extremely brief guide to attractions in the area.

A good buy for a short term amusement.In the game, you are able to build plot-like fields of farms with varying types of crops, like strawberries or grains. What you want to plant will depend on where you are located in the U.S. (which you choose at the beginning). Little icons appear to show you if you have pests or other problems with your crops. You can apply chemicals by tractor or plane. I never could get the crop duster to work very well, though. Then you harvest and can sell immediately or wait till the price goes up. But the price might go down, or you might wait too long and your crop will spoil.Personally, I'd probably buy another Sim-type game over this one. It is quite outdated for today's graphics and sounds, and is not very complex. For the time, it wasn't too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Game","review":"This game is boring!

It comes with a plastic boombox that plays two songs, cute little bunny slipers that can be worn by Moondancer (The pony included) and some cool curlers that can really add temporary curls to your pony's hair! The set also includes a plastic cellphone, 2 plastic tumblers and a lemon/lime drink, a bowl of popcorn, pink teddy bear and a soft pink blankie to wrap up your pony in.

A splendid mixture of a government science project gone wrong, Special Forces operations, the CIA and the army. When genetically enhanced creatures, Synbats, escape from their creators and raise havoc with anyone in their path, Riley's team is assigned to clean up the mess. Terrific plot, great characters, nifty dialog, plenty of explosive action and some really creepy scenes with the creatures lurking in the shadows and sewer tunnels in Chicago. A good blend of action, dialog and comradeship. This would make a great action movie if handled right. Find this series if you enjoy action adventure books with a twist. The books are hard to find in some cases, but they are out there. Check out Mayer's other books, The Gate and The Line (written as Bob McGuire) for more splendid action novels.

One reviewer commented that he wouldn't call it the greatest game ever, and he's right. But I will say that this game, years later, is still one of my absolute favorites. I've been waiting for a space combat sim to come out that's at least half as good as Freespace 2. Unfortunately, they don't really make them much anymore, and those that I've seen don't look nearly as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great door knobs/levers","review":"We replaced all our door knobs with these at our home, and then a few years later at our cabin.

All of the performances in this seventeen-disc set are immaculately played and perfectly performed. His vision, technicality, and sensibility make him a sensitive and authoritative interpreter of J.S. Bach's organ works. The records are mostly digital, crystal clear, and quite powerful. Hurford's command of his technique is astounding. I cannot stress how important this set truly is. I HIGHLY recommend buying this compilation. At about 8 dollars a CD, this is most certainly a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great CD sets of all time","review":"Like another reviewer here I grew up on Helmut Walcha's DG set on LP, and was also familiar with a number of other \\"great Bach organ work\\" collections.One can cavil over the way Hurford takes some of the pieces, I suppose, but his flair, imaginative registrations, and sheer musicality are hard to beat, and the recording too is fantastic.It's quite easy to listen to three or four CDs from this set in a row, which says something about how fertile Bach's imagination, but also how absorbing Hurford's performance, and how willing he is to avoid generic and worthy church-like interpretations. This is music and music-making of the highest quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly brillant","review":"This is Bach at his finest. And you won't find better recordings of Bach's greatest masterpieces.

I hated Socum the map was just to complicated and it took forever to load. The graphics were great but the game Conflict Desert Storm 2 is perfectly solid. There not the best graphics in the world but they hold up better than any other war game ive seen yet. You can expect better graphics since it is on the Gamecube, and sound. Actually when I think about it the sound is amazing in this game no sound glitches no hiccups or problems with the cd. Im really far in the game and ive been playing single player and multiplayer. This game has the best frame rates per second for a war game. The multiplayer has no drop in frame rates nor any graphic dissolution for having two screens. The Co-op mode is worth it. There are so many guns and ways to take out the enemy that it doesn't get boring. Actually it is kinda hard but you will learn quickly if you keep at it. This is the best war game yet.

I found this to be a very unstable, inconvenient and somewhat dangerous design. It is necessary to arrange the pots carefully to maintain the balance. Removing a heavy pot from one side of the rack tends to cause that side to flip up and the remaining pots to slide to the opposite side, often resulting in several pans crashing to the floor. For rarely used items it might be suitable but it doesn't work well for pots that will need to be removed & replaced frequently. I used this pot rack for about 2 years but finally replaced it with a much sturdier wall mounted model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like most bands change for the worst...","review":"Most rock bands start off real good and then drastically change their music causing crappy albums like this.

This album is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"Great album. Standard tuned guitars and more traditional chord progressions make this effort a bit more 'pop' than there previous albums which were tuned down a 1/2 step and had a bit of a darker feel. Even though some may consider it little more radio-friendly; giving the band much deserved exposure; those from days past, myself included, will definitely enjoy it. I started listening back in '97/98 and this is just as good as 'Tip' and 'Greyest of Blue Skies'. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just lacking something...","review":"It's not that this album doesn't sound like anything they've done previously - I enjoy creativity and variety in everything I listen to. However, this album is just really lacking something and seems very derivative, especially when you consider how interesting their other three efforts were. All the soul seems to have gone out of this band, they're going through the motions but it's just not registering or breaking through. Let's hope the next album has something worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more paralyzers?","review":"I love Paralyzer.. it has a harder sound to it which I was hoping to hear on the rest of the album. Unfortunately, I only liked the first track and found the rest to be a bit of a disappointment. Seems like \\"Paralyzer\\" should have been done by Disturbed. The only reason I gave the album a 2 was because it has one song I can't get enough of. Otherwise, it's a zero. Generic and poor lyrics = radio friendly. Not what I'm looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy \\"Paralyzer\\" as a single.","review":"I'd heard some of Finger Eleven's earlier work, and thought there was some potential there. When \\"Paralyzer\\" started playing, I really liked the sound, picked it up, and played the CD on the way home.It was something of a let down, as the CD was not cohesive and no other songs stood up to the expectations the single created.The album's not BAD, it's just BLAND.I'd say stick to the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"With the exception of the first song, \\"Paralyzer\\", this whole album felt completely generic.

I snore lyrics like these in my sleep. And how about: \\" This club could close in three weeks; that would be cool with me\\". I'm sorry, but these lyrics are really corny. Maybe they have other good songs up their sleeves. When I hear one on the radio, I'll think about purchasing one of their future albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"F11 lost their edge","review":"So these guys are getting older, more mature, and lighter. This wasn't a huge problem with their last album, which is WAY lighter than their previous efforts and a great collection of songs. However, the boys from Canada seem to be moving away from rock altogether. Don't get me wrong, the album has a few good songs on it, but it also has an equal amount of filler tracks, a problem they never experienced on their first three records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As much as I loved the first track I was hopeful about the rest of the CD. However, the remaining 10 songs were pretty slow. There were only about 4 that were okay. The other 6 in my opinion were not good. It's disappointing. I absolutely loved the first song, perhaps other CDs of theirs are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fozzy's new CD destroys this.....similar vibe but way better songs","review":"Fozzy's new CD All That Remains Reloaded was similar in approach vocally, yet Jericho believe it or not is a far more interesting singer and has better melody.

Check out the Fozzy CD and do yourself a favor........."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 songs i like","review":"This was an okay album only 2 songs i like and thats falling on and paralyzer the rest did'nt interest me, so this was an okay album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"I waited a long time for this album and what a bad surprise when i heard it for the first time too pop too light and only two inspired songs.Please go back into studio now to make a real album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good ...","review":"I've listened to this album many times, and just can't get into it. It's very generic, and sounds like everything else nowadays on the radio. If you're looking for something better, try Chevelle's newest album, or even old Iron Maiden. In my opinion, Finger Eleven is a waste of your precious listening time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Originality???","review":"For all of you who like the song paralyzer...I can't believe this band copied this exact song beat from Franz Ferdinand-Take Me Out....seriously listen to both songs its hilarious.

However, I also think that Finger Eleven is completely underated. Strong groove that flows with the vocals....they finally got it right, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected!","review":"After seeing lukewarm reviews, I went into this with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised! The songs were not all \\"One Thing\\" imitations, but rather the band has gone in a different directly with their music. Two of the songs even have a slight 'twang' to them, and while I despise country music, the 'twang' works well on this CD.Ironically, Amazon has paired this with Chevelle's latest, and those two CD's are currently my top two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Greyest of Blue Skies Instead","review":"If you want to hear Finger Eleven at their absolute best you have to listen to \\"Greyest of Blue Skies\\". There were so many modern rock songs on that cd that should have been radio release hits it's not even funny. They never got the exposure they deserved when \\"Greyest of Blue Skies\\" was out. Their first cd under the name Finger Eleven was \\"Tip\\" and it was great as well. I caught them live with CREED back in the \\"Greyest...\\" days and they were great. I just don't care for the new sound that these guys have developed. They are a super band but I am stuck on the \\"Greyest of Blue Skies\\" cd!!!! It's totally different than anything else they have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORROW A FRIEND'S!!!","review":"I have, with this purchase, bought 3 dogs in the past month.

Save your money!!! I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder, as everyone should know","review":"The only valid reason to buy this disc is for \\"Paralyzer\\"; it's the one semi-original, decent tune on the entire disc, and if you're familiar with how the mainstream record industry works, you'll know that's all you should expect. They'll milk one song, push the record on the strength of that given song ad nauseum until not even the one song is listenable, then move on to the next victim.

I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the \\"what does the world look like\\" story and she falls asleep before it is finished. She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her. I highly recommend this to every parent! It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 15 month old daughter loves this.","review":"I recently bought the Dreamscape Soother and I wish I would of bought it months ago. My daughter can turn it on herself and she loves loves to listening to twinkle twinkle little star.

Well, she loves it so much, she wants to touch the screen. As soon as we leave the room, she ends up turning it off!I think LeapFrog could have put the Start button somewhere a little harder for babies to get to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to change the battery too often","review":"I do not know why so many people give it a 5 star. I've been using the soother for almost a year now. It was ok at the beginning, but when she can turn it on an off, it drains out the battery too often. We end up changing battery almost every week - not only wasting money but also causing us trouble. My daughter is so attach to it and got annoyed when battery is running out. We have to rush to change the battery and put her back to sleep. Drama happens every few days and it's driving us crazy.If I know what's going to happen, I would choose a simpler sleeping assistent toy for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st time mom","review":"This is a big waste of money. I bought this to help soothe my little one to sleep but he would put his fingers up to touch the light and kept on turning it off. The play switch is right at the bottom. It also uses up quite a bit of batteries. Don't bother buying this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy, returned toy. Not worth it!","review":"The idea is nice, but it drained a fresh batch of batteries within a couple of days and not that much use. Features were not that great either. Totally not worth it in my opinion. Very dissapointed.I have tried other products by LeapFrog and have been very impressed by them, not sure what happened here."},{"rating":"2","title":"My toddler loves it!!","review":"I bought this for my soon to be born daughter and my 25 month old loves this toy. She loves watching the story setting which has her favorite animals.. a lion, bird and whale. She also loves her favorite song twinkle twinkle little star setting. She jumped into bed lastnight and watched it and fell asleep. Also tonight. I am impressed that this has helped so much with her sleeping on her own. I am grateful for this toy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-saver for sleepless parents","review":"According to the book, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth, it is necessary to teach your baby to fall back to sleep on their own. The Dreamscape Soother was invaluable!My oldest daughter learned to turn her Dreamscape Soother on by herself at night at six months and my second at 9 months. I rarely had to get up and get them in the middle of the night after using this Soother and following Marc Weissbluth's tips. My girls are now 1 1/2 & 2 1/2 and are healthier with good sleep habits.Downside - Soother's moving parts lasted a little less than 2 years, then we had to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality","review":"We love LeapFrog products and thought we couldn't go wrong with this crib toy...however the image quality of the scrolling pictures is murky at best, not at all vibrant or appealing. We returned and opted for the Fisher Price Flutterby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies Will Love It, And So Will You!","review":"My grandmother brought the Dreamscapes Soother for my then two month old. My daughter was having difficulties sleeping alone in her crib, so my husband and I decided to try the Soother. As soon as we turned it on during one of her crying bouts, she calmed and became attentive to the toy. After the first positive experience the Dreamscapes Soother became a part of her bedtime routine.Now that my daughter is almost four months old and finally used to sleeping in her crib, we do not use the toy as a part of the bedtime ritual. Instead she has mastered the art of turning the toy on by kicking her little foot! Therefore, the Dreamworks Soother has changed from a calming item to a form of entertainment. I would recommend it to every parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big brother stole it from his baby sister!","review":"I bought this for my baby while still pregnant and put it in his/her crib. My 18-month old kept wanting to get in the baby's crib to watch the movie and would sometimes spend an hour at a time in there. When we decided to get rid of my son's pacifier at 22 months, we took this toy out of our baby girl's bed (she wasn't very interested in it) and put it in our son's bed one night. He instantly forgot about his pacifier (had never slept without it- always grabbed it the second we put him in bed) and turned on his movie. Never fussed for one minute. Pacifier is gone and two months later he still settles in watching his movie. Worked like a charm. (Don't worry - I replaced baby sister's toy with a crib mirror w/ rattles and she loves it!) I do agree with some of the other reviews that it eats batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to par","review":"I am a faithful Leap Frog buyer. I own and love all of their products...except this one. We brought the first one home and after one day the thing must have shorted out or something because it would drain brand new batteries in a matter of minutes. So that was returned and on the second one we brought home, the screen stopped moving after two days. This toy was not getting strenuous or unusual use, it was strapped to the crib, so I cannot explain the malfunctions. I do know I returned it and got the trusty aquarium one I had with my first two children. I am extremely disappointed as I have never experienced any trouble with any other Leap Frog product. Hopefully they will work out the quirks and bring us yet another wonderful toy in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soother was a Godsend! Both kids used it for 3 years each!","review":"This crib toy held up well through both of my childen! We got 6 years of use from it and my kids were CONSTANTLY playing it in their cribs. My son even had me move it to his toddler bed when he outgrew the crib. Both kids turned it on and watched it to fall asleep. WHen they woke up in the night I'd hear them hit the play button and the music start.It gently gets quieter and the light softens toward the end of its cycle. Other soothers turned off suddenly and would cause the baby to wake!I bought this for 2 other new moms as it was SO perfect and useful for getting kids to sleep. My only complaint is that it burns through batteries (4 \\"C\\" sized) and I had to replace them at least once a month. It got expensive but it was worth how well it soothed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only got better :)","review":"My mother bought this for my son when he was 2 weeks old. He would stare at it and the light only option was nice to checkon him. I love that it has different songs and options liek story or songs or music. It sounds nice and works great. Now we wake up to it - he wakes up and put it on every morning so we hear that over the monitor. I dont have a bad thing to say about this. It stays on a long time so you dont have to keep pushing it to keep it playing. It turns off nice and easy as well. It is colorful and batteries last while in it. I have only changed then once and my son is now over 6 months old. Highly recommend this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought - SCARED my baby!","review":"This isn't for all babies. My baby loves to watch TV so I was hoping that this would keep his interest and lull him to sleep while he was in the crib. The first time I turned it on he screamed and cried. He was terrified! I tried holding him while he got used to it, but he just hates it. Some babies may not mind, but I think the the voice is pretty scary. The lights dim and it has good volume control, but the quality of the picture is not what I expected from Leap Frog. Buy with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy... But Buy Cheap Batteries","review":"we bought this toy for our baby and he LOVES it. The only problem we have is it went through the brand new batteries in FOUR DAYS!!!! He only used it at night, so it was not used THAT much. My husband and I even go to sleep with the story and music, and our baby will turn it on at night and go back to sleep by himself, so is a plus there also. The story and music are great and very soothing so I can't say I would not have bought it even if I knew about the batteries, but I would surly buy the cheaper batteries because it will not matter as far as how long the toy will work and it is not as hard on your wallet. My choice was to buy cheap batteries every time I went to the store and stock up.(Our local Wal-Mart sells a 4 pack of batteries for $.97 so try there for a good price) It is worth it to me because my son loves this so much. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have bought two aquariums!","review":"i bought this thinking it would be so great. First of all it did not fit on the end of the crib so we had to put it on the back side and at the time we still had the matress up high, we thought that would work until in the middle of the night my baby rolled into it and turned it on! uhggggg what a nightmare. It woke me and both babies up ( dad slept thought it all of course ). So the next day I took it out of the crib and put it away. Now the boys are 11 months old and the matress is lowered so I put it up again. My other baby has the aquarium one in his crib and has a blast with it in the mornings and my other baby just stares at him because his toy is out of batteries. Also the aquarium one has little buttons that they can play with and the soother doesnt. So even when the other one is out of batteries it can still be played with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Soothing About It","review":"Not worth the money. There was nothing soothing about it. Plus, it's a royal pain put it together and get it on and off the crib.If you want something great, buy the First Years CD player that clips on the crib. It has a dim light that you can put on at night. We put in James Taylor Greatest Hits and she's a new baby! We finally got her to fall asleep in her crib (after 8 months), and we owe it all to the CD player and some wonderful, soothing music."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is awful!!!","review":"The light on this is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too bright. There is no way to adjust the light. The music sounds funny. The woman signing has a scarey voice. I returned this item immediately. It is not worth the money at all. I've told people at stores that I've seen with this item to not bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware!","review":"I love this soother for my 7 month old son. The story and songs are lovely and calming.The sound quality is excellent. Beware of the need for many, many batteries. The four C's die faster than you'd believe. I guess this is the SUV of toys...Very reliable but costs in the gas department! I recommend it anyway- all my son's toys are battery super-suckers.He really enjoys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Leapfrog fan, but I hate this soother!","review":"I have several other Leapfrog items and love them, but this one had to go back. The music selection is good, but the quality isn't there. My biggest complaint is that every time you turn it on, the light comes on and starts the \\"slideshow\\" which is run by a very noisy motor. You can turn off the slideshow once it's on, but it's still enough noise to startle my sleepy baby. My older child had a crib toy that also had a motor such as this for another purpose, but was nowhere near as loud. This proved to be too much of a distraction for me and my child, so we are now off to find a new crib toy/soother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Leap Frog","review":"We have the Leap Frog Discovery Ball and Baby Tad. Our little guy loves both of them. The Baby Tad nighttime sequence with the blinking lights and music is pretty good unfortunately 6 minutes it is too short. I thought that the Dreamscapes Soother would be of the same quality but it is NOT. The sound is of poor quality. The light does not dim as the instructions state. The brightness is too much of a distraction for baby to fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"For older babies!!!","review":"I thought that since I was buying a Leap Frog item that I would be happy, boy was I wrong! My son sleeps on his tummy, so that could be a reason for my displeasure of the toy; but the main things that I don't like it is the knob to turn the toy on, and also the overall size of it. It's so bulky that if my son moves to close to the bumper he could hurt his head. It's defintely a battery drainer! And the sound doesn't go up high enough. I was going to buy the fisher price aquarium sounds but instead I went with the dreamscapes soother, BIG MISTAKE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"never never land","review":"I love the dreamscapes soother it helps keep my son from waking up when we move him from his swing to his bed. I only gave it 3 learning stars because while it speaks other languages it is geared towards helping to put your child to sleep rather than teach them something. It definitley serves it's purpose in our house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love this product. It helps my baby to fall asleep without a big fuss. I found it easy to put together and attatch to the crib and the music is great. I love how it has traditional songs from other countries."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT purchase","review":"We purchased this for our 8 month old boy. He loves it. He never wanted to be left alone in this crib before but now he likes to lie there and look at the moving pictures and listen to the music. You can choose between playing lullabys, songs, stories, or nighttime music which also has soothing talking such as \\"Goodnight nose, Goodnight toes....\\" There is a dial to turn the volume louder or softer with many settings in between. The light can be turned off so it is possible to listen without any pictures.We used the crib aquarium for this baby and our previous one, and although that is an excellent product, if you want to choose between them, choose this one! Excellent value for money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will spend more on batteries!!!!!!!","review":"Overall, the Dreamscapes soother is wonderful in terms of the music/lullabies, etc. BUT, I find myself changing batteries once a week! The unit takes 4 C batteris which need to be replaced constantly. My daughter naps twice a day; I turn the unit on three times a day (before her nap and before bedtime). That's all, and enough for the unit to drain the batteries in a week! Another reviewer complained of the unit's positioning potentially hurting the baby. This is true. If the baby can sit up he/she can knock his/her head with the bottom edge.All in all, I wish I had purchased something else primarily b/c now my daugher loves the fables, music, and the little figures scrolling on the screen but I am stuck buying batteries and unscrewing the unit once a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY THESE!!!","review":"I paid full price for these at Best Buy, and I have already returned one pair to the manufacturer that literally fell to pieces in my hands for no reason. Now my second pair has abruptly stopped working too; the sound cut out for no reason in one ear. They were working fine 24 hours ago when I was wearing them in bed to watch something on my computer. I put them on my desk, put them on last night to wear them out of the house, and all of a sudden Houston, we have a problem.Not only are the headphones themselves awful; the people at the company are awful too. I got into a fight with the guy who was in charge of orchestrating the first replacement because they forced me to pay my own shipping to get the headphones replaced.I simply cannot say enough terrible things about this product and this company. I will never buy Phillips again as long as I live, and I heartily encourage others to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy!","review":"Really awful headphones, this is my third time replacing them! The connection to the mini jack shorts after awhile and the swivel where the speakers attach to the head band breaks apart.. Happend three times to the same model.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strategic, Involved, and Easy-to-Beat","review":"SimAnt is an excellent simulation of ant battle, but is easy to beat and the sound and graphic quality is poor. Basically, you're an ant in a colony trying to destroy the red ants. A spider (which somehow shoots lasers occasionally, don't ask me) and ant lions are among the existing perils. It's pretty involved, with mating, behavior control, and foraging. These can be left alone (except the first), but it can be tougher without them. The full-game mode, the only one that I find worthwile, is too easy to beat and involves a simple strategy. I recommend this primarily for people who like strategy games."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fun game","review":"this game is really cool! i have a lot of fun controlling the ant and killing those disgusting red things [ants]. i also like exchanging into the spider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sim Ant","review":"I remember playing Sim Ant when I was a kid. It was a load of fun, and for its age and time, I thought it was a brilliant and outstanding game. Now, it didn't help me pass biology in high school or even zoology in college, but it did help pass the hours of boredom. Basically, for such a low price, it will grab your kids attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Do It","review":"I ordered The Assassins' Gate after seeing the author interviewed on The Daily Show. It sounded like a great book for learning the inner workings of the Iraq Debacle. Unfortunately, after the first few pages I was dazed and confused. Too much information. Too many names, dates, etc. Too many trains planes and automobiles. I almost always finish every book that I start. I feel ver yguilty if I don't finish a book I've started. So this one sat next to my bed, and I dreaded going to back to it, because I knew, deep inside that I wouldn't be able to get through it. I just knew it. That realization brought up feelings of guilt and embarrassment. Was I not smart enough to read a work of historical non-fiction? Am I just a novels guy? The book sat there and sat there until finally I came to a resolution in my head and said, \\"OK, I am putting this aside. I'm not reading it.\\" I felt bad, becasue I really WANTED to get teh inside story on why we're in Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book by noted expert on Iraq","review":"The Assassins's Gate by Gearge Packer is a great read if you want to inform yourself abour recent historical developments that led to the United States getting involved in the Iraq war.There is information in this book that I was not aware of, that while it doesn't in any way justify our involement or invasion in Iraq, does show what the reasoning was for our being there.In some ways, the book is an indictment of the Bush administration, but not a total condemnation either.If you want to get informed what this war is really all about, to see the facts laid out with clarity, then I would definately recommend this book to you. On the other hand, if you are on some kind of witch hunt against the bush administration, you will be somewhat disappointed, be cause it is not that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Assassins' Gate: America in Iraq","review":"I saw the author interviewed on television and the interviewer was so positive about the book, I had to order it. I have a son in Iraq and I needed to understand what we are doing over there. This book should be a must for everyone, especially for other mothers and fathers who are trying to understand why their son and/or daughter is fighting halfway around the world. Mr. Packer takes you back to origins of our modern involvement in Iraq which I found very interesting. It is an easy read and I found it extremely informative. I was surprised that it was also a very objective and unbiased look at our involvement in Iraq. I've recommended it to all my family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than I thought","review":"I thought that this book would give me a deailed history and analysis of our involvement in Iraq. It does, but not in the way I was expecting.Rather than a dry, analytical overly critical account, it is a detailed, at times impressionistic, narrative that focuses on wha happened after we \\"accomplished our mission.\\"After reading this all I can say is \\"Boy, did we ever F**k Up\\"And the sad fact is that both the Americans who are dying in the war and the Iraqi people are the ones who are paying the price for our total lack of understanding of what we were doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and remarkably non-partisan","review":"This book changed my view of the war in Iraq. Prior to reading it, I had been against the very idea of it. Thanks to Mr. Packer's adept reporting and analysis, it's now clear to me that removing Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do. However, almost every single choice by this administration in conducting this war has been wrong with deadly consequences. My only wish, with regards to this book, is that Mr. Packer could write a sequel, now that Iraq is devolving into actual civil war (this week anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Folly in Iraq","review":"I found this book a confirmation of what I researched and believed before we declared war on Iraq, and, at the same time extremely disturbing. I had to set the book down from time-to-time because of the anger I felt over the blunders made by the Bush/Cheney cabal. Packer's book is a MUST READ for those willing to look at the neoconservative movement. And, I say \\"willing\\" because it seems so many want to buy into that which is told them, rather than do the necessary research. \\"Faith at War\\" by Yaroslav Trofimov is yet another disturbing, but rational book by someone who spent years in the Middle East taking a pulse of the citizenry. I fear the American pysche will have much to pay in years to come, not to mention the ongoing billions of dollars needed to reconstruct (if this is possible) Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good insight into the history of the war","review":"I found the author's journey from pre to post war an interesting insight into how high hopes ended in disaster.A good book to understand some of the detail behind the war, however I would probably suggest that the book Fiasco is a more comprehensive read. This book covers a lot of the same themes, but Fiasco has a lot more detail and supporting evidence.One area this book lacks compared to Fiasco is the later years of the war (2005 onwards) where it is very obvious from the commentary that information is coming much more 3rd hand rather than from direct experience. This is directly related to the security situation on the ground and although it is understandable that the author didn't want to put themself in harms way it does take away from the rest of the book which is very engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book was good. It was a little all over the place but he did a good job in the end explaining our entrance into the war in Iraq and mostly about Iraqis. I feel as if I have a much better understanding of their situation. It doesn't make you feel any better about American foreign policy in the 21st century though."},{"rating":"2","title":"DG is correct, but...","review":"I agree with DG (\\"Engaging arguments, but I'm not sold, March 30, 2006\\") but Packer does provide thoughtful insights into the daily lives of Iraqis and documents the multiple omissions and errors committed by the Bush administration. I strongly recommend reading this book for its background information on this horrible war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming soon to a course syllabus near you.","review":"Mr. Packer has written a book as fair and balanced as one could reasonably hope to come out of such a politically charged and divisive war. There are no cartoonish superheroes, and more importantly no supervillians. Packer endeavors less to point fingers than he does to knife through the fog. The decisions that led up to and followed \\"major combat operations\\" are examined from every possible perspective: the white house, pentagon, state department, Iraqi exiles, the CPA, our troops and above all the Iraqis themselves, whether Kurd, Sunni, Shia, pro- or anti-American. This is as fine and troubling a book as I've read in quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If you want to know about Iraq, The Assassins Gate is the book to read.\\"","review":"The title of this review is a quote from a friend, an US Army Brigadier General who has done a couple of tours in Iraq. And he is right. As Gary Trudeau of Doonesbury fame has said, \\"The Iraq War has been chronicled by some great literature.\\" I agree that Cobra II, Fiasco and Imperial Life in the Emerald City all are good reads and paint vivid pictures of both the glaring mistakes and overshadowed successes that have made up the invasion and first years of the occupation. In this book, George Packer does it at a level that seems to breathe Iraq itself. At times incredibly painful to read, this book can give one a nuanced understanding of the country that the others don't often attempt. For the most part, their focus is on the actions of Americans. Mr. Packer takes it all in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!! Required reading to understand the Iraq war","review":"Reminds me of \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" by Thomas Friedman in that I didn't want to put it down and its 480 pages flew by. I expect that it will also stand the test of time and also be considered a classic - required reading in regards to the Iraq war. It is carefully researched and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Book on Iraq","review":"George Packer has written a masterpiece that speaks volumes! The book details the events that contributed to America's entering the War in Iraq and portrays the keyplayers involved. I even got a chance to hear him speak recently and he is extraordinarily down to earth. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking honesty","review":"This book is heartrending in its honesty and devastating in its delivery. This is the truth about how we got to Iraq and what we have done to the Iraqis (not to mention to ourselves) in pursuing our latest and most shameful foreign adventure since Vietnam; I had to suspend reading for a few days in the middle of the book because of nausea.Packer's indictment of the Bush administration's means and motives is damning. If you read no other history of the present conflict, read this one, and ask yourself what we are going to have to do to prevent it ever happening again.I hope Packer writes a sequel in a couple of years, so we can all learn the truth about the end of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armchair Quarterback","review":"Well researched but naive, overly-simplistic, tedious and repetitive. According to the author, there was not a single good decision made with respect to Iraq. If only the Bush Administration would have listened to the people he interviewed, things would have turned out just fine. There -- I just saved you ten bucks and eight hours of reading. You're welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent for the price but HDMI easy to break off","review":"I too had the same issue where the HDMI connector broke off from the plate. It's very gently attached via 2 tiny screws to a thin piece of plastic. It broke off the second time I attempted to close the plate to the housing behind.It is working but loosely, so if I wiggle the cable that goes to the receiver a little too much, it can slip off to the back.A tip while doing this project is to make sure you get a fairly deep housing and get HDMI cables that have the smallest connector as possible. The HDMI connector on this wall plate would have less chance to break if my housing had more room so that it won't stick out so much and putting so much pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with the stampfers","review":"This game is good and gets boring, though it is exremely addictive.

I've played them all (some only in teaching my nephew the fine art of being a SimAddict). This particular game was dull (there's so much stuff that could have been done with it - but wasn't). You only get a single perspective of the building and the main challenge (rather easily mastered) is to manage elevator service. I could think of a variety of perks that could have been put in to the building to make this game more interesting... but in the end you end up feeling like a slum-lord as you create this monster tower with no character to it.

There's no way to not be bankrupt in this game! The view [stinks], you can't even turn and see the side. graphics, you can't tell if your in a book or not. the drawings are so flat! I'd rather get my thumbs chopped off then rate this game with them. If your planning to buy it, you shouldn't. (I'm a Sim collector, I played em' all). Beileve me you really shouldn't.

But the game goes down hill from there. Getting enough population to gain another star goes from hard to downright impossible. But the worst aspect is how they tried to make the game a little more difficult by having everyone leave every couple weeks. When you get a pretty good sized tower, this makes getting everyone to move back in a pain and plunges you into debt and a lack of population. Not fun. The game is all together dull, frustrating and tedious. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sim Tower ... !","review":"If you don't have this game don't buy it. I bought it.

As you build, your population grows larger. You start with $2,000,000 and as your population grows so does your fund. As you achieve higher ratings (1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star, 5 star, and \\"the tower\\"), you can build more things. To be awarded the stars needed to get 5 stars and higher you have to meet certain requirements. You can name 20 people and 20 tenants. This game takes a few months so it will pass time. It is also a good game if you like only small amounts of pressure. As you journey on your trip to a \\"the tower\\" ranking you take up many challanes. Keeping good evaluation and dealing with terrorists who will go to any level to charge you money. But you might not have to pay them, if you have good security. I think this would be a good game to have because of all of the traits listed above. So consider it when you want a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldy but a goody.","review":"I think Sim Tower suffered by virtue of the fact although it was highly inventive, engaging and fun; it looked old fashioned, awkward and silly in a short space of time.Had it been released in a time when computer technology was not so rapid in it's change and advancement then it may have had a chance to become a classic game.That said, in my opinion it is a bit of a gem and really quite subtly educational. It has it's faults and flaws but they are part of the fun really. A tip I would offer is to leave it running overnight to build up building funds. You may return to minor disasters, flea bitten hotel rooms, fires, bombs, out of business stores; but you will have the capital to remedy the situation and do some more building. Some good old fashioned kind of computer fun if that can indeed be said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have game","review":"Simtower is a challenging and entertaning strategy game.

Instead, they concern the procedural and practical aspects of Church life. People wonder whether a non-Catholic is permitted to receive Holy Communion under any circumstances; whether a priest can write and use his own prayers in celebrating Mass; and what's involved in the \\"annulment\\" process.All of these issues involve church law, but most educated Catholics don't know where to look for the answers. In this book, Pete Vere and Michael Trueman have brought their gifts of organization and clarity to the subject. Their 150 questions and answers, based on the Church's canon law and liturgical law, get to the point, while also explaining the Church's intention behind each point of law.

Get a fleet of ships or even a single ship, control it, kill stuff, whatever. A true Capitol Ship Combat game. This is not. Maybe its supposed to be. The controls are hard to figure, the instructions read like something from a TechEngineer, and it has more bugs than an ant hill. Example: going into combat, no damage, red alert, etc. MY WEAPONS WON'T FIRE! Or better yet, I take a hit reported to be only sheild damage, no hull damage, then I try to make a high-speed turn so I can fire back, AND ALL SYSTEMS FAIL! Not to mention, I still can't tell the other ships what to do except \\"attack at will\\" or \\"run away\\". Even after following the instructions, letter by letter!

This game is sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trek Lover, Game hater.","review":"I really anticipated the release of this game, as all Gaming Magazines had rated this game off the charts! After purchasing the game, I went through the tutorials, and read the entire instruction booklet. I found the ship relatively easy to control, and figured out all of the controls fairly easily. The graphics were spectacular! What I didn't like was the boring game play, and graphics glitches, ie. Flying right into a planetkiller, and no damage to your ship. The gameplay was boring because of an excessive lack of a GOOD storyline. Whoopee, Decker's on the loose. That was about it. They could have made the mission briefings 10x better. There basically was none. How about having the capability to go to warp speed. INTERPLAY- TRY COMBINING AN RPG, AND A COMBAT SIM WITH A GOOD STORYLINE AND THE SAME GRAPHICS QUALITY FROM THIS GAME. IT WOULD BE HUGE! Also, I felt there was absolutely ZERO replayability. Overall, I give it a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm one of those weirdos who likes this game...","review":"Starfleet Command (SFC) is an incredibly deep starship combat game-if you can call it a game.

It has lots of races and ships to choose from and it has really good graphics(if you has the reccomended system requirements. If you only have the basic requiments if runs slow and the graphic are really not as good.) The game ends pretty short if you win about 10 missions in a row. There are also lots of good cheats for this game. You can had lots of power so that you can have everything on your ship up to full. I would recomend it if you like Star Trek."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"For me it works fine, i was expecting something else but it delivers. However i do have to agree on three defects on it, The Torps only hit once every 10 shots, The graphics are sometimes poor, for example you can see the deflector from the top of the saucer of a Federation ship. And the lack of Warp capability. We need warp, what's a ST sim without warp ? But the game has it's good points, the music is nice, the sounds are awesome the interface is kinda cool and the 3d effects are nice. I would recommend to try it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italo-Gaelic folk","review":"La Grande Famiglia is a spectacular recording by the Modena City Ramblers. It represents perhaps the height of their Irish orientation, after which they begin to introduce more South American (Terra e Liberta) and rock/reggae (Fuori Campo) influences. La Grande Famiglia, however is a wonderfully balanced and diverse album, ranging from beautiful ballads, such as \\"Canzone dalla Fine del Mondo\\" and \\"Al Dievel\\", to foot-stomping sing-alongs like \\"Banda del Sogno Interrotto\\". And while the music is usually distinctly Irish (plus an accordian or two), they maintain a strongly Italian orientation, writing songs about the partisans in WWII and anti-Mafia activists, and covering folk singer Francesco Guccini's \\"La Locomotiva\\". All in all, this is a vibrant, fun album and a great introduction to the Ramblers' music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun","review":"My 3 year old son got this for Chritmas and hasn't stopped playing with it.

A young infant's interest is not held by the very, very small light green lights. I've had other toys meant for babies to lie on their backs and enjoy...this is NOT one of them. They can't reach the hanging objects and it really is too boring for them. Again, an older baby of 7 months or so can enjoy the unit as a floor toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ebough!","review":"When I first saw these I thought it a was a good item since it spoke spanish and english.

The songs are nice but I don't think a young child would care that the same song is in different languages. The numbers go from 1 - 5 and it is repeated so fast, you may miss what they are saying.

A total waste of money and will be put in out garage sale very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"We just bought this for our 3-1/2 month old daughter and she seems to enjoy it a lot. She loves the cheerful music and lights and looking at the moving mobile. She isn't yet able to sit up, but a selling point was that she will still be able to use this toy when she can sit up.The toy was easy to take out of the box (unlike most toys that are attached to the packaging by those annoying industrial-strength twist ties), and was SIMPLE to put together. It is also easy to convert from a lie-down toy to a sit-up toy. Our 2 year old enjoys it in the sit-up mode.Overall, we have been extremely pleased with all LeapFrog toys that we have purchased and this is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good buy","review":"The toy needs its music to last longer w/ particularly with YOUNGER infants.

We might have to put this away until she's either bigger or until she can sit upright on her own and use it in sitting position. Hopefully the sit-up position is better designed so she can reach the controls on her own. We'll see.

Eventually I made it to them and they were not helpful. Didn't give any tips on how to troubleshoot. They said we can not replace it if you received it as gift & don't have receipt. We would also not replace if it was bought 90 days before. I said, how about repairing? I am OK to spend on mailing to you folks. The anwer was we can't even repair, but we can give you 15% discount on next purchase.

I may be a bit prejudiced (I love LeapFrog products) but my son adores this gym. In the beginning he was content to listen to the songs and watch the mobile. He cracks up laughing whenever we sing the &quot;Hello!&quot; song to him. As a bonus, his big sister also enjoys sitting with him, playing and singing along. It's given them another way to bond. As he's grown, the mobile encouraged him to reach and excerise those tummy muscles. Now that he's sitting up it's as if he has a new toy since you change the learning mode. The only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is because if you have a very active baby this product may not hold their attention for as long as you'd like. However, we made sure to purchase an activity gym for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a nice thought","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers - - in the lie-down infant mode, this one is a little disappointing. The mobile moves really slowly, and there's not a great deal my 4 1/2 month old can do with it when he's lying down. He can't reach the other knobs and things on the gym, and the mobile doesn't really do much else. The music and words are nice, but they only hold his attention briefly. I was hoping this would be something that he could have been more interactive with, but it's not. For this kind of money, I wish I'd researched a little more and found something more appropriate for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing toy from Leap Frog","review":"I am a big fan of Leap Frog products, but I am very disappointed in this toy. My son is five months old and he is not entertained by this learning gym in the least. He can touch the mobile, but that interests him for about two minutes. When I try to help him sit up, he still has trouble reaching the globe. I am hoping that in a few more months, he will enjoy some of the other features of this toy, such as the peekaboo mirror. Until then, this gym is pointless while he is lying down. Perhaps more flashing lights would have entertained him in this mode. The manufacturer's recommendation for this toy to be used by children as early as three months is completely erroneous in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!!!","review":"I am disappointed with leapfrog this time. I put this gym together for my daughter and she cant do a thing with it. She is to small to reach the globe and is bored with the mobile. The music is nice but I have many things that play music. I certainly can think of more toys that she would enjoy better. I will be returning this gym to purchase one that she will enjoy. I have many leapfrog toys and havent been disappointed until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I have liked all the leapfrog toys purchsed so far. But not this one. It says it has all these learning tools. I found this to be untrue. It shuts itself off after a short time and leaves your baby just laying under it. The mobile rotates very slowly and does not really seem to encorage any motor skills. The \\"world melodies\\" is some of the worst music I've heard. This toy is not entertaining and does not seem educational. All in all a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not entertaining for an infant!!","review":"We recieved this as a Christmas gift for our 4 month old daughter. I would rather have gotten the Little Tykes 5-in-1 Adjustable Gym. But, I have been pleased with all of our other LeapFrog toys. With much hesitation we opened it and put this gym together.The only part she really likes is the mobile, which really isnt all that exciting. The lie down setting plays an obnoxious song that I found singing to myself all throughout the day. Another problem is that the mirror can only be seen if you can pull it open and then it closes again. Babies seem to prefer a mirror that the can look at constantly. The box boasted about teaching other languages. That is true if you count 'hello' and the number 1-5 as other languages.All in all, this product isn't geared toward infants. There aren't colorful flashing lights and various up beat songs. If I could I would take it back and get the Little Tykes one."},{"rating":"1","title":"She just never got into it","review":"We had this toy since my daughter was born. She just never got into it. She really likes the singing but she'll listen to it if I turn the globe. She has never played with it and the mobile is terrible. It also consumes a lot of space and certainly doesn't teach languages!I do not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cost","review":"We purchased this for our son when he 2-3 months old. He did not enjoy it very much at all until he was able to sit up. The only thing he liked and could reach at that time was the mobile on the bottom, and his crib mobile was much more entertaining. Once he could sit up, he liked to play with it a little bit, but was never entertained for long. Now that he can stand, he likes to pull up on it, but has even less interest in any of the buttons. I was intrigued by the international/multi-language aspect of this toy, but I think it was too much for an infant."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 month old loves it!","review":"My 2 month old daughter just loves this.

I would highly recommend this over any of the activity mats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great visual toy","review":"I really like the mobile-esque aspect of this toy. My 4 month old loves to watch it twirl around and around to the music.

In the laying down mode it plays wonderful music or sings in 5 languages continuously. I like the fact that my son has heard so many language sounds during a linguistically plastic time. Now that he is sitting, the gym has adjusted to entertain him in a more interactive fashion playing music or singing only when he manipulates the mechanisms. At all stages, our family has enjoyed helping him use this educational toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was not impressed with this toy. I agree with many of the other reviewers, it is not age appropriate and not interactive. I even propped my 3 month old son up on a Boppy so he could reach the globe and other activities but there really isn't too much for him to do with it. The songs are good and I liked the music but it doesn't offer much more than that. I'm going to try to introduce it to him again when he gets older and hope for a better response."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"I bought this toy for my nephew when he was only 2 weeks old. I thought it might take a long time for him to get to play with it, but I was wrong. At first he would just lay there and listen to the music (which my sister loved because she could get things done.) But starting at 6 weeks of age, he would lay under the gym for hours and just kick and play while trying to hit to mobile.I would recommend this gym for anyone. If your baby loves lights and music, this is the gym for you. With the changing modes, there is none of the same songs over and over. I find myself singing the songs when I am playing with my nephew. I also gretly surprised to hear new songs ever once and awhile. BUY IT!! It is worth ever penny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starter play gym","review":"I bought this for my son when he was just 3 months old. He loves it! I like that there are two settings, one where the music plays many different tunes (perhaps the parent who said that it did not was not aware of this) The other setting is for when you don't want it to continously play and rather it only plays when the globe or buttons are pushed or touched. Also when the globe spins or you push buttons - even more songs play in a few languages. The lights really fascinate my son. He coos and kicks and plays for at least 20 minutes with this toy. Is a very stable toy also and converts to a sit up play w/ toy for when he is able to sit upright. Price at toys r us was only $25."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your baby doesn't sit yet, use a bounce chair with!","review":"The music is great, and the globe is cool, but the mobile? Take it right off, and put your baby in a bounce chair underneath and watch 'em go!!!

He couldn't touch any of it and we had to move things to get it to change music (which is very limited) or actually get it to do anything. Now he is 6 months and even with the new adjustment to the sitting position it is awkward for him to push the buttons and the globe. It is like he is sitting in the front row of a movie theater with his head leaning back, but he has to be that close in order to reach the different buttons - which he has no interest in. Don't buy it - it really is not fun and although I did learn how to say hello in other languages, I don't think he really cares about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for a while","review":"We bought this toy when our son was 2 months old and he loved it for a while now that he is four months old he does not want to play with it at all.

Considering the money that you pay for this, it is not worth it. The mobile is boring and there are only 4 lights for the babies to look at.

I was really disappointed when I put it together. The mobile provides very little entertainment since it is just plastic pieces that spin in a circle. There is nothing for them to really bat around and get any amusement from. It plays the same song over and over. I was hoping for more of an international mix of music. Also the color wheel has very light colors, which I think would make it a little harder to teach your child colors. The orange and yellow are almost identical. I thought that LeapFrog was supposed to have such great products, but this product does not make me want to purchase other LeapFrog items. It is not worth the $40. Hopefully I can return this product and get something that offers more entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I saw the ads for the Fisher Price Activity Gym and when I went to purchase it, I came accross the LeapFrog version....being impressed with the sophistication and learning potential of other Leapfrog products, I opted for this toy...made the wrong decision! Although the gym entertains my 3 month old son, I can see his boredom growing....he likes to reach and interact with toys. At this stage, all he can do is kick the mobile and that does not cause any effect.

Dangly, Swattable, Contrasting, Jingly fun things. This \\"cute\\" activity gym is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am starting to wonder what all the Leap Frog hype is about.The music is nice on this gym and it is colorful but the only thing my baby can reach in the infant mode is the mobile and that doesnt keep him occupied for long.

For the most par the toy is durable but the stand is a little flimsy.

The device relies on a \\"weak\\" FM signal to transmit music from your iPod through your cars stereo system.

I sometimes even had a hard time getting my car sterio to register the frequency that I would pick because there was so much static it wanted to just skip to the next station. What's more interesting is if I wrapped a piece of aluminum foil around the top of my ipod and sort of formed a small antennae with it I would actually get very decent sound quality, just slightly worse than what you get from most radio stations.

The Two Cool Musicians are a perfect match. There are other recordings by Mutter , Chung, Zukerman, etc. But I strongly recommend this disc. Mullova is 'TRULY HERSELF' in every piece of music she plays. And she explores areas of emotions and rhythm that were never found by any other artist. She has a great intuition as a musician and this recording shows it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal single","review":"The first single off BE, \\"The Corner\\", is nothing short of classic. Kanye West lays down a pretty stripped-down drum track made up of nothing more than a few piano chords and some scratching, and Common completely tears it up. Kanye West shows up once again for the hook, along with some spoken-word poetry courtesy of The Last Poets to set up Common's next dope verse. The Corner may be Common's best single since I Used To Love H.E.R from back in his Common Sense days. Classic material, and BE ain't too shabby either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek: New Worlds","review":"This have been better. It was fun for a while. The gameplay could have been better.

The missions are way too complicated and take hours to finish, and if you screw up when you've almost finished it's very frustrating. There's no way to save or minimize so it takes forever to do anything. While it's cool to see your colony grow and to see how the different races handle different scenarios it's not a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Sucks","review":"The controls are hard to use, it's almost imposible to order your units to attack enemy units because they move to fast. The 3D graphics are terrible and the sound is mediocre. The game says you can play multiplayer on 56K or better but you realy need DSL or something. The so called tricorder is imposible to use. The missions are way to hard and you can only save at the end of your mission so you'le end up playing for hours trying to finish. If you want good 3D strategy dont look here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worse game I have ever played.","review":"It is certainly the worst strategy game ever. Not only was it a HUGE dissapointment, it was just an all-around bad game. Besides from slow units & a horrible interface to work with, the game was plagued with many problems. Some of the bigger ones are that there isn't a costum game mode, and you can't save your games ever! I read some PC magazine reviews that called it \\"Star Trek meets StarCraft\\", well this isn't true at all. Each race only has about 3 units that are combat-related, one of wich doesn't even has weapons! Don't buy this game if you're expecting a Star Trek based strategy game with lots of awesome battle units. You get the exact opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a letdown","review":"I guess I'll never learn about the latest incarnation of \\"Star Trek\\" games.

I've managed to build the colony, mine the dilithium required, but I can never find that archeological area you're supposed to run science scans on. They need a strategy book for this game. It's just too hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Trek game made","review":"So, what was the point of this game? I never could distinguish the baddies from the Feds during alien battles. And, I could never finish the second mission. In my opinion, don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Total waste.

I could live with all that but no, they can't bother with the must have common sense option any worthwhile game has, The SAVE button.

My customer service helper, Michelle, told me that shipping allotments could never be adjusted and that most buyers know when Amazon fails to provide enough money to the buyer for shipping costs.I am posting this message for all of you that don't naturally know that the shipping costs here are a quarter of what they should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I luv'd until it LEAKED.","review":"I came here looking to replace the Brita cooler with a later model but after reading the reviews, not likely.

The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because I cannot set the cold temp above a two or else I get freezing inside and water will not pass from the cold water vent.

But, now, several years later, it's leaking. Not the bottle, the actual cooler. I've taken it apart as much as I can without totally disassembling it and see the area where it leaks cannot be reached without totally disassembling. Also noticed quite a bit of rust, so it has probably been leaking slowly for awhile. It is no wonder they no longer make these.

My biggest problem is the D pad, it seems to be a 4 way only directional pad, pressing a \\"corner\\" produces no movement in my game at all.Worse, even when I simply press left or right I have to REALLY press HARD for it to take sometimes, it is not nearly as responsive as it needs to be.Going to put this in a drawer I guess and buy one of the $40 pads, seems like that is overpriced for something like this though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cost efficient & perfect for emulators","review":"I'd highly recommend this controller if the most advanced emulator you plan on using is PSX.

Some of the tracks here are really quite nice - Russian Lullaby and Trane's Slo Blue stand out - but these are overshadowed by the sessions that put Coltrane in a quintet/sextet grouping with such dim bulbs as Sahib Shiab and Idrees Sulieman. Lackluster performances also come in from Donald Byrd, Cecil Payne, and Pepper Adams. The best cuts are the quartet with Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Arthur Taylor. The big problem, however, is the \\"house band\\" feeling to the album, with Coltrane just one of the front men. That's disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album!!!","review":"La Pina is considered one of the \\"Godmothers\\" of Italian Hip-Hop. This is one of her best albums.

He has it in bed with him right now. Hasn't even needed the microphone for it yet (didn't want to worry about him strangling himself with cord in bed at this point). There are enough songs that he has only scratched the surface. He likes the animations (little red dots of light). Reinforces counting and the alphabet, introduces phonics songs. As he gets older, introducing the microphone and the singalong songs (Oh Susannah, I've been working on the railroad) will make the toy seem new again. Very happy with my choice based on the reviews"},{"rating":"2","title":"great learning toy","review":"I finally found this toy at a store on black friday! I have been looking for it because it is made by leapfrog and every toy that my son has from them he loves. My 2 1/2 year old loves it.

Which is cute, but sometimes I would like for him to hear himself naturally. I would def. recommend this toy. I really like leap frog products & this one lives up to leap frog standards.

I completely agree about the volume control once the toy is turned on. It's a little loud, but it really doesn't bother me. Educational value - not bad. It does only do 3-letter words, but we have to remember they are just starting to learn/read letters and words. My daughter could recite a few more words if she would stand still long enough while holding the microphone. As for the microphone, that was a little hard for her to get use to. I had to remind her to hit the \\"blue button\\" so she could hear herself. Fun for her either way. Durable - well lets say that this toy survived a accidental crash landing off a picnic table onto concrete with only a little scratch 5 minutes after she opened it!

Now after purchasing the Leap Frog Letter Factory DVD the Karaoke has new life and seems to make sense to my son.

He absolutely loved it then and still does at 2/12. I bought a second one for my daughter before she was born. This toy helps soothe both children to sleep, and lessens the bedtime hassle. I absolutely love the fact that you can choose between 3 different time settings, the longest being 20 minutes of play (most toys only offer 5 or 10 minutes). This means that I don't have to keep entering the room to turn the toy back on. I would highly recommend this to any parent who is having difficulty at bedtime.

The picture is extremely repetative but it doesn't seem to matter at all. It has the on/off on the front by pushing the big star.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"insensitive and unfeeling","review":"This set of quartets is very well played indeed, but somehow one can feel a strange indifference and coldness in the interpretations. Everything seems so insensitive and unfeeling and even the most beautiful Cavatina lacks the romantic anguish that is so wonderfully produced in some other recordings. There is a feeling that the only goal Emersons have here is to show how well they can play. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sensitivity","review":"Really a wonderful recording. The Emerson plays wonderfully in this recording, paying attention not only to the obvious details of each quartet, but also the minutiae of the piece as a whole. Really, overall a quality recording, and a good recording to own for anyone whether it be as an introduction to the music, or to enjoy in the future.In terms of the structure of the CD's, there is one opening packet with liner notes, which, although interesting, I find somewhat insufficient. I would have perhaps liked to see some more in depth discussion on each quartet, however, this type of discussion is perhaps best reserved for books.Overall, a wonderful recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Analytical","review":"Maybe I'm not the most qualified person to be writing a review on these works. I have to confess that after hearing these quartets performed by a number of ensembles, I just can't hear what all the brouhaha is about. Maybe I'm listening incorrectly or something, but to me the string quartets are simply not on the same level as Beethoven's symphonies and piano sonatas. (I can hear a collective gasp from music-lovers around the world.) That said, I'm not so ambivalent that I can't prefer one performance of these works over another. Alas, the Emerson's quartets would not rank highly on my list. Technically the Emersons are amazing and their sonority is perfect. And yet, their playing seems to lack any kind of emotional attachment to the music. The performances therefore come off as rather cold and analytical. I like more passion in my music, particularly in these works. But like I said, maybe I'm not the perfect judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, though in a few aspects lacking","review":"Despite my admiration for this set, I have to strongly disagree with the music fan who wrote this is the only recording of these quartets you will ever need. For once, the richness of this extraordinary music can never be encapsulated in one single version. Then, there's the fact that the Emersons are technically amazing and bring an impressive and refreshing sense of urgency to the music, but they lack the passion that emerges so strongly from, for instance, the much less polished Lindsays. Sometimes the Emersons just make the music sound too beautiful, other times they just sound rushed. There's no denying it's an extremely worthy set, that ranks high in the catalogue, but when the Talich and the old Lindsay are still out there, and there are new sets en course from the excellent Petersen and Takács, this is hardly the first choice, much less the \\"only\\" choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the imagination","review":"Now, before I rave about the toy, I must be the odd one out and say that parts of this toy were rather flimsy. The little purple railing for the balcony and the clip-on wall that swings out keep falling off during normal play, which gets frustrating. Also, the little cardboard cut-outs of food have begun to peel and rip after just a month.Other than that, this is a great toy for our daughter, who is pony crazy and has a great imagination for a 2yr. old (I often forget she's only 2). The oven and cash register are activated with the hidden magnets in the pony's hooves...great idea! Our ponies have had many adventures in the Cotton Candy Cafe and have eaten countless slices of pie and ice cream sundaes. How do they stay so trim with such a sweet diet?Best of all, this playset is quite inexpensive, so I don't even mind the flimsy parts so much. You get what you pay for, after all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun MLP toy.","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves this toy.

Jameson speaks authoritatively on Star Wars and Body Heat, maintaining a high level of analysis on popular culture concepts. Said provides a fitting bookend, as he considers the problem that marks all the other authors in the book (except Jameson, whom he rightfully praises): namely, that they write for an increasingly small audience of their fellows, bound by the walls of their disciplines and separated from political life. He impliedly bashes the preceding authors, who deserve such a bashing, as their contributions range from pedantic to unintelligible. Baudrillard's \\"The Ecstasy of Communication\\" is not as bad as some of the essays by his less luminous fellow authors, but it is particularly cosmic and incoherent. Overall, this book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent game but 3d card support is limited.","review":"I love this game. The landscape plants and grass that you can hide in are perfect for sniping. Buildings, tanks, trucks, and boats can actually be blown to bits. I set off satchels on a boat once expecting a burn mark on the wall, but it actually sank and tilted to conform to the lake bottom. Unfortunately, the game does not support Voodoo cards and requires a Riva card for hardware acceleration. Unless you have a very new Riva card, over 100 MB of RAM, and a 600 MGhz processor you will be experiencing DF2 with a low frame rate, therefore very choppy movement. Also, anytime you try to switch the screen resolution in the game, the game crashes. The auto-patch updater is a bit tricky as it downloads a patch for itself at least 20 times before it starts updating the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm Nuts....","review":"It seems that most of the people who played this game liked it. And I must say that when I got it, I was expecting a better experience than I got, something along the lines of Rainbow Six with more running and shooting. However, as opposed to most of the reviews I saw, Delta Force was a huge dissapointment. With horrible graphics (Maybe it's my computer, but they didn't even have a strafing animation or realistic grass) and stupid extras as weapons (see the pathetic explosion from a strike) the game was a massive waste of money. I'm beginning to think that everone likes it because it's so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Graphics","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm a loyal Delta Force (DF) player. I've played every one in the series so far. This is the only game in the series that I've regretted purchasing.DF1 was a software-rendered game. It didn't rely on OpenGL (hardware) and other stuff like that. DF2, on the other hand, is the first OpenGL game in the series. It seems very dark and kind of slow. Maybe it works better on some video cards, but it didn't work that well on my TNT2.I'd recommend getting Land Warrior (DF3), which also has hardware support, but none of the issue of DF2. Or, get one of the newer ones in the series. As of the time of this writing, Black Hawk Down (DF5) is what I'm currently playing (and the newest in the series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Rainbow Six, Soldier of Fortune, If you want good.","review":"Really. This game is not that good. The graphic are choppy, the gameplay gets kind of boring after about thirteen minutes, and its about the same as Rainbow Six or even the original Delta Force. So, don't waste money on this. Spend it on Land Warrior, or Soldier of fortune. Not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Be Better... Get Black Hawk Down","review":"Delta Force is a mostly a good game. The gameplay is very fun, the sound is realistic, and the graphics are ok. However, if you have a good system, then don't bother. Black Hawk Down is a better game, and it's beautiful. But if you like FPS, have a lousy machine, and don't mind a one shot kill (even if you shoot someone in the scope of their gun), get Delta Force 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best game I have ever played......NOT !","review":"Get it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suck,boring gameplay(I usually like realistic military games), coudn't acess campaign, takes forever to install.I would give this game 0 stars.

I'm going to return it ASAP and get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DF2 (Unrealistic, corny, and just plain dumb.)","review":"Okay. Some people (Like 10 and 12 year olds) think this game is sooo cool. This game so very unrealitic. Infact, everything about this game is stupid. The weapons are okay, but when you fire, there is no recoil that makes you reticule (The cross thingy that helps you aim) go up and down. Also, 1 shot from any gun kills an enemy (Which is pathetic) so why put your M4A1 rifle on burst? Just use single shot to conserve ammo. The games graffics are as [bad] and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony. I suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above. Please, save your money and buy a better game like Counter-Strike (The best game ever made) Half-Life (The second best) or Rainbow Six: Raven Shield (The third best) If you are looking for realism, DO NOT look here at this game. Its pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I just wasted some money","review":"I bought this game at a fairly low price, and when I started playing, I was totally amazed - at the incredibly bad graphics.The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars, placed above and below it. That was the first thing I noticed. Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy, and my gun wasn't all that impressive either.\\"OK...,\\" I said to myself. \\"Why don't I try walking around and see if this gets any better?\\" So I did. Guess what? No gun sway! Every stinkin FPS game I've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun (Ok, maybe not Wolfenstein 3d, but still!).So, anyway, I tried firing the gun - barely any recoil at all. I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not.Anywayz terrible graphics = boring game. Enough said"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multiplayer is strength of game!!!","review":"DF2 is pretty primitive as detail, graphics and AI go. Really, quite lagging behind plenty of other entrants in the FPS arena. Missions are relatively simple and straightforward and most accomplished gamers will breeze through the single player missions and campaigns no problem. The fun begins on Novalogics' internet site for multiplayer...day and night, a smorgasbord of games to enter, custom designed maps being played on- quite addictive!! I own RTCW, Op Flashpoint, Medal of Honor and plenty of other \\"latest\\" games but raw ol' DF2 is still the game in my system at 2AM, letting me snipe some fella playing in the Netherlands...it's a hoot!!! Simply put, load it, play it, dial up and your playin against 16 other junkies. Love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"The FPS genre isn't in danger of have greatness redefined by DF2. The graphics and controls are decent, meaning that you can generally distinguish targets and terrain and the movement isn't difficult to master. The fundamentals of the game are sound in that the solo missions are satisfying, the campaigns follow the same theme as the solo's, but it's the multiplayer that is the biggest let down. Unfortunately there are cheat codes that find their way into the multi-play. So, for example, if you are playing flagball and someone is using speed-cheat, forget it, the game is over. And there is almost always at least one person cheating. Artillery support in King of the Hill is equally ruinous of any fun.I definitely wish I had picked up another game. Once you get tired of the solo work, which is quick, the multiplay is so dissappointing that there is no long term value in the game. Wait for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun One, player AWESOME Multiplayer!","review":"If you like any other shooter games,I.E. Rainbow 6 or Hidden and Dangerous, you'll love this game. The one player game is mediocre. But the Multiplayer is Awesome. With up to 50 players battling it out it gets pretty crazy. Also, I would get this game if you like to paintball."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow up.","review":"When Delta Force came out I had to have it. It is one of the few games I kept coming back to, that and Half-Life. So, when I heard that Delta Force 2 had come out in the States I had to get it.My opinion is its fantastic. What did it for me in the end was I was hiding behind a wooden building when a armoured vehicle with a heavy calibre machine gun started shooting at me through the building. And the ability to straith a tent with you gun and kill inside. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a huge fan of the original Delta Force, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Delta Force 2. I must say that I was sadly disappointed. I expected some improvements over the original. Granted that you have new weapons and a little more functionality, the game falls far short of what I was expecting. This should of been an expansion pack to the original. I have shelved it after only playing it a hand full of times. My advice, borrow a friends copy and check it out before wasting $$ on a retail version."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing natural cleaner!!","review":"I purchased this product to make my own homemade cleaners and it works so well in cleaning every surface in my home. I used to use harsh bleach cleaners and they did not work that well and left harmful chemical residue and made me feel sick. Making your own cleaners with this product has changed housecleaning for me. I had a shower that had deep dirt stains, I made a cleaner with this product and sprayed it on. Five minutes later, I used a sponge to wipe away the stains. It makes every surface sparkling clean and leaves a heavenly NATURAL orange scent :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Notice to pet lovers....new data has shown severe allergic reactions by some dogs to D-Limonene.","review":"New incidental data coming in shows that this chemical, made from citrus peels, can burn the skin tragically, and affect internal organs of dogs who may be bathed in this as a cleaning shampoo homemade mixture. It does work wonders on pet odors but at least two dogs have almost died from coming into contact with this serious cleaning solvent. Check Youtube for story about a Pomeranian named Ginger, whose plight started the alarm posts coming in from around the country.Pet groomers are advised NOT to clean their equipment, tubs, tools, etc, with this cleaning solvent and NOT to mix it with shampoo to use on pets. The damage to skin and coats are chemical burns but internal damage can affect the kidneys and the blood system."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair, but not exceptional","review":"Although Tchaikovsky intended his liturgy for church performance, it is given a rather secular performance in this recording. The singing is in tune, but the basses are barely existent and the sopranos are consistently overpowering. Even though the entire liturgy is not complete on this CD, it does, however, feature 7 of Tchaikovsky's \\"9 Sacred Choral Works\\" which are not often recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unlistenable","review":"The reviewer below is much more charitable than I. I found the singing to be overburdened with heavy vibrato, almost to the point of the stereotypically Slavic wobble. I am no fan of boring straight-tone singing, but the chords just don't tune here. The sopranos are far too prominent, but this is probably a combination of the high tessitura and unmusical engineers. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the WB's series","review":"If you liked the WB series X-Men: Evolution (which was rather well done) you'll enjoy this as well.

And you contradicted yourself by saying that the C major sonata facile was the only famous one and proceeding to called his C minor sonata famous.And on with the review. This was one of those performances where it sounded like Schiff was trying so hard to be so light. Many of the \\"alternating figure\\" passages are broken up because of this tension in his playing. It's as if he has the idea but hasn't quite gotten there. This is a wonderful CD if you just want to listen to it during leisure time, but for more of a refined and Mozartian style, turn to Barenboim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary Sonatas","review":"After listening to the first CD of the Schiff set I knew that he really disliked Mozart. The piano sonatas of Mozart require a light touch and very little use of the sustaining pedal and that is not what I have heard in this set. Many sonatas have also been played either too fast or too slow, like the Durnitz sonata. If you are looking for a good recording of the Mozart piano sonatas I recommend Barenboim's set because his style conforms to the change in musical feeling in Mozarts time, the beginning of the change from late classical to early romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy for your little one!","review":"I had not seen this toy before but it was given to me at one of my baby showers.

Although I had to manipulate it for him then, he loved it and kicked his feet to the beat. He is now 9 months old and still loves it. He sits independently in his pack and play and plays with it. The best part is that it is soft. I never had to worry about him falling into it and getting hurt. The fact that it changes songs when it rolls is a good feature. It encourages interactive play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy!","review":"We bought this for our 6 month old daughter. She's just starting to sit up, so the Melody Block is keeping her busy. She also like to kick at it with her feet. It's soft there are cute animals to play with, and a nice variety of songs to listen to. I think she will enjoy it even more once she can sit up better!The only con is the fabric seems to rip easily because we purchased one and brought it home and then noticed a rip in the fabric as soon as I took it out of the package. So we returned that one and this one is fine. Hopefully it holds up longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"WHITE polar BEAR in the icy snow .... \\"","review":"Very cool toy. Our 7 month old adores it and I imagine she'll like it for some time. Each side of the block is different and has interesting visual and tactile features accompanied by optional audible melodies or spoken word rhymes. The melodies are pretty, at different tempos, and are at a reasonable pre-set volume. On the downside, the rhyme option drives me up the walls and I can't deal with the woman's sing-song voice, \\"WHITE polar BEAR in the icy snow...!!!\\" Oh man. Fortunately, the rhymes are an option that can be ignored. That said, this is a great toy with enough features to engage your infant through the early months of development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Even Little Babies","review":"We received this as a gift for our 2 month old. He is at the stage where he loves to hear music and look at colors. The first time we played the block and held it up in front of him, he just giggled and laughed and tried to move with the music. I think as he get bigger, he will be able to play with it himself. We love the songs and rhymes - it's a great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Musical Toy I have found!","review":"My husband & I purchased this item for our 9 month old daughter and she loves it! She enjoys the colorful pictures as well as the soft attached toys(which cannot be put into her mouth). I like how you can set it to sing or just play music. We also like how each color/side played it's own type of music like classical, carribean beat, etc.We also like the fact that she can drop it and it will not hurt her or make a loud crashing noise or break! We enjoyed watching her play with it so much that we purchased it for our friends daughter who is 4 1/2 mos. and she will dance to the music. IT'S SO CUTE.We highly reccomend this toy. Plus you can even change the batteries if needed and that compartment is hidden very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy, but a little too sensitive","review":"My 8-month old girl enjoys playing with this cube, but when the edge (as opposed to the side) of the cube is facing the ceiling, you do tend to go back and forth between two different songs, depending on the exact position of the cube. It's more of an annoyance for me than for her though. Other than that it's a good-sized toy for little hands and both the music and the rhymes are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading for H.S. freshmen's parents!","review":"With two kids of my own in college and one a high school freshman, the only thing worse then worrying about prom nite and all the decision making about who's going to be in which limo -- is planning the college application process.Parents of entering high school students should read Mathews' book BEFORE running out in their child's junior year and buying U.S. News and World Report's College Guide.Mathews' book is a no nonsense, wise guide.

This book will pay for itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"This book is good--certainly better than many college admissions books--but it's far from being great. First, while much of the advice seems solid, the details are sparse. We could use more facts and examples to back up the advice. Second, while the author has some opinions on colleges, he doesn't explain many of them. Allen, in College Admissions Trade Secrets, has loads of strong opinions but usually explains them and gives facts to back them up. Third, what about the kids who just want to go to Harvard or Princeton? Taylor's advice is often more \\"why do you want to go to Harvard?\\" than helping kids understand how to get into Harvard. Once again, if you want insider tips for getting into a top college, you'll need to buy a book by Allen, Hernandez or perhaps Toor. Taylor's book does a great job of convincing applicants that being rejected from Yale isn't the end of the world -- but other books do a better job of explaining how to get admitted to Yale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long, Expensive Magazine Article","review":"Sjogren's other books are more useful than this one. His most useful books for ordinary church ministry include, Conspiracy of Kindness; Irresistible Evangelism; and 101 Ways to Reach Your Community. This book would have worked better as an extended magazine article rather than a complete book. Perhaps if he'd spent more time on it he could have made it more substantive, meriting book-length treatment. My wife also read the book and thought the beginning of the book was good - especially where Sjogren says there is no single right way to be a healthy church. Her take on the rest of the book was that he then proceeded to deny his first point, implying that the \\"low-church Vineyard\\" way was the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"fire alone will save our clan...","review":"i found this book to be very exciting, and full of action. at some parts, i cried, they were so sad!

So don't read this for Buddism, don't read it for the writing, read it for yourself. Try the first few pages.

It is my problem that I distrust the fantasy makers, like David Stoctman who congered up Reagan's Supply Side Economics, or pudits who espose knowledge of TRUTH. The very claim arouses empirical disbelief; on one hand, while promising something emotionally higher.Compared to D. T.

The aging \\"punk\\" author seems to understand Zen as well as my niece, who thinks it's a perfume.Punk, a youth fashion/subculture created as a marketing strategy, is as remote from the spirit of Buddhism as anything could be, with the possible exception of bullfighting and vivisection.Why did Bodhidharma come from the West? If he'd known that his journey would eventually result in this book, he would have stayed home, married a Bollywood movie-star and raised a large family with luxuriant eyebrows.A towering pile now exists of good or readable translations of the Sutras, Zen classics and serious, credible books on Zen.

(the diamond monster sound cards crash too). there have been literally hundreds of posts on their web site begging for help and there has been _no_ response from tech suport for over a month now. go check their web site for yourself - it is very revealing...i strongly suggest you save your money until they fix this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great graphics! Great game!","review":"I got this game some time ago as a gift and even though I was never a fan of this type of game - I loved it. The graphics are great, gameplay is challenging but not impossible and there are several tutorials that take you through the basics of the game. Another big plus is the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Using Bruce Campbell for voiceovers was a brilliant idea and brought a spark of life (and humor) to the game.They also created a backstory for the game - a consistant well thought out one. It's nice to be able to choose your missions and who you want to fight for. One of my biggest beef with these types of games is the lack of choices, you just jump through the hoops. There's still a little of that in this game but not enough to detract from the positives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bite Off!","review":"Sure the graphics on this game might be nice, and have creative ships and characters, but in the long run this game is just a big bite off of Mechwarrior: Mercenary. For example, the Main Menu looked all too familiar. I thought I was playing Mechwarrior. Again, the plot is relatively similar. In my opinion, just a little close to Mechwarrior, and it's not what I would spend my money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tachyon is Tacky","review":"I have had to remove my Voodoo 3 card in order to get the game to even run.

It takes time to get to know these sonatas. The Mozart sonatas are more widely performed, and therefore known to the music listening public. At this point in my experience, I must admit that I prefer the Mozart sonatas, but I am gaining an appreciation for those of Haydn.The quality of the recording is good with very little background noise or noticeable distortion. The piano seem OK for the type of music and if one reviewer thinks these are twangy, listen to these sonatas on an eighteenth century pianoforte.Mr. McCabe is a competent player without any idiosyncracies which seems in keeping with these sonatas.I received a boxed set that had two disc sixes and no disc three.

I arranged to return it to the seller and they accepted the return, saying they have had a problem with a lot of these. Either a lot of them have no disk 3 and two disk 6s or else a lot of them have other disks mixed up.I'm going to try the Naxos Jando collection, which I've heard some parts of on the Naxos Web site.

They are VERY twangy. And this is some of my favorite music, I like these better than Beethoven's and as much as Mozart's. I am very disappointed - but only in the sound of the instrument.

If you listen to them you hear he doesn't really \\"get started \\" until about sonata 32, compared with say Beethoven who except for 3 or 4 composed 32 of the greatest piano sonatas the world will ever hear. I have attempted to give Haydn a fair hearing for symphonic ( boring ) and keyboard works but for the most part he must get the award for not really being able to put 2 consecutive asthetic notes together. The Nelson Mass is very nice. And I know in his last years, Europe just adored him. He was earning upward in todays dollars of $85,000, which just galled Mozart.Finally the sonatas are performed and recorded well.Before purchasing these sonatas listen to the clips and see if you dont want to run screaming into the night, but if you are a boring person with absolutely no musical asthetic, these sonatas cant be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"Awfully written.

THE CRUSH was on the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling books list for 14 weeks between October 2002 and November 2008, reaching the peak position of 18. Sandra Brown has 48 novels on the USA Today best-seller list.Dr. Rennie Newton is on the jury that acquits Ricky Lozada, a hit man who keeps getting away with murder. During the trial, Ricky constantly eyes the beautiful, never-married Rennie, a workaholic surgeon dedicated to saving lives. Soon after Lozada's release, he kills Rennie's colleague who had been recently appointed to chief of surgery, a position Rennie expected. Lozada did it because he has a crush on Rennie. The cops think Rennie hired him.This is fast paced and suspenseful story overlaid with a romance novel formula.

She has a smooth writing style that moves along and very rarely has drawn out sections. This book was no exception. The plot was about an obsessive stalker chasing a woman doctor.

It is enjoyable reading but definitely not the best Sandra Brown novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read","review":"Sandra Brown does not disappoint. I have no regrets when it comes to reading one of her suspense novels. I like the way she writes. This book was better than I expected because the liner notes were too brief and a bit misleading. I thought it more in the vein of Envy with a secret (the real truth about the shooting in the den), and a controversial act to catch the bad guy that makes you want to read a follow-up by Scott Turow. I like the way Sandra Brown gives you the story from several characters point of view, but I thought there were a few loose ends like the scorpions... Not as .... or crude as some of her novels, more romantic, which is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz....","review":"Oh. *blink, blink* is the book over?Sandra disappointed me with this one.

However, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Wopat's reading skills as I listened to this on audio CD. He has good voice inflections and made a mediocre story come to life. On a long car trip, it sure beat listening to radio stations with poor reception.Rennie Newton was a hard person to get to know and like. She was so controlled and emotionally suppressed that her true character did not show until the end. Wick Threadgill was a cowboy - likable, goodlooking, but a real loose cannon. There was good chemistry between the two, but at times it was a bit forced.The story was interesting enough, but not up to her previous standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Was Great!","review":"I started this book on a Sunday and finished it Wednesday night.

Enough said!However, as Amazon requires me to express at least 20 words, let me add that this was an extremely predictable and cliched book. Creepy hired gun, heroine with a mysterious sordid past and a maverick cop. Put them together in a large metropolis (this time, Fort Worth)and weave a thin thread to come up with this weak, unbelievable story.Yes, I did finish it, but in no way was I reading a novel story. It has all been said before in movie and book form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and dumber","review":"Contract killer Ricky Lozada, who'd been on trial for murder, develops a fixation on Rennie Newton, the medical doctor who served as jury forewoman and got him off. He starts stalking her. Enter Wick Threadgill, the troubled, brooding, mentally unstable police officer (are there any other kind?), who hopes to protect her -- and score with her, and not necessarily in that order. The relationship between the cracked-up cop and the troubled trauma surgeon, never too realistic to start off with, just gets stupider and stupider as the book goes on. SPOILER ALERT.

I just hope my I.Q. can eventually recover from having read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first, but a great ending","review":"This is probably one of the hardest novels written by Sandra Brown that I have had difficulty reading. Most of her books I can't put them down until I am done. I did however enjoy the \\"friendship\\" that takes place between the two main charaters. I did not expect the truth that she was holding back, but it made sense. The ending was predictable but still kept reading.I would recommed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near Brown's previous works","review":"I have enjoyed most of Sandra Brown's previous books - The Switch, Envy, and even her older titles. So I was not only disappointed but surprised with The Crush. It was painfully slow and Brown dragged out the suspense to the point where it simply got tiresome to turn the page. I finally abandoned efforts to finish it when I could not get the image of Wick - the most unappealing hero in a romance! Sorry but I don't find anything romantic about a man who doesn't like to read and so burdened by his problems he doesn't care about personal hygiene and the state of his living conditions. I hope Brown's next book won't feature another [character]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I have been looking for a good book for a long time, buying books that could not keeping me interested. This one with a my very busy schedule, I read it in four days. I love her writing, she keeps something from you that will be revealed in pages to come. I didn't figure it all out until almost the last page. I will be buying many more of Sandra Brown's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Sandra Brown?","review":"This couldn't be the same author who gave us such chilling books as Unspeakable, Charade not to mention the breathtaking ENVY and SLOW HEAT IN HEAVEN. In The Crush, both the prose and the characters are juvenile and boring. The hero is too busy with his wisecracks to do anything competent. He is also a major screw-up and extremely stupid. For example, after issuing a direct challenge to a ruthless serial killer, he calmly returns to his motel and proceeds to take a shower - unarmed. He also endangers a woman with his careless unprofessional questioning and gets her killed. The rest of the characters are not much better. The author painted Fort Worth's finest as a bunch of dirty minded bickering teenagers who couldn't outsmart a criminal who is not all that smart.A major disappointment and quite depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The book was everything I'd wanted in reading a thriller, except it doesn't have that extra spark of originality. But other than that, it was an addictive read. Even though it's my first time reading a Sandra Brown, it was obvious that she's an accomplished writer who knows how to satisfy her audience. The pacing was perfect - I love how she doesn't reveal her characters' pasts all together, but spaces it out throughout the book. We don't find out the true nature of Rennie Newton until the very end, and I loved Wick Threadgill. He just seems to be the perfect hero, though flawed, but who isn't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SANDRA - WHAT HAPPENED? BORING, BORING...","review":"I can generally count on Sandra Brown for a good, light romantic thriller. But this is one that never should have been published. The cardboard characters and predictable plot attract as much emotional connection as reading the ingredients on a jar label. Apparently, someone realized that and when things get truly terrible - a \\"love scene\\" gets thrown in. I use the word \\"love\\" reluctantly --- it's more like in the hopes of spicing up the story she's thrown in a little soft porn. Not up to her usual fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough power","review":"After installing this backup sump pump I realized I made the wrong choice. I tested the pump after installation and the pump seemed to work, but could just barely keep up with incoming water during a rain. When I received my next water bill ($50 more than normal) I found that the valve was leaking. I contacted the manufacturer who stated that if my water pressure was greater than 60 psi the valve would not seal. They sent me a new valve at no charge but in order for the new valve to work properly I had to install a $40 water pressure regulator. After regulating the pressure to 60 psi the pump was essentially worthless. The manual states that with water pressure at 60 psi it will pump 317 GPH with 10' lift (not accounting for friction loss in pipes or check valves). If you think that sounds like a lot, a typical 1/2 HP sump pump operates at 3,200 GPH at 10' lift or a 1/4 HP battery sump pump operates at 1,000 GPH at 10' lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good so far....","review":"I bought this pump for around $100 after looking at the other water powered pumps.

After I installed the unit and tested it I thought it worked great. The problem came when I got my water bill and noticed that it was significantly higher than normal. I went to my basement to investigate and put my ear to the water supply line going to the pump and could faintly hear that water was going through. I tried over and over to adjust the valve to eventually find out that my water pressure was too high but, if I adjust it to the 60 psi that the manufacture recommends than the pump won't keep up.

The routine is led by one woman, and there are two non-speaking women in the background who follow her lead. At times, the cues the leader gives are a little off -- she says them slightly after the fact when it's too late to follow -- and her assistants, particularly the one on our right side, get confused. Which brings me to the subject of left and right-- I appreciate it when a video instructor means \\"the VIEWER'S right (or left)\\" and not HERS, so that we mirror-image each other. That doesn't happen here. But as I said, after a couple tries, these points became trivial. Slightly dated exercise costumes, but that doesn't matter either.

However, the Thrill Loop track will attach to the Vortex and then you don't have to worry about that anymore. Another thing I love about the Speedstars is that they are largely self storing. The flexible approach track slides into the loop which makes a much smaller unit to store. The winder attaches to the side of the loop and the car has a little garage in the base of the unit. Speedstars also stay together, unlike Hot Wheels tracks, and don't require frequent parent intervention.

The product doesn't work well on straight knobs that don't have anything to hang on to. I don't recommend this product for a cabinet you really want to keep secure. If a child is incapable of removing this then it also means s/he can't open a door either, because it is so easy to remove, so don't get it.After using this product for over a year as an infant has grown into a toddler, my opinion of it has gone down further.

It was only within the last couple years I discovered there was more to the series. I thought A Wing in the Door was just as wonderful as A Wrinkle in Time. However, Many Waters and A Swiftly Tilting Planet were written in a different order with a different style and voice.Many Waters stars Sandy and Dennys--the twin middle siblings of Meg and Charles Wallace. As they are trying to fix a snack, the teenage twins go into the parents' lab, accidentally trigger an experiment in progress, and find themselves in the pre-flood time of Noah.While L'Engle uses an interesting perspective of Seraphim and Nephilim--the sons of God who intermingled with humans--she also deals with sex and puberty in language that is more appropriate for young adults. A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the door, and possibly A Swiftly Tilting Planet could be recommended for middle graders, but definitely not Many Waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good children's novel","review":"I read the first three books in this quartet and I really liked them so I decided to read many waters. I was in grade 5 at the time and unlike the other three books it had a mature theme to it it really grossed me out when I was in grade 5. I don't think this book should be considered a childrens novel and it doesn't belong with the other books in the quartet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science fiction is not really my thing...","review":"Lot's of adventures go on with Sandy and Dennis Murry, the twin boys, who got bored and snuck into their dad's lab and the next thing they know there in the middle of one huge oasis.It is a biblical novel that takes place right befor Noah's ark.Also the cocept of the \\"Nelphilims\\" is had to understand, but they are hevenly people who turn against god and fall in love with human woman. I think L'Engle wanted to make this book excting and adventurous,but I think it was boring and difficult to follow. The names of the characters were so complicated such as Oholibamah.The story content was sometimes \\"over my head.\\" I think teenagers might like to read this book.So what will ever happen to the Murry twins? Will they ever make it back to there time?If you really care to find out be my gust and read Many Waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha ha ha funny, this book sucks!","review":"Were do i start. We had to read this for school and th 8th grade and My parents read it to me sometimes when we had reading time. Sometimes my mom put the boo down and was horrified with the amount of sexual relationships. The two twins in loin cloths getting in the nude and coming close to actually going to home base. The story concept was slow and horrifying. Do not recommend this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a madeleine L'Engle fan...","review":"I thought this was an awesom book! A must have! I started reading and couldn't put it down. I love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different in a good way!","review":"When I first looked at this book a thought, \\"Oh, another sci-fi book by Madeleine L'engle.\\" That was fine with me, because I loved \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" But I soon found out that I wasn't getting into a super sci-fi book. I discovered that Many Waters is a more, realistic fiction book. That was O.K. with me too. But when I really got into the book I found out that it was a lot better than I gueesed it would be! If you havn't read it, I suggest giving it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not L'Engles best, but enjoyable","review":"This was a very good book, though not L'Engles best. Will be a favorite with L'Engle fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madeleine Misses","review":"While I thought the first three books in the Time quartet were excellent, this last installment let me down. It was corny and a little dumb, even though the plot was ok. Sandy and Dennis, the middle children in the Murry family, embark on their own adventure, which happens to be back in time, before Noah's flood. The inhabitants of the desert they land in are tiny, and nobody wears anything but a loincloth (not even the girls). Amidst trying to win the love of a woman, the twins must find a way home before the flood comes. To sum it up, I say skip this one and enjoy the Time trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!","review":"The author did a great job of writing this book! I love the way she made all the different characters. Sandy is a really nice guy who help Noah and his father to talk again. Yalith is a nice girl who cares about everybody she meet. THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"about two twins that get sent back to the story of Noah'sark","review":"This book to me is very good but it is not the best book I have ever read. Though it has a good story many characters and interesting. It's not too hard to follow. I liked this book very much and I plan to read the whole series. The reason I want to do this is because of the plot of this book I hope the others are as good as this one. The best thing about this book is it bounces around from one character to another and dosn't stay with one person the whole story. This book was a little bit too long and drawn out even though it was good there was a little bit too much detail. I recomend this great book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover.","review":"I read Many Waters because I had read the books before it and loved it. When I was in a bookstore I thought oh... that cover looks intersesting so I picked it up and bought it. I brought it home and after the first three chapters I couldn't read anymore. The book was dull and slow moving. I forced myself to read more thinking that it would get better. Maybe it got a little better, but not much. Some people loved this book, but I think that it was really dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beter than A Wrinkle in Time ?","review":"Excellent! Brilliant! One of the best books I'v read! But, is it better than A Wrinkle in time? some people would sayI do think this book is beter than A Wrinkle in Time. This book kept me hooked while Madeleine L'Engle's First book would be like read 2 chapters in about 3 days it was not very \\"Active,\\" where as in the first chapter of Many Waters they get sucked through a computer into another demention. So yes I do think this book is beter than A Wrinkle in Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"L'Engle has written some of the best books I have *ever* read but this is definitely not one of them. This poor idea from the very beginning has an only marginal plot and insufficiently developed characters. The twins from the incredibly excellent \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" find themselves in the time of Noah before the Flood where they marginally struggle against the advances of an agent for the bad guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest book to put down out of the books I've read.","review":"Even after reading the first three books, this book was the best book I've read. It had everyting from sci-fi to drama/ romance. I had to read it so much I finished it in 4 days. Even when there wasn't much happening it was still suspensful from the overwhelming amount of curiousity I had about what was going to happen- i.e. was Sandy or Dennys going to marry Yalith, or neither?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is a wonderful story.The author is able to take comtemporary characters and place them in abiblical setting, mixing her original characters and biblical figures into a story that is entertaining without blaspheming. As if that weren't enough of an achievement she is able to portray in language so simple and direct that it can't help but touch your heart all the confusion and anguish of a first love. Along with the lesson that some times you have to sacrifice for love, to do the things that are right, even when it hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting, but...er...mature matter","review":"This book is not the genteel book that L'Engle readers are used to...it contains some mature matter. Nothing bizzare or vulgar, but not for young children, more for teens. It is very exciting. That's all I will say, except that the adult's form didn't work. I'm 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool book","review":"I must be honest - I actually liked this book better than 'A Wrinkle In Time'. Sandy and Dennis - Meg's younger twin brothers - find themselves whisked back into an ancient world that is pre-Biblical flood. Noah is one of the supporting characters in this book, and you also have the Seraphim, some of who mate with human women to create the giants mentioned in the Bible. This is a really cool and unique take on the Biblical story of the Flood and I found myself enjoying it a LOT. If you didn't like 'A Wrinkle in Time', you might enjoy this book, because it's different."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read","review":"March 24, 2011In the time quortet by Madeleine LEngle I think this was the best. The Biblical characters were pretty accurate. It is now one of MY top 10 books. As you probably know many books are written, but I think Many Waters will stay as one of my top 10. Most of the time authors dont write a \\"prequal\\". This is my first experience of reading one. The way Many Waters explains love is very detailed. If you love books with romance and adventure then I think you will enjoy this book as much as I have. Caution: Imagination is necessary to fully comprehend the book.April 10, 2011I have finished reading Many Waters for the second time and again I have enjoyed the book. I understood the book a little better this time. It is one of those books that you have to read two or more times to understand the book. I think I might read it again but I am not sure when."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Twins (Like Noah's Ark)","review":"I really like this book. The Murry twins type something on the computer keys and a blast of heat. To bad that they didn't see the sign on the door \\"experiment in progress.

But Sandy and Dennys get separated while riding on unicorns. The small people help them heal from the sun burn. But how will they get back to their own time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Worth Fighting For","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writer successfully blended the two genres I love- suspence and romance. She distinguished herself by providing the reader with more than just a love story. Additionally, I could truly relate to Tangerine and her fear of entering into a romantic entanglement with Eric. We've all experienced this hesitance. It was also equally refreshing to read about the development of the story and the love between the two characters over time. It definitely kept my interest!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway Satisfied","review":"I was not entirely impressed by this particular novel. The idea of mixing two genres (romance and mystery) in the same book is always intriguing. I did enjoy the romance side of this novel but the mystery side left little to be desired by me. I feel that the mystery plot was not clearly defined and I did, at times, lose my train of thought. On the romance side, however, I feel that the characters lives were very real. I definitely could relate to what was happening between Tangy and Eric. I feel that the author will improve her technique as time passes. Since this is her debut novel, I will give her books another chance to impress me. As with many things, it just gets better with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for Lexmark Product - Toner","review":"Unfortunately this product, Lexmark E120 Toner Cartridge did not fulfill expectations.

This is only a book to help you sell your stuff in the streets which is what you should avoid at all costs if you want to break into the real thing. Not a helpful book at all. Its about selling Epson prints for $30 in the streets. Great if it is what you want to do but not great if you have a bit more ambition than that. Some people are fine with it, great art does not sell in the streets. Sorry, but its true."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little book is the real deal!","review":"I am so pleased to have this book. Marshall White has done a terrific job of presenting a little book filled with oodles of pearls on how to jump-start your art career. He clearly is living what he writes and how fortunate we are that he is willing to share his knowledge and experience with us. This book is very readable, is easy to follow and packed full of so much detail. I see many uses for this resource on my shelf, beyond art (although I have always wanted to have a go at it)...I am going utilize this book to market my little antique/curiosity business that we plan on opening soon.

Marshall White promotes a specific approach. How to sell your own artwork, and make the most money while doing it. Sure you can put your art in a gallery and hope it sells, (how many of us have done that???) Marshall shows the reader how to make sales happen.This book is concise, easy to read, and a step by step guide on how to do just this. If you are even wondering if you want to sell your art, you need to read this book. It is full of great references, from which printer to buy, to where to get matting supplies for prints.The most important part for me, is the attitude with which he goes about his art sales. Always have a smile on your face, look your customers in the eye, and what one thing can you do today to further your business or art? Attitude is everthing, it can make or break a business. Marshall White gets it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-nonsense advice: making a living from your art","review":"Many artists only dream of making a living from our fine art. Brian Marshall White is doing it and telling us how in this book. His approach may not agree with everyone -- especially those who graduated from art school and are waiting for galleries to accept them. In this book he shows that if you want to create art full-time, and don't mind creating *some* that suits your local market more than your own aesthetic, you can make a living. He doesn't deal with how to submit to galleries and such, but how to get your art into buyer's hands directly. I am inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has problems with Windows XP","review":"It is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows XP. You can run most of the features, but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature. You need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles.

However, I was extremely disappointed to find out that it's hardly a game at all. Minimal skill and effort is required to get from scene to scene.

I can tell you now from experience though if you never watched the movie you will be a little lost. The rendered cinemas are the best I've seen. There is a shooting range in the police station that tests your reflexes. These targets are replecants as well as humans which you have to learn not to shoot. There are sleezy night clubs. There is alot of swear words in the dialogue for this game being rated teen. The bottom line is if you liked the movie you will like the game, the visuals are outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, and serves the purpose of a sequel.","review":"Alright everyone, you can stop bothering Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott about a Blade Runner sequel. Look no further than your local software store. BR: The Game effectively recreates the world of L.A.- 2019, and, though you don't play as Rick Deckard, does include many of the movie's characters. The environment in which a player is immeresed is designed beautifully, and gives the same forlorn-city feel as the film. It's great that the humans/replicants aren't constant from game to game, providing multiple outcomes and new surprises. However, there are only four stars up there, not five. My reason is that this game is less of a detective adventure as walking around, talking, and picking things up. It doesn't require much deduction on the player's part. Despite that, Blade Runner is certainly worth it's price, and has great scenery, without needing graphics acceleration. Replicants are walking the streets... find them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Best Adventure Game of 1998","review":"A game that takes place on the same fictional earth as Philip K.

Her empathy with the audience and with the roles she plays comes across even on this CD, so no one can doubt her great ability as an actress as well as her phenomenal voice which is rich, solid, and full.

Olga Borodina is one of the great voices of your time. She has a magnificent mezzo voice, rich, velvety, flexible with gorgeous high notes. No CD can do justice to an opera singer and this CD does not really do justice to Olga's great voice, however it is a sample. The best track is her singing of Berlioz' \\"D'amour l'ardente flamme\\" - this shows off her voice very well...deep emotion, expansive sound, flexibility and soaring high notes.The least successful track is Purcell...Olga is not a Baroque singer!There are many more CD of Olga Borodina to listen to and enjoy...so go ahead, buy one, and revel in the sound of a great mezzo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre little stories","review":"Set in the same universe as Bubblegum Crisis and AD Police, Parasite Dolls tells the story of police investigating crimes involving 'Boomers' human-like replicas.But the animation is fairly cheap with a lot of still images and not much motion, the designs are not very innovative and the stories are rather dull.

What is exceptional about the set is the intell iegent, sensitve, and energetic playing of Askenazy of music that in many works, especially the later sonatas, stand as peaks of the piano literature.It is a delight and a treasure to have the 32 sonatas in one volume so ably played. The earlier less familiar works gleam ; the familiar sonatas are refreshed with understanding and the talent to take Beethoven for himself.Along with the probing and ethereal moments of the last sonatas, the entire series serves itself as music to stimulate the heart, the mind, and the soul.Playing such as occurs in this set is never dated no matter when it was recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashkenazy's Beethoven Piano Sonatas","review":"These are the complete piano sonatas.

The only thing he does well are the slow movements, which are gorgeous.However, after listening to so many exemplary Sonata sets like Artur Schnabel's, Annie Fischer's and Wilhelm Kempff's, I am left to wonder about Ashkenazy's. He seems to only concentrate on the quality and sound of the TONE...however beautiful it is. But to me, there is no profound emotion behind his playing. And for me this is the most important in Beethoven.For anyone serious about Beethoven, I can only recommend this set as an introductory set, for someone just getting into Beethoven's sonatas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear approach","review":"When I was at the University, a fellow pianist who was crazy about Vladimir Ashkenazy gave me a tape with the Mozart's Sonata K330; some days later, he asked me about my impressions on it and, for his disappointment, I told him Ashkenazy was a \\"correct\\" pianist. Askenazy may be a major classical artist but every time I listen to this Beethoven's cycle I feel he misses something; his playing lacks emotion and deepness and, unfortunately, I think the same can be said about the Chopin's and the Mozart's boxes.

Every student of popular singing (or singing period) should own this compilation. Her phrasing, intonation, her sense of time, her immaculate diction and just the way she puts over the song as a whole. I would venture to say that more singers than we realize are influenced (perhaps unconsciously) by Miss Horne. Just listen to the attitude and attack in the some of the 60's recordings of Streisand or recordings of Diahann Carroll, Johnny Mathis,Nancy Wilson,etc. I say all this to say, if you don't own this, you should!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent softcase","review":"Not a hardshell, this softcase is more protective than a typical gigbag but lightweight. The foam will dent slightly under very hard finger pressure, but is an inch thick at the thinnest point so should be adequate.

It has two interior spaces that can hold a pocket-size effects box, strings, straps, etc. The outside zipped pocket will accept a 9\\"x12\\" songbook or a couple of pedals with some room to spare. The mesh outer pocket doesn't hold much but, oddly, does open at both ends.

The only reason I left out one star is because, like all LEGO games, it is really hard on your computer. I also had two other lego games, and together the three totally crashed the computer. My parents won't let us install any games on the computer now. It's a shame, because I really miss playing LEGO Racers. It's not extremely challenging, not if you're played other racing games and are good at them. However, beating Rocket Racer is very (underline ten times) difficult. One of my favorite things to do is creating my own racers to race with. You can mix-match different legs, bodies, heads, and helmets or hats to make your own cool/funny/wierd racer!

After shipping I found a minor ding that I bent out, not enough of a problem to ship all the way back. After installing the product there was a noticable sag in the middle. This product just does not span that big a distance, poor design. I built a support for the middle of the bed just to give it strength. Cover leaked from day one, again I think it is a design flaw. I will admit the cover looked great initially! After 2 years the cover started coming apart. Rivets had fallen out and panels were seperating. After less then 2.5 years I have taken the cover off and thrown it a way. Would not recommend to anyone else with a full-size truck.

Some have complained about this, but I've found there's enough info in there to find what you want.

As if that's not enough, there's a set a handy dandy radius gauges cleverly attached to the back. I recommend this book for anyone from beginners setting up their first guitar - to seasoned pros.

It provides guitar players with a better understanding of their instruments which leads to better evaluation of a potential purchase - including a priceless walk-thru a guitar evaluation. It also guides the guitarrist through the basic setup and maintenance that the instrument requires so often. All this is achieved with a minimum of tools (the pro jobs are left to pros) and there's plenty of suggestions for home made, \\"recycled\\" tools.I like this book better than his earlier one and it's my main reference.

I bought the castle and some other products, and while I have noticed some flaws and annoyances, I am pleased with the purchase. There are stickers to place, but it didn't take me hours to do. There are parts that come off, the crown is pretty flimsy, and the balloon is better used off the castle, but the general structure is fine. The castle is pure nostalgia for me; it reminds me of the ponies original castle. And I can only think that right now that old castle is missing roofs, furniture, the stickers are peeling off, but I loved playing with it- I spent hours upon hours. And maybe it can be labeled junky as well, but it didn't matter to me, and I can see children now, playing with this new one, enjoying it just as much as I did, and looking beyond the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall apart Castle","review":"I was so disappointed in this item...it took me several hours to put it together because as soon as I had a piece on and moved to another the previous part would fall off.

Once I got the castle together enough that she could begin playing with it, my daughter was so disappointed when then pieces started to come off in her hands, which inspired me to get the glue gun and call Hasbro to complain.To their credit Hasbro offered to replace the parts that I was not pleased with but there were way too many of those for me to be satisfied with that resolution.

Well, it was the biggest waste of money ever; if it weren't for the fact that daughter loves it, I would pack it up and return it.

Even my daughter who is 5 and is totally into all things \\"My Little Pony\\" commented on how frequently the castle falls apart. I don't mind some assembly when we get a new toy but I do expect it to stay together. I am continually putting the parts back on this thing so the kids can play.

My parents bought it for me for Christmas, and although it took forever to get all the little stickers on, I haven't has a problem getting this toy to stay together. It spends the majority of its time on a shelf, but it does get some play from my friends' kids. The balconies and such seem to be made to \\"break away\\" and fall apart rather than actually snap off, but the kids seem to learn real quick how to put it back together. Based on other reviews though, I suspect that Hasbro released this toy a little too early, without a decent amount on consumer testing. I also have the Cotton Candy Cafe and the Celebration Salon, and those stay together wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was wrong","review":"My daughter loves the ponies, so I thought she would love the castle.

Well, I was very disappointed!!!! Nothing stays on the castle which makes it no fun to play with. I was getting very frustrated everytime I sat down with my daughter to play. I have not thrown this out yet but this is not a popular play toy in my household.

She got this as a gift (despite the reviews) and hasn't played with it since we put it together, which was time consuming oh and the stickers, c'mon why aren't they prelabeled? She takes her ponies and plays with them in her durable doll house.Something on this castle falls apart as soon as you touch it. It's a cute idea, just very poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"What a HUGE waste of money. Just like everyone says here - it falls apart - CONSTANTLY! The pieves dont even fit together. My 3 yr old got it for her nirthday and gets so frustrated because nothign stays together. Top that with the Care Bear Castle that falls apart and the Real Friends Playground which is a hunk-o-junk and she has nothing durable to play with at the moment. Heck - Her Little People stuff is always together! Anyway - spend your money on the ponies - but not this! Hasbro should refund us all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed!","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter for x-mas and my daughter tossed it in the garbage by the end of January due to the doors and other parts constantly falling off.

She loves it, except for the fact that parts you have to attach keep falling off. The toy itself is fairly durable - only a \\"rope\\" on the hot air balloon has broken. My daughter still enjoys it from time to time, but looses interest when the parts have to be put back on too often. I've tried hot glue with parts on other My Little Pony sets, but eventually they come off then too.

We put it together and were first upset by the turrets not attaching to the top of the castle. They just kept falling off. The hot air balloon was such a fun feature, but there is no sturdy place for it to land. The kids started to play with different parts of the castle, and everything fell apart as they played with it. When they are finished with it, we can't even pick it up to put it away without pieces falling off. They can't get it out themselves and move it around by themselves which is highly frustrating. We really would love our money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept...Poor Quality","review":"We had purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who absolutely adores My Little Pony. What a huge disappointment this was! The crown was so mangled out of the box that we were never able to mold it to the correct shape and had to throw it out without even being worn. The top turrets/platforms never quite click into place and are always falling off. The stairs are always coming undone. It just seems to be one thing after another and, quite honestly, my daughter isn't even rough with her toys. All in all, it was just a big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks!","review":"I sometimes look after a 5-year-old girl who loves my little pony. I like them a lot, too and I own about thirty of them. This little girl got the castle for her main crimbo present, and after all the very hard assembly, it was only played with for a couple of days before it was put into storage. Okay, it looks pretty, but it really is so small that the baby ponies are the only ones which can decently fit in it. In the doorway of the castle is a dance floor, but when you put it on, the pony's magnets in their hooves cannot make the music work, as it covers the music button. I would not reccomend it to anyone who wants their child to get a lot of fun out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other MLP toys","review":"I bought this toy last year for my daughter. Luckily on clearance. The items immediatly popped out as soon as you popped them in. This was before my daughter even had the chance to play with it. I really was fine with the crown not working I realize no toy will be perfect. I didn't mind the stickers but all the balconies and stairs just fell right off. I glued everything but they were so badly warped they fell off within days after glueing. My daughter would huff and puff and finally stopped playing with it. I have not purchased another MLP item since. I will say though, she got the twinkle twirl dance studio for her birthday this year from her grandmother and it is much better quality. Only a few accessories but no assembly. They have restored my faith in MLP:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy and if you did, return it!","review":"What a piece of junk.

I plan to return it tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time","review":"We struggled for hours on Christmas day trying to assemble this thing- the turrets that are supposed to \\"slide on\\" or \\"snap on\\" appear to have been put in the wrong box because they fit NO WHERE!

Ultimately, she played with it once or twice and now it is in the basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pony Castle Should be Called Pony Apartment","review":"My two year old daughter got this item for Christmas. She has wanted one for a couple of months now. Upon receiving this item, I noticed right away there was a lot of stuff to put together and a million decals to be put on. No problem. However, the pieces seem to be cheaply made and the crown that goes on top is flimsy and won't stay on. The music won't play correctly and the stage in front with the steps won't stay on. The furniture is nice, but the castle is really too small for all of it and there is little room for the ponies. This toy has the potential to be a really cute toy, but the parts make it impossible to have any fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly built.","review":"\\"Santa\\" brought this toy for my six year old daughter. It was the one toy that she wanted really badly. This toy was very poorly built. I was suprised how the top two pieces just sat on the top, they didn't snap on or anything. And the snap on pieces don't stay snapped on for very long. The stairs fall off, the drawbridge falls off, the top pieces topple over if you bump them. The only good things I have to say about it is that the music and lights are cute, the hot air balloon is cute, and the baby pony it comes with is adorable.I think 40 bucks is way too much for such a poorly built item. If you can talk your kids into something else, do it. They'd be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!My 5 yr old saved up her money and this is JUNK!!!!!!!","review":"My poor daughter saved her own money for this and HAD to have it.

Yes, it takes alot of work to put it together with the stickers - the stickers assembly is ridiculous. The crown is worthless and absolutely does not stay on.

The castle itself can easily display over 18 ponies, with room out in front for other My Little Pony scenes (such as the tea, birthday, or slumber parties). Room in the furniture, and a hidden drawer, offer space to keep accessories (combs, barettes, crowns, etc).

Do not disappoint your little girl with this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out the liquid nails","review":"You have to be kidding me! My daughter is majorly into My little pony, so she had to have the castle for her birthday. After hours of trying to understand the misleading directions I was totally frustrated. Nothing that \\"snaps\\" into place actually snaps or stays there. Nothing that \\"presses\\" is even remotely going to stay put (that's in reference to the turrets for those of you who have one...and why are all the holes there?). Try the word set instead. Set into place maybe. Is Hasbro crazy. For $40 I shouldn't have to put on 40+ stickers while a child crys to play with it. And the crown, don't even get me started. It's flexible and comes apart at the slightest touch. Don't understand the notches next to the holes on that one either. So many problems. But what are you to do when a child wouldn't part with it for their life. Try Liquid Nails...it worked for us. Just don't glue down the mote or you won't be able to change the batteries. Hasbro is getting a note on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Hasbro","review":"I purchased the My Little Pony Celebration Castle for my daughter. After spending 45 minutes arguing with the castle to try and make it stay together we just set the piece that fall off in the hot air balloon that falls off the top of the castle. She has played with it once. I even emailed Hasbro with my concerns that for the money they wanted for this product it is poorly made. They had the nerve to send me a whopping $3 coupon. That is ridiculous. They charge parents $40 for a toy that if you breathe to hard near it, it falls apart. The crown is all disfigured from being squeezed into a small spot. And they expect children to be happy over their products. My daughter was so disappointed over this toy she hasn't touched it since. I would not suggest this toy to anyone who has a little child. It is a huge disappoinment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected!","review":"I was expecting the worst when I read the reviews of this toy, but there was no talking our 3 year old out of it!

I am loading it all back into the box as you are reading this and taking it back to the nearest Toys R Us. I suppose I could invest in a drum of superglue to hold the miserable thing together, but when you spend forty dollars for something, you have a right to expect a little more quality. My 3 year old just got too frustrated with having to bring me all the little pieces that kept falling off to have me fix it.... again and again and again. I will be scrutinizing every purchase from now on when \\"Hasbro\\" is mentioned as the vendor. I can't believe this product made it through their quality control department.

I must admit, based on the reviews and what I saw when I assembled it, I threw away the crown before my daughter ever saw it. Anyway, she plays with the castle and her ponies for HOURS.

The castle has music (2 songs), lights, and clever working elements (the ponies can open and operate various components with their feet). I have been pleasantly surprised at the number of hours of imaginative play this toy has generated and have found the quality better than expected for the price. More interactivity for much less than the Barbie castles at $100-plus! Also, unlike Barbie, the 4-legged inhabitants of this castle can actually stand up in it on their own, \\"move\\" around, and cleverly use their magnetic feet (instead of human hands) to make things turn on, open, or close.

I for the life of me can not figure out how when the top piece is about 1/4 inch smaller than the bottom piece.

She loves her My Little Ponies, so we figured it would be a hit. We were right, she does love it. Unfortunately, this is the one of the most poorly constructed toy I have ever seen. The \\"snap on\\" pieces don't snap on at all, and are constantly falling off. The crown doesn't stay together at all. There are tons of sticker decals and it took me well over an hour to put this thing together. Luckily our daughter is very gentle with her toys, or this thing would be in a million pieces. Unfortunately she can't play with it at all when her little brother is around because of it's poor quality. Aside from all this, she still does love it. Hasbro had a great idea, to bad they didn't give us more of a quality product. I won't be buying any more of the My Little Pony playsets."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad to say we had to return it","review":"After fixing this castle on a daily basis, I had to return it.

It is such a better quality and a she is completely Happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!","review":"This toy is poorly designed! None of the features attach securely and whenever tapped or bumped, everything falls apart!This was the only toy my daughter asked Santa for and now, only 2 days after Christmas, it is the first toy my daughter has EVER asked me to get out of her way! She wanted three castles for Christmas and I insisted she narrow it down for Santa and ask him for just one. Sadly, this was it. We are returning it in the morning for the Disney Princess castle because \\"santa\\" sent a note apologizing for it's poor design.

She had been asking for it since September and couldn't wait until Christmas morning to see if Santa brought it. She was so excited when she unwrapped the box. My husband and I started to put it together and much to our surprise, the pieces didn't fit tightly together. The hot air balloon plastic ropes always pop off. The two turrets just set on top of the towers. Forget the crown that is supposed to attach to one of the turrets because it never stays on. The \\"magic\\" only works with the two ponies provided because they have a magnet in the foot. My daughter stopped playing with it after only 20 minutes. It is a waste of money and poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not purchase again","review":"This is my first review, I put this together for my 4yr old daughter and the whole time I kept thinking I could not wait to write & read reviews about this product.

Don't do it.","review":"My daughter received the castle for Christmas after begging me for months to get it. After the initial set up, my daughter tried playing with it. The parts came ungrooved so easily, the so-called crown that it came with was a joke, it would not stay on as part of the castle. My box was missing a piece and right now it is sitting in her room not being played with and has been for a week. I went to go play with her just today and after reassembling the castle for the fifth time the sound is broke. I replaced the batteries and still no sound. The one cute thing about the castle now does not work after one week. I am disgusted with the castle, it was nothing but an overpriced piece of plastic. Would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If on sale - buy it, otherwise, it's not worth the money","review":"My daughter wanted this toy for her birthday, so I bought it. It's a cute concept, but it is very cheaply made, and it never closes up right and the pieces do not latch on properly (they keep falling off).

Whenever she does play with it, it falls apart instantly. The parts do not stay connected and the balconies always fall off. She doesn't play with it because it is such a pain to put together. She has more fun playing with the ponies by themselves.

My daughter loves My little pony and this castle truly disappointed her.

This toy is too much and never snap together as it should. Look for the little pony at a flea market."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I have to say that I am absolutley disappointed with this castle. First of all you have to put the whole castle together BUT everything keeps falling apart because it was made So cheaply. It's not sturdy at all. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's definitley not even worth what they ask for it either. Buy it and you will find out.

If you add other ponies its adds to the fun with the magnet is the hoof- makes the the dance floor light up.We have no problem with any parts falling off and i did'nt have to glue anything together and no i dont know any one at hasbro!!! This is just a great fun toy and with the added ponies(sold separately) it adds to the adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"What a piece of junk. I'm so sorry I asked my daughter's Grandma to buy this for her. Nothing stays together and if you even look at it the wrong way it falls apart.

I'm very disappointed in Hasbro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Toy","review":"I thought my 4yr old daughter would love this toy however she barely plays with it due to the thing falling apart. Every piece of plastic that attaches to the castle falls off at a single touch. The small star stickers took us 1 hour to put on and I find them all over the house and not on the toy.

The partial directions say to press in place,there is nothing to press???if you are lucky the turrets will balance on top for a minute or two before the earthquake of using the elevator or your 3 year old trying to play with a crumbling Castle. Buyer beware not worth a penny!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Your Glue Gun Ready or Take It Back","review":"This toy is the biggest dissapointment. This was the most talked about toy among my 5 year old and her friends. What a beautiful looking toy. And that's where it stops. Nothing on this castle stays together. If you do not rush to take it back which is what I did, your other two options would be to 1- glue gun everything down or 2- Press things together as instructed and watch this castle magically dissapear. It is a piece of junk, like a toy out of a cereal box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"My daughter (3.5) loves ponies, so we bought her this castle.

I can't believe I'm taking the time to write this but the truth must be told. The elevator is junk...they should call it \\"elevator in an earthquake!\\" Let your child move the elevator up and down and watch the earthquake begin with toys and the castle rocking to and fro.(a can of gear grease may help) On a positive note, your kid will develop advanced bicep muscles while working the elevator. The turrets on top of the castle are held in place by gravity: complete bush league item. Run away from this $6 piece of plastic junk and don't look back. Once again, this is JUNK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dissapointed","review":"Yup! It's all true. One of the worse toys I've had to deal with in a long time. It looks so beautiful on the box.

The insructions say \\"Press into place.\\" It's more like glue it into place otherwise its not sticking. The last thing I need is a toy that is clearly going to be a bigger hassle than fun. I will return it tomorrow. Unless you have money to burn, buyer beware of this castle. It's really a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Castle, but not worth the money.","review":"I bought this for my girls last Christmas. The stickers were a real pain to put on.

What a shame, after about one and half hours, and a splitting headache, of putting on stickers, it was ready to play with. Everything started falling off- the second floor, the valance, the balloon, and the crown holder. I would get all the pieces back in order, then they would try to move the elevator. This was almost impossible (as the elevator sticks at each notch), and it sent all the toys falling to the ground, again! The ropes to the balloon started breaking the minute I moved them down to attach them to the base. This toy has been the biggest aggrevation and waste of money yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLIMSY PRODUCT","review":"My mother bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas.

I could not even handle this toy with out it falling to pieces... imagine a 3 year old trying to enjoy this!! It had the potential to be very cool, since it has a lot of great colors and neat things for the ponies to do, but since it broke every time we even so much as moved it, I had to throw it out.

My daughter is 4 and loves the ponies but the buildings are a joke. None of the 4 large pieces will stay together but if you are going to waste money might as well waste the least amount possible. Maybe if everyone complains the company would do something about it to save a few customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you $$$ on this hunk of junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Boy do I wish I would have read everyone's reviews before we wasted our money on this crappy toy.

Not only did it take us forever to put this \\"easy assembling\\" toy together, all those horrible shiny stickers made me sick and ruined the rest of my Christmas. It has not stayed together for more that 5 minutes at a time and my daughter hates it. All it's worth, is a trip to the dump. Don't waste your money.

There had to be at least 100 of them, and most of them were so tiny that I didn't even waste my time trying to get them on.

The snap on pieces fall off immediately, the hundreds of stickers are a nusiance, the elevator barely moves at all..even the door fell off!! As a matter of fact, I am sitting here looking at it right now and there's not a piece still attached that was supposed to be.

It also didn't help that a piece was missing from the box. The \\"wearable\\" crown is supposed to fit on the top of the castle, but does not. The age on the box says three and up(my girls are 4), but this toy will cause great frustration to any kid under 7 or 8 because the peices fall apart at the slightest touch.

But I find that you don't really know what happened until the books come out. This book is a perfect example. This is the story of the 3rd battalion of the 4th Marine Regiment - the Three-Four Marines - and their march from Kuwait to downtown Baghdad.The author was embedded with the Three-Four during the war. More important, however, the author had been a marine himself. He understood what the grunts were going through, he also understood what the leaders, especially Lt. Col. McCoy was doing.More than a story of combat, this is a story of leadership in action. McCoy leads from the front, inspires his men, all the things that the talk about, but he seems to do it naturally. It's also a story of the author learning a lot about himself by examining his own thoughts and feelings about the war.This is one of those books that you just have to be glad was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another reporter looking for a couple bucks","review":"This book is horrible. Skip it. just get 'Generation Kill' instead.John Koopman is right. He is no reporter as he states early in this rushed, hackneyed attempt at storytelling. Full of typos, I wonder if anyone really did proofread it.Also, the actual reporting of action doesn't even begin until page 111. The previous 110 pages of drivel are Koopman's life. Trust me, 5 pages would have sufficed.Poorly written, slow, and written a jarring short-sentence style, I will soon be listing it for sale here while it's still in hardback.AVOID!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journalist with a Marine's Insight","review":"I disagree with the previous reviewer, Barth. McCoy's Marines isn't about the author, Koopman, wanting to be the main hero. This is about a former Marine going to war as a journalist and everything experienced along the way.The author writes about Col. McCoy. But because Koopman was also involved in the events described, he has to write about his experiences, too. This is nonfiction storytelling, not an egomaniac's version of war.Anyone thinking poorly of Koopman for including those letters is wrong. Including the families' letters is a tribute to the families and those they love."},{"rating":"2","title":"3��4��","review":"Great read.

I mean they wouldn't burn us again, right? (Can you say Ultima8)Wrong.This game is pretty much unplayable, even with the best hardware. You are guaranteed to see a crash with this game even after the 2 patches available (after roughly 3 weeks in the market) are applied.I've got tons of memory (256meg), tons of processor (p3/500) and a voodoo2. It leaks memory and crashes a LOT.Still, I give it a 2 for the nice graphics, but that's it.

I like this game because it is an Ultima, everything is simple and non-cluttered, and the graphics RULE! , but only with a Voodoo 2 or 3.

For one this game is the biggest resource hog i have ever seen, its about 700MB for minimum install and about 1.2GB maximum. Another thing is i have a AMD K6 2 400MHz w/ a TNT card and this game looked like a friggin slide show, the frame rates were terrible even when i turned down detail and sight distance. The bugs.. ahh the dreaded bugs! I'm not even going to get into that subject, theres too many! This game had some awesome potential to be the Game of the Year but OSI just had to rush it out for the holiday shopping spree insted of keeping it in development for another month or so. If they gave this game another month or so it would have been awesome, i would have rather waited longer than play this buggy piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good and Bad","review":"First off installation of the game was easy enough for me. The game however, will be prone to crashes if you don't have enough virtual memory which is about 580 megs. The graphics are stunning to watch and the world of Britannia looks fantastic. I've been running this game on minimum requirements and it runs pretty good. The only time it will slow done however is when it tries to hide the fact that it is loading the terrain. I think it would be wise to run this game under Voodoo3. So all in all after the patch, I think that the game is fun to play and will keep you occupied for many hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"Ultima Ascension is a good game, but do not expect it to live up to the standards set by previous Ultimas (Black Gate and Serpent Isle in particular). Also, the Direct3D support for this game is very poor. Make sure that you have a Voodoo-based card installed in your system before playing the game. Finally, make sure you have patched the game to its latest version (1.18f) before playing. Otherwise, you are in for an extremely frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you don't at least have a 3D FX video card.

Patience is required, because as others have said, 3D accelleration is a must to get anywhere in the game. I also found that the patches cause more trouble than they're worth (i.e. some monsters you're required to kill to progress in the game suddenly become invincible), so I run it straight out of the box. Load time is slow, particularly in cities, but underground scenes run great (don't worry--you have to conquer 8 dungeons. You'll be underground A LOT). The graphics are second to none I've seen. The lengthy load times are more than compensated by the visual treat you receive after the wait. I'm running a 400 Mhz PC with 128 Megs of RAM, and experience hanging periodically, along with choppy movement. But again, for the quest-hungry gamer, it's a great adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest dissapointment ever","review":"I have played all the Ultimas in my time and for the most part loved them all.

After about 2 hours I finally got it to install correctly, and found nothing but bugs and bad game play1) You have to do every quest exactly as your told to no matter what.2) Nearly every quest had a bug that made me reload at least one time usually ten times though.3) Where are these stuning graphics in this game. They were ok but nogthing compared to other games that came out at the same time.4) This is my biggest complaint. The game is choppy.... and Neither of the computers I put it on were .... The first one was a PII 400 with 320 Megs of SDRam and a TNT 2 graphics card, and the other is a PIII 1000 with 256 Megs of Ram and a Geforce3 and its still choppy!!!!So my edvice is to avoid this game like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"astonding graphics, now they need to design the game.","review":"Since I have a fairly new 733 pentium III, I had no problems getting a good frame speed. Even playing at full speed the graphics are wonderfull. The landscapes in this game reminded me of the German alps. No game I have ever seen comes even close to matching the visual quality of this game. Unfortunatly, this is the game's only real strong point. The quests are often long and tedious. Places are hard to find, with too much travel time. The fighting in the game is boring at best, and the puzzles are second rate. Spending the time to beat this game is simply not worth it. There are too many other RPG's out there for anyone to buy this game. Unless you are the type of person who likes playing games where you run around for 30 minutes to complete one fairly simple task, all the while fighing simple creatures by clicking the left mouse button as fast as you can, this game is simply not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work for too little reward","review":"I have never played Ultima before, so this was my first impression of the series. The installation went fine. Having to re-install the game after EA sent me an updated, non-crashing version of the game was a bother. The graphics were choppy, but I could deal with that since they looked so beautiful. What really ticked me off was that I would be playing the game for a while and getting through some pretty rough sections of it and all of the sudden, my \\"avatar\\" would fall through the floor or the game would just freeze, causing me to have to restart my game and sometimes the computer and continue the game from the last point at which I saved.

Beverly Lewis must've cringed watching it. After reading the book and loving it I tracked down the dvd and couldn't wait to watch it. However, the movie barely follows the book at all. The accents were terrible (Lyddie's was the only one that pulled it off throughout the whole film), they totally changed the character's personalities, namely Caleb and Josiah and even the main character, Sarah! Changing the plot and characters so much just didn't make the story 'gel' together right. It came across that the only way to be a good christian is to be plain which is way off and anyway their was no mention of Christ anyway. I think one of the only saving graces the film had was little Bailee Madison who played Hannah- she was adorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent dvd","review":"This is an excellent movie.

I borrowed a copy of the book and read it in preparation for when the movie itself would be on DVD. I bought it and watched it last night, and I will be throwing it in the trash. What a waste of $18!! The sexual inuendo is one thing that bothered me; I also had to mute it many times during transitions as they loudly played rock type music.As for the story itself, Ivy DID leave a will, the children never left Lancaster County(much less the state of PA), Sarah becomes born again, and those are only a few of the major discrepancies I found.While there were some cute and funny parts, (which were not in the original book), they don't make up for the shortcomings of the story otherwise.

From the very beginning the story line diverged from the book. The book explored the dynamic of Sarah Cain's arrival and acceptance of the \\"plain\\" lifestyle and her coming to understand the Amish people from living among them while struggling with the dilemma of what was to become of the children. I believe if the movie had followed the storyline of the book it would have been more compelling and certainly not as disappointing as the movie. If you have read and enjoyed the book as I did do not view the movie as you will most probably come away terribly dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not authentic Amish and too schmaltzy","review":"I did many research papers on the Amish when I was in college. This movie is so far removed from the way the Amish really live, with the exception of an occasional Amish 'slang' word thrown in here and there for good measure. The accents were AWFUL, the mannerisms, the way of life, etc., were way off the true reality of the Plain Folk. I almost threw up when the boy said, 'We're not in Lancaster County anymore.' I could hear Dorothy's famous line, 'We're not in Kansas anymore.' It was a struggle just to finish watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I'm a die hard Beverly Lewis fan and have read every book she has written.

After reading the book I went to the local Blockbuster and rented the movie. Well let me tell you I was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed because the movie doesn't follow the book. Also I thought the actress(?) who played Sarah was terrible. That's my two cents.

The Redemption of Sarah Cain was my least favorite, but still an enjoyable book. There was not much similarity comparing the movie to the book. In the book Sarah is redeemed from spending time among her nieces and nephews and the other amish by living in Lancaster Co with them. She is struck by the way they live, their simple ways and their complete trust in God's divive providence and this is how she comes to terms with something horrible that happened in her past. I understand there may be issues with the amount of time in a typical movie, but there is so much departure from the book that it should not even be associated with it. I may have liked it better had I never read the book. I was looking forward to some of Lewis' characters come to life, but there were too many inconsistencies and omissions.

The mounting hardware is really cheap and the fan does not feel very secure in the mounting bracket. There is a 3/4 inch gap around the base when you choose flush mount.

As I have replaced the others, I have started getting all of my ceiling fans from Hunter. They are built great and run great. I have been running this fan almost non-stop in the past three years and it is showing no signs of stopping.Installation on this fan was pretty easy. It is simply attaching the hanger to the light box and then putting the fan on that. I was able to get it up in about 30 minutes.If you are looking for a new fan, go with Hunter.

We looked at various places that offered Hunter fans and found that Amazon sold the ceiling hugger type fan for the best price.

The production quality is poor, the sound muffled, the mix bad, and the vocals poorly done. This CD is NOT a quality recording, contrasted to the higher quality recent major releases by Pillar. The content is good, and the lyrics have a personal, real depth which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star.I was SHOCKED at how poor the vocals were on this album. On slower songs like Beautiful Savior, an awesome song is wasted by a poor vocal performance. This album is not, in my opinion, listenable, and you'd be better off buying a newer Pillar CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another hack job","review":"I've now read several of the books in the \\"Complete Story\\" series, and they seem to be typified by indifferent writing quality, a very heavy UK slant, insane chapter ordering, and a general sense that they were tossed off in a weekend by a third-tier writer. This book has way too much focus on racing, not enough on the cars, and not enough on the M organization.

This time he claims the British actually favored the Zionists during the inter-war period. After that, the Jews are basically a side show, in the struggle between the Arabs and British. To be brief, Prof. Yehoshua Porath of Hebrew University, absolutely rips apart this book in the spring, 2000 issue of Azure. Porath details Segev's half-truths, mistruths, ignorance of key events and meetings, and an overall mischaracterization of the Mandate period to fit Segev's 'new historian' anti-zionist agenda. The reader should know all the facts, not just through Segev's biased lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I have been a student of the Middle East of a while, and no book as better explained the complex situation in British Palestine. Segev offers a balanced view of the occupation. His research into the British, Jewish and Arab views of the conflict is in depth and intelligent. This book lowers the Middle East Conflict from the esoteric pedastil that it has been placed on by the media and countless other books. While a long book, the benefits gained from reading this great history greatly outweighs the time that is required to put into it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crude attempt at revising facts to suit politics","review":"This was one of the worst-written books I have read on Israel. Segev seems to take inordinate joy in character assassination regarding anyone who may be an exception to his politics. The hopelessly inaccurate information he gives regarding Orde Wingate, the brilliant British military commander, and ardent Zionist and friend of the Jews is a case in point. Since Segev attempts to paint the British in general as pro-Israeli, he must perforce cast the aruably greatest friend the Jews had during the Mandatory years. On the whole, a very questionable piece of pseudo-scholarship that I would advise against wasting time on. Good only as a reference on how distorting this new breed of 'revisionist' historian is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this if are interested in history and current events!","review":"A must read for those trying to famarialize themselves with the historical context of the current situation in the middle east.

Same as youd find in any hardware store selling the same product. If you want better make your own. I used these to cut holes for grommets in the Sumpreme Moving quilts. Intially I started using a rubber mallet for hammering the punches (just because I saw online demonstrations using one) this is a mistake! You dont get enough force and the end result is the tools not cutting a hole easily. Use a metal hammer both for the punches and when setting the grommets. The people commenting that these punches arent sharp enough, probably were using a rubber mallet. As it makes the punches seem dull. After switching to a metal hammer it was like night and day. Great buy, great product. PURCHASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Disappointing","review":"The price was right but the sharpness was not. These are remarkably dull.

The music is too loud for that and the songs to short. There are a few different melodies that play for about 30 seconds each.This is toy did provide a lot of comfort to my son though.

Now I know why it was donated. I have no problem with toys that play music, but when you want something to soothe your child to sleep, it needs to have some sort of volume control.

The music is very annoying...I can't stand it. It plays notes of twinkle twinkle etc, but the sound quality is terrible. I don't know how to describe it, but I would not find it soothing. Also no way to turn off once it is playing, just have to let it run it's course.I much prefer the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Soothe and Glow Seahorse. We have had this for almost 3 years. It is still going strong and we love it. The music is soothing, not annoying. It plays for ~5 minutes, not 30 seconds and has an added feature of being able to turn off if you want.

However, that is not what this toy does. The \\"songs\\" are so loud they can be heard over all noise in a busy room (tv, talking, ringing phone, etc.) and in a quiet room it was so loud the noise made ME jump. Also, the toy is very heavy and the hard plastic center that houses the music device can be felt easily through the padding. My glowworm did not come with a book, either, even though the picture indicated it did. I have written Hasbro about the quality of this product and I hope that if you want a nap time or bedtime toy for your child you will buy the vintage version instead.

It's easy for a baby to squeeze it and make the face light up and the music start. TOO EASY! My son fell asleep with it in his crib and rolled over on it. It instantly began its music and lights. By the time I sprinted across the house to remove it from his crib, he had awoken and was screaming bloody murder. Really tough getting him to go back to sleep. It needs an on/off switch, volume control, and something to prevent it from switching on in the middle of the night and waking the house. Great toy, but not for bed.

However, my older toddler did seem to like it, but I still returned it because I did not think I could stand hearing the music over and over again (which is what toddlers do!)

I agree that glow worm is too loud...but you can take out the inside and put duct tape over the speakers. If it is still to loud, cut a piece of cloth, put it over the speakers, and duct tape it. It will soften his music just the right amount and no one is the wiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new gloworm could use some help...","review":"I was very excited to buy this for my daughter, but it turned out to be a huge disapointment. It does not have a soft gentle glow, rather a bright glow that was uncomfortable to look at. The music was not even close to soft lullibies, rather it scared my daughter and my older son every time it turned on. The music could be heard across the house, even with other noise. I was very sad to return it, but could not keep it when it scared both my children because of being too bright and too loud.

This also holds up really well in the washer and dryer, which is a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has much room for improvement","review":"I was very excited about getting a gloworm for my son and never imagined that it would be a terrible toy, so I never bothered to read the reviews before I ordered! Though all the reviews about the volume are correct, this toy was not a total loss.Once it arrived, I found that the reviews were not at all exaggerated. This thing BLARED the loudest melodies! After I pulled the music box from the worm and confirmed that there was NO volume control, I rolled up scrap fabric and taped it over the speaker holes. It made a significant difference but the toy is still pretty loud.My 11 week old son responds very well to the worm when he lights up, so I guess he likes it. But this toy is too loud to put in the bed with my baby. We take it to the grocery store for when the surroundings are already loud and we need a toy that will project over that noise and get my son's attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't play long enough.","review":"This only lights up and plays for about 30 seconds; then you have to push the patch on its stomach to play it again; so it's not really good for bedtime and getting the little one to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all have volume control!","review":"Yes, this toy is loud. Very LOUD! I have read several reviews that mention, and even tell you how to find, the volume control. However, mine does not have one. The white cylinder inside has two positions, \\"play\\" and \\"demo\\".It was a gift from my grandma to my infant in December 2004, so maybe the \\"new gloworm\\" was not available yet. Mine looks identical to the ones pictured here, though.My solution: I removed the cylinder with the batteries. It no longer glows or sings, but it's soft, cuddly, cute to look at, and easy to chew on. Problem solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter's Favorite","review":"I recieved this toy as a baby shower gift and thought that it was adorable. It was the first toy that my daughter really got attached to. She is now 7 months old and does not want to be separated from it. The music a little loud, but not so much that it bothers me or my husband. It's a great comfort toy and I have given it as a gift on three occasions since recieving mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared 2 yr old who isnt afraid of the dark","review":"Parents I don't know if you remember the old gloworms- They were great. So I decided to get one for my son, well that was a big mistake. He loves the gloworm as long as it doesn't play loud annoying same song music or light up. He cries everytime he accidently steps on it or hugs it. I eventually had to give it to my neice who is 4.What is so weird is that my son isn't afraid of anything. He runs into dark rooms before I can manage to get the light on and on halloween he walked right up to a Jason look alike and laughed. I think he is afraid because our faces don't light up like the gloworms does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"We brought this for our daughter who isn't even a month old yet and she loves it. If she gets fussy all we have to do is squeeze it and her eyes widen and she just watches it. The only bad thing is that it doesn't play the songs for very long before it shuts off and you have to squeeze it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloworm not the one pictured","review":"Playskool came out with a new Gloworm in 2006. The one pictured and described here (with the star on the cap) is the 2003 model. I much prefer the 2003 and expected it when I ordered 4 of these. Since I got the 2006 instead, I sent them back.The main difference between the two is how easy they are to activate. The 2003 one easily plays a lullaby and lights up when squeezed virtually anywhere, but the 2006 model has a patch on the tummy that the child has to press to hear a tune and get the face to glow. That's fine for 8 months and up (and not in the middle of the night), but the other one is more user friendly for all ages.Unfortunately, the 2003 model is unavailable everywhere. I am just writing to let everybody know that [...]does not have the 2003 model either."},{"rating":"1","title":"no song no lite","review":"My daughters aunt bought her the glow worm and when we got it home and from there on out and battery's after battery's it would not play the melody all the way through. I think if they make a musical toy it should be where it plays the whole melody and not part of it. We were constantly pushing the belly to get it to play more and it made my 1 1/2 year old very irritated. other than that it is a great stuffed animal and the glow part of it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little loud but still soothing","review":"I loved this toy when I was young so I jumped to buy one for my 1 year old daughter. Although it is fairly loud, my daughter loves to caress it (box felt inside and all) and rock with it. She will lay on the worm and \\"croon\\" herself to sleep; when she wakes up I can hear her playing it and singing/talking to herself.(She actually has two of these worms now- one for her crib to sleep with and one in her room for her to play with.)This toy may not be great to sleep with if your child rolls on it to trigger the music, but it is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"I bought this for my infant and it only plays the 1st line of any of 3 songs. It lights up for longer than it plays music for. The nice thing is it doesn't take much to set it off. My 9 month old can do it fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price's Seahorse is better...","review":"I have this glow worm and the seahorse by fisher price. Both are essentially the same thing - lullabies and lights. Well, my 5 month old and I are not fans of the glow worm as the music is loud for babies trying to sleep (even NOT in the 'demo' mode) and the music is so short! I had to sit right next to her (as she can't turn it on herself) and constantly keep doing it for her. The seahorse plays much longer and is more soothing sounding - puts her right out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old vs. New","review":"What was worng with the old Glowworm? My son loved it. He is 4 now & really misses his 'glowbaby' as he calls it. The old one was so soft and cuddley. In his 4yrs he has worn out about 6 of them. We can no longer find the old style & he hates the new one. He still sleeps with the old one even tho it is worn out. I wish we could find 1 of the older ones. All it did was light up with no music and for a child that does not like loud nosie it was great. Somethings should be left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooooooooo!","review":"Ok, leave it to Playskool to ruin a perfectly good thing. I ordered two of these for my children because they both have 'issues' with the dark. When they arrived I expected to see a cuddly little stuffed thing that lit up when hugged. Well, it not only lights up... it BLARES the WORST electronic 'lullabies' you can imagine! And you can't turn them off!!!! Now why would they do that on something that is intending to be a nighttime comforter? Ugh!!! I promptly packed them up and returned them, and found the old (quiet) version elsewhere online."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Turn Off the Sound!","review":"I wanted to buy this GloWorm for my daughter but after reading the reviews decided against it. Then we got it as a gift. If you read the information that comes with this toy, you will see it has three settings/modes. Demo (which it is set at when you buy it), Play and Light. This means you can turn off the music altogether if you feel it is too loud! Also the Play mode is a bit quieter than the Demo mode and will play the full lullabies instead of the short version meant for a sample at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LOUD!!!!","review":"My daughter was given this last year for Christmas. The glo worm was so loud that she would start to cry. I put it away and sold it at a yard sale this summer for $1.

Very young children put everything in their mouths-- when my son was an infant, he almost choked to death on some scotch tape he was able to dislodge from a surface.If anyone knows who this reviewer was in Elgin, please contact her & alert her to the hazards.

I said to myself, \\"Self, remember to change the needle position IMMEDIATELY when you turn on your machine again.\\" Of course I didn't and the second time I went to use it, I ended up with a broken needle. To me, a foot that results in a broken needle if I don't remember to change my needle position each and every time I turn on my machine, is not a adequate foot for the machine.Look - this needle is great for quilting even 1/4 inch seems. But I doubt I'll use it too many more times. I don't want to buy needles every single time I forget to change my needle position before dropping it.

He plays beautifully, correctly, and with feelings too, yet completely fails to delve deeper into the spirit of Scriabin's music. Ashkenazy's very orthodox textbook pianism does not possess neither fragile delicacy of Horowitz nor the uncompromising and almost frightening concentration of Richter, let alone the deep mysticism of Sofronitsky. I have a feeling that pianists like Ashkenazy or Kissin, prodigiously gifted though, never question what they are doing all their life, therefore their recordings lack timeless quality of past masters.If you would like to know real Scriabin, you must listen to Sofronitsky, whom Richter once mentioned as god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you have insomnia","review":"Ashkenazy ruins everything he touches.

This and the shots of violent and sexually-explicit comic book pages make viewing at times inappropriate for children or students.3) There is a definite Western slant in the dialogue that seems to reinforce - not cut through - the stereotypes about Japan and its people.

It was entertaining to see what is going to happen next as this family explores the depths of its depravity."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"I'm a big Miike fan, but I must admit, Visitor Q left me unimpressed and a bit sick of this attempt to push or cross the line while illustrating a moral.I loved this film for it's exposure of elements..true elements of what seems to be the downfall of the Japanese (and even Western) family life/structure. Most elements of the family's disfunction were either taken strait from the Japanese newspapers or bore incredible similarity, but, the genius of that was lost when every thing from incest, fulls scenes showing middle-aged lactating, scatology, necrophilia, domestic abuse and murder were featured in an almost pornographic-like manner.This was Miike showing off and patting himself on the back while doing it. Sadly, it really is, or could be, a great story, but the story itself seemed to much to be a means of holding graphic scene of every taboo together."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilariously brutal","review":"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. I am a woman and I LOVE this movie. I laughed all the way through it, even though I felt guilty doing so. People who think this is \\"pointless shock for the sake of shock\\" are a bunch of morons. It is original, postmodern, and the writing is brilliant. But, yeah, it's also EXTREMELY f*cked up. But it's f*cked up in such an imaginative and well-written way that places it on a shelf above shockorama stuff. This kind of stuff is the future of art, if you ask me...it's called \\"Bizarro.\\" Check it out. And if you just don't get it then that's your problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This movie(if we can call it that)was the biggest waste of a disc that I have ever seen.Besides being disturbing and discusting the movie makes no sense what so ever.I think I would rather have a root canal or spend the night in a Turkish prison then have to suffer watching this piece of trash again.Dont waste your money or time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern art?","review":"Mix of bulling, violence and simply psycho, enchanted with soft sex at astonishing level hardly leaves anyone indifferent to this low-budget movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takashi Miike AT HIS WORST","review":"This movie was Garbage...I though Vistor Q was going to be great but instead I got garbage...Its stupid and yet disturbing...Trash....Very bad...THis movies plot was just as stupid as the film...DO NOT GET THIS FILM!!!-0000000/5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, tasteless GARBAGE","review":"I had an open mind when I read about Visitor Q. It sounded like an interesting and provocative take on such a disturbing topic, but this movie was anything BUT interesting and provocative. It is actually a poor-quality, low-budget porn flick. The subject matter is not only stupidly unbelievable, it is downright disgusting. I could not take this movie seriously, even though it was supposed to be such a serious subject. There is a section of this trashy movie where the father gets \\"stuck\\", and it is so implausible and ridiculous that I had to laugh. There is absolutely NOTHING interesting or exciting about this \\"film\\". I fast-forwarded through the WHOLE movie, and still felt I wasted 15 minutes of my time. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this nonsense","review":"Although slightly disturbing and gross, this film is fairly pointless and boring. I love original and somewhat strange films, however this film (despite the ongoing incest and other taboo behavior throughout the film) is senseless and almost boring. In fact I could barely sit through the entire movie, not because it was disturbing, but rather because I was about to fall asleep! I understand the concept completely, but I don't find that it helps in the least...I do agree with one thing in other reviews, the quality of this film is very poor. However I would also add that the acting is also atrocious! Overall, I would never recommend this film to anyone, unless perhaps they were suffering from sleep depravation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh What a Visitor!","review":"Let just say this film is not for everybody. It probably will offend some. You have a mom who is a prostitute and junky a son who is beaten by local class mates and then takes his short comings out on his mom by beating and just torturing her. A dad who is a reporter who has sex with his own prostitue daughter. You can see this alone makes for a sick and twisted faimly. I think you get the ideal about this film. There are more disturbing parts that you will have to see for yourself. If your looking for strange and different this film is it. You will have to read subtitles but its worth it. I think if your just tired of all the same old same old this film might just be for you. I say you must watch it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miike's one sick mutha!!!","review":"By far Miike's most disgusting and vile entry, but also very interesting and entertaining...even though, and I should warm you...not for the faint of heart or those with weak stomach, this film will test audiences to the limit! I couldn't explain the amount of grotesqueness in this film...almost every frame is as vile and sick as a garbage truck, but it is a masterpiece in its own right. you almost get the feeling that you 're actually watching a reallity show ...but a very nasty one. Takashi miike is a cinematic genious and this is his most disturbing and creative film so far. I won't review it because I hate reviews...but if you are not familiar with Miike's work, try Audition or Ichi the killer first. If you are able to finnish watching those films, or by any chance find'em entertaining (which they certainly are!!!) then move for Visitor Q ...but be prepared...this will shock the living crap out of you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"Unfortunately, this movie is just a jumble of family based atrocities. Make a list of taboos, then one-by-one, cross them off as the movie proceeds. Things happen, so I guess that counts as plot, but not really \\"theme\\", unless finding new lows is \\"theme\\".I had absolutely no sense that this was a real family, that there was any kind of familial relationship, or even basic human caring. Of course, undoing taboos involves seeing the destruction of what the taboos are supposedly intended to protect, so lacking any normal foundation, tearing at the fabric of a fake family was just rending.These points could have been made more effectively with a stronger base and a more subtle application of the violation of social norms. Peeling the onion, as it were.Instead we get a shotgun blast of violence and ludicrous behavior. Not the best work we've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I really liked this movie and it is a crazy one. Takashi Miike is a excellent director and I feel this is one of his better ones. I enjoy movies that shock ,surprise and entertain you all the way through.

I would recommend this to any Miike fan and I even think it's a good start for new fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I've been torturing my copy of Audition for years and finally decided to check out the \\"legendary\\" VisitorQ. Foreign, Artsy, Disturbing, etc? Fine. VistorQ? Garbage! A standard story hidden beneath shallow shock and awe that's preoccupied with hiding the films lack of depth. This movie did not disturb me. I've seen worse. I'm not trashing it because of the incest, milk, murder, necrophilia, etc. It's just not a good movie. Two stars instead of 1 because I can barely see what this movie was trying to do. It just fails horribly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people should not be allowed to watch Miike.","review":"If you are a moralistic bore, who was offended by Little Miss Sunshine (as apparently many were) DON'T watch this film.If you enjoy the early films of John Waters and enjoy being jolted and even disturbed by over the top violent humor, then I say 'what are you waiting for a second brick to the head?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the %$#^@#","review":"Well, I thought I knew what to expect after viewing my first few movies by this director, but little did I know....This is just weird, but wonderful!

I find myself searching every web site and store looking for all of his movies...Happy hunting!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst movie I've ever seen","review":"I must say, Takashi Miike; the director of this film is a very disturbed individual. I feel like this was made only to shock and disgust people. other than that, there's absolutely nothing to it. From a Japanese female point of view, I was very offended and disgusted by the story. This film is SICK - I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"You know what would shock me?A \\"nice\\" Japaneese film...a film with a bit of warmth and humanity to it...Hell, a romance, that would be mad!These are just getting teadious...Ichi the blah blah blah, enough!!!These Japaneese movies movies are like Japaneese food, very beautiful to look at and amazingly technically put together....but Japan has the highest rate of bowel cancer in the world.Know what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS!!!","review":"Takashi Miike should be serving time for his films. Plain and simple.Yeah, I should've known what I was getting into after Audition & Ichi the Killer. This one takes the cake though.

Otherwise, I'd stay far, far away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Takashi's best...Stick to AUDITION","review":"This film was a bit too twisted and sick for me but I still managed to watch it in one piece. This film was just a pure crap and had some really unnecisary scenes and is just as bad as the unholy overrated Ichi the Killer. If you want to see a good Tkashi Miike film watch Audition...Forget this crap..2.1 out of 5 stars..Lates"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry but this is funny......","review":"While this movie trys to raise the bar in shock and awe it really isn't easy to take this movie serious its like a george carlin skit, he is talkin about serious matters but all in all its still damn funny.The sad part is i am not even sure what this movie is about the plot goes nowhere the sences of violence look like they are from monty python its just a silly movie and how anyone can give this movie more than 2 stars is beyond me, maybe i am missin somthin.... but if you want real takashi go with audition or ichi the killer...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visitor Q","review":"I honeslty did not know who Q was until near the end of the film, which in my case was really sad but sue me. This film is about a guy who enters the life of a family and helps them become happy and sane. There is a lot of strange stuff in the film, especially with the long twisted sex scene opening. I know it might seem sick, but I couldn't help but laught during one of the scenes of the son beating his mother. It was just too darn ridiculous. The whole family got issues but Q helps solve everything with little effort it seemed. Visitor Q is not for everyone for sure but it's a really good dark film with some humor here and there. Worth cheking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got milk?","review":"\\"Visitor Q\\" has it all to shock and amaze. The story is clear: a dysfunctional family--which, in my point of view, represents all of the moral values f****d up by today's chaotic, non-sense, empty and yet modern society--come together thanks to a stranger who helps them to free the real demons that they have been repressing by \\"acting normal\\".My closing for this excellent movie after viewing it: the righteous way to be is represented by a nice and tasty gallon of milk. \\"Visitor Q\\" is the fire that will heat this liquid, so fast you would not notice when the milk spilled--be warned, the mess may not be of your liking.Based on Passolini\`s Teorema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic, Exciting, A Real Page-Turner!!!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book. I read Ms. Jones' previous novel, and I liked the story of Eric and Tangie, but it but the excitement was missing. Ms. Jones has a real hit with the story of Kevin(Alex) and Maria. I absolutely loved the book. The cover models did not match the description of the characters as was written in the book, but I loved the story. it was well written, sensual, and had a suspenseful plot with a great ending.

For instance, the section on Friendly's includes only a few ice cream and dessert information and nothing about the meals. Only information readily available (information about McDonald's meals, for example) is included. The sample contains only random selection of fast food restaurants. There are no guesstimates about typical dishes in non-fast food restaurants.

Battery reportedly saves not only time/date but also all recorded messages. Bad points: 1. Product that I received had a manufacturing defect -- the \\"next message\\" button did not work. This button is also used to set the date and time, as well as the PIN code for remote operation. Had to deal without use of those features. 2. To install the battery, need a phillips screwdriver. A \\"no tools needed\\" approach would have been better. 3. Had a hard time installing the battery -- battery cover would not close unless extra force was applied.

Sound quality, above all, was the most important quality for me. I scoured the web for something that would get the job done -- the Blue Bean seemed to fit the bill. Not so. I am appauled with the sound quality. It is very bad. Both the outgoing and incoming messages are muddy. Don't confuse volume for clarity. The volume can reach high levels, which is nice. However, because the messages are so muddy, it is very difficult to hear what is being said, despite playing it at a high volume. I can't believe that some company can't manufacture a DIGITAL answering machine that is high quality, and sounds as good, or better than a tape machine. I'm willing to pay for one if it exists. Sadly, the Blue Bean is not that machine, and I CANNOT recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great but Does it work?","review":"This answering machine has two great advantages over alot of other ones: it is cute and it is small. Unfortunately the good news ends there.Answering machines have to do two things: record messages and play them back. This one does record messages and it does play them back -- at least I think that is what it recorded. The sound quality is so bad the messages are almost impossible to decipher. After 6 months of wanting to rip it from the wall, I finally did just that and tossed it in the garbage. I replaced it with an AT&T version and I couldn't be happier.

Every song on this CD is incredible, with provoking lyrics, thick guitars and one of the most talented drummers to come across this genre (he'll pour down an onslaught of lightning-fast fills)...the chemistry between vocals + drums is magic - giving the songs a definitely surreal quality. Joel's voice is also insane- see tracks like Disappear, the train, and Till we have faces (holding out a high note for about 15 seconds- this song is sure to become an emo anthem-one of the craziest). Every song has such a strong melody yet they are all so distinct in their structure.Check this band out live...they'll be out on the east coast soon, it's probably the most incredible show ever...there is no reason that they shouldn't go \\"big\\" on their musical merit alone...no overproduced hype here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Band Ever","review":"These guys in my opinion are one of if not the best band of current times, Christian or Secular.

We have just gotten to the adventures of Snaggletooth and Red, and the students are very interested in what the characters will do, and how they will get to the Veritas to save Cyon. Can they suceed? Of course, every child knows that true heroes must be at least somewhat sucessful, but the path that sucess takes is the proof of an excellent story that will linger in the memories of my students.

I especially like 'Les Adieux.' Ashkenazy is my favorite pianist. He is my favorite because his performances are 99.99% of the time FLAWLESS. His interpretations, in my opinion, are top notch, cannot be beaten. Even though some say that he is a better Chopin or Mozart performer than a Beethoven, I beg to differ. His style, in my opinion, is much more suited to Beethoven, and it shows through in this compilation. This is a must buy for any Beethoven or piano lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashkenazy goes horribly wrong.....","review":"I admire Ashkenazy for his Mozart Concerti(20, 21, 23, 24, 25), all his Chopin except for a slow Raindrop Prelude, all his Beethoven Piano Concerti in 1986-1987 with the Cleveland Orchestra and his wonderful playing on the Beethoven Violin Sonatas with Perlman. He is also outstanding with Rachmaninov's Piano Concerti, wonderful.However when it comes to Beethoven's Piano Sonatas, it's almost as though he's afraid to play it straight and he totally upsets the dynamics of every piece, usually too slow, too tentative in all the wrong places, a good example is how slowly he plays the opening chords to the Appassionatta, no passion whatsoever!He has not the least sensitivity to this monument of music, what a terrible disappointment and waste of 7 years recording. For much better LvB Piano Sonatas try Rudolf Serkin, John O'Conor instead. O'Conor is especially good with the Hammerklavier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rate the CD...IF I COULD ONLY HEAR IT!!!!","review":"Hopefully this is only due to a defective copy of the CD but the copy I received was barely audible.

The teeth are pretty fine though so it allows pretty decent adjustability.It's basic nature doesn't keep it from doing its job though and it is well enough made that it should hold up to years of use.

I really wanted to give toy a zero, but it's not a selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speer","review":"Albert Speer lived from 1905 to 1981. In 1927 he received an architecture license. He joined the Nazi party in January of 1931 after hearing Hitler speak at a Berlin rally in 1930. He was Hitler's chief architect from 1933 to the end of the war, and minister of armaments and war production from 1942 to the end of the war. In 1946 he was sentenced at the Nuremberg War Trials to 20 years imprisonment in Spandau prison, in West Berlin. He was released in 1966.I enjoyed the author's bookThe Face Of The Third Reich: Portraits Of The Nazi Leadership, and have long been curious about Speer, but knew little about him. This book does not delve as much into the psychology of its subject as I had hoped (the author, Fest, did do this for the subjects in the other book) but it is a good overview of Speer's rise to influence and power, the infighting and distrust that went on around Speer, and the ups and downs of Speer's friendship with Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Infectious","review":"Very seldom do I bother to post comments for books ... but, in this instance it is warranted.Caprice Crane is a very talented artist; capable of vivid imagery as well as biting wit and rauccous, riotous laughter. Caprice's writing style and choice of subject matter just blow the reader away simultaneously pulling him/her into the all-too familiar and believable situation and not letting go until every muscle in the body - from the forehead (laugh lines) down to the tippy-toes (from toe-curling laughter) - is sore from irrepressable, irresistable laughter.I came across this book and authoress due to myspace and mutual friends and i couldn't be happier that I did.I know that anyone who reads this will be immensely pleased ... and, as a suggestion ... be careful while reading, you're gonna laugh 'till you lose all control, haha.ENJOY!!! I know I did, as did many, many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should stop at \\"Stupid\\"","review":"This book was quite bad. I would not recommend it and I am surprised that it has gotten as many favorable reviews on here as it has. I honestly expected to come on here and find a much lower rating. The writing was awful and I did not find it all that funny in general. I quite like chick lit especially when I am in the mood for something light and funny, but this read was not worth it - I could barely finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight but Entertaining","review":"\\"Stupid and Contagious\\" is a quick enjoyable read, but not terribly original. It's highly derivative of Nick Hornby's work -- you'll find numerous similarities between it and \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy\\" -- and the novel \\"Syrup\\" by Maxx Barry. The female character is great, so I hope Crane gives her a new, more interesting life in her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible writing.","review":"A 10 year old could've written this book. I have shelves upon shelves on books in my home and this is the ONLY book I've THROWN IN THE GARBAGE. It makes Sweet Valley High look like Charles Dickens. Even as I read the \\"writer's\\" dedication at the beginning of the book, I found myself gagging. When you read the \\"About the Author\\" section at the end of the book, you might find yourself gagging, too. I guess it goes to show, virtually ANYONE can publish a book. So in that sense, I guess the book gave me hope. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contagious and brilliant....","review":"I was given this book by a friend and had to go buy my own copy so I could read and reread this A++++ book.The first time I read S/C my husband asked me to leave the room as I was laughing so loud.

Heaven is exactly how every girl wishes they could be but can never find the words. She is so fun and has quick come backs. Brady is the boy next door every girl has always wanted. I liked that Caprice used common experiences that everyday people have when it comes to relationships and jobs. Speaking from experience of being a waitress she had it dead on the nose of how people treat wait staff.

The dialogue was littered with pop culture references that made it feel like one of those millions of Tarantino/Kevin Smith ripoffs that populated video store shelves in the mid-90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I tried hard to finish this book because it was recommended by a friend. I got about three-quarters of the way through it before abandoning it for more stimulating reading -- like, for example, the ingredients of a nearby tube of toothpaste. There's absolutely nothing original about this book. The protagonists are annoying and nearly indistinguishable from one another. They're exactly the kind of characters that, if you met them in real life, you'd find yourself fighting the urge to punch them in the stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not stupid, but definitely contagious!","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise, and one I quite enjoyed. I picked up Caprice Crane's newest book and the title for this one caught my eye so I added it to my basket. The relationship between Heaven and Brady is enjoyable, and what twenty something can't help but relate to Heaven's down on your luck life? A fun and light hearted read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Random meetings - Fun book","review":"Do you need to ponder the, \\"Why the heck did I meet this person?\\", \\"Why does this person always show up at the worst times?\\" or \\"Why did a normal situation 5 minutes ago, turn into something only a freak would do?\\" questions. This book has some funny answers for this, it is a light read and will have you laughing about the hilarity of people who have nothing left to lose. Cinnamilk forever. BTW - My sister did this as a child, since we were out of cocoa, it tastes badly without the sugar. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ENJOYABLE!","review":"As a person who mainly reads suspense novels, I was really happy to find such an enjoyable book. Crane writes with an easy-flowing style that it makes this story fun to read and hard to put down. Both characters are well-developed and the author has a real insight into the minds of men and women alike. I HIGHLY recommend STUPID & CONTAGIOUS! Pick up a copy...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious! MUST READ!","review":"Stupid and Contagious is an absolutely hilarious look into the lives of two neighbors, Heaven and Brady. It follows their stories seperately as well as together.

I highly recommend this book, you will love it! 5 stars, all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT TITLE FOR MAY","review":"I enjoyed this book as an unique new piece of writing from a budding talent.

I can chuckle, or nod, but hardly ever belly laugh. I laughed so hard reading this book that I blew snot bubbles. What really appealed to me was the author's use of pop culture references. Each section begins with lines from movies. I couldn't wait to get to the next section to see if I recognized the line and to see if I had seen the movie. After reading the book, I felt like I knew Heaven and Brady intimately and I deeply wished I really knew people like them. I can safely say that it was the most entertaining book I have ever read, and I will make it an annual event to read it.This book will appeal to all ages. I hail from Generation X, but recommended the book to a 60 year old grandma who loved it just as much as I did. Do yourself a favor and make a date with Heaven and Brady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely stupid; Hope it's not contagious.","review":"I don't know. Maybe I expect too much from the books I read, even the frivolous girly ones. I just didn't like the main characters in this one, and after awhile found myself not caring about what happened between them. Make Heaven a little smarter, and not a carbon copy of a gazillion vacuous women in this world, and maybe I'd be interested.I wonder if any of Gilligan's kids got a book deal, and if it's any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Stupid and Contagious is one of those rare books that comes along when you least expect it to remind you what a good book is supposed to be like. Once you start reading it, you'll have a tough time putting it down. It's easy to relate to the two main characters, Heaven and Brady, because Ms. Crane make them so true to life. There's nothing gimicky here, no fluff, and no filler. One of the best things about the book is that it's told from two different perspectives, Heaven's and Brady's. It's almost like Ms. Crane lets us into a secret club where we get to see what the opposite sex is thinking. I really enjoyed Ms. Crane's take on the music business and pop culture, which is interlaced throughout the storyline. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you might even get a hankering for a can of Tab by the time you're done reading. If you buy this book you definitely won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, laugh-out loud read","review":"I would highly recommend this book! The narrator flips between a female and a male so you get different perspectives and makes the book a fun read. The main plot is a bit predictable but the series of events leading up to the end can't be guessed. There are quite a few music references so if you're into music, this book might hold your attention.There are also quite a few funny and entertaining scenes which are very funny. I often found myself laughing out loud or recounting jokes to friends! I loved this book because of the quirkiness of the characters and the writing style - which kind-of rambbled and analyzed some daily occurences that you never really pay attention to - like the importance of an aisle seat and never switching seats on an airplane!!Read this book if you're looking for a fun and light read. You'll read right through this book in a matter of days.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"This show is horrible. Beware of its awefulness.

Home depot sells about 4 different types of glue for pre-pasted borders and I think anyone of them would be fine.Get the back very wet, we used a sponge, and then apply the glue.We had our best luck cutting the border into 4 foot strips. We painted the room a warm off-white and it looks great. Very cute pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different twist","review":"This is an interesting book. The authors took a different approach to human origins. Instead of relying soley on fossils, they prefer to use molecular evidence to support their hypothesis.They claim that humans, chimps, and gorillas shared a common ancestor less than 4 million years ago (mya), which is quite different from the 20 mya which is the number used by \\"traditionalists.\\" They also believe that the ancestor might have been more \\"manlike\\" than \\"chimplike,\\" or a man-ape rather than ape-man. Also suggested is that neoteny occured in our evolutionary development.This is not all that was discussed in the book. Other interesting topics include chimps and language/communication experiements, ape ancestory, and brachiation.Certainly a good read for those interested in palaeoanthropology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy way to control our elevator landing doors","review":"We installed one of these on each floor so wheelchair bound hubby can easily open the landing doors from the outside.

I wear a 15 and it feels a bit snug even though there is plenty of room left at the toe. I usually wear extra insoles for padding but these shoes are already comfortable enough.

They are clearly walking shoes, but they look fine in informal work settings.I reorder them whenever the last pair wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great walking shoe","review":"I chose this Saucony walking shoe for the leather material, for walking in wet weather, and the clean white look. I am very pleased with the fit & comfort as well as the cushioned support during my walks. The only negative for me was the tongue is not leather, so water could penetrate. However, this has not yet been a problem and I've been out on some wet walks so this may not be an issue. The fabric tongue probably allows better breathing in the summer also. All in all, I am very happy with this shoe. I will probably buy more Saucony products in the future... I usually buy Asics."},{"rating":"1","title":"They squeak badly.","review":"They are good as walking shoes go, I like the width and length is true. The only drawback is they squeak very badly when walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm..! Great shoe.. Yes and No!!","review":"Well I should have heeded other people when they said to go up to the next size for a proper fit. My feet are typical in that I have no special medical requirements from any shoe. I have healthy average feet. These shoes from what I could tell from my short time to audition them was Yes.. very comfortable shoe, great cushioning, feel great on the feet. No..! they do run small and narrow. after a half hour trial with just a medium thick sock on... I decided to return them for a pair the next size up. I'm disappointed that I couldn't be wearing then now.. right away.. they did feel great... just a little cramped for long term wearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the size, may be off","review":"I had great experiences with another shoe made by Saucony, the Saucony Jazz. It still remains the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I took a chance on this different line of shoe, but unfortunately the size is not good for my feet. Although I ordered the same size as I had with the Jazz shoes, and they fit me perfectly, this shoe seems to run a little small and narrow at the toes. I can tell they are pretty comfortable in terms of cushioning and support, but they hurt my feet and cramped my toes, even after trying to break them in for two weeks. Basically, I will be unable to wear these on account of the bad sizing, so it turned out to be a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes.","review":"Great buy on a geat pair of shoes.

I finally gave into buying this cd, and I am extremely impressed! Nearly all of the mixes on here are the originals youve never heard. I used to hate \\"soul on soul\\", but Ferry's original version is unbelievable! Every song on here blew me away, they were much better than the mixes I had heard before. Ferry Corsten is one of the top 3 trance DJs in the world to me (others being Tiesto and Armin Van Buuren) and he proved his worth with this.

With just 25 colors (48 color palette) to work with, you'd think they'd use all 25, but it doesn't look like it. I don't think they use all the available sound channels either. This is in sharp contrast with the Xbox, which has more processing power than the onboard computer of Space Shuttle Discovery, or so I heard (in Discovery's defense, the shuttle was cheaper).The game starts out with a prompt, and describes the environment around me. Dark, gloomy tower ahead. I'm likely to be eaten by a grue.What the hell does that mean, anyway?I'm starting to think the Nigerian I bought this from was lying to me.GRAPHICS: 1/10SOUND: 2/10GAMEPLAY: 4/10INTEGRATION WITH MSN MESSENGER: Priceless.no -- it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda clunky, but fun.","review":"I actually played \\"Heavy Rain\\" first, a newer game by the same company, and I fear that is why it suffers in comparison. The story line is great, and I love the multiple choice concepts, but I don't think they had worked out all the bugs yet, so you find yourself having a very difficult time navigating the controls quickly enough. To be honest, I stopped playing it because I got frustrated, but I can't get the story out of my head, so I imagine I will go back to it one of these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but falls short overall","review":"This game has a very interesting storyline which keeps players coming back to see how it turns out, but near the end some things get way too out there, and it doesn't conclude as well as it starts. The dialogue can be annoying at times, people just don't talk like they do in real life, and this affects the whole interactive movie thing the game is going for. Overall its a fun experience, but trial and error gameplay and things getting too weird near the end make this game fall short of a 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captiviting story","review":"I was a little hesitant with the description of this game. It made it sound interesting but so often the description oversells the game - not in this case. I was so engrossed in the storyline that I was finding myself sneaking whatever time I had just to play. The added twist of playing multiple characters meant more story to immerse myself in. I cannot say enough great things about this game. The graphics were wonderful, the story will keep you coming back for more.

It is nice and thin o you can slip it just about anywhere and forget about it. The stand only works when you have it on a flat surface, which is really annoying when you are camping, but the good thing is when you set the alarm and close the case the clock will still go off. The thing I did not like about this clock was the setting feature for the alarm. it is small little disk on the back you turn with your finger, and you can only spin it one way, so if you miss your time by a little bit you can not back it up, you have to go all the way around again. I also noticed that this clock seems to get about 5 minutes slow a week. It has been doing that since I first received it, but I just check and update by my watch. Overall, it is a decent alarm clock, but next time I think I will go for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"At first, I was thrilled with the clock--it was slim and lightweight. Instructions said that the battery provided with the clock was intended for very short-term use, which was true. The problem came when I bought a replacement battery that didn't work. I bought a second and then a third battery, neither of which worked. All batteries were the same model number as the original one provided with the clock. I contacted the seller and was told that since I'd purchased it more than 30 days prior, they would not accept a return and, furthermore, was told that batteries shouldn't be replaced because it might interfere with warranty restrictions.

While you'll probably recognize the opening track, \\"Roc The Mic\\" from MTV and/or BET its far from the only great cut on the album.It is a must have for any complete collection and its thankfully free of all the hip-hop/R&B collaboration most of us have suffered thanks to MCs unable to compile a compelling album on rapping ability alone.

So rap, hip-hop music featuring Jay-Z, Freeway, etc. When Roc-A-Fella records was on the rise and big in the music/rap game it's that type of music. The quality is good, no complaints. Just miss this type of music. The beats are good too.(I actually ordered this on mistake, I thought it was the DVD but it's okay)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie and Soundtrack","review":"I really liked the both. It was like a documentary on Beanie Siegel. It may of been but do you really think Beans would be singing today if it was. The soundtrack was great with some extreme songs and the movie was great along with it all. The movie was great because of the performances and acts.If I would have to refer a same topical movie, it would be 8 Mile, a bio documentary close to the life of Eminem becoming a white rapper.

I was disappointed in this book, although not as much as another book on inter-marriage, which is why I rated this book 2 stars.Mr. Kornbluth does bring up a somewhat valid point that identity is important to children, however I would question the amount of importance he gives this issue. The entire book seems to be written around the premise that there **will be** children. I found only one reference to inter-marriage without children and this was almost a throwaway comment. I am deeply disappointed in the lack of substance in the arguments presented.

If you're looking for a coffee table volume about the area for guests to peruse, this may be the volume you're seeking. If you're looking for photographic tips, I'm afraid you will need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely nutsy fun","review":"This book was wild. The love scenes were stirring, and the plot was so way out, it sounded like an old movie/Shakespearean role-switching extravaganza. The setting is the French Revolution, which is hardly humorous, but this book was full of humor. I have never read a romance quite like this-- the heroine is brave, the hero is almost disregarded in the beginning, although I knew his identity only 1/4 of the way through it. It's sort of a Zorro plot (although not quite that either), in which the characters are hiding their identities by day and emerging at night seeking justice as well as profit. It's a complete fantasy, but that's why it's so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate coffee table book for foodies!!!","review":"This is a deliciously decadent dive into the guts of cooking. Eric Ripert and Michael Ruhlman have delivered a true masterpiece for anyone with an obsession with good food, and quality cooking.The recipes are sensational...the pictures are glorious.

I started paging through it looking for ideas for a dinner party, and then I started reading the text. I couldn't put the book down. What lucky people Michael Ruhlman, Valentino Cortazar, and Tammar and Shimon Rothstein were to be part of Eric Ripert's return to cooking. Sounds like it was creatively uplifting, supremely delicious, endless fun. I only wish I was there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting vacation log for artists and a cook","review":"I bought this because I like Eric Ripert, but the is the second of his books that is very odd. The difference is that this one is odd by design. An artist, 2 photographers, a food writer/chef, and Ripert embark on a series of trips and cook/eat/paint/write/photograph there. The back to the kitchen concept is cute, many of the recipes are decent, but none are fantastic and none are especially relevant to the settings. We mostly learn of Ripert's likes and dislikes (he likes cured lemons and several other pantry items that probably are not in your pantry). In short, this book is not bad, but it's not a real home run on any level either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a coffee book table","review":"Not meant for normal people to use as a cookbook.

It's a very user-friendly machine and I loved the Coral Red color - which reminds me that I was disappointed to find out that there are not many color options for these machines as there used to be.One good thing to consider is that as soon as you purchase a Nespresso machine, you are considered a Nespress customer; and for any questions or complaints you might have about the product, you can directly contact Nespresso (no matter which vendor you purchased your machine from). One complaint I have about the specific machine I got is that the pump is too noisy at times. I guess if I use it more that problem would go away, but I only make coffee with it couple of times during the week. All together I like the product...

It has an enemy, weapon, item and character index and it doesn't give away the ending of the game. It tells you what herbs to mix and the result of mixing them. It tells you where to find the weapons and their ammo. The maps are also very well done. They tell you where to find herbs, weapons/ammo, and save points. This guide also tells you what attacks the enemies have and it gives you strategies for defeating each monster.

Some complete sets you've got to have: All the Haydn symphonies, all the Haydn string quartets. Well, add to that all his piano trios as well, and these are the performances to own. It's all delightful music, wonderfully played. As a small footnote, I will add that I purchased this item through Amazon within the past month, and what I received was not the packaging currently displayed in the item listing. Instead, the discs came in paper sleeves that sat within a pasteboard box accompanied by a booklet, with different cover graphics, all under the Decca label -- a more recent issue of the same material, and I adore the new packaging. The focus, though, is the music, and this set is a big winner without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime","review":"These are among the most beautiful and satisfying CDs that I own. The performances are nothing short of sublime, and preserve the essence of the best years of the Beaux Arts Trio. The recordings themselves are balanced and have both warmth and intimacy.

These discs would be high on the list of my desert-isle collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Issues with the HDMI inputs","review":"I had major problems with the HDMI inputs. I had a PS3 and TW cable connected to this unit via HDMI. With the cable, i had issues turning channels. The screen becomes blank (blue screen) sometimes and I have to keep in flipping thought the channels or turn the unit on and off before I get get a picture. In terms of the PS3, sometimes this unit degrades the picture quality. There are these little specs on the TV and sometimes the letters on the screen is screwed up. I'll turn the unit off then on, and sometimes it get worse. The only thing I can say positive about this unit is the sound quality is pretty good. Especially using the Multi LPCM.In terms of features, I think it is a little behind it's competitors. There are other units out there about the same price with 3 to 4 HDMI inputs and supporting DTS-HD and True-Dolby.I returned this unit and purchased a Onkyo SR705."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability Problems","review":"My AVR 347 was wonderful at first, but shortly after the warranty expired, it start to fail. It would occasionally flash \\"Protect\\" on the front panel then shutdown. Originally, the receiver would do this every few hours, but now, it won't stay on for more than a couple of minutes. I sent it in for repair, but after spending $100 at an authorized HK service center, it still has the same problem. Searching the Internet, I now find that many other owners are having the same problem. I caution anyone considering a Harmon Kardon receiver to look into the reliability problems before making a purchase.

It started great, but then the sound stopped working on occasion when we would turn it on when associated with a video feed. We'd need to turn it off and turn it on again to get it working. That occurred about 1 year ago and nearly every time we used it. Then two weeks ago all audio stopped for the video feed. It would work for the radio but not any of the methods of getting video in and out including HDMI and component.

He's easily poseable and comes with a pretty good base to climb upon. If that three-star rating in the \\"educational\\" category seems odd, it's because it comes with a reprint of an X-Men comic book in it, and anything that gets kids to read gets bonus points in my book. I just wish they had selected an issue of X-Men that had more to do with the Beast, he's really just a bit player in that comic.

Most impressively, the storyline is the richest and most involving of any game I've ever played. If you're a fan of Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, give this overlooked gem a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately the best RPG of 1999","review":"If you liked <a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001QEQ8/qid=951776255/sr=1-2/002-2818223-1369817\\">Fallout 1 or 2</a>, you are definately going to love this game. The plot is excellent and the character interaction with its great dialogue is more than you could want in this great RPG. On top of that, the music is awesome and the graphics are very well done and stylistic. This is one game that you have to have if you consider yourself a true RPG gamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torment","review":"I'm not going to knock BI, this is an awesome game, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would and actually felt that it was a bit limited as far as the games I have seen them roll onto the market. The graphics are awesome, the effects are awesome, and the storyline is great. The only complaint that I have is the character was pre-generated. I hoped that it would have been more open."},{"rating":"1","title":"player's torment","review":"this game is a real turkey. 1. the theme is goulish, almost disgusting; 2. the pace is extremely slow; 3. the player options are poor. Also, it \\" eats \\" memory out of your computer. I have nothing good to say about this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great game!","review":"This is another great game from Interplay and it is very enjoyable to play (it's alot like Baldur's Gate to me) the only thing is it's another multi CD-Rom game so you have to change discs in the middle of the game. I think they should release a DVD version of this game also like they did with Baldur's Gate. Overall I would say it's definately worth the money. My only beef is it doesn't support multi-player which is what all good role playing games should do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantscape; Torment","review":"I Have enjoyed this game emmissially.Didn't recieve any manual or big box,but no biggy. shall continue to play anyway. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the greatest","review":"This is without a doubt the best computer game that I have ever played. Planescape Torment essentially lets you walk through an incredibly well written novel. It is funny, tragic, and horrifying from moment to moment. Seven years after its release, there is still nothing that can compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading Advertising","review":"They've changed the picture to the european one anyway, so my original complaint is moot now. They should have strived for accuracy in the first place, though. I wish you people would take back the down votes--I had a legitimate complaint, and I didn't let it damage the score for the product itself. If you want an in-depth review about the game itself, there's plenty of those already.As for the game, if you're into dialogue-heavy games with lots of choices and flexibility in gameplay-style, give this one a try. Its an oldie, but in this age that demands spoken dialogue, this game isn't hampered by the budget constraints a modern game would have. That means more plot, more depth of universe and characters, and more story in general. In fact, this is almost more of a visual novel or a choose your own adventure than an rpg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fruitless Speculation","review":"As has been observed, a sequel was not made. However, I had fun speculating what it would be like if various characters were selected as the hero of the next Planescape. (Since the Nameless One is unlikely to volunteer for a second starring role.) If Vhailor became the protagonist, the next game could be a lightweight slugfest with lots of goodies. If Nordom were the lead, it could be a humorous cartoon set in outer space or on a tropical island. If Annah starred, she could sneak into darkened mansions and stab people in the back. But wait, haven't all these games been made already? By retiring the The Nameless One, with his curiosity, his sordid past, and his intense passions, Planescape eliminates the possibility of a sequel with the ambiguity and mystery of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Awsome Game","review":"I purchased this resently purchsed this magnificent game and i would wholeheartledly recommend it to anyone who enjoys computer games. This game incorporates magnificent graphics, a facinating and very much alive universe, and an in depth story line that puts Baldur's Gate to shame. I feel that anybody, wheather they love RPGs or those that dont, would enjoy this newest masterpiece from the people at black isle."},{"rating":"2","title":"best rpg I have ever played","review":"This is the best RPG I have ever played. The storyline are character interaction are far superior even to Baldur's Gate. This is not like other games. The atmosphere of the game really pulls you in. For starters you wake up on a slab in a morgue with no memories but notes to yourself tatooed on your skin. And in the room with you is Morte the floating skull who tells you he's your friend. How is that for a way to start a game. The game is big, you won't be disappointed there. It is not a new game so you don't need the latest Pentium IV and latest graphics card to run it. The graphics are not as eye popping as today's games, but this is a truly awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Adventures","review":"Planscape Torment is a very good game. It combines real life with imortality and fairy tales. You start out in a mortuary not knowing anything and slowly come up to the point where you learn everything. You have to roam around trying to find infomation about where your mortality is. But at the same time you have to complete quests. I'm not sure what happens at the end but I think it's something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"older game with gameplay problems","review":"this game gets a lot of great reviews, and i guess almost ten years ago, this game was considered cutting edge with RPGs for PCs. i only bought this game two months ago, and i feel it's only okay. the graphics are a bit bland, which creates problems because sometimes your character will have to find something in the game environment but since so much on the screen is either shadowed or looks the same, it's hard to spot important things. also, the AI can be maddeningly frustrating. you \\"control\\" a group of about five players, but they'll do the most ridiculous things, like running into danger, standing and simply getting hit, not attacking. this becomes a serious issue towards the end of the game when you have to fight a lot and need your characters to be on point instead of doing things which specifically gets them hurt and killed. overall, this game is okay, the storyline is okay. it's just a blah sort of game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Decent RPG by Black Isle Studios","review":"My current RPG is Planescape Torment. Black Isle studios release from a couple of years back. Developed primarly using Direct X functions, this game is similar to their other games that they have released, which take advantage of different aspects of TSR's universe.I like it so far, but my one complaint with it is that there is alot of talking to people and very little focus on advancing your characeter through battle. It would be nice to make the next title something more like the old Final Fantasy games. I was thinking of Neverwinter Nights or Dungeon Seige. I prolly go with the Nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stability problems","review":"I can't argue with much of the content of the reviews here. However, be aware that the character control is really poor and that's aggravating in the extreme. I have a high-end PC with lots of memory and disk and the game crashes (just leaves for the ether), on average, about once for every 3 hours of play. The game has lots of nice dialog options, character 'alignment' (good/lawful/neutral, etc.), but the problems I've mentioned make it pretty low in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing for AD&D Players","review":"I LOVED Baldur's gate. This game was dissapointing. It is much more geared toward role palying and you CANNOT die. That takes all the fun out of all those battles. If you are looking for a AD&D game, buy Baldur's gate or the new Icewind dale."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent primer, and not just for radiologists","review":"Written in a straightforward style, this little book effectively demystifies MRI and provides the best single introduction to the principles of MRI for non-physicists.

Mike seems cautious and scared to go to camp. Then the bus stops in the middle of nowere and drives away.Then the kids here growling noises and suddenly mysterious animals appear.When Billy is finaly settled in, some strange thing start to happen.

Camp Nightmare. Here the woods are full of dangers, and the adults offer no real help or protection. So when, one by one, Billy's bunk mates start disappearing, he can only assume that he'll be next.\\"Welcome to Camp Nightmare\\" is a fast-paced horror story, due in part to Stine's effective end-of-chapter cliffhangers. I was a little disappointed by the ending, though, but this is still a good book for 8 - 12-year-old Goosebumps fans. It's ideal summer camp reading, but only if you like to be scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO!!!","review":"The book sucked big time when i read the book i thought it was awaste of money .

I only wish they had this model with answering machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone!","review":"I did a fair amount of research before I purchased this phone. I am so glad I bought it. I love love love the speakerphone on handset option. That is the main reason I bought it, because I couldn't find any other phones that had it. It is so great to have when you are on hold. Our reception is just fine. I saw some reviewers said their reception was bad or echoey, but for us it is crystal clear, and we live in an apartment building in the city (the only time there is a problem with the reception -- a slight dinging sound can be heared by the other party -- is when I am using the speakerphone). I would strongly recommend this phone to anyone considering buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe it's just not a city phone...","review":"Everyone I called with this phone either complained about the bad connection or how echoey and strange my voice sounded. Actually, the phone sounded echoey to me too a bit when talking on it. Perhaps because of the speakerphone? Also, during every conversation I had with the phone, strange interference and drop outs abounded every few minutes. But I really liked the speaker-in-handset function so much that I didn't want to give it up. As recommended in the instruction manual, I tried it in several locations throughout my apartment, always with the same results. Finally, I gave up and returned the phone. Maybe it failed because I live in an apartment building in NYC?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this phone last week and had high expectations because of all the positive reviews I read on it. I'm probably not going to keep this phone because of the noticeable \\"echo\\" it has even when I turn the volume all the way down on it. I don't know if the echo has to do with the DSS technology but it seems I hear it in almost every phone I've tried that has this technology. If you don't mind the echo on this phone than you probably will like it, but for me it drives me crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of noise and static","review":"Im returning the phone. Its possible the city setting has to do with it, but the quality of the reception on this phone is awful. Not only do I get the echo, but I also get static noise at certain places. Ive moved the base and handset around to different positions, but nothing helps much. And now I have to pay for shipping... nothing against amazon, but its probably not a good idea to buy electronics you havent tried out, because you inevitably have to deal with the extra shipping costs and hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful piece of writing","review":"Unlike the other review written by somebody obviously lacking patience for good literature and seeking immediate gratification, I think this is a wonderful book and I've read it several times through. It offers a look into human emotions (including those of Mizue and Tamiko, if one is paying attention), and has a relaxing quality to it. It ties rock garden design in beautifully with the exchange and flow of human emotions, and offers interesting insights into human relations in general. Also, it's just plain enjoyable to read, and a quick read at that! I also think the translation is wonderfully done, although that might have something to do with the fact that I had Stephen Kohl as a Japanese lit teacher at UO and really enjoyed his classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game SUCKS!","review":"First of all, there is no way to even make contact with the ball unless it is right down the gut. Second, if you play against the computer, then you may get a few strikes on him, but he hits the ball everytime.

I have used the hit-a-way ball for a year now with good success. I was forced to purchase the pole because in Phoenix, there is no round poles to play off of. The Hit-A-Way pole was very solid, which was what I wanted. I was afraid that hitting it with enough force would tip it over, but not this product. It is heavy as posted by others, but the attached wheels makes for easy transport. This is a great product for solo players where you dont have to rely on someone else to feed you the ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for All Ages!","review":"This is a great bat Training Aid. It is a versatle piece of equipment also since you can get the Softball or tennis ball kits very easily. I have used it with boys from ages 8 and Up. We use it for our family and our little league team.As for the one negative comment. If the ball does not wind and return correctly then you have not struck the ball correctly. Pop-ups and tips will not wind correctly. This is how you learn to strike the ball properly. Line drives score not pop-ups.As an adult on the machine it is FUN and Easy form of exercise. Machine sets up and breaks down in minutes. So far the only part that wears is the Ball and they last a long time! New ball and cables run about $20 -30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Plain and Simple","review":"I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Not For The Feel.......","review":"As a jazz guitarist you always listen for what you can learn from someone, what they do well and not well. Russell is an amazing talent when it comes to chord melody playing. His voicings, along with slick tricks using harmonics makes for a beautiful addition to the standard approach to playing jazz guitar chord melody. What makes this CD difficult to listen to is his playing in time or with the rhythm section. His lines are mostly un inventive and have a very awkward feel. It does not have the feel of say, Grant Green or George Benson. It sounds as if his picking is not worked out well and subtracts from the over all rhythmic feel of the music. I would love to hear a record of just solo guitar from this artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gardiner's Choral Conducting","review":"Though I have not myself heard Mr. Shaw's recording I can still give my honest opinion of Gardiner's recording of these Schubert works. All of these pieces came alive in very distinct ways. Gardiner masterfully understands the path of the musical phrase and follows it very faithfully to the intent of the composer. As usual the Monteverdi Choir is perfect in unison and seamless in transition. Especially in 'Gesang der Geister' does the mellow sound of the low strings combine with the male voices for a very introspective sound. This recording is very important to have--you are unlikely to find this collection recorded very often elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Shaw instead","review":"Although it is nice to have access to some of these seldom-heard pieces on a major label, I find that Gardiner's conducting, as well as the singing, is irrevocably mannered and shrill. His tempos make no sense in terms of what's going on in the score, and some of the choral \\"effects\\" he gets from the singers are absurd. This is a repertory that is sore need of rediscovery, so it's nice to have a choice in recordings. But the Shaw disc (Schubert Songs for Male Chorus) is light years agead of this one, with sensitive tempos and truly nuanced singing: i.e. rich, adult voices versus Gardiner's shrill boy-choir sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing recording from a splendid singer","review":"After reading the rather rude review of this CD, I was ready to rush to Emma Kirkby's defence, but I thought maybe I should listen to it first before passing judgement. Unfortunately I must conclude that this isn't a good CD for fans of Kirkby or Beach. Emma Kirkby's repertoire covers a huge section of musical history from the 12th to the 18th century, but this is the first recording I have ever heard where she sings later music. So many fans and critics have suggested that she sing something more modern, and it would appear that this is her answer to them. The earlier virtues of clarity and control counted for little with the romantics, and her voice seems so out of place here. Listen to her singing Bach, Dowland, Monteverdi, De Machaut or Handel, but don't listen to this CD. But everyone makes mistakes sometimes - even the Eagles had the Long Run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bass Method","review":"If you like to start playing bass guitar it's useful to learn how to create your own style.

And Baldwin's choice of 4 prominent black activists/artists to illustrate this is an efficient vehicle for this purpose. However, the author's dense, academic writing style leaves one bleary eyed after a few pages. Needless repetition just exacerbates the teadiness. I found the chapter on Robeson the best just necause she refrained from turgid literary analysis as she had with McKay, Hughes and DuBois, but then, those dudes were writers and Robeson a singer. She does make legitimate observations about the similarities and disparities between the Soviet and Black experiences but I would have liked more hard-core history of these individuals' personal struggles with racism and government oppression. The book would have benefited from a non-academic editor and being half its current size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"If you have the tool you realy shoukld spend the extra couple of dollars and look after it.I just wish all tool makers would do similar extra's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Window and Shower Squeegee","review":"These are by far the best and most durable squeegee's made.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"High ratings are questionable - product is substandard","review":"Bought this squeegee to compliment a new custom bath & shower we had just finished that included an expensive frameless glass shower surround. I am very suspicious of the high ratings I see associated with this product. It is a lousy product. The blades are very rigid and do a rediculously poor job of cleaning the glass. My wife had actually purchased a cheap $3.00 squeege from Walmart to use until this one arrived. After giving this Cleret squeegee a fair shake for a few weeks we tossed it in the trash as we were tired of the streaks it left on the glass. We now just use the cheap $3.00 one from Walmart which had nice soft blages like a windsheild wiper. Sorry but this Cleret squeegee is a real peice of junk and not worth one tenth of what they are charging for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it.","review":"It is too stiff.

I knew that President Carter was a hard working, great man; I just did not realize How Hard Working, Caring, and Diligent President Carter actually is. He is defintely a man that is a great role model for all people that are interested in running for a political office, or wish to live peacefully on planet earth. Mr Brinkley does a fabulous side of pulling us in to the Carters' world, educating us, and entertaining us. This is a GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to critical reviewer","review":"I believe that most of the other reviews reflect my opinion of the book, and the man. While he has his flaws, ego not being the least of them, he has done more in his post-presidency than virtually any other individual who has held that office in the last century. What I would like to point out, however, is that the one very negative review below has false or grossly misleading statements in it. Far from supporting Daniel Ortega, Jimmy Carter was the person who persuaded the former President and Sandinista leader to concede his electoral defeat, very likely averting a civil war. Almost every scholar and political analyst will tell you that Carter also helped avert a potentially devastating war on the Korean Peninsula by his travel there in 1994. I suspect that many leaders, while they may be reluctant to admit it, take his advice deadly seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine Mahler First, but Abbado kept growing","review":"Like Bernstein before him, Claudio Abbado found new things to say when he rerecorded Mahler symphonies. This studio version of the First with the CSO (avaolable much cheaper if you do a little looking around at Amazon) is played virtuosicaqlly, but the interpretation remains rather studied and plain-faced. It's also in fairly shrill digital sound and therefore never rose to match the best readings, by Bruno Walter (mono, with the NY PHil. on Sony), Kubelik (DG), Levine (RCA) and Bernstein (two versions, on Sony and DG). HOwever, Abbado's live remake with the Berlin Phil. showed how a conductor can grow into greatness--it's the most imaginative and expressively free version I've ever heard, far preferable to this earlier effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"Just some long term input on this device.

It had been off all day and was 73 degrees in my place. I took a peek with a flashlight through the vents and found that the old parts not replaced were what failed on the rma device.

I have a Laptop that has Harmon Kardon speakers plus sub-woofer, They have a great sound, very good. After reading other peoples reviews I bought a Refurbished HK AVR 247. I am very dissapointed with this unit, the switching from one input to another is not very good,(the display flickers,then finally switches input) as it was with my Onkyo, also the CPU has shut down four(4)times, leaving me with no picture on my TV, very annoying. you must reset the CPU, loosing all your Input settings, and having to put everything back in is a pain. HK tech support is no help either, should have bought a Onkyo!! DE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Audio than Video","review":"The 247 offers a lot of features for the price. The setup is pretty easy. The on-screen menu makes things even easier. I had problems getting the on-screen to work with rca connections, but it came right up with hdmi. The microphone for the automatic speaker configuration is simple and works well. A real luxury. The receiver reads the signals and adjusts output to match. hdmi comes through in digital dolby and it sounds great. Music sounds great, but video does not work as well. I have my cable running thru to the television. For HD, it is fine, as the signal passes right thru to the tv, but for lower signals (480i, the current norm for broadcast and cable), the receiver tries to upconvert, which can sometimes leave artifacts and shadowing. Overall, I am very happy with the receiver. It looks as great as it sounds, but I may run my cable directly to the tv to avoid the video deficiencies of the HK upconversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, very poor quality","review":"I bought this receiver based on reviews that rated the HK units as some of the best for music. My setup includes a set of high end Klipsch speakers and a 12\\" JBL sub-woofer, sound was excellent while it worked. I have gone through 2 units now. The first one failed after 2 months and was replaced by HK under warranty. The second failed 1 week ago and I still have not been able to get a response from tech support. I am now in the market for a new unit and will not buy another HK receiver. As much as I liked the sound the low quality and low reliability are simply unacceptable. As others have referenced the remote is awkward and not very user friendly. A minor negative. On the positive side, the sound was very good. The low quality leads me to write this and strongly recommend you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Receiver!","review":"The earliest reviews reflect a bug that was fixed by the manufacturer. This integrates your home theater and home audio very nicely.The remote control is a bit overkill, but it can really pump out a lot of sound. I am using it with the HKTS 18 Audio speakers. I fear I would break the windows if I maxed this out.Do some research, HK advertises a more true \\"watts per channel\\" than other mfrs and especially from the old days.

The Philips recordings are marked by dim and dry sound, while the DG is bright and fresh all the way through. The performances on the Philips are pretty well all not very inspired and energetic, (except the Cello Sonatas) while on the DG you feel like you want to keep listening over and over again!For the love of Brahms, get the DG set instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Close, but no Cigar","review":"For the money spent, I think this collection of recordings is less than inspiring.

If any feeling is present at all in his playing, it would be best suited for playing Romantic music. His interpretation totally lacks the fire needed for Prokofiev. I would recommend the complete set of recordings played by Berman and Guiterrez on Chandos, or, if you can hunt them down, the recording of Prokofiev himself playing for the Third, and Baloghova, an unknown Czech pianist whom I have been unable to find any information about, playing the Second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashkenazy's Albatross","review":"After purchasing this CD set I was to say the least dismayed! Askenazy's performance is routine at best, and Previn is amazingly luke warm conducting the LSO! Decca/London's remastering is one of the worst I have heard for a 1975 recording! The strings are shrill, like fingernails on a chalk board, and the whole set has a weird bassy kind of imbalance! The best Prokofiev set to buy are the two CD's containing all five concertos on NAXOS, with Kun Woo Paik, and Antoni Wit conducting the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra! Superb performances, and some of NAXOS best digital recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fingers, fingers...","review":"Well, may be I can give one more star for his technique...After all he did learn all the 5 concertos. But what is the point? I have to admit that his first recording of complete Chopin etudes, when he recorded all of them on one breath, is amazing. But lately I feel like he's lost passion for music. Only technique, only fingers and NO heart whatsoever. Oh well...But if you want to remember the performance, listen to Vladimir Krainev! Trust me on this one!!! I know what I am talking about.

I didn't think I would sweat as much as I am so I wasn't prepared as far a having sweat head bands or wrist bands, and I would constantly need to stop to wipe sweat off my face, arms etc. Well after reading and searching for a good set of sweat bands, I found Under Armour, now I had not heard of this company prior to my research and going by reviews and price I decided to go with this brand, and wow am I impressed. It's a good fit the head band is about 1-1/2\\" wide and truly absorbent. It dries quickly feels soft and comfortable yet made solid and feels durable and not flimsy like the lesser brands.

It was not nearly as absorbent as many cheaper brands and it was ridiculously tight (and I am not a big headed person, just normal hat size).

Rarely has the opening 4 note motif sound so rhythmically lifeless. The second movement is the worse, drawn out tempos, ornated dynamics and an unbearable Wagnerian arch to the flow.

Definitely not a first choice. Although Thielemann's control of the orchestra is admirable and the recorded sound is excellent, he manages to purge most of the intensity and excitement out of these 2 warhorses. An amazing achievement, in that respect.

It's definitely more comfortable than some of the girdles you'd find at popular lingerie stores, but the velcro wrap is a bit of a nuisance. After wrapping it around your belly,it does work in smoothing your stomach out and making it appear flatter, however under clothing, you normally see the velcro overlay sticking out - it does not lay down flat. Size won't make a difference, it's just the way it's designed.

And if beauty and perfection in art remains a flawed depiction of the ideal Platonic universe that is out of our reach, then having players who perform without the sweat, moans, groans and other human biological noises of most other string quartet ensembles is something very special and very precious! My highest recommendation for this set! -- Another outfit that recorded great performances of Beethoven's quartets without extraneous noises was the Melos Quartet - A big \\"Si\\" to that set as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geez!

The \\"Carmen Fantasy\\" is a good introduction, and the \\"Rondo Capriccioso\\" of Saint-Saens is one of my favorite violin pieces, up there with Bruch's famous \\"Violin Concerto in G minor\\".

Every piece in this album has an air of perfunctoriness, and the venerable Academy orchestra under the equally venerable Sir Neville never seem to click with their gifted soloist. The recorded sound is good, not spectacular, but this neither adds to nor detracts from the fact that the \\"warhorses\\" on this album do not need another just polite compilation, especially from a violinist like Ms Josefowicz. Listen to her ealier \\"Solo\\" album, and you will get an idea of what fire and passion Ms Josefowicz can add to her technical prowess. Sadly, this is simply absent from the current album. If you've never heard these pieces before, you wouldn't mind this album at all, but if you have heard the old masters (e.g. Heifetz, Ricci, etc) handle them, you will be left wanting much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another New Age \\"self help\\" tape","review":"For those concerned about references to New Age or Eastern mysticism, be assured that Dr. Myss's concepts are solidly rooted in the Christian tradition.

Her approach, however, builds on classic truths taught through the ages, not on simplistic misinterpretations. She has distilled these truths into a very cogent, direct presentation relevant to our own age which should be of interest to those seeking to enhance their understanding of a complex subject.

It is obvious that the enterprise that Van Andel and De Vos started is barely holding on, and books like this are merely a form of vanity press to remove actions of the corporation from the renegade distribution zombies- so much for free enterprise, Jay's views surely are bent toward the right with ultra christian \\"family breaking\\" values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into the success of the Amway Corporation","review":"This book, unlike others about multilevel marketing in general or Amway specifically, gives all the details of why Amway has succeeded so wildly over the years. Jay Van Andel relates how he and partner Rich DeVos built their business on solid, conservative, Christian principles which resulted in unbelievable growth and overwhelming financial success for themselves and others. Distributors and non-distributors alike will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WAKE-UP CALL TO THE UNITED STATES!!!","review":"AN ENTERPRISING LIFE epitomizes the values and principles on which this great country was founded. WAKE UP, AMERICA! Jay VanAndel shows clearly how we're rapidly heading toward socialism because the vast majority of us expect someone else (the government) to take care of us. Instead of sitting on their backsides in front of the boob tube, Jay VanAndel and Rich DeVos got out there and used their God-given minds and talents to help build a secure future, not only for themselves and their families, but for millions of families around the world.In short, this book is an instruction manual for success in all areas of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"vc andrews rocks","review":"this book is very very nice and cool i fell in love with the characters totally and felt as if all of these girls sound so much like the people i know i think this book is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ghostwriter needs to stop","review":"The GW who took Andrews place has done it again! He's made a boring, same-old-plot book. I got through Robin but couldn't get through Teal because it was so boring. The only books the GW wrote which were good was the brand new Gemini series. I'm telling you, stick with Flowers in the Attic and the rest of that series, My Sweet Audrina, and the Gemini series. Don't waste your money! I went out and bought Broken Wings and the second one in the series: Midnight Flight. I did so believing in Andrews and thinking that this book would be so good I'd start reading the second in the series right after.I can't even get through Broken Wings, so I know Midnight Flight will be sitting on my shelf for awhile. This book is only good for burning. Use it in your fireplace on a cold winters night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Fools and Horses","review":"How can I say this. This book is bad. It isn't just bad it's [terrible]. I wish I could sue for time wasted for reading the first chapter in this book.

They still whine the are still naive and still sterotyped so perfectly It makes you sick. Poor little rich girl. Awww nobody loves her. County girl so naive caught in a trailer park nightmare shucken. Easy uneducated black girl from the wrong side. Fo rizzle. How about some girls with some back bone. An African-American female who isn't poor or stupid. Something we can be proud of. I can't see for the life of me why these books make best-seller. Oh yeah people like me are sucked in just hoping they'll get better. Why don't I just ask the sun to rise in the north."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad...","review":"What can I say about such a book except that it was really, really bad? Abysmal. Personally, if it were up to me, I would have put a stop to this 'dragging VC's name through the mud' a long time ago. She was a wonderful writer when she was alive, and this ghostwriter should just quit writing. They should just put her name to rest before it gets any worse.What's the book about? It's just about a bunch of whiny girls who are born to be bad. I'm through Teal's story now, and I'm struggling to drag myself through Phoebe's, it's that boring. Teal was just a whiny brat, Robin...well, I hate to say this, but her sarcasm wasn't witty one bit, nothing like Melinda Sordino from Speak or Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye. She came off as just bratty. I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time, and I read a lot.I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. You'd get more from staring at the wall twiddling your thumbs than you would from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little - too basic and incomplete","review":"This book spends too much time explaing computer operation (pull down menus, command keys) and not enough on Finale. Too often as it gets close to having some depth it says \\"but this is beyond the scope of this book, read your Finale manual.\\" The one page index is worthless. The book does things like wastes 4 pages on a windows/mac keyboard comparison chart and yet does not show how to setup notating a drum kit. If this is your first piece of software, maybe it would be helpful, but if you think it gives insight and tricks beyond your manual, forget it. I feel cheated. I found some mistakes in the book and certainly the title \\"mastering\\" is an overstatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a start, but...","review":"As a teacher of electronic music and a Finale user since 1992, I have been looking for a good, well-written and reasonably priced text on Finale for my students, other than the online documentation (which is actually not so bad in of itself). This book contains some OK beginning exercises for students, but is not what I would expect in a quality textbook on Finale, and for a semester long course in music notation, you run out of topics rather quickly. Particularly, there is no addressing the more powerful aspects of Finale, including the versitale MIDI tool, among other advanced features. I flipped through the Rudolph/Leonard book from Berklee Press briefly, and that looked much more promising, but it is considerably more expensive. Granted, the title of the book does say \\"Primer\\", but at the same time, the concept of \\"Mastering\\" falls way short with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps going and going and ...","review":"Bought it last year and am very pleased with this player. Used it while riding the train. Worked fine when I strapped it while jogging. High quality sound. The batteries seem like they last forever. Off late the gadget geek in me wanted to buy a flash based mp3 that plays OGG once this player goes bad. I dropped it from 2 feet height once (not intentionally :) ). But this player just plays fine. Cant wait till this goes bad to justify buying another mp3-player.

I purchased it under the guise the a Sony would be reliable and of high functionality. Neither was true. The MP3 acronym only means that you can convert MP3's to their proprietary ATRAC format. While their format has merit in it's own right, their advertising and packaging is deceptive at best, if not an outright lie. So, I went ahead and converted several things to their format (which you cannot play on anything other sony ATRAC stuff) only to find out the unit would randomly emit a loud POP and completely reset itself. At first, I thought that this was the power supply (car power)but the same thing occurred when I used batteries. I lived with it for a while until finally, it became so prevalent (translate, frequent) that I gave up. In short, a piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice","review":"Everything seems fine about this item until it's actually hooked up in my car. Everytime I turn the car off, the power to the player is off and it resets everything. The volume is digital so it resets to level 1, the cd starts on the first track, and the incredibly annoying beeping sound (when changing tracks, starting the cd, and continuously while paused) is reinstated. Basically this means that every time I start the car I have to hold the stop button for one second while turning the car on (to disable the beeping), set the volume, and find what track I was on. I'm sending it back. Don't buy it if your cigarette lighter turns off when the car is off."},{"rating":"1","title":"mp3 player?","review":"Sony's mp3 decoder is horrible, it makes all mp3's sound [horrible]. Although I am not an audiophile the difference in quality of playback using Winamp on PC and Sony's mp3 player was very obvious.I you don't mind the terrible mp3 playback quality then go ahead and get this, otherwise look for something else. This one is designed to play CD and ATRAC formats, mp3 playback is a joke.Sony makes awesome hardware (like 50+ hrs of battery life) but spoils it by using some propreitary formats like ATRAC3. Why would anyone want to convert to Sony's propreitary format is beyond me.It seems like Sony has purposefully added a [bad] mp3 decoder on this player, perphaps under pressure from its music unit. That's what happens when a big company with numerous conflicting interests like Sony (member of RIAA) makes an mp3 player. Korean startups like iRiver seem to do a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreasonable 400 Mp3 Limit.","review":"Pros:80 hour mp3 play time.Resume to the exact point within MP3s.Fast forward.Supports 16 to 320 kbps.Cons:Unreasonable 400 Mp3 Limit.Fast forward is slow/awkward.Mysteriously doesn't play all discs (possibly burner soft/hardware related?).Cumbersome controls and wires.Hassle to plug/unplug from car.Remote ignores hold switch when unvelcroed.Remote too sensitive, when bumped wastes batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help?","review":"Can you play the mp3 cd in a car using the cassete adapter or will the car's cassete player only read regular cd's?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"My old Sony Discman had a line-out jack situated next to the AC port for easy car-use. It was not affected by the disman's volume control. This one has only a headphone jack, so I have wires hanging off both sides. It also sits poorly in the pot under my dash. My biggest complaint is that the volume resets to zero every time it is turned on, or whenever the disc is changed out. This is an awful inconvenience while driving, as I have to change the disc, dig the discman out from under the dash, locate the volume control, and hold it for about ten seconds if I want it to be loud enough to hear through the cassette adaptor. Unfortunately, I bought mine on Ebay. If I had bought it at a store, I would return it and look for something good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids and collectors","review":"The Cartoon Network series Justice League & Justice League Unlimited are hugely popular! These toys are great and are sculpted to look just like the characters in the cartoons. The figures come with a display base that locks with the bases of the other figures in the series. This makes them look great when displayed outside of the packaging.Kids will love using their imagination to fight crime and save the world. Consider also getting the Javelin jet or Watchtower playset for really fun adventures. Adults will horde these great collectibles (especially since this black/silver figure is a special limited edition exclusive).

The one exception is the delightful \\"Shall We Gather At The River?\\", an old American folksong. Great listening!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Game!","review":"He y'all. I actually bought this game a few years ago. It was my sole purpose for buying a play station 2. I had bought this game not from Amazon. But I wanted to express my admiration to the company that made Indigo, Quantic Dream. I love that this game is like a movie, and if you guide the character into different directions, you'll get different outcomes. Lucas Kane was a great character for this game, and well written. I love Carla too. This game always goes forward and you don't need to retrace anything. And I am a female, and not much a gamer, so this I recommend for any person that would like to solve a mystery and kick some butt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel please","review":"I was surprised how addicting Indigo Prophecy was. The mysterious storyline easily draws you in. I liked that we could explore or choose options that affect our outcome in the end, but you don't have total free reign and still have to stick to the plot. You also get to control multiple characters in the game and experience the storyline from their points of view. There were no action scenes (that you control) or fighting which also surprised me. There are only directional button sequences you have to follow during key events... Kind of strange!! I had a lot of fun playing this game and thought it was unique, sitting for hours on a free day and finishing 2/3 of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game by Quanitc","review":"Yes this game has a few issues here and there but it was way ahead of its time. The story arcs are great and you really feel for the characters even though the graphics seem bad today. The story does go a little overboard in some parts but its a solid game that you should own if you love heavy handed story telling and deep interaction. The simon says qtes do get a little annoying but doesn't ruin the overall experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action or Story?","review":"If you like playing games for the story then you will like this game, but if your a looking for action you will be disappointed.For the most part you control the story, whatever you do will have a consequence good or bad. If you die you can let the game end there or load and try again.Through out the game you will play as four characters, a man who was possesed and murdered another man, and two cops who are on his trail. Everywhere in the game there will be minigames, that can be a bit redundant, but are fun just the same.So if you're into story like games you might want to look into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"what prophecy?","review":"Some sort of story going on here, but hard to follow.

It was brave of the developers to do a game with a movie-style plot that flows like a movie and you actually control how successful someone performs an action, or whether someone asks this question or that. But ultimately, the plot is shoddy at best, the dialogue on par with George Lucas' recent work, and you can't see much of anything because you have to play games of Simon to advance the plot.I tried to make the most of it, I really did. Maybe it was too ambitious, maybe it need to be better written. But that's my take on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of both Worlds","review":"Although it was somewhat enjoyable I'd have to say I was rather disappointed in this game. The most disappointing feature was how extremely little effect your actions had. Sure, you could fail a squence, but the game was advertised as having major changes in plotlines based on your actions. In the end it only really matters what you do in the final \\"battle scene\\" to see all the possible endings, besides a few minor variations. The only other effect is that some sequences of the game get a little harder if you do the earlier scenes badly. Regardless of this, most every \\"puzzle\\" was very easy.The action sequences got boring really quickly. They are like playing a retarded version of Simon Says, where you don't even have to memorize a sequence but just hit the buttons it tells you.Despite this, the game is fun to play through and has a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful book for the historian (military or pilot).","review":"This book is more than just a manual in that it starts with a brief history of the P-61, then goes to the actual manual which emcompasses an introduction to aircraft systems, then basic operations from walk around check to flight characteristics to release of external stores. In this age of poorly written manuals I was surprised at how clear this manual is. It will add a dimension to your understanding of the P-61 unavailable in (but complimentary to) other sources. It will be appreciated by military historians and pilots (who could compare aircraft operations with their modern \\"twins\\"). Very \\"large scale\\" modelers might also find the detailed cockpit photos useful.

The SonicStage software is slow and not very user friendly. Why does the list of just recorded song keep refreshing every time a song is converted? Nice try Sony, but please package some usable software with your poducts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for your lives","review":"What a mess. Sony missed the boat big time with this one. The software is a mess, buggy and doesn't work well with Windows. My puter crashed a minimum of 15 times in 2 days. Support? I had to hunt them down and then it took, no lie, 6 hours on the phone. Seems the CD was missing a .dll file and windows would not recognize their .inf files. In addition, the unit itself had to have the memory reformatted, a manufacturing issue. Now that it works, beware, unless you rip your own CDs or want to buy from the Sony Music Store, which, by the way, uses a different version of the software and will also crash your puter, you are pretty limited. I wish I had purchased another product, the use of this will be very limited and I cannot recommend it to anyone for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy, yet feeble..........","review":"I've owned this for almost 1year. It looked Cool, yet after carrying and slighty bumped against a desk few times, it broke..Design is fancy and the format type(ATRAC3) is good to save a memory. However, the software occupies immense system resources. Overall, it was nothing but a funny toy for me.Although sound quality,design and portabilty are OK, durabilty makes this player as one of worst mp3 players i've owned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now what?","review":"I ordered this player when it was first available from Sony. For the last year and a few months I have been happy with it. I do agreee with the software problems others have commented on, but the size and ease of use was a bonus for me and I was able to deal with the software issues. Now just as I am training for my first marathon... the battery will no longer charge. I have searched for information on replacement and I doubt I am/ will be the only one with this issue, there isn't even any information on the Sony website. Apple with the ipod/ipod mini have already addressed this issue with replacement batteries.I spent good money on this player more than a year ago, so it is no longer covered, but now I am stuck, with no options and no player. I would advise finding a different player unless you are willing to afford a new one in two years or unless Sony can fix the battery issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy the Sony Network Walkman","review":"I received the Network Walkman as a prize and it has made my life miserable. Contrary to what the box & Sony Customer service will tell you, it does not play MP3s. The computer will confirm that I downloaded the files, but the player displays \\"No Data\\" when I try to listen. Therefore, I need to use the SonicStage software, but the software does not work. Every time I try to load music into the music library, I get an error message and the program shuts down. Customer service was difficult to track down and could not help me when I got through to them. The Network Walkman looks good, but it is a very expensive paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good for the 105 days it lasted.","review":"This is a light weight, compact unit that's perfect for those who listen to their own CDs. I haven't had issues transferring WAV files since I record off of my own CDs. It doesn't skip with movement and the sound is very good. However my unit stopped working 105 days after I received it. Being that the full warranty is only for 90 days, I am now stuck with paying shipping and labor charges to get it fixed (Sony only covers parts for 1 year). This is an expensive unit and I was happy with it while it worked but the price works out to 3$ per day. No MP3 unit is worth this price regardless of size, features and sound. You expect to pay a lot for a Mercedes but you also expect it to run for longer than 3 & 1/2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the concept, but","review":"The idea of having a ladder readily available in a room while disguised as a chair appeals to me, but there's a bit of a problem with this ladder. It says not to use the top 2 steps, which basically puts you back to close to the height of the seat of the chair. So if you only use it as recommended, you could just stand on the the seat of any regular chair without the extra weight of the \\"ladder\\" part. I received this item very quickly, but it's not the best construction. The vertical pieces of the chair back separated from the 3 horizontal pieces, cracking the white paint, and making it a little wobbly. I chose to glue it back together rather than try to package it back up to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Library Chair serves purpose","review":"I needed some sort of step stool to reach cd's and books on a top shelf and the Library chair works perfectly. It is very solid and easily and quickly converts from a chair to a step stool. I opted for the white one which is painted nicely and even. When converted to a step stool there are only 4 steps and the top 2 you cannot stand on so it is not very high if you need to reach very tall places but for a little boost this serves multiple purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny.","review":"Let's stack this lame, formulaic retread against some cartoons that are actually watchable: The Simpsons was consistently brilliant for 8 years and can still hit some high marks. Futurama was original, superbly-drawn, and although it was inconsistent its best episodes were as good as anything. The Family Guy was (and is) sometime hilariously twisted. Compared to these shows, Sealab 2021 is nearly useless. It's visually crappy. Its characters aim for quirky, but come up short and fall squarely on annoying. The plotlines try to wring some humor out of bizarre situations, but it's a lost cause -- there's just no reason at all to care. I really don't understand why people like this show. I know it's on late at night, but I don't think I've ever been stoned and bored enough to get into lame, numbing garbage like this. Along with the static anime, this is a low point for Adult Swim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?!?","review":"Why would they do this?OK, I can understand the humor. A great number of people appear to appreciate it. I think I would, as well, if it weren't for one key missing ingredient. Whey didn't they take advantage of all that additional space on the DVD (or go with an additional DVD) and include an option to select between the Sealab 2020 audio and the Sealab 2021 audio?I bought this not realizing what I was getting. I thought I'd be getting the original Sealab 2020 (not catching it was 2021, initially).I don't see Sealab 2020 DVDs offered for sale, either.I'm just very disappointed.An Original Sealab 2020 Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"Do not waste your time with this dvd! i picked this up on the recommendations of a few people and it sounded hilarious from what i had heard. i was incredibly let down with the bad animation and sad attempt at humour! steer clear of this title, you will be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny","review":"Don't be deceived by the other reviews.

The sad thing is there just isn't enough episodes out there. There's only about a dozen, and they're each about 11minutes long. Let's do the math here...11X12=132minutes. Can someone PLEASE explain to me why this is a two disc set then? My King of Queens DVD set has 11episodes on JUST ONE DISC, and those episodes are more than twice as long as a Sealab 2021 episode. It seems to me like the company putting this DVD out is just interested in spreading out the material over 2 discs so that they can charge us consumers a higher price tag. This should really only be on one disc, and they should be charging HALF the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Show = 5 Stars --- Warner Bros = 1 star!","review":"this is a total WASTE of 2 discs, and MONEY! the only reason it's 2-DVDs is so they can justify the OVERCHARGE to us fans! the content of BOTH DISCS = 6.64GB, and since you can fit 7.8GB nicely on 1 dual-layer DVD, it is a crime WB wastes the discs like this! i don't understand who is responsible for such waste, but we as the consumer should start complaining to WB about it! (they did this with Aqua Teen Hunger Force & Wonder Woman, ie... stretching the disc count to MORE than necessary) anyway, great show, and at least WB gets point for releasing it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study of one man's descent into madness.","review":"In the year 2020 Hank Murphy had it all. A happy family, a successful career, the love and adoration of his peers. Then something happened.The pivotal event in Captain Murphy's life is never revealed to the viewer, rather we are given a select series of short vignettes which meditate on his descent into madness. Through these glimpses one is given heretofore unprecedented insight into the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but ultimately Empty and Soulless.","review":"Let it never be said that Sealab 2021 was not funny.It is very funny, and like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and other similar \\"Adult Swim\\" shows, it has perfected the art of using crude sarcastic randomness overlaid upon earnest-looking 70s art to make you laugh. (I have come to think this is kind of a cheap trick.)But that's pretty much all it does. There's no interesting story, just the most bizarre sequence of unrelated events you can imagine. The jokes are not particularly smart, they just consistently hit that sweet-spot of randomness. The characters usually all die in every episode, preventing any plot progression or consistency. There's no original music to speak of save the catchy theme song. The animation reflects a clear minimum of effort.In conclusion \\"Sealab\\" is funny, but it is devoid of other entertainment-value content. So in my personal view it is 2 stars, it's entertaining, but not really worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"The author spends paragraphs, pages, and chapters on ideas that could be expressed clearly in one or two sentences.

It was also noisy (clicks, ticks) while it played. I have owned other Sony products and have had no problems with them. This is the first time that I am quite disappointed with a Sony product for only 1.5 years of use. I called Sony Service Center and was told it could be replaced with a \\"refurbished\\" one at a cost of $78.97, recommending that it might be wiser to just buy a new one. I have no intention of doing either. I will inform my friends, including investors, of this experience, and cease purchasing Sony products and encourage them to do likewise."},{"rating":"2","title":"great player, easy to use software","review":"I have used many, many portable cd players over the years but this is my first mp3/cd and although I don't know much about the technical stuff I found the software extremely easy to use and versatile.

Instead, I was treated to finely-constructed correspondences from politicians, authors, and entertainers. Some of my favorites: everything from Abraham Lincoln, Churchill's treatise on the unintended consequences of praying for rain, Bush The Elder's letter to the chairman of the Roach Bowl in Hawaii, Lewis Carroll's over-the-top apology for missing an appointment, everything by Mark Twain, groaners by Dorothy Parker and Carl Sandburg, and the exchange between Eddie Cantor and Florenz Ziegfeld.Some letters are laugh-out-loud funny, but many are more subtle, understated, and dry. All display the wit and expressiveness of their authors. While I don't want to give up telephone and e-mail, I can see how these technologies have made the thoughtfully composed letter an endangered species.So read this book and then get out some stationery and write a real letter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This should not be under the humor section","review":"If you're looking for funny books, this is not one of them. This book should be entitled personal, intimate, casual (or other synonyms) of famous people, and it should be categorized under history.

It received high ratings, so I read it (I couldn't get through the whole thing and just skipped around to the people I found most interesting) but was not impressed. I love humor and I'm a history grad student so I appreciate certain histories (though I did not expect to see them here), but this book was just not for me.

It took forever to get to me. I mean, it has traveled more than I will ever travel. Poor krill. First it gets plucked from its freezing water only to be squeezed to death and have its oil distributed out of Pheonix, Az (The hottest place on the planet). It then took a tour of FedEx in America. It went from Pheonix to Dallas, to Wisconsin, to Indianopolis to me over a two week period. 2. I don't get krill oil in genral. Maybe slime is part of the deal.

Never wanting to be accused of giving up too easily, I tried the NKO again a week later...queasy all day long, but no nausea on the days we didn't take these.

Then 'Totally Boring Country' would have 2 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"Mainstream \\"country\\" is pretty much all watered-down crap these days, so this CD naturally doesn't appeal to me. However, the one surpisingly bright spot on this otherwise dull compilation album is \\"I Want You to Want Me\\" by Dwight Yoakam. Kudos to whoever decided to put him on this CD, because it shows that at least SOMEONE in the corporate Nashville music industry has real, honest-to-God taste in good country music.Save yourself a few bucks and buy a Dwight Yoakam CD instead. Now THAT'S quality listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Book & Facts","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The events described are an almost an hour by hour passage of time, during the short lives of these two antagonists. We really don't care what Clyde did at 2am on the morning of the 15th of the month if it really has nothing to do with the outcome of the event! It seems as if this author wrote these pages directly from a courtroom transcript or a witness' testimony. Furthermore, there are entirely too few pictures (we want to see more of Bonnie & Clyde - duh!!). Pass on this book and buy one of the others out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping way too much","review":"I was going to buy these & then looked at the shipping charge. Ouch!

I went to Target and the reviewer was right the wooden hangers were there for that great price and I bought two boxes and came home and promptly hung all my hall closet coats and jackets on them. A couple of hours later I went to that closet to get a coat and there was a terrible chemicle odor. I discovered that each one had a smelly plastic wrap around the pant hanger part. So I removed the plastic with a knife, put the hangers outside to air out and no more smell. A bit of a hassle, but great a price for wooden hangers. Thanks-Catherine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value at this price","review":"This is not a good value at the current price considering I just bought a 24 pak of equivalent wood Maple hangers at my local Target store for $14.49 + tax.That said, wood hangers are way better than cheapy plastic ones so I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely outrageous shipping charge","review":"The shipping charge for these hangers is $27.34. Once I put the order in, I was unable to take it back. I am furious. And there is no obvious way to contact Amazon customer service so I guess I'm just screwed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to a Target store, don'tbuy them online","review":"Target sells a 20 pack of wooden hangers for $9.99 in store. By the time you add shipping, etc to your order from amazon, you could have around 60 hangers (if you purchase in store) for the price of 30 hangers (amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best map guide out there","review":"These Knopf map guides are great and very useful. Very handy - so I can stash them in my jeans or jacket pocket when traveling. Maps are very nice and of he right level of resolution - so I can travel around the city without need for additional maps. Plus succinct description of sights to see, along with where they are on the map - definitely a plus for me, since I do not like verbose descriptions with too many details in the other guides.

In case I need additional info on a particular sight/landmark, I typically read it up online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Looks, Junk Quality","review":"CD player started failing off and on after a few months. I thought it was scratches on the CD discs. After a few more months it stopped reading any CD discs. I cannot find the receipt, so the warranty does not help.

All have what I assume to be a bad laser and all had the \\"no disc\\" message flashing.

I would buy precisely no Sony CD/ laser product unless it had a longer warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile","review":"Nice looking system and no complaints about the sound, but what I'd recommend is thinking twice before you buy this if you have small kids or will have it in a rough environment. It's built for style not rigor - in retrospect you can tell this from looking at the construction. My son pulled the cord so it fell off the table from a height of maybe 3 feet and now the CD lid won't shut. It's probably a 50 cent part that needs replaced but for the cost to repair it I'll just buy a new unit. I had an old panasonic box for 15 years that put up with much more abuse than this box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babied the unit but still got \\"no disc\\"","review":"Interesting to see all the other \\"no disc\\" issues. I bought this new and it has never seen sunlight - it's in perfect cosmetic condition as it's always been perched in the corner of the kitchen and tuned only to the local NPR station. Sound is fine, small footprint is convenient, and I use the 60 minute radio-off timer most days. I probably had only played 10 CDs in the 10+ years I've owned it, but sure enough, I get \\"no disc\\" message anytime I try. I had thought of replacing the unit with another psyc but after seeing others have had the same issue, I'll look for another small footprint cd/cassette player. If the CD player worked I'd love this thing but reality is it's only good for radio (and I suppose cassette though I've never used it). Disappointed, cannot recommend. Surprise Sony put a dud on the market. Very un-Sonylike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complex controls","review":"I purchased this device a few years ago and have never been happy with it. Firstly, it is very difficult to setup anything on it...time...presetting channels. Anytime I want to perform some function, I always have to refer to the manual. I bought it thinking that Sony produces good products, however, in this case I was wrong. The controls for the tape cassette are counter intuitive and the tape stopped working after about 1/2 year. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A totally defective product on the CD part","review":"After less than four months, the CD player failed by displaying the infamous \\"NO DISC\\" message. Sony should recall this product. Don't buy it! Its functionality is nothing close to its look. This is the second Sony product (the first one being a 32\\" TV) that has failed shortly after I bought it.The better part of this deal was, when I called Sony customer service, I was told that I could send it for repair for $83 and they will cover the parts cost. And I was assured that it was not a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got mine working","review":"I don't recommend this device because the controls aren't welldesigned and of course there is the \\"no disc\\" problem. HoweverI got mine to to play CDs by plugging it into AC power instead ofrunning it on batteries. I think maybe the batteries were tooweak to power the laser."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon","review":"I bought this in June 2003. In August it stopped playing cds. Luckily my warranty covered fixing the repair. However, upon return I noticed scratches on the unit. When I called to complain, they said that the unit came into them as \\"Fair\\". Considering I got the unit 6 weeks earlier and it has been on my desk the whole time, I would not considered it \\"fair\\". Whatever! This month, November, the antennae literally just fell off. Mind you, I usually listen to cds so I don't touch the antennae. Sadly, the warranty does not cover the repair. The unit seems to me to be very fragile. Not a unit I can recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 2 months","review":"Great sound, but after 2 months, the CD Player dies on you(I'm not the only one).

It is an in concert product showcasing his unabridged version of Send Lawyers,Guns,and Money which is why I bought it. Also on the CD is his Werewolves of London to be played at Halloween as a rite of passage. He was an icon of Classic Rock and Roll and underappreciated.

This book sadly does not showcase those skills.The book is about the Final Four and the teams that made it in 2005. We get the usual background on players and coaches, but nothing that makes these stories particularly compelling. When I read a sports book, I want the author to take me there and show me the atmosphere or a unique view of the players' lives .Sadly, this book is like 99% of the sports books out there. Feinstein may once have been great, but he's slipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"A very good look inside the history of the NCAA Final Four. Many good stories about coaches who try to win one and other coaches trying to continue doing what they love. The story and links of Bob Knight, Dean Smith, and Mike Krzyweski is one of the center parts of the book.The stories about the referees, how the NCAA tournament field is selected, and stories from players who have been there make it an informative and enjoyable read for any sports fan.A great book all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Repetitive","review":"A decent, quick read about March Madness and the Final Four. The depiction of the coaches meetings during the last weekend in March is what makes this a worthwhile work. Feinstein is, well, Feinstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories to hook less bookish readers.","review":"I am an SAT tutor. One of my constant challenges is finding ways to encourage kids to read who'd rather do anything but. Books they actually like are a great first step. Feinstein's stories are gripping and accessible. They'll hook young readers who are more athletic than bookish, ideally making them a little more the latter. And, for anyone gripped by the love of a good sports contest or even just a good story, it's hard not to like Feinstein's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feinstein scores again","review":"The Last Dance joins other excellent books by John Feinstein. He especially has a feel for college basketball. Anyone who loves the chase for the national championship will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feinstein's Worst Effort","review":"I was sorely disappointed by this book. So much so, that I never even finished it. I have devoured most of Feinstein's other books (except for \\"The Open\\". But this one just left me snoozing. I was simply amazed at how many times the book repeated previous stories or quotes. And not just once; the same story was repeated 3-4 times in some instances. It's as if the editor or author never read the book as a whole, only in parts.Some of the stories were interesting, but overall this was not worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Feinstein's books are getting lazier and lazier. As he has gotten older, his access to the a-players is better and better; his diligence worse. This one has a few good anecdotes, but those are outweighed by the lack of flow and repetition throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much New Here....","review":"Wow- this was an easy one for Feinstein!! A rehash of a couple of his earlier books and a couple new stories he picked up while at the Final Four. This book is not bad- it just reads like a look at the Final Four only from the eyes of Duke and Carolina- and honestly much of the info has been covered by Feinstein before- He really mailed it in on this one- I mean you need to dig a little deeper in your source book than Coach K and Dean Smith for comments on everything in college hoops. I like Feinstein's book but have found them getting worse and worse through the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big hoops fan, but this book doesn't cut it","review":"I love college basketball. John Feinstein's book provided some interesting and fun insights into the workings of the NCAA Tourney. Unfortunately, his editor did nothing but \\"word-smith\\" this book from notes. How else can you explain telling stories that were in the book 3 chapters ago magically reappearing! I liked the information, but the book was SOOO repetitive it killed me. Did I mention it was repetitive?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, much of this seems like I've read it before....","review":"...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun insightful read","review":"As a big March Madness fan, I couldnt help but check this book out from my local library. I love college basketball and especially the \\"Big Dance\\". This book is a great look behind the scenes at the Final Four and is full of valuable insight and interesting side stories.Feinstein does a great job of really capturing the essence of the Final Four and the magnitude of the event from a coaches and players perspective.My favorite chapter is the chapter on the unsung players, the walk-ons the players that won't ever step foot on a NBA court and for them this is the pinnacle of their athletic career.I also enjoyed reading about the coaches, officials, and players that make the Final Four the greatest weekend in sports. A must read for the college basketball fan and a highly recommended one for anyone that loves sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Dance: Behind Scenes at the Final Four","review":"Terrific read by the best sportswriter in America...if you are NCAA Bball fan you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never call them trifles!","review":"In addition to his 32 sonatas, astonishing \\"Diabelli Variations,\\" and 5 concertos with orchestra, Beethoven also composed a series of smaller pieces he called \\"bagatelles.\\" The name, which more or less designates a little nothing, a bit of whimsy or fluff, scarcely designates the imaginative and emotional content that Beethoven often invested in these little works. Many were studies for other pieces, or ways of trying out ideas before developing them in larger works. Listening to Alfred Brendel play these works is revelatory: he convinces you that these short works are perhaps the most profound things that Beethoven ever penned. He knows them intimately, having edited some for the Wiener Urtext Edition of Beethoven's works. Yet while he brings these pieces a sense of gravitas, he never forgets that brevity is the soul of wit. In short, this disk lets you enjoy Beethoven's final works for his own instrument played with as close to perfection as you're going to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"A handful of gems","review":"The Bagatelles are but rarely performed compared to the 32 Sonatas (not speaking about the Concertos). The reason is obvious after listening to Brendel's recording: this is Beethoven at his most intimate but also most inventive (a parallel with the quartets comes to mind). A Beethoven which doesn't fit a large concert-hall but a salon where small circle of friends lean on the piano while one of them plays.Brendel's pianism is amazing as usual - simple but never dull, sensual but not over-romanticized. The sound is great and nuanced (I don't hear any humming after repeated listening on my DENON hi-fi).I have absolutely no reservations about recommending the CD to anyone who loves piano music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"I guess I must have got a dud. If I push too hard while trying to scrape a sticker off my window, the blade retracts. There is absolutely no way to avoid this unless I push on the blade gently, which of course means that I don't get all the sticker residue off the window. I ended up holding the razor in my hand and doing a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYDE GLASS SCRAPER","review":"If you are lucky enough to have someone who can load the razor blade into position exactly right, you can use this scraper. It is very difficult to load the razor blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life.","review":"I ran into this book randomly while traveling. It changed my life. It's a new framework for seeing the world and although it may not speak to everyone, it is certainly written in clear prose and will give the reader a lot to ponder. I heartily recommend it for anyone on a journey, whether it be literal or metaphorical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague Psycho-babble","review":"An awful lot of the reviewers for this book are greatly impressed by it. All this book does is let the reader try to figure out what this book is about. It is nothing more than psycho-babble that lets the reader make up their own story line. I found this book to be tedius and selfindulgent. It says nothing, means nothing and makes me wonder how it ever got published. There are no explanations for any of the so-called 'points' that are made just as there is no sense to any of the narrative. DO NOT BUY this worthless piece of New Age nonsense. If you must read it, borrow a copy from one of your 'enlightened' friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Nonsense","review":"Having an interest in Game Theory, and also seeing the praise this book has received from reviewers, not least on this site, I opened this book with high hopes. Imagine my disappointment, therefore, on discovering that it is pure New Age-type drivel with a pseudo-philosophical style. Imagine my further disappointment on discovering that the book is a Trojan horse for encouraging spirituality or religious beliefs, specifically Christianity, although the author pretends to deny this.Don't be fooled by the references to Wittgenstein et al, this is altogether a mendacious piece of tripe which will appeal only to the feeble-minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"It must be me...but this book is absolutely senseless. It does not say ANYTHING that I don't already know..and whatever little it does convey, it does so again and again and again....and again! Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Life!","review":"The entire content of this book could be summarized in a single boring paragraph. Furthermore, it's mostly wrong. The author is attempting to teach something that cannot be learned from a book, and which he himself obviously has not yet learned.P.S. This book is an \\"amateur philosophy\\" book, and has nothing to do with mathematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"Reading this book reminded me why I haven't read any philosophy in 10 years, and thus it'll be another 10 years before I try again (it'll probably be Foucalt's prison book next time). It's a mildly logical tract with some nice, pithy passages masquerading as a profound statement of truth. In the end, it doesn't tell us more about our milieu than we could have learned in 5 pages. The rest is fluff which might give the impression of profoundness and novelty.I'm perhaps in violent agreement with hangedman's statement of the character of the book, differing only the conclusion about whether said character is a positive or a negative. If you want poetry which imposes a world view about human nature, there are many better places to look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words: 1) Mind 2) Blowing","review":"In a cutthroat competitive society such as ours, where \\"winner take all\\" isn't just a slogan, but the guiding metaphysical principle, this book comes like a cool refreshing glass of water, gently nudging us into a wonderful paradigm shift."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR THE PLANET","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. I spent the evening looking through my book collection to find my copy of Infinite and Finite Games. The ideas seem simple, but are complex. It is one of those book whose concepts stay in your mind long after you have finished reading the book. I remeber right after I finished the book for the first time, years ago, I went to a bio-diversity. I remember thinking that most of the species on the planet are playing an infinte game. That is they are playing in order to keep playing. We are the only species who plays the game soley to win. That is our tragic flaw. One species playing only to win can destroy life on an entire planet.I hope we learn the most important thing is to learn to play infinite games--to learn to play in order to keep playing. If we don't learn this simple lesson, life here will, of course, not survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal revelation","review":"Finite and Infinite Games has been for me nothing less than a revelation. I first read this short discourse shortly after it was published in 1986, and have not gone a year without revisiting it both to understand and to use within my own life.What Finite and Infinite Games does is bring perspective. It empowers the self to understand and accept the finite rules imposed by ourselves or others and to decide if and how one plays around those rules or with those rules. It is a book of hope.Alas, James Carse's book is not for everyone. Of the many copies I have given to family and friends, some half have not inspired the recipients. I suspect that one must either be looking for, desire, or already be aware of a little bit of the infinite to really understand the slightly abstract nature of this work.For over a decade one of the top 2 books in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game Time!","review":"I buy this book in bulk when I can and give it as gifts to people I care about. Carse makes a profound distinction between games that are essentially futile and games that support and maintain life and creates a beautiful little handbook for living. There are games that end in X amount a time with a clear loser and winner and there are games that are played for their own sake where competition is not a factor and all participants are winners. Carse's distinctions remind me of Eric Berne's concepts of Good Games and Bad Games. Carse's descriptions are much more general and are not as difficult to understand as Berne's -- they don't require the background of Transactional Analysis to understand making \\"Finite and Infinite Games\\" more generally applicable and useful. Pretty good work for a Methodist minister! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The winner is","review":"anybody who takes it upon themselves to sit, read, delve, and ingest the pages of this masterful, yet quite simple text. The book tells you absolutely nothing new, but instead organizes the minute intricacies of everyday life, only to expose them under one giant spotlight as pretense and absurdity. The book never takes a side for the players of finite or infinite games, but definitely leads the reader to a conclusion, if not a clearer perspective, on the roles in which we play socially and mentally. Not accomplishing this by the bashing of social roles and institutions, but rather by the presentation of hard truth and logic. A life changer, if not a call to all players to \\"play on\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This is basic philosophy wrapped in a poor metaphor. To sum the book, there are things that we must cast off as trivial and there are things that transcend our immediate concerns. Pay attention to the larger concerns and forget the \\"small stuff.\\" Read Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius instead if you wish to explore your own place in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I love philosophy and am intrigued by it. Sometimes though, I am reminded of Mel Brooks the standup philosopher in \\"History of the World Part III\\" ...\\"oh you mean, bulls&^t artist\\".Professor Carse's arguments hold little water once you begin to insert your own questions - but what is the impact of the finite nature of time, resources, and intellectual capacity on the infinite gamer? Cannot one play an infinite number of finite games as a single infinite game.Ultimately he argues that winning and losing are not worthy subjects for argument.Grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A family novel with a social conscience","review":"or a political novel with a lot of heart and real-seeming characters that stick in your mind after you read about them.Tackles the big questions of American life from sometimes in the fifties through to the nineties without clubbing us over the head with any of it, and some of the questions clearly don't have easy answers.

But I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was very well done and the story, acting, and cinematography were all exquisite. Now I see why the film's cover-art and backside features a layout of all the awards for best director, best actress, best actor, and winner of Japan Academy awards for 1984. Numerous nominations and \\"awards\\" were won for this film. I feel that this motion picture, \\"The Geisha\\", is a true authentic portrayal of Geisha culture. It certainly has a more of a REAL-Geisha (accurate) feeling to it which brings the authenticity of Geisha culture to fruition. If you like the art of film in general, or if you enjoy enlightenment on Geisha culture and the talented form of Geisha traditions, along with good acting, some comedy, and passion, then I would highly recommend this piece of good cinema-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una base de datos fácil de usar","review":"Luego de un largo tiempo de esfuerzo por dominar Access, My Data Base es una brisa de aire fresco.Fácil e intuitiva de comprender y usar, además de tener numerosos formatos prehechos, puede armarse una base Custom.

It was fabulous, got good reception of both radio and TV in Chicago. Then within a year, but after 90 days it died. But husband said, maybe it was his fault. So I bought another one. Same thing happened. Now twice. Same issue. Poor design. The antennae is the headphone wire and it just goes, even with careful, gentle use. So no, I do NOT recommend this gizmo. Sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony SFR-M37V is excellent","review":"This radio is perfect for what I wanted. It sounds great, offers all these channels with presets, and the weather radio band is very useful. The hold switch is very useful. It's even handy having the clock. Everything is ergonimic. A pleasure to use. Great reception range. I might get another one to keep away from home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else, this thing stinks!","review":"I always thought you could trust SONY to make great products but this radio is a piece of junk. I bought it to use on my daily walks and it worked fairly well for the first 3 months. Then the LCD display went bonkers and no longer displays anything useful. Since you normally need to charge the battery from time to time it drove me crazy when all the preset stations become lost each time you remove the battery. I normally only listen to one station but it still is a pain to have to sync in a radio station from another radio in the house (much easier to do if the LCD display worked). Finally, the radio just went totally dead so now I use it as a fishing line sinker. All in all I got about 6 months use out of this radio before it found its true calling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, Sturdy, Great Reception","review":"I bought this radio to use while I walk on a treadmill at the gym. Before I figured out that the belt clip works great, I set the radio on the controls of the treadmill and subsequently walked away and caused it to fall to the floor hard. I did that two or three times and it continue to work great. The reception is excellent and is digitally tuned to the exact broadcast frequencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I've owned other Sony products and been pleased with them. This one is a disappointment. It plays beautifully, as long as you are not moving. If I use it while walking (remember, it is called \\"Walkman\\") the signal strength varies and noise intrudes.

I don't actually use it very often because of the poor reception; I have an old cassette walkman that gets better FM reception and gets used more often. The good points on this radio are (1) simple to use, (2) small and light, (3) only uses one AAA battery, which lasts a long time, and (4) has weather band. However, the FM reception is very poor. Signal separation is very poor, even when listening to powerful local stations. Reception quality varies greatly with minor movement of the headphone cord. In general, acceptable reception is only possible in open-air sites, with careful positioning of the radio and headphone cord, and while remaining immobile. I plan to discard this unit and buy a Sangean."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"After returning a Virgin model of the same type of radio, I was wondering if I'd ever find one that worked!

I would agree with most of what's been said already. This radio is small and lightweight, clips nicely to clothing. The reception is adequate, though I don't get the tv channels and sometimes FM is a bit crackly. I have only three preset stations (one on each band) so I don't have to fumble with the most of the buttons. For my limited use of this radio, it does a fine job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Radio But Replace the Headphones","review":"Great little radio with less background noise than the previous M35 model. But do yourself a favor and ditch the headphones that came with it. Instead get the Koss Sportapro(~$30) and get dramatically better sound. It may seem crazy to spend as much on headphones as the radio itself but you'll be amazed at the sound quality when you do. The Sportapro gets great reviews and you can't do better for a $30 set of headphones--they also fold backwards in \\"street style\\" mode and keep out of your hair when exercising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customer","review":"A little static in the weaker stations.

I tried cheaper ones and ended up throwing them away. I haven't used the earphones that come with the radio as I have earbud headphones from Phillips. As far as the radio goes, the best things about this radio is the lock button so I don't accidentally change the channel, the six presets which I have each assigned to different tvs at the gym, the fact that it uses only 1 AAA battery and it lets you know how much battery is left. I'd say the only con is the clip which I have trouble clipping, but that's a minimal problem.

I tried 2-4 different ear buds & head sets to no avail. You can't get to the plug in socket to fix without damaging the radio.

It loses the signal or is overwhelmed by stronger stations when the wearer walks just a few yards. If you only listen to stations with strong signals, this is a good buy. Unfortunately I listen to the Bay Area NPR station for which this radio is relatively useless. It also does a poorer job indoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony SFR-M37V Walkman radio","review":"I am generally very pleased with this radio. I use it mainly during the night as I often have trouble sleeping. The FM reception is excellent while AM reception is quite good as well.It uses only one AAA battery, which concerned me at first, but I found that you get quite a bit of mileage out of it. I just wish the buttons would be illuminated for a few seconds as it is difficult to locate the right ones in the dark. The supplied headphone has decent sound and is comfortable to wear in bed. All in all, a very nice radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you'd think","review":"I bought this radio after reading the other reviews that was listed for this item. I thought I was getting a good radio. Boy, was I wrong! In all fairness, the FM band is pretty good. I'm assuming that the AM band is good too (if I wanted to listen all day to talk radio). The TV band does not pick up the stations at all--no matter what I do. Also, what I really wanted the radio for was the Weather band so that I'd know what was going on when the power went out. Well, guess what--NO WEATHER BAND EITHER! Can't pick up anything!I feel that if I either wanted to listen all day to talk radio on the AM band or pick up a few stations on the FM band, this radio would have been great. But when you have bad weather coming in and you want to know what is coming your way, this definately is NOT the radio to get. I feel I have wasted my money on this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome portable radio","review":"I needed a portable radio that was effective and had great quality. I'm happy that I chose this one. The Sony SRF-M37V radio is a lightweight wonder. It's so small and can fit in your pocket and can clip onto your belt.This radio is awesome. The quality of the sound is very good. The digital tuning and the preset buttons are very convenient. The TV channels are also a nice feature (for local channels up to channel 13).This radio looks sleek and very nice. It's also very nice in that it doesn't waste batteries. It only takes on AAA battery and lasts for many hours on that.At first I thought that this radio was {too much} but it's a very good deal. You get a durable and reliable radio that you can use while working out or just chilling. When the radio is off the digital display tells the time, which is very convenient.

In this brief time period Fremantle travel through all but 2 of the states of the Confederacy. During his travels he meets a virtual \\"Who's Who\\" of the Confederacy including all of the full Generals and numerous well known lesser generals, as well as President Davis, Secretary of State Benjamin and Secretary of War Sedden and several members of the Congress. While holding to the British abhorrence of slavery, Freemantle adopts the southern myth of the benevolence of slavery and returns to England an even more committed supporter of the south than when he first arrived. Most remarkable is his writing style, Fremantle is a superb observer of men and a gifted storyteller.

This time when i battled it in the earthquake arena, mine hit it and made its bit chip and flew 20 feet away and the attack ring flew away. Even though i lost somehow, we looked for the attack ring. When we found it, it had a huge crack at the top. Finally, the third time, i attacked it and seperated its blade base, attack ring and weight disk.

It is a shame this book does not describe it. 2 stars for effort...but my niece came to visit during her Europe trip and she had Rick Steves Travel Book...she loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a reference book!","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. Not only is there no Interactive Table of Contents, there is no table of contents or index at all. This is absurd for a book of over 1000 pages. I expect the TOC problem when I get free or 99 cent e-books, but not at $14. I am soon going to be making a long trip within Europe. I need a reference book where I can quickly look up a city or area and get useful information. I am not looking for a hotel, which seems to be what this book is about. Anyway I returned it within 1 hour of purchase. Sadly, while I had high hopes (considering the publisher), for me the book was useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first rate performance much preferable to his later work","review":"In this release, Brendel again ventures - or should I say, ventured (back in 1983)? - forth on well-trodden ground, but his performance is defeinitely the best he has produced so far and much better than his recent live performances (BPO, VPO). It has a clarity and freshness that stands in sharp contrast to his later, more rigid and inflexilbe style. Levine and the CSO provide a perfect orchestral foil for his playing. The range and quality of sound are impeccable as well.

Blevins' reference book is without a doubt the Roark and Young for vibration calculations. It is setup in much the same way as Roark & Young's, with many easy to understand tables with many cases. It covers the vibration mode shapes and natural frequencies of beams of many cross section and boundary condtions, shells, plates, and even fluid systems. I've had it for a couple years, and I still learn new things every time I use it. A must for any engineer who deals with vibration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service","review":"I received the book I ordered in a short period of time.

I've only seen about a dozen episodes myself, but my 6-year-old daughter has seen a lot more and she said she had never before seen the story of \\"Sitch in Time.\\" Regardless, it's a fun romp back and forth in time for Kim, and grownups (like me) will enjoy the inside humor as they watch.

Sometimes, during the day, I'll look up in the sky at the clouds, and I can pick out the form of Kim Possible within them.I heartily recommend this video to any other 30-year-old Kim Possible fans living in their parents' basement.

Their dogged investigative work was responsible for bringing together a string of events that eventually prompted officials to take a second look at what appeared to be a death by natural causes to, in fact, have been a premeditated murder for financial gain. The twists and turns this story takes as a result of the cast of characters involved is stranger than fiction, yet a true story. Thanks to Yocum and Candisky, an amazing story of deception was presented and which assisted in the bringing to justice an unseemly trio of felons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtuoso Performance","review":"Excellent lyrics!Masterful musicianship!Beautiful voice!This recording is simply superb!Not a weak song on the disc.

Thank God she believes in what she does and puts it in her music. It gives one great hope.One of the things I like about this CD is that it's NOT a superficial rant. It's got all the stuff of good drama -- murders and love affairs....pre-martial sex and fidelity....war and peace. Philosophically, she's akin to Emerson and Thoreau, more so than any modern day gurus and sages.This record is a thrill and it feels very healthy at the same time.

She uses the CD player for the alarm, and very rarely to play music in her room. After less than 12 months of gentle use, the CD player only works intermittently.I checked the warranty information after the fact, and SONY only warranties for 90 days, parts up to 6 months. After the 6-month period, you pay for labor to service the product. It's a waste of money, because the labor cost will certainly be more expensive than buying a new radio.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Psyc Clock Radio","review":"I really like this clock radio.

Hoping to see more soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Free with Price of Admission","review":"This self-glorifying piece of garbage seems like the kind of book that comes free when you pay to see the author speak about modern business. Problem is, with most of these types of books as a matter of fact, the people writing them have been out of business for several years and it shows.I received this book for Christmas because my brother thought it was actually about ESPN. The other reviewers nailed it when they said ESPN is only used to sell the book. The early days of ESPN, the operation, were dry and lifeless in this presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Misleading Title","review":"It's not that this is a terrible read, because Evey does have some interesting stories to tell. It's just that the title is completely false, and people expecting meaningful insight into ESPN won't get it here. This is not the history of ESPN, or even an in-depth look at its creation. It's the autobiography of Evey, pure and simple, and his ESPN dealings get the focus of about half the book. But even that section is just about HIS dealings, not the bigger picture. I'm going to give him two stars because some of this stuff is kind of interesting.But I really don't like being conned, and (even though I just plunked down $1 for this at a used book sale) I was conned. I admit I wouldn't have looked twice at a book called \\"The Stuart Evey Story,\\" but the big \\"ESPN\\" on the cover grabbed me.Evey acknowledges that part of his success as an oil executive and resort developer was conning people a bit. Well, he's used the same method to sell his book. Don't be conned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete and utter waste of time","review":"Silly me. In looking for the definitive history of ESPN, I somehow stumbed on this this effort: nothing more than a self-written vanity project by a long-retired executive with no journalism background and waaay too much time on his hands. Readers must endure droning tales of Stuart Evey's days as glorified gofer to a son of eccentric billionaire J. Paul Getty; pointless tales that have nothing to do with the founding of a network. Other reviewers summmed it up nicely, that Evey was nothing more than a well-placed conduit for funds from Getty Oil to ESPN's true creative founders... he provided nothing more and in this excreble effort mightly attempts to snatch much of the credit. Sorry, pal, you were there as an early observer, little more. (Oh, you hired Jim Simpson? Wow.) ESPN has risen to become an important player in the twenty years SINCE your departure. The whole effort is pathetic, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeze, Mr. Evey....","review":"You'd be better off reading Michael Freeman's \\"ESPN: The Uncensored History.\\" Freeman's book is extremely thoroughly researched and Evey comes off as quite a jerk. He thought because he brought the money to make it a go, it was HIS network (wrong) and he could make decisions without the input of Chet Simmons (also wrong). He also thought--again, because he brought the money--that he could take ALL the credit for ESPN (extremely wrong). He did occasionally have good, useful ideas but this is not a guy you would want to work with. Bill Rasmussen still can't stand to hear his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK to read for perspective","review":"This is as mentioned an autobiography. For those who have read Sports Junkies Rejoice by Bill Rasmussen this gives another perspective on the founding of ESPN. Rasmussen's book is a little more technical and not as \\"action packed\\" but seems more informative. This book is filled with Evey's Ego and his justifications for kind of screwing over Rasmussen. Still it is good to see the other side. The thing is while Rasmussen had the idea, and Evey got the Getty money, the real success of the network came down to those who hosted and produced sportscenter, broadcast the events and marketed the network. ESPN did not really become a full fledged success until the 1990s. Really the network was still showing reruns of the 1960 TV series Home Run Derby in 1989. So while the founding is an interesting story it isn't until a majority of TV's got cable and ESPN got good sports contracts (the NFL and MLB) that ESPN became the giant that it is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petit Messe:lovely piece,uneven performance","review":"The gorgeous Kyrie from the Peit Messe Solonnelle has recently been used to good effect in the film 'Bad Education' prompting me to get to know the piece better and purchase this recording.The whole work is a delight,much lighter in tone and broader in length than the title would suggest.However,i suspect this is not the recording to have(i'm going to try Muti/EMI)as the soloists(a glamorous team)are unfocused and intonation a particular problem.There's a surprisngly tentative feeling about the whole performance.The piano part(a few splashy moments here) is normally taken on 2 pianos but here they make do with 1.....seems a shame to me.Stabat Mater receives an authorative account,another very approachable work which i shall enjoy getting to know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all, the composition itself (Petite Messe Solennelle) may not be for everyone. There are some fine moments, but I find many of the choral movements to be sprawling and unfocused. The martial-sounding tenor aria is a little goofy and operatic for it's sacred text, but if you really like Rossini, you might get some guilty pleasure out of it. The soloists are uneven (I find the bass and mezzo to be especially disappointing). In general, there are some terrifying intonation moments, especially during the treacherous (a cappella) Sanctus. Wish I could recommend a better recording, but this is my first acquaintence with the piece. All things considered, I plan on dumping my copy. I haven't even listened to the Stabat Mater, which of course is much more widely recorded work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty and cheap, and really really hard to set time","review":"I bought two of these in black and thought they would be easy to use in my car. The instruction sheet was tiny (2 inches x 1 inch?), and the text was minuscule. Then, once you actually read the instructions, it was ridiculous to set things, and even more ridiculous to remember how to do it from one time to the next. The time became too close really quickly, and since it was so hard to reset the time, I just threw the first one out. The second one never started working when the batteries were put in.The temp readout seemed ridiculous in my car, far warmer than I think it really was when the a/c was on.They give you velcro to put on this little bump on the back, but it wasn't enough velcro to stick in my car...it kept falling off.WASTE OF MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick on clock","review":"I was sent WHITE clocks instead of the one pictured.

Especially, when he was first released, you have to keep in mind that at that time, if it didn't make much sense if was always considered good. Not to say that that didn't work some times. I just don't feel that it worked here.His writing, especially his poetry is so one dimentional that if there is any interest generated it doesn,t stay with you and soon you wonder why you ever liked it in the first place.

It's catchy and you might like it for a few listens but then it's time to find something with more guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of hype, not very good","review":"I bought this book after my brother-in-law recommended it but was not impressed.

I liked the music of the 60's but the quasi-intellectual nonsense and philosophy that came out of that period is, in my opinion, a joke -- not to be taken seriously. This work fits right in with the truckload of other work from that period. The writer ended by blowing his head away with a 44-magnum which I would probably have to do myself if I wrote stuff like this for a living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spring afternoon syrup","review":"Do you feel blue ? perhaps things don't go your way right now ? Your boss in on your case and everybody around you nagging ? Then let Brautigan show you his world and his thoughts on that world through this book.

I don't think this flaw happened during shipping since the poster was rolled up inside plastic wrap and inside a box. This tear must have been a result of negligent packaging. Had the map not been defective... It would have been perfect. I assume that had i contacted amazon they would have replaced it. However, since I am using this for a classroom I figure this amount of damage to the map was only a matter of time... So I decided to forego the hassle of returning it.

Two things really stand out, and most other reviewers have already noted these:- this product is shipped in an envelope, not a cardboard tube like the world map from swiftmap that I ordered (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006I59E8/ref=oss_product). Officemap really needs to fix this because my map arrived with all sorts of crinkles in it. If it weren't such a hassle, I would return the map.- the lamination is not true lamination -- it's more like what you get when you buy inexpensive glossy photo paper for your inkjet printer, if not thinner. I won't be using any dry-erase markers on this map unless I cover it with plexiglass or some other laminate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice large map","review":"This is a great product, a very large map with many details and cities of the U.S. Lamination is a nice protection feature.

This area is now the Zakarpatska province of Ukraine, but at the time it was part of a newly formed nation. Nikola and his Ruthenian friends, who were in the Austrian army, return from the war and decide it is easier to be outlaws than to fit into a new social order run by Czech soldiers and Jewish shopkeepers. Living in the mountains with the secret support of many of the townspeople, they evade capture and become local heroes.

First off, I could only fit 380 songs on my mp3 cd (not that I'm really complaining about this), but the cd took literally 3 hours to burn. Why, I have no clue. Many mp3s won't play off the disk now, which is disappointing. In the end, the disk only plays 270 songs. The sound quality is horrible, too. There's an odd, rather metallic clicking noise in the background with the bass, now. It's really irritating, and I recognize it from other cheap mp3 players I've owned before.

That first figure, which I call \\"true blue Superman,\\" was accurate to his look in the first season of the \\"Justice League\\" TV series, and had Supes in his trademark blue costume. This version (let's call him \\"blackout Superman\\") is the same toy, only with his suit black instead of blue, and his 'S' chest symbol red on a black background instead of red on yellow. Blackout Superman offers no new accesories, and no special features. The only reasons I can see for buying this are that you can't find the \\"true blue\\" version, or are one of those obsessive collectors who HAVE to have every version of every toy (I'm not one of them). A better deal: get the Justice League's Javelin 7 spacecraft, which has electronic features, AND a True Blue Superman figure free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"Not very good at getting one to where they think this book will take them.

That's big business for you.I've learned more for free on YouTube in 5 minutes than this DVD ever taught me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better titles are available.","review":"This has very basic information, and is not very deep.

If your a novice your just going to get frustrated watching someone play things you'd like to learn but are never taught and if you are familiar with blues techniques there wont be anything in these videos you probably don't already know.

There are a few things of use but not much for the price. The flashy dvd guitar playing is over done and not necessary. People buy this stuff so that they can learn and not something to watch someone else show them how good they are after years of playing. I would not recommend this to anyone but would advise them to look for something with better instruction and not just bits and pieces.

They eat batteries as do all digital cameras so make sure you have plenty on hand if you don't buy rechargable batteries. The cameras all worked so awesome for the first few months. I used mine the most and it was the first to die. The pictures start coming out blurry and then sometimes the camera would turn on and then shut off or would not come on at all. I lost the screen on the top first and then the lcd screen went wacky. I have pictures of my newborn stuck in the camera and am unable to retrieve them. If you want to spend $100.00-$189.00 on a throw away digital camera then this one is for you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious problems","review":"After having this camera for a couple of weeks I bought a CF card for it (it comes with built-in memory). Lexar media is one that is listed as compatible. When I inserted the CF card the camera would not turn on. After leaving it on for a long time it told me the CF needed formatting. It formatted the media and then the camera repeated the process of complaining about formatting. Since then the camera will not turn on reliably, gets confused about the media being there and randomly gives the complaint about the CF not being formatted. Compared to my Olympus camera experiences this camera is a definite no-no when it comes to anyone considering a 3mp digital camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Camera Unreliable","review":"I purchased the camera from HSN.com after watching the impressive demonstration. I it worked well at first. I added 256 MB flashcard and it got very quirkey. I sent it back and they replaced it with the same result. I used a different smaller flashcard and it worked OK for a short while. Then it started having problems capturing the shot. The shots would be fuzzy or completely black if they did register having taken. This is a camera I would advise everyone to keep away from based on my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Digital","review":"This is my second Digital, first was an Olympus that I never did figure out how to set it up right. The Vivitar 3735 is quick to use with easy to read instructions. The settings remain where you set them and the color, at least on my model, is true to form. For a mid range camera, I would recommend this model. I have rechargeable batteries and highly recommend using them for anyone using any digital camera. If you are looking for a camera that has everything, this is not it, but if are in the market for one that is quick to use with a bit of noise, then this one is for you. As far as the noise goes, I have no problem with it, as I don't plan to be taking pic's in a non-noise location."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall a good camera with some limitations..","review":"Tons of features and good quality pictures.... a few downsides is the compression level on this camera even in fine mode seems to be significant compared to other cameras.. with a 128mg CF card I get 124 pictures in the highest resolution mode with the fine mode for compression...most other cameras give only about 80 picutures at this setting so there is much more compression than other cameras...which is noticble when zooming in a picture. memory cards are cheap nowadays so I do not know why Vivitar is letting us get more and more pictures on a card at the sacrifice of picture quality..If you do not plan to zoom and print a picture you will be fine.

Mr. Edward Everett Tanner (a.k.a. \\"Pat\\"...Patrick Dennis...Virginia Rowans) did EVERYthing, wasn't afraid of ANYthing. From the experiences of his deep and lifelong commitment to friends, to wife and children, sprang all of the side-splitting laughter he has left us---\\"Auntie Mame\\", though definitely his chef-d'ouvre, is nonetheless only a small part of the body of his extensive work.Too bad it took him the better part of his life to come out to himself---maybe it would have made a difference in his literary output, since so much of his comedy was tied to then-clandestine camp. But who knows or cares? Any man who can find humor even in the penury of his last years is a creative genius on any level.You'll laugh often, and out loud, and get some great lines for cocktail conversation!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"While a couple of the reviewers here are busy nitpicking things they don't like about this book, they miss the point -- there never HAS been a biography of Patrick Dennis before, and Eric Myers has done a superb job of breaking that silence. I suppose, with an author as well-loved as Dennis, it's inevitable that some of his hardcore fans feel Myers' work doesn't measure up to the imaginary biography they've carried around in their heads all these years. But that shouldn't steer readers away from a very accomplished piece of work that also happens to be great fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger than Fiction","review":"This is an excellent biography of someone who was larger in life than his most famous creation. If you wrote it as a novel, no one would ever believe it, especially the denouement. The writing is droll and wise. This is well worth reading by anyone who loves farce or the theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart of a Clown","review":"The heart of a clown, the saying goes, is a sad one. So, too, with Edward Tanner, better known as Patrick Dennis, at least according to Eric Myers. Myers has written the long-overdue biography of Tanner, who is best remembered for having written AUNTIE MAME. This is a peculiar work: While Myers' research and writing both are first-class, his subject unexpectedly turns out to have been a sad little man. As interesting as Tanner's life undeniably was, there can be no mistaking that he turned his back on his family in the pursuit of his own fulfillment. Tanner's late wife sounds saintly, accepting as she was of his bi-sexuality. Inevitably, this book could not help becoming a treatise on mid-Century homosexuality and how closeted it then was. In the end, Myers' scholarship could not transcend the sadness of his subject matter. \\"Pat\\" Tanner is a man who should have had it all--yet he managed to blow most of it. Still, this was a story worth telling and Myers told it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Mame","review":"The challenge of a biography is to balance the facts with interest - from carefully placed words, to relaying the pathos of situations - and to maintain readability.I found the story engaging - and humorous - both of situation and fact. Amazed at how meticulous the research must have been (Living in Patrick Dennis' area) and also having published a modest amount myself, what kept my attention was the way all the parts flowed to complete the whole.While Dennis himself was a rather 'backgroiund' fellow compared to the popularity of his works - anybody should be encouraged to see how the realities of ones life affects the work one produces.Biograhies of the atypical make the world more interesting - and this is a worthy example of something unusual - and well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Feel Good book...","review":"Although I will not dismiss anyone's opinion I do believe this review is out of touch. The book is written to be a feel good book so the family problems shouldn't be discussed. As for a 10 year old child not being able to be mature enough to soul-search is a ridiculous comment. I know some children that young that are more mature than some 40 year olds.This book is a very quick read and will remind you what Christmas means. Another feel good book that came out recently is called \\"The Christmas Sweater\\" by Glenn Beck.

Though I haven't copped the album - intending to though - if the whole thing is like this it should be really brining the flames. Meth rips it with some clever lines, and Bustah Rhymes - guest artist on \\"What's Happenin'\\" - brings one of the hottest verses I've heard from him the last few months, and, of course, he helps Method tie it all up with the head nodder chorus over that tight beat.

Sony has done a standout job making this a very solid, durable unit; nothing flimsy or cheapo about this one. We get good radio reception, even though we live in a very rural area. Other reviewers have commented on the volume not being loud enough. We find the volume to be very suitable; although, most people have closets that are bigger than our bathroom, so that might explain it.

The Jensen was not nearly as water resistant, and the reception was not as good (living in the country where it is hard to get a lot of stations anyway, this is very important). The other great thing is that the clock switches back to showing the time shortly after you change stations instead of continually showing the station when the radio is on. I would definitely recommend this radio to anyone. It is well built, has great reception and sound quality, and is very easy to use. It is definitely worth the price when you compare it to a lot of the other radios out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"Like most items sony puts out this is good quality.

It worked perfectly for the first 4 months I had it. It even got good radio reception in my shower and had highly respectable sound quality for a shower CD player/clock radio.And then --> now, if the top of it gets a little wet (as it usually does, being in a shower), it won't turn off. So, I just turn down the volume and it turns off by itself in 30 minutes or more.

All features are available at the touch of your finger. That would help when you have soap in your eyes. The radio has a preset feature for your fav channels. Reception is good for stronger channels, but the radio's antenna only can do so so. This unit claims that it is for the shower, but the manual gives instruction not to have near direct water.

I would definitely recommend this item it is very good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is great!","review":"I got this for my husband as a gift b'c he wanted to listen to music in the bathroom.

This was my first shower CD player purchase, I'm guessing in general there are no great products out there if this mediocre thing was rated so high. The problem is after a couple months the display wasn't working anymore. And then today (after a few months) the clasp that closes the CD lid was so rusted it come off completely. I don't even switch CDs that often, I've only openned and closed that thing 10 times tops in the last few months. It wasn't cheap either to be falling apart like this...

AM/FM/TV stations and weather. 5 presets for each. Very easy to use. Sturdy construction. CD player works great. Obviously, don't insert a CD into it or take a CD out of it while you are in the shower. It's waterproof, not made for underwater use.Only possible drawback with the unit is that it's heavy, so I had to rig up a special holder for it in the shower. But with the weight also comes sturdiness. Other minor drawback is that I wish the volume could go a bit louder, but for shower radio purposes it gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra money","review":"I purchased this a few weeks ago to replace an older GPX shower CD player, and have been very happy with it.The sound quality is excellent, considering the type of device this is, but what's really nice are the controls. The volume and tuning / track knobs have a very good tactile feel, making them easy to adjust when your hands are wet. And the minimalist rubberized buttons on the front make for a clean look that's simple to use.My only real gripes are that it takes an unusually long time for a CD to start playing, and discs will skip with the slightest bump. So if you usea hand-held showerheadwith a hose, you may not want to hang this from your shower.Were it not for those two problems, this would have received a solid 5 from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony CD Player","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter who hates to take showers.

This is no comparision to all of those other little dinky shower radios on the market. It's sturdy and has a cool design. I know it's really pricey for a shower radio but if you like music and want to play cds in the shower it's a luxury that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best every shower radio but....","review":"This is truly the best shower radio made today. No more having to dial in to a station and hold the radio sideways on one foot to get good reception-it has ALL the features I wanted plus more! The ability to dial in the lower UHF TV channels 2-13 is a great bonus. There is only ONE drawback which I'm surprised to see that only one other person has noticed; the volume. While in the shower, the volume will not go high enough to really get a great sound on the radio, the TV channels are too quiet to hear. It would be perfect in the tub. Other than that, like I said, it is THE best shower radio out there today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific...until it stopped working after 7 months.","review":"I'm so glad I waited to write this review. Had I written it prior to last week, I would have said that this is a terrific product and well worth the money. Then the radio inexplicably stopped working. I initially thought the batteries had died, which is reasonable after 7 months of daily use. However, when I replaced the batteries yesterday with brand new Duracells, the radio came on, but none of the stations work. Nothing unusual happened to the radio prior to its failure, so it may be something specific to this radio and not every radio will stop working. But please be aware that it may not be the perfect product it seems to be at the beginning. Given the cost of the radio and the batteries, I have paid just over $10 a month to listen to the radio for a few minutes each morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shower radio!","review":"My girls love to listen to music in the bathroom, and they were always lugging in one of their own jamboxes -- so I bought this and they love it!

He was the neighborhoods bad boy with the standard dysfunctional family, but Isaacs makes her character believable when he steps into the world of make believe.Sy Spencer (movie producer) is murdered by his swimming pool and the chief suspect is his ex-wife Bonnie. The evidence is so tightly stacked against her that you almost wonder if the controlling Sy set her up to take the fall for his murder.Criminal investigation and romance are tightly woven in this complex novel.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer a different style of writing and genre.","review":"I thought this was romance, but it's really a mystery. Readers who love mysteries would probably enjoy this more than I. There were way too much conversation and detail facts to follow. I didn't want my brain to have to work to remember and analyze all the details. I also didn't like this style of writing - all in first person, told from the police detective's perspective. Story brief: Steve is a police detective trying to solve the murder of Sy. He falls in love with Bonnie who is the main suspect.Sexual language: strong.

For a penny, how could you go wrong?Since buying it, it has been one of my favorite albums! Cowboy Curtis' song \\"Longway Around\\" is the best on the album, but its speckled with spots of genius throughout. Eleni's Mandell's \\"cant you see Im soulful?\\" is so real and somewhat sardonic, it's beautiful. It ends with Will Mason's \\"Oxygen\\", which seems to be making a social statement on the state of the world, but it's beautifully sad.You can spare a penny, right? C'mon, buy this album. You won't be dissapointed. It's perfect, almost. David Berkely's song, The Sharp things, and Benzos are just passing songs, nothing worth listening to. If they were filled with three better songs, this would get a five star rating. But overall, I give this a Four and I highly recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"We needed to purchase a firewall for our business and this one was recommended to us.

Unfortunately, it is primarily composed of photographs of formal highly stylized houses which look like museums.

It is a wonderful journey and learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD Avoid It!","review":"I have ordered a lot of CD's over the years on Guided Meditations and some are very good, some not so good. This one is the worst I have ever encountered. It is a recording of a live session that Kornfield did and sounds like it. The recording of the CD is an obvious afterthought. Besides the sarcasm, thick New York accent, and flippant attitude hard to find a single redeeming quality that would justify the purchase of this CD. Most of what is covered, is on any other beginning meditation CD with far better audio quality and a much more pleasant delivery. I just tossed this one in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This CD was very uninformative and provided almost no information about the topic it was supposed to address, which is meditation.

This book has been quite helpful. Yes, there are a lot of words here, and yes, I would have trimmed a couple of chapters. But the book explains a great deal of complex info and is written very clearly. It's clear that the author is tied to real world -- I gather from his bio that he's a web application developer in real life. Wish I'd bought the book earlier.When I want to quickly remind myself of some common bit of syntax, there are other books where I can find the info quicker. But when I have those \\"gee, how am I going to do *this*?\\" moments, this is the book I grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the average textbook!","review":"I found this to be an excellent reference tool. It hits on all the high points and helps to understand all the major concepts of relational databases and to grasp the variations of SQL and their syntaxes. My official textbook \\"SQL Essentials (Randolph & Griffin)\\" was a pitiful representation of a text reference at a level barely better than \\"SQL for Idiots\\". Historically, I have always liked QUE books and once again the SQL SE version was a tremendous supplement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent SQL book","review":"I have reviewed alot of Oracle SQL books and you would have to spend alot of money to get what this book delivers.

Very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself some $$$","review":"And just read the SQL reference in whatever DB product you have (Oracle, SQL Server, Informix, etc). Nothing new here except added verbiage which just takes longer to sift through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Festive Feast","review":"I'm a big fan of the sweet former chorister Anthony Way. His voice on this particular CD has started that inevitable change and is a little huskier than on his previous albums, but no less enjoyable for this.My favourite track is Balulalow which is beautifully sung by this unique boy soprano, with much expression and a gentle delivery.Anthony is joined by the men and boys of St.Paul's Cathedral on this Christmas release, but it doesn't sound like your average mundane choir recording. Anthony Way's vocals could never be described as mundane and the arrangements of these traditional Christmas carols are also different and very pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the movie, hated the disc","review":"Ok, so I really do like this movie (I am, admittedly, a Smith fan) so I was happy to see it at a good price on blu-ray. I buy it, put it into my PS3 and it fails to get beyond a \\"LOADING\\" screen. It fails to move beyond this screen for over 24 hours. I try a second disc, same problem.

However, this film is not good. The dialogue is canned, the \\"love story,\\" if you want to call it that, is about as sappy as it gets. It's been awhile since I've had to cringe from the amount of cheese in a movie.Another issue: This movie doesn't work in the profanity well. Smith tries to hard to be cool with his f-bombs to the point where they sound forced and unnatural. Pulp fiction did its 256 f-bombs justice, but this one just oozes with the feeling that he's filling in for lack of substance.Terrible film.P.S. What's with the all the \\"I'm-a-fat-lazy-but-somehow-charming-pothead-who-manages-to-bag-a-hot-out-of-my-class-chick\\" movies?

But for some reason it loses all of that in about 20 minutes. The movie was predictable. Even a \\"stoned stoner\\" would fall asleep. The director just couldn't hold the interest long enough to carry it through. I see that as an \\"educational\\" experience as i see comedies changes around us in the media, but it is something in the end where you feel the need for a long hot shower and an Ambien. Kevin Smith is gifted, but this is not even close to his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-entertaining","review":"I guess I expected more from this movie, but it ended up being merely a one-liner based movie. Besides some fun lines or dialogues there is very little substance.The funny scenes are mostly juvenile old toilet humour and vulgar pee-jokes.The filmography is also disappointing and this is in no way of the quality-level of previous Kevin SDmith movies (Clerks, Mallrats...)Terrible movie. I don't undertsand how it got 7.3 on IMDB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie, Pass On It!","review":"This movie starts out as an easy comedy worth watching, but quickly turns into a horrible story.

When they were trying to rate this movie there was a lot of controversy about it being a rated R movie or a NC-17 movie. The male lead Seth Rogan said something to the nature that we can produce movies like Hostel and release them with an R rating and they show far more graphic and disturbing things and we cannot show two adult having consensual simulated sex without an NC-17 rating WTF!!! And I cannot agree more, this is a romantic comedy that was far under rated. If you are tired of Sandra Bullock or Dane Cook romantic comedies then give this one a shot. If you like the \\"Ugly Truth\\" then you would love this as well, it may not have a lot of heart warming moments but the ones that are there will have you watching this movie over and over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny movie don't let the title scare you","review":"This movie was a very big surprise for me.

I enjoyed some of the early parts of the movie where there was some of that uncensored-even-by-your-brain dialogue where people say EXACTLY what they're thinking, there was some pretty funny stuff.As the movie got more into the making of the porno and the \\"romantic\\" plot between the two leads progressed the movie got more boring, more crass, and less funny. I'm guessing the actual porn scenes depicted were supposed to be hilarious in kind of a shockingly crass way, but I found myself non-plussed. After enduring the last 30 minutes of boring predictability and shlocky plot, plus some boring raunch, I wish I'd spent my time watching something else. You can still see flashes of talent here, and it starts out with some promise, but by the end it's a mess and I don't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"waiting for the director's cut?","review":"This movie was beyond hilarious. I nearly lost all bowel control while watching in theater (pun intended). From what I've heard, though, the director's cut will be even more worth it (should it ever be released) because of the scenes that had to be cut in order for the film to be shown in theaters.

Hated the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Kevin Smith film yet.","review":"I'm a Kevin Smith fan but I hated this movie. The best part of this movie is the Primus song in the beginning, after that it's straight downhill. I never once laughed out loud throughout the movie. The deleted scenes are much funnier than any of the scenes in the movie. I would recommend renting this before you purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Bob is not so silent with his point in this flick","review":"Maybe I am totally off here but what I think Kevin Smith is trying to do here is not outdo Judd Apatow but rather, give his twisted view of what Americans may be driven to do in the face of this horrible economy and unaffordable living.Aside from that, this movie is hillarious and Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are the perfect pair in this. A tale of desperation that leads two people to love is classic in nature but of course with Kevin Smith and this cast, adds its own comic twist.If you are a fan ofSuperbad - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition),Pineapple Express (Single-Disc Unrated Edition)orKnocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)then you will like this movie as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"Please be advised that if you plan on using your PS3 to watch this blu ray DO NOT BUY!

He was really quite funny.2) the shock of seeing Jason Mewes run around naked.

The main works here are three String Quintets, played by an augmented Grumiaux Trio with total assurance & commitment. These are all ravishingly beautiful works. The Horn Quintet, where the soloist is Timothy Brown, is a happy and spirited piece, again wonderfully played. The only question mark surrounds the rather literal, even wooden performance of the Piano Quintet with Ingrid Haebler & The Bamberg Wind Quintet. Compared to Murray Perahia & his ECO Wind Players, the recoridng here sounds far too measured and unspontaneous. Nevertheless, this cannot detract from the magnificence of the other recorded works on this disc, which are all to be had a a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"For SSRI withdrawal and Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome","review":"I had the worst time trying to get off Zoloft for many years. I just couldn't handle the withdrawals even after many months. I researched the professional antidepressant withdrawal programs, and they use milk protein concentrate for one of the supplements. I have tried many other herbs, supplements, etc. (like st. johns wort, 5-htp, etc.) and this is the ONE product that completely eliminates all my symptoms.I also have mitral valve prolapse syndrome, which causes tachycardia and panic attacks. This stuff completely eliminates my nighttime panic attacks and most of the daytime ones. I know that the magnesium in them is very important for this, also the valerian and chamomile.The only drawback to this product is that I have to break it in half or sometimes in 4ths and take many small doses throughout the day so I don't get too sleepy.

Alas, it did not happen so, and though my family got it two days later, I had to wait for them to ship it out for me. It was disappointing, but I got over it. The back of the book was also a tad bit bent.The book itself is very good. I was afraid that it would be entirely in French, but it's in English. It's very well written. I just wish that I had more time to read it (especially since it's required!). Good books like this aren't always on the required reading list, so get this one to read when you don't have anything nagging at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant...","review":"I found this book to be absolutely beautiful and it's so sad to think what this suite might have become had Nemirovsky survived. Thankfully, this was published and she has been introduced to a new generation of readers. The notes at the end of the book a truly moving and I found them to be just as interesting as the story. A five star recommendation for this incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderfully written piece","review":"This is a fantastic two-part story, written by a woman who was living in France while the events were ocurring, and writes as she lives them. Her descriptions are impressive, and her charaacters real. A rewarding (but sombre) read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author background much more interesting than book","review":"I am listening to the audio version and am bored to tears, wanted to look at reviews to see if i should bother listening to the last 1/4 of the story but now I won't bother! I was not aware of the background of the book/author, and I have to guess that this background, as opposed to the writing itself, is what most people found appealing. I also repeat the sentiments of other reviewers who said that they could not bring themselves to \\"care\\" about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time","review":"After reading all the reviews I was hoping it would captivate me. I struggled with not putting it down. Dumbfounded by the reviews, I returned to the scene of the crime and realized I wasn't the only one who felt like it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I'm sorry to say this book never lived up to all the hype for me. None of the characters were appealing. Felt like I was reading short stories by a high school student. I found it very difficult to get through as there was nothing going on to keep my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"suite francaise","review":"It was a bit hard to keep up with the characters but it portrayed a time in France when the German occupation was not as bad as it is normally portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!!!!","review":"I'm trying.....I'm really trying to like this book!! I was excited when I bought it and couldn't wait to start reading it.......well, a few pages into it, I kept thinking.....HUH??!! It's extremely confusing, it jumps all over the place from a set of characters to others, and does not grip you, at all. Some review, I believe listed in the book, said that this book was better than the Diary of Anne Frank, don't fall for that!! I'm on page 108, and I've been struggling to get that far within a week, where, usually, I can read that much (and more) within a day. If you haven't bought this book............save your money, unless you feel you may be like some of the others who wrote a review on how great this book was. Wish me luck, I'm going to keep on reading, after all $14.95 plus tax is $14.95.........I may not finish, but I will try in her memory and I believe every person has a story to tell. I don't know if this book has a section on her life, her story, I do hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 150 pages!","review":"I have to echo the sentiments of those who say there were too many characters and they're not well-developed enough to make you care about them. And what you ARE told about them makes them all completely unappealing! I was certainly expecting some unsympathetic Germans, but I was not expecting that all the French characters would be petty, snobbish and selfish -- at least, what little the author tells you about them. I thought I would love this but didn't bother to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully boring","review":"After the raving book reviews, I was eager to read this book. Unfortunately, I could hardly finish it and persevered only because I just knew it had to get better. It didn't! Though well-written, I found most of the characters unlikable and underdeveloped. Worse yet, the ending was dissatisfying and incomplete, which I guess should be expected since the book is, in fact, only the first two parts of a planned five part novel. Not a book I would recommend to my fellow \\"casual readers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed in expectations","review":"I had only heard favorable reviews for this book, so was dissapointed to find out how much I didn't enjoy this book. Too many characters, too disjointed and no ending. All facets of a book I would not recommend. I understand it was supposed to be more books and it may have all tied together, but they weren't written and it wasn't \\"wrapped up.\\" I won't be one to recommend this book to any friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suite Francaise","review":"I found this book exceedingly depressing, and it was very difficult to read. I could not make it through to the end. I did not feel compassion for the characters -- I did not feel anything for them. The book also felt very self-conscious to me, and this was a distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suite Francaise","review":"This is a unique look at the second world war from the position of different characters/classes in the French society around Paris. Besides giving voice to how different classes of people experienced the war from Nazi takeover to collaboration, Irene Nemirovsky's own story, as detailed in the epilogue, is playing in the back of your mind. The only sadness is that she wasn't able to complete more of her planned \\"suite\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suite Francaise review","review":"I found the book disjointed at times...the final story about Lucile and the German and their village was more interesting and quite believable. The writer did create very real images for the reader. I almost abandoned the book after reading about 100 pages, but persevered and then found that the story flowed better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a bittersweet classic.","review":"The story of this author, and the way her orphaned children made sure this book was published, is an amazing tale in itself. But the actual novel is captivating and consuming. The characters are as real as any, and her description of the period is detailed and vivid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and Beautiful","review":"This is historical writing at its best. Highly recommended for readers who value tragic settings and unforgettable characters. Heartbreaking and Beautiful indeed. By Paul D. Cohn, Author, Sao Tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic, beautiful, incomplete","review":"A good read and one is immediately transported to this time. It may feel a bit incomplete, but it is a haunting tale nevertheless and realisticly and beautifully written. Wish it could have continued into the other novels she had planned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suite Francaise","review":"It is a shame we will never be able to read the entire body of work Irene Namirovske had planned. I enjoyed reading the first two parts and also felt the two appendices were valuable. The first indicated Namirovsky's plan for her 5 part Suite. The second were the frantic and poignant letters that were sent in a vain attempt to save her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled Potential","review":"I was incredibly excited to read this book. I generally love novels surrounding WWII and had heard the fascinating story of the author. I was thrilled that a masterful piece of literature survived such a harrowing experience and was published years after the author's death. Unfortunately, I have been extremely disappointed. I find myself loathing the characters. A majority of the characters represent the upper class and are portrayed as snobby, arrogant, and inconsiderate fools. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but am forcing my way through it. I'm reading this for a book club that I run. If not for the book club, I would have given up long ago. From The Diary of Anne Frank to Atonement, there are many books that better portray the harsh reality many people faced during this time frame. I know they weren't all arrogant idiots. A disappointment, clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel has interesting aspects, but overall boring and difficult to get through.","review":"While I found the descriptions of people being forced to evacuate their everyday city lives in Paris and others having to board German occupying officers extremely interesting, I found the other aspects of the story quite boring. I ended up skimming large portions of the last few chapters, which like much of the novel, are heavy on describing the situation but light on anything actually happening.The letters in the appendix from the author's husband are heartbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for my Library","review":"Despite the quality of the writing, I found the character description so dispassionate that it was all I could muster to finish the book and even at that, it took me many weeks. I can't believe the majority of the reviews were so glowing but then perhaps I am being more objective to the work itself and not letting what happened to the author overshadow the literary value. If you enjoy WWII History, this book might be fun to read but if you want a good story with characters you can fall in love with, forget it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mechanical","review":"This is the book you think you should like. Dont worry it is banal and mechanical. I am virtually sure that the writer was more interesting than her book. Waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true testament to artistry","review":"Even without the dramatic context of its creation, this work would be moving almost beyond endurance. Knowing when and how it was written makes it that much more remarkable and affecting. Nemirovksy is not kind to her characters, but her skewering is revelatory rather than mean-spirited, and wonderfully funny. It is the humor, in the end, that somehow makes this work seem most tragic. I cannot imagine any lover of literature not delighting (and mourning) in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic","review":"Usually, I don't favor knowing a lot about the personal life of an author I like. If the words and story move me, that's enough. But this is an exception. Irène Némirovsky wrote Suite Franaise while she and her family fled the Nazis. Their flight was in vain, as other reviewers have noted. Suite Franaise is a novel, since it has an imagined plot and characters; but it is also a real-time evocation of what was happening around her. To truly appreciate the beauty and terror of this book, you have to know that Némirovsky was writing it not in some tidy office, but in the fear and dislocation and dread of the very events she so skillfully describes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suite Francaise","review":"A fabulous accomplishment which almost didn't become known to the public. Nemirovsky's daughter is responsible for recognizing the brilliance of these two stories and sending them off to a publisher instead of a French museum.The fact that Nemirovsky wrote the book while the events were occuring is unheard of and further demonstrates her talent as an author, an author who died far too young. My book club had the best discusion in years with Suite Francaise.I've just started reading The Wine Of Solitude and I hope it is just as remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"unaware to the end","review":"What a story! An unfinished fictional novel based on the author's lived experience in German-invaded France during the second world war. What surprised me most was how the author portrayed the German soldiers. They are seemingly beautiful physically, some well-cultured, and even kind, all caught in their own country's evil zeitgeist, as it were. All the more wrenching given the known fate of the author..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Translation","review":"I am now almost completely through the entire book and need to post a review about the translation. While many reviews tout the excellence of the translation, I believe the translation is actually sub-par. I feel the paragraphs are choppy, and the sentences don't flow into each other. In addition, there are multiple spelling errors, including spelling one character's name incorrectly - multiple times within a single paragraph! These are simple things an editor could have fixed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, amazing work about people in crisis","review":"I found this book to be an incredible piece of work, not only because it was written so beautifully but also because it gave me insights into a period of time that I found both interesting with an honest, direct and unromantic perspective. True, you're not going to relate to every character, but this narrative is beyond that--it's about a dire situation, it's about how different people react to that situation, in a sense, (and I don't want this to sound too dramatic) but it gives us a slice of humanity under stress when livlihoods, culture and sense of home are threatened. The characters are dropped into a scene that exposes both their strengths and their many, many flaws. I thought it was an amazing, honest, brilliant work. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book that must be read","review":"I could not stop reading this book,it has hypnotic power.With gentleness and great skill the descriptions of individuals and the underlying crisis and pain of the French people of that period are unfolded in detail.Of the many books written about that period this has a depth that touches the heart,stirrs the soul and teaches a lot about human behavour.It has the strength of Tolstoy, the passion of Proust and the sincerity of Semprum.Indeed a book that must be read and to be learned from, it is invitingly readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, heartbreaking","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book after reading a review for it and I wasn't disappointed. Her writing is lush with beautiful descriptions and the people are so real and it's just amazing to think that she wrote this during the time that it was happening. I loved the appendices probably as much as the book, the letters especially were heartbreaking and the forward to the French version with a biography of the author was absolutely gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read, wonderful appendices","review":"I found this book difficult to get through. The first part (of what was to be a 5-part book) is choppy with superficial character treatments. What makes the work remarkable is the harrowing circumstances in which the author was writing. It's deeply tragic that this wonderful writer suffered and was murdered during WWII. The writing and storyline vastly improve in the 2nd book, and I believe if Nemirovsky had been able to revise and complete the novel, it would have been wonderful. As it stands, the book is rough and hard to digest. I do recommend this edition, however, because of the moving letters in the appendices written by Nemirovsky and her comtemporaries during the period leading up to and following her deportation. Those (not the fiction!) brought me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkable","review":"Although an eminently readable piece of historical fiction, the significance of the book is not in the story, but the insight into the author and the time.Above all, I found the author's treatment of her characters fascinating. In spite of her own peril at the hands of the Nazis, she is, in the most part, kind and sympathetic to her German characters and harsh to the French - with an especially ruthless fate delivered to a young priest.This seems to indicate to me that the author may have been more fearful of her adopted countrymen than of the \\"enemy.\\". And rightly so, since in the end it was the French who betrayed her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is a work of fiction, although there seems to much historical truth included in this work. This was to have written in five parts, yet the writer was arrrested and put to death in a concentration camp after completing the first two parts which comprise this work. The first part takes place in 1940, after the City of Paris had been overrun by the German army. The focus of this section is on various families from differing socio-economic backgrounds, and hoe the cope with the difficulties that are incumbent upon the conquered. The Author is masterful in her descripton of the characters in the pathos of war. Part two, deals with families that were forced to house Soldiers in their homes and how they interact with the occupiers. This is a superbly well written book with an excellent job having been done by the translator. The book is special and should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suite Francaise","review":"Fascinating, very well written story about people evacuating Paris and the countryside as the Germans moved in during WWII. Attention to detail that brings you there. Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As People Say...","review":"It's not often that I don't finish a book. I'm a voracious reader, especially when it comes to anything that even remotely has to do with history. When I saw all the high reviews for this book, I had to give it a go.I don't think I made it halfway through the book before I had to give up on it. Rambling would be a good description. The book is all over the board. Way too many characters, which doesn't leave room for ANY of the characters to have any sort of depth or feeling. The whole book felt flat to me. To compare this to the Diary of Anne Frank is just WRONG. The book bored me to tears. A B-17 Flying Fortress training manual is more exciting than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy!","review":"The most interesting thing about this book is the circumstances under which it was written. The prose is good but not great. The character development leaves a lot to be desired. I couldn't remember who characters were when they appeared in later chapters and didn't care what happened to any of them. I rarely leave a book unfinished, but after reading the first novella and starting the second one I realized it was more of the same and tossed it into the \\"try to sell at used book store\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one!","review":"Really bad! I usually need to finish any book I start. Literally couldn't with this one. I put it down after 150 pages because there was absolutley no plot development and characters were static! I can't believe the overall rating was 4.5 stars! WHY??"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"It's not often that I choose to not finish a book, and even more rare that I throw a book across the room in anger, but I found this book to be uninteresting and confusing. With so many names and places, I couldn't remember who the characters were, or what they were supposed to be doing. I love world war 2 history, but this book sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"Sorry, but I can't believe anyone enjoyed this book. It was our book club pick for the month and halfway through I sent out an email asking for ANYONE to give me some hope to continue. No one could do it. It was difficult to keep track of the characters, and I didn't \\"care\\" about any of them, they just weren't developed enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I posted a comment to someone elses 1 star review then thought I should create my own review so that the star rating might change and save others some valuable reading time.I'm sorry to say I found this book incredibly boring. Too many undeveloped characters with some meeting very brutal and outrageous deaths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Too Painful to complete","review":"I had to force myself to get through even the first CD. I have listened to hundreds of books on CD during my daily commute to NYC and this was one of the very few CD's that was so painfully boring that I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suite Francaise","review":"I did not enjoy this book. It may lose some of its beauty in the translation but it was a difficult read. I appreciate the effort in finding and publishing this book. However, the characters and even the story did not evoke empathy. I did not like or champion any of the characters. I did not care who survived or who died. The French do not \\"look good\\" in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irene Nemerovski","review":"Clearly her best work and the supplemental letters and notes show more of her process as well. A tragedy that the \\"Suite\\" was incomplete at the time of her incarceration and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"J'adore ce livre!","review":"This book is so wonderfully written and the characters so thoroughly realistic that it had me enchanted for days.It is rare that I find a book like this that can capture my attention so completely and inform my daily life so deeply.I am about to buy all of her books in hope that the others are as captivating as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow.","review":"I'm not quite sure what the hoopla is about with this book. I dragged myself through to the end, just so I could say I finished it, but it was a chore. I do commend the author for her ability to help the reader transcend the mood of the war and what it must have been like for people fleeing the city during chaos and uncertainty. Other than that, I really felt like this book was disjointed and aimless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"I \\"saved\\" this book for several weeks after I bought it because I knew it would be a really special, wonderful read. Instead it is flat, condescending, and tedious. The plot jumps around to many characters, none of whom I like or care about. Most of the time the point of view is some distant, almost panoramic, omniscient point of view. I like novels with an up-close-and-personal, tight point of view. But in this novel the point of view just doesn't stick with one character long enough to establish any sort of reader empathy for any of them. It's not chilling, it's empty. Which reminds me that this manuscript was discovered unfinished, and truly was not ready for a reader's eyes. It reads just like what it is....an author's notes for a novel, not the novel itself.I stopped reading around page 100, which always makes me feel like a failure, and so I rarely do so. But still, if a book doesn't capture my attention by then, I am too old to waste more time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and unusual read","review":"Nemirovsky's has a wonderful, yet urgent flow to her storytelling; it was difficult to put the book down. I loved her sense of irony and the unexpected twists of fate that her characters take. The characters are wonderful and not stereotypical. She takes a risk by not characterizing all of the German soldiers as \\"evil\\". Similarly, not all of the French are \\"good\\". It helps to know the story of the autor and to know that this is two books cobbled together because it helps make sense of the storylines. A superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"This is a really lovely book. dipicting many souls during the nazi occupation of Paris. It a side of history we dont see. I think because it has not been polished or reflected on. The writer wrote all of this while it was happening. Very nice work and is sure to be as important to history as the diary of Anne Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get into it","review":"This wasn't a book that captivated me. a lot of charaters, and none of them I really cared about. I usually never put down a book, but half way through this, I didn't have the desire to pick it up again. I didn't hate it - i just didn't find it interesting enough to continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal reading experience.","review":"To read what is now historical fiction, but was contemporary fiction when written, is wonderful. She will move you emotionally. The appendices are a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrates the German occupation of France during WWII","review":"Rather than summarizing the plot or providing description of the characters since others already did these things, I'll just tell why I liked the book. Its depiction of the Nazi occupation of France was realistic and transported me there. This generated strong feelings, and I empathized with all characters.

The stories presented through narratives relating to several characters, many of which cross from one \\"book\\" to the next, are gripping. I couldn't put this book down.What a tragedy it is that Ms. Nemirovsky lost her life at Auschwitz, but what a gift she left behind. I read that another of her books will be released in English in March. I look forward to reading it. She was an extremely gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like slogging through mud...","review":"I'm a pretty optimistic reader. I keep reading long after common sense would dictate that I cut my losses and move on. I have this hope that somehow, magically, the story will pick up, the characters will become interesting and my time will be justified. Not so in this case. I actually gave up after a few hundred pages of disconnected stage-setting. I found no characters in whom I was at all invested and no inducement to continue reading. All the hype on this \\"masterpiece\\" left me feeling either cheated or far less intelligent that I had supposed. Reading \\"Suite Francais\\" was like slogging through mud. Uphill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and uneventful","review":"I had read plenty of reviews on this book prior to reading it and I was very excited to jump into it. I was totally disappointed as I made my way further through the book. There is nothing \\"classic\\" or life changing about these 2 stories. In fact, I felt that the story telling was very dry and slow. I have read many books about the war and unlike many of the others, this one completely failed at grabbing my attention.In the end, this book was simply a very boring read. It wasn't horrible... but it definitely wasn't good enough to recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk Back in Time","review":"Beautifully written.

I am not a happy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"We chose this book for our book club based on the fact that it was supposedly the best-reviewed novel of the year. All I can guess is that book critics were enthralled with the circumstances under which it was written. Indeed, those were fascinating and tragic. So while I feel a great deal of empathy for Irene Nemirovsky and her family, I didn't feel any empathy for any of the characters in this boring novel. I read A LOT and this ranks as one of the worst reads in recent memory. Perhaps if she'd lived to rewrite or edit it, it might have stood a chance, but as it is....don't bother, unless you are a student of French history or a WWII buff. Oh and by the way -- almost everyone in my book club felt the exact same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected to love it, gave up on it.","review":"I had heard such great things about this book, so was really looking forward to reading it. I read to chapter 22, then quit. I thought it was extremely boring and very slow moving.

Couldn't Finish It","review":"I recommended this book to my book club after reading about the author and her story (as well as the book's fabulous reviews). Only two of us finished it (and not because they liked it - they wanted to honor the author).

The seller uses a different shipping company that doesn't really do expedited shipping compared to other more well know services. This can be quite costly in other ways! Otherwise, the product is great and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Play","review":"I really was put down when I realized how different tactics would be compared to the origional Fallout 1 and 2; it had excellent graphics and a good storyline, and the new and improved items were great. I can't forget the multiplayer and map creators that are readily available, but if you are interested in buying tactics for the sheer RPG value of it,then don't even bother.

I kept wanting to skip certain parts but then got lost not knowing how far forward or back I should go. I just got discouraged. There is a decent length meditation/hypnosis type segment that didn't appeal to me, but maybe to others.

The five masses (including \\"Credo\\" and \\"Coronation Mass\\") are very lightweight and delicate when compared to the composer's \\"Requiem,\\" and Beethoven's \\"Missa Solemnis\\". They're very fluid and beautiful to listen to. The Choir of King's College, Cambridge really fulfills the classic and ambient sound that these masses require; the diction and tone is perfect. Maestros Cleobury and Munchinger get the classical tempi right: they don't romanticize it like Karajan or slow it down like Gluilini. And of course, let's not forget the audio quality. It's excellent! Another outstanding achievement from London/Decca.As I said before, Mozart isn't really a favorite of mine, though I'm starting to grow on his music.

Most of Mark's information is fun and non-technical. This is not a how-to book, but more of a capsulation of the technologies, companies, and people surrounding the synthesizer revolution.

It is the story of young librarian, Alexander Short, caught up in a search for a timepiece to complete a collection owned by a wealthy eccentric, Henry James Jesson III. Books, library searches, heraldry, theft, adventure and a wife who is constantly trying to seduce her husband. Who could ask for more?And, indeed, this is a fun little book. I am particularly fond of the scenes set in the New York Public Library with its resources and its cast of interesting characters. I also find the search for the timepiece to be an interesting one with plenty of twists and turns along the way.My only complaint about this book is the payoff. There really isn't one. I found that the book just kind of fizzled out in the last few pages. I have not read Kurzweil's first novel, A Case of Curiosities. I wish I had. I get the impression it might throw some light on this novel. Still, as it is, it's a quick novel and well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mundane complication","review":"My interest in this book was sparked by a review on NPR's Fresh Air. Being a library addict, I looked forward to reading a book about books.This book starts off with a bang and whimpers to a slow painful ending. It reminded me of other books on the same theme - the search for The Maltese Falcon, the mind games and symbolism in John Fowles' The Magus.Unfortunately, it disappoints on both counts - the search for \\"The Grand Complication\\" is not very engrossing and the \\"games\\" the protagonists play with each other border on the verge of childish.The inside story of how libraries work is fascinating but can't hold the different pieces of the story together."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars For Clever Book Design","review":"When I started this book, I thought I was going to love it. It involves a Manhattan reference librarian who is hired by a wealthy, old, eccentric man who needs help tracking down a watch believed to have been owned by Marie Antoinette. A beach read for the literary set, the book is filled with puns, and clever word play all intentionally formatted to span exactly 360 pages, and resolve the conflict in sixty minute like chapters. The book to it's credit reads very fast, but about half way through I started to not really care about what was happening, and worse after some revelations late in the story, felt let down. I don't know what exactly I was expecting or what kind of pay off, but aside from being clever and well written, it's not something I'd recommend to many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought to vibrant life with rapturous imagination","review":"The genesis for Allen Kurzweil's thriller that is The Grand Complication lies within a true story told to the author, of a stolen pocket watch masterpiece made by Abraham-Louis Breguet, a French-Swiss craftsman of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. To learn the history of the missing watch, author Kurzweil spent five years of research and travel, from a private museum in Jerusalem to Switzerland, Paris, and the Isle of Man. Filled with passion, drama, intrigue, and danger, The Grand Complications follows protagonist Alexander Short, who through a series of crises gets involved in a trail of clues that point to the missing watch, though the complications of his relationships and the motives of the one who hired him hover ominously. Meticulously researched, yet brought to vibrant life with rapturous imagination, The Grand Complication is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This librarian is not impressed.","review":"Generally, I am a big fan of bibliomysteries. However, the only mystery here is how does anyone stay awake while reading this dreck. This is one of the most excruciatingly dull books I have ever read.

The new book is simply not worth the wait. The characters are paperthin, their motivations are unexplained, the plot meanders and the ending is contrived and unbelievable. Very puzzling, given that we know Kurzweil to be a talented writer. It is a very peculiar book, almost as if the whole thing were an extended inside joke to which only the author was privy. And the continued references to his first book are annoying given that it was written almost 10 years ago and that the author has produced nothing else since. They only add to the inside joke feel of the novel. Better luck next time, Allen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clever for its own good","review":"This is a cleverly conceived novel with some amusing moments but ultimately dissatisfying.A novel about trying to find a stolen treasure (Marie Antoinette's clock) - could be a good yarn but notice there are 60 chapters like the 60 minutes on the clock face and you'll start to see that this book is trying to be clever. The characters are unbelievable, the plot unbelievable; but it is clever and we can have a few chuckles at the anally retentive librarian protagonist's predicament - but that is all you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry James Reborn... Unfortunately","review":"OK, the story line is original (I can't imagine anyone could have come up with it), but totally boring. Searching for a missing watch to complete a \\"case of curiosities\\" is hardly engaging material. Though, the interaction between the characters prevents this book from being a total snoozer.Worst of all (for me), the writer's prose reads as if the book were written in the late 1800's, which would be great, if you find that sort of thing entertaining. I don't.The story is a mystery, just not kind of mystery that I would have picked (the book was a gift) or preferred to read.Bottom line, to the writer's credit, there is great potential as the character development is excellent, but they're caught in a weak story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky, self-conscious, sloppy and silly","review":"Caveat: I read for characters, not necessarily ones I like, but people who interest me, whose complexities, problems, cares and peculiarities are worthy of a novel-long narrative. This book's characters aren't people, they're cartoons, and badly drawn ones at that. The whole girdling thing, for instance, is just one of those annoying tics third-rate novelists give their protagonists, hoping it'll make them seem interesting and eccentric without actually having to create a three(or even two)-dimensional character.

(Nic, who at leat had the potential to be intersting, came off as a running gag about sexual frustation.)And what's with the \\"jewish\\" dialogue? (\\"You vont I should sell sumting?\\") It verges on the infantile.

The librarians depicted in this book are stereotypically odd, crochety, obsessed, narrow-minded and antiquated. Hey--real-life librarians are lively, funny, hip and often sexy people.

Getting to see a minute or so of the shorts they make to play on the tv that they watch on the show is funny.

It's just so off the wall, and the characters are so well done it puts to shame almost all other animated series. The amazing thing is these guys shoot with a budget of like 60k an episode and almost everything is done with relatively cheap off the shelf computer animation programs! The creativity is the main feature of this show, and although the animation is enjoyable it's no Shrek concerning animation quality. But it will put a smile on your face, and it's better than a shrink in helping deal with all the BS coming our way each day!I would say some of it is not for kids, and some episodes are even offensive to adults, kind of on the order of South Park but not as vulgar or blasphemous.

First off I want to say that if I was to rate the quality of this show, I would give it 5 stars. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is easily one of my favorite cartoons right now. However, someone is really trying to screw us fans with this dvd. (...) That is just crazy. Why would they not put all 24 season 3 episodes in this set? The answer is they want to get as much money off these dvds as they can. The funny part is the need for a 2 disc set. Are they using single layered dvds? You could probably fit 13 episodes on one single layered disc and unless they are including 4 hours of commentary and special features they are really just deliberately ripping us off. I will probably end up buying this baby because I love this show too much and want to support them so they don't go the way of Home Movies, but it really disgusts me how they are selling this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanging out with the wrong crowd","review":"This is a spectacular series the aqua teen hunger force is one of the best shows out there.

Now I'll reviw the material on the dvd.The material is soo pleasant. Karl is a neighbour to a gang of foods, each of the three who compromise the gang are food items, like a milkshake. The gand often summon friends from space cause mischief, and Karl canno't stop them. They rest in his pool, even though he never gives permission to them to them.

What a complete waste of money.I also noticed that nowhere on the box does it ever say \\"non-toxic\\" which leads me to believe that these crayons may not be safe for my child.I will never buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh","review":"I have a 2 year old and she loves to color so I bought these. They work fine except they do fall out of the holders and they are hard to clean off the tile unless you scrub. The darker colors stain her skin so once she is done playing we have to wash all over. I would never buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"These crayons are not worth the investment! They fell out of the holders on the first use. They break very easily. Once they have fallen out of the holders, they do still work however if they rest on the side of the tub, they create a mark and run easily. If the holders worked, they would be a much better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"These suck.","review":"I didn't read any reviews of these - I just wanted to get some tub crayons for my 2-year-old and I think these were the cheapest ones that were prime eligible. I'm not sure what the purpose of the holder is - they should've just made the crayons a little fatter and they'd work great. The crayons themselves are super skinny and only last a couple of baths. I definitely don't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crayons Crumble","review":"I never write reviews but just had to take a few minutes to express my complete dissatisfaction with this product. My toddlers used it one time and, when we tried to use it again the next day, the crayons had become a huge crumbling mess! There were crayon chunks all over the bath tub, as the crayons disintegrated before our very eyes. What a complete waste of money. It's not terribly expensive but a complete waste nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than these reviews say","review":"My kids have been playing with these bath crayons for years. They love them! I have probably been through 15 sets of these things over the years and bought lots of different brands. They are all the same. Yeah, they aren't the most durable things. But they don't care if they fall out of the holder. They use them without the holders. I'm just always looking for the cheapest sets. And good luck finding them at a local store. I've never been so lucky. By the way, all the paint sets are horrible. They don't write well. The crayons are the only way to go. I just buy 2 or 3 sets each time to offset the shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE of money","review":"This was a waste of money!! I bought these for my daughter Sophie, who is 23 months old, as a Valentines Day gift. The crayons are very small and the holder makes them appear to be bigger.

I WAS NOT IMPRESSED and DO NOT RECOMMEND these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!","review":"My wife and I bought these for our daughter ( 14 months ) to play with in the tub.... First when we got them we were surprised at how SMALL they really are... and these things dont even fill up the whole holder the come in, not at all like how big they look in the pictures... Second, they WOUND NOT stay in the holder during the bath... they fell out and would not go back in, no matter what we tried. TAKE MY ADVISE, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR YOUR MONEY ON THESE THINGS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read these reviews!","review":"I read reviews for these crayons somewhere else. There, the reviewer boasted about how these crayons were better than Crayola's because Crayola's break and these are more durable. Well, while it is true that none of them have broken, like the previous reviewers said, they fall out of the holders! My daughter was in a bubble bath coloring with them and all of a sudden there was no crayon in the holder. We found it and tried to get it back in but it wouldn't stay. Terrible. And they are MUCH smaller than they appear to be in the picture. They only fill about half the holder and they're skinny like a regular small crayon. Although my daughter thought they were a lot of funny, there must be better tub crayons out there. I will seek them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Crayola Bath Crayons, instead!!","review":"Well, I made the mistake of not checking the reviews for these tub crayons, on Amazon, before buying on a whim, at our local Target.First off, these crayons do not work, once they are wet.Secondly, the waxy part doesn't stay in the plastic part.Thirdly, they start to fall apart within a weekFinally, they were thrown out within 1 week of using.Previously, we had the Crayola Bath Crayons and I think those lasted us about 6 months. They draw very well and keep together great.

My son got that as a gift and they lasted and didn't melt. Now that my daughter is old enough, I bought a set of these without the sponge for her. They were terrible and melted and wouldn't come up out of the holder. They don't write well on wet tile at all, so what is the point of being able to use them in the tub??? I think they have reformulated the crayons or something because the quality has definitely gone down since 4 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tub Crayons","review":"I like that your child can draw in the tub but the crayons are constantly falling out of its holder. They do not hold well and I have already lost quite a few crayons down the drain. For the amount you spend on the actual item and then shipping, you are better off going to a store to purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate these zero stars","review":"These are the worst bath crayons we have tried, and we have tried many. The color came out of the holder before I even handed them to my child, crumbled when he tried to draw on the tub, and then wouldn't even leave a mark on the side of the tub (which was dry at the time). My advice, buy the Munchkin crayons, they have been the best for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissolved in the tub!","review":"The other reviews are correct in stating that the crayons don't stay in the holders that they come with. Fine. We took them out. I gave my son two and I took one for myself so I could show him how they work. I wrote his 6 letter name on the side of the tub and the crayon was half gone! They crayons were dissolving in the water! What a waste of money. Fortunately I had also purchased the Crayola tub markers. Those are much more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET A DIFFERENT BRAND","review":"Tub crayons are a great toy for the bath, but these ones are smaller than they appear, and less durable than other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Bad Implementation","review":"Love to draw in the tub, but these crayons don't last very long on the tub - they wash away immediately... Also, if you leave the crayons in a wet area, they begin to crumble. These are not worth the time or price - you should find another tub crayon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushy horror","review":"We adored our original shower crayons (I think Crayola), so we bought these foolishly thinking them to be similar. They are absolutely not. Not only do they fall easily from their holders, but they retain water and thus are swiftly reduced to a mushy paste after a few uses. This makes pushing the crayon up in the holder impossible, as the plunger rising only mushes the crayon out of the front slit instead of pushing it out the top.Absolutely cannot recommend. Try any other brand first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I appreciate a good romance. I love supernatural fiction. I was very pleased to see someone trying to merge the two.Unfortunately, Raliegh is simply not a good enough writer to have attempted this project. Her protagonists are obnoxiously perfect, and the supernatural plot ludicrous. In Raleigh's prologue, she tells us that vampires of the world have evolved beyond their bloodthirsty past. So where is the rationale for a \\"vampire\\" hero who doesn't actually need blood? The plot involves a magical amulet which was divided into parts and sent, for safekeeping, to three \\"maidens.\\" Why not leave it with the oh-so-perfect vampires? And that \\"heroine\\" -- bleah.Every line is over-written, hyperdramatic, and childish. I can sympathize that the author was dealing with an unfamiliar mixing of genres, but there is no excuse for this tawdry, sophomoric hackwork.

As a profesional journalist, I frequently write feature stories. The advice and lessons presented in this book have helped me add depth and life to those stories. Franklin teaches outlining in a way that makes complete sense. I used to fear the \\"English Teacher's Revenge,\\" but now find outlines to be most helpful and easier than ever to create and use. The book reads more like a novel than a \\"how-to\\" book. The book is written in a friendly and approachable manner. Franklin draws in his reader and treats him or her as a confidant. Truly a must read for beginners and old hands alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something that makes sense to me","review":"After several tries with other well-reputed books, this is the first that has truly conveyed to me a clear understanding of how to write for story. Indeed, when I read this for the first time, I found it difficult at times to focus on Franklin's words, finding myself pulled away by story ideas crystalizing for me as never before.It may be that my technical background renders his methodical approach, liberally sprinkled with engaging anecdote and warm humor, particularly transparent and memorable, when the words of others yielded little real insight.If you seek understanding of - a solid 'feel' to - an approach to storytelling that facilitates the construction of engaging and memorable tales, then this book might work as well for you as it does for me. If, though, you view organized thought as antithetical to creativity, then you might not find this work so appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"This is the best book I've ever read on the subject of structure and craft. I read it several years ago and am still using ideas I gained from it. I don't really think that anybody can learn to write from reading a book on writing, but I do believe that those, like me, who write for a living day after day need the wisdom and inspiration of really fine writers like Jon Franklin. The annotated text for his feature story on brain surgery is worth a college course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and practical medicine....","review":"This is an atypical book on writing, which focuses on something that man has been doing since language was invented -- telling engaging stories. The concepts are simple and powerful, but the application of them is not! I found that this book has helped me to improve my writing and appreciate other people's writing. Jon Franklin is a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who honed his skills in the writing trenches rather than in a classroom. At times, what he has to say is bitter medicine, but reading your finished product will be worth the effort.I at times found Jon Franklin's tone a bit offensive. Sometimes, he came across as a \\"know it all\\" or that his way was the only way. In other words, he seemed a bit rigid and perhaps even arrogant. However, the advice is sound and I must admit that after trying the techniques, I can see why he encourages (pushes!) so hard for the writing principles he obviously believes in and that have made him very successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"More better elsewhere ...","review":"Franklin's book make me queasy; the thing is just so much hackwork, and the stories he takes apart -- his own two Pulitzer prize winners -- are kind of poorly, blahly done. They just don't have the impact JF thinks they have. I don't know what the P judges were thinking; maybe the competition was exceedingly weak. In any event, Franklin's work probably would have a difficult time getting published today -- at least in a magazine it would -- for it seems amateurish and underboiled. A far better book (despite its title) is How to Write like a Pro, by Barry Tarshis: it's a pleasure to read and is far more sophisticated in all regards than Franklin's little puddle. It's out of print, however, so you'll need to do some sleuthing to track it down. But I assure you, it's well worth the effort, and it WILL improve your writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly boring","review":"Franklin dissects the craft of writing so poorly that he leaves just a bloody mess of details; the soul is gone. Anyone who learns something from this book must have been an amazingly awful writer to begin with. It's not that using a formula is bad; of course, writing needs structure. But Franklin is so fascinated with his own methods that he makes the common mistake of presuming everyone's mind works the same way, so everyone else must follow his methods. Wrong, wrong, wrong! And, in obsessing on the details, he loses track of essentials like creating reader interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Difficult Read","review":"Jon Franklin's book was a disappointment. There were a few good tips in the book, but they were nothing new to anyone who is studying how to write good non-fiction. These same pieces of advice could be found in any high school text book. The only difference is that the structure of this book makes it hard to find a specific piece of information. There is no index or glossary to make this book a useful reference book.I found the book difficult to read because he devoted much of the book to describing what a wonderful writer he thinks he is. I would have found the book more useful if he included examples of works written by other authors along with an analysis of why he liked their work.One last complaint about this book: Jon refers to a story written about a mother having trouble loving her mongoloid child. As a special educator, I find it very offensive that he did not correct this outdated term and replace it with the term Down syndrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did This Hack EVER Win the Pulitzer Prize?","review":"I've read this book twice through. It is a dreadful piece of hack work. The stories Franklin presents as exemplary (his!) are awful. And the last chapter, \\"The Nature of Art and Artists\\" is frankly bizarre.Avoid this one like the plague. Pick up Zinsser, Tarsis, Joseph Williams, or any of a number of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Audio Set","review":"This is an amazing audio set. It's not a book on CD, it's more like a personal workshop with Robert Moss. Anyone interested in dreams and dreaming would want to own this set.

Well, the second season fulfilled that old saying about 'being careful what you wish for'. The second season had the high production values, the violence, and the sex - but little else. The story shoots off into wildly inaccurate and implausible directions, especialy concerning Atia. The men, particularly the great general Marcus Agrippa are portrayed as weak-kneed boys who are manipulated by the wicked wily women.No, it's not University, but the first season proved that they could produce riveting TV with plenty of salacious details and violent action without mutilating the history part. The Second Season is mostly a vheicle for a lot of bedroom romps by Atia and others, not altogether a bad thing, but what a disappointment after such a promising first season. It reminded me of the old SNL skits about the Battle of Network T&A;."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the 2nd season.

Hard to say how it really were, but then most of the information comes through the prism of this or the other writer/historian whose objectivity is still not devoid of bias, after all - objectivity is still only a human prism.This part of the series \\"Rome\\" is rough in many ways, and yet it manages to remain likable - the protagonists are not positive, and yet we like them. In that sense, the film really does follow a somewhat pagan model - there are really no antagonists here, but the only \\"bad\\" or \\"evil\\" is the one characters impose on themselves - a profound point and something to consider when viewing history in general. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately Not Season One","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed Rome Seasons One and Two, the casting of Simon Woods as Gaius Octavian Caesar in Season 2 was a disappointment. Max Pirkis, Octavian - Season One, played the role much more believably.

The cast, location, story line, etc are amazing. While it may not be 100% factual, much of the story is based on true stories and some of the special effects were great. Seeing season 1 and all episodes in sequential order are a must but once you watch the first couple of episodes you are hooked.

I have never been in any classroom where students have seen a teacher in the light that this author apperently saw himself in. It is an unrealistic depiction of high schooler's thoughts and reactions to the situations in which they were placed. It is also rather offensive to me as a twenty something female that such negative terms were used throughout this book, and I highly doubt that any female would write such things in a journal that was to be read by a male teacher. The writing itself was very hollow, and it seems like this author is a big fan of tooting his own horn.

I don't know how the author got the slang down so good. I think the style this was written with is something that more teen books could use but you really have to know the language of teenagers around you. The story line kept me interested until I was all of a sudden done. I liked how the characters had no loose ends. Tate Thompson does the one thing that I always hope for when I am reading. You find out what happens to all of the characters after they finish high school. That and the slang made this a quick read for me and I really enjoyed the experience. I would recommend this book to people who like teen books and want to read something with a different style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dv-84's vs. DV-64's","review":"After owning the DV-84 towers and DV-64 towers for over a year I'd like to say that the 64 is the way to go. I've been told that 8\\" drivers are too big to be accurate and I can now hear it. At first I liked the 84's because of the extra bass but last week I put the 64's side by side with the 84's again and realized the 64's have a much cleaner mid range. And besides, they're cheaper. So, don't buy the 84's because you think they're going to sound better with bigger speakers.

I have the same Cerwin center speaker (which I can't wait to replace). I didn't realize what I was missing. I placed the BICs next to the Cerwins with just the Marantz and couldn't believe the difference in clarity. The BICs blew them away. I must say the tweeters on the BICs are way too much. I have the parametric eq set at -8 on the highest freq. and it's still too bright. I'm just getting into the entry level audiophile stuff (it's addicting) so I'm not an expert but I know a bit about it. Like everyone says... great bang for the buck.

There is no \\"zoom\\" on the lens; meaning you cannot change how wide or narrow the light pattern is displayed.

It's absolutely the best, and I must say that I feel no other violinist connects as well to Brahms as Mutter does in this recording. She is stunning with her vibrato, perfect pitch, bowing technique, and all the elementes are suavely knitted togehter to form the most gorugeously expressive, technically undefeated performance. Also, the Schumann fantasie is such a rear treat. Mutter's interpretive brilliance of German music truly shines through... I do not need to say more, because you will hear and feel that rush once you get a hold of this recording, and it will keep your heart beating fast and unable to sleep... you just have to listen to it over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"What makes this CD so appealing (other than looking at her gorgeous face) is a recording of the rarely-played Schumann Fantasy. Suprisingly, this piece is not performed very often even though it is a tremendous and powerful composition.There are traces of greatness in her playing, without a doubt. Her Strad projects well over orchestras and has a fine tone thanks to her training with Erna Honigberger and Adia Stuki (both pupils of the great Carl Flesch, one of the greatest pedagogues if the 20th century).Ms. Mutter's unique interpretation of the Schumann and Brahms made this a required purchase for me, no one played it like her. It seems to me she could play these works like anyone else but chooses not to and that is why I find this disk so entertaining. Her use of portamento and rubato is what makes this performance different than most.Thanks Annie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"My 11 month old loves these (and has since she could first grab) but they do not work like they are designed. They are impossible for her to squeeze and they are hard for me to get them to connect and stay put. They are also a cleaning nightmare. They get very gross on the inside and I cant seem to ever get them clean. The directions tell you to drain them after each use but I can never get all the water out. If I can get them clean enough I will just stop using them in the bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Keep Clean","review":"As others have said, these toys are impossible to keep clean. No matter how I clean them or store them after use, they fill up with nasty mildew and mold, which inevitably squirts out when my babies are squirting them into each other's faces. Disgusting! They were fun and cute for the first week, really gross for the next few weeks, and eventually I just tossed them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to keep clean","review":"My baby loved playing with these, but it's impossible to get the water out after bathtime.

They are ok as small toys, but I will not use them in the bath, because they are hollow and have a hole in them so you can fill them up and then squirt water out of them. The problem is that the hole is designed so that you can never get all of the water out, they constantly have water sitting in them. I think it is unsanitary and the sitting water will cause bacteria to grow, and there is no easy way to clean them out (except maybe boiling and squeezing them to fill them with the boiling water??) But you would have to boil them after every bath. I prefer to get toys that can dry thoroughly between baths."},{"rating":"1","title":"traps water which can't be emptied and grows mildew & algae","review":"The squirt holes are recessed so the toys can't be completely emptied of water.

Beyond yucky. I will never buy another squirty bath toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy - but not for water","review":"My grandson is almost 1. He has loved playing with these for about 6 months. They don't snap together well, so he gets frustrated with that, but likes to carry around the octopus. I learned early that they are not good in bath. They don't squirt because they are a harder plastic. In really hot water they are squishable, but then its too hot for baby. Plus, you can't get the water out when bath is over - even if you shake and shake, there's still a little water in them.

The plastic is much too hard for a bath squirter. They don't actually squirt very well, and certainly not when squeezed by a little preschooler's hand.

Bath squirter FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and Colorful, but very awkward.","review":"First of all, the item pictures shows twice as many as you really get. you only get 8, i was expecting more. they fit together in a very odd way, and young children will have a difficult time figuring out how exactly which part goes in which as well as actually pushing them together. they're sturdy but the hard plastic is tough for even my 3 yr old to push together. its really awkward. these are nothing like the beads that are for regular play which are a harder plastic and its easy for a baby to figure out which part goes into which.also you have to worry about the black mold/mildew that collects when you have bath toys like this. they cannot properly dry after use and this nasty stuff collects and there isn't any real good way of cleaning it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooooo!","review":"Ok for babies b/c they can just throw them around, but these are too hard to squeeze.

This book is about Anna Lockwood, who, much like me, knew all about herself until she is in a car accident. This book describes the emotional and physical hardships she goes through and realizing she doesn't know herself anymore.It deals with finding that true person inside yourself. After reading one very, ummm...self-centered review (\\"i (...) have recently recieved australian young writer of the year. and beleive that orr's writing is put to shame by my own brilliance!\\"), i knew this book was better than that.By the way, any person that reads a book all the way through without realizing they didn't enjoy it is just asking for ways to make the book seem bad.

The character personalities that the author chose for them are excessively dull. For example, I feel that Anna is more worried about her old boyfriend kissing her than anything else. I feel that is absolutely ridiculous. Throughout the story Anna was annoying to me, because I didn't like that she was more concerned about her love life than she was about her injuries. In my perspective I would want to become better. Another example is Luke. It appears Luke is waiting for Anna to break up with her boyfriend so that he can say he loves her. I think the book would become exciting if Luke told her he loved her at first. The book becomes lifeless without any action."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Friend Likes Hayden","review":"I personally thought that this book was very bad.

They do not say much that is of any practical value. This book will tell you that it is important of build socially inclusive cities, but it will not tell you how. It has little of practical value. Rather than provide an alternative approach to city building that is socially and environmentally aware it does little more than rehash arguments against planning that have been around for 40 years.Though Sandercock goes some way to recognising the importance of design in city building she still can't bring herself to engage meaningfully with new urbanist proposals or to make any design recommendations.By concentrating on 'planning theory' it misses out on the rich traditions of planning practice. It has no photographs of real spaces or real cities, just words. Don't read this if you haven't already read \\"The Death and Life of the Great American City\\" or \\"A Pattern Language\\".

The color is great (getting lots of compliments). Lots of storage for numbers. The camera feature takes clear pics for a cell phone. It has an alarm clock in the tools section, which I like to use when I am away from home. The battery standby time is really long. Several days go by before I need to recharge. This is my first phone with bluetooth; it's easy to use, but it takes some getting used to. The phone has speaker too. I am getting great reception and others tell me that I sound more clear than my old phone. The phone is easy to navigate; you can even program the buttons to have the function you want if the preprogrammed ones don't feel natural to you. The music capability is convenient, the phone came with the appropriate cable to hook up to the computer to download the songs. The screen does get smudgy, but it is very colorful and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Buttons","review":"This phone does everything it says it does just fine, but I cannot stand it for one reason--THE BUTTONS. THEY DRIVE ME POSITIVELY INSANE. The \\"brushed steel\\" thing is horrible, it feels like pushing on sandpaper. The buttons are not raised at all, in fact they are RECESSED into the phone! Everything about them is horrible. I hate pushing buttons, and that is the main function of the phone! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OFF THE INTERNET!! Go into a store and look at it and push the buttons before you buy it!!!!!!! If you don't, you will probably reallllly regret it. Trust me on this, I would've loved the phone but for the buttons :(! And they are a big deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fluff, very little meat","review":"This book was a required text for my first semester of the Economics PhD core. I found the book to be a terrible disaster. Supposedly this book is a more basic approach to advanced macroeconomics, but I found I comprehended higher-level texts with greater ease than this book. The wording is very obtuse, which makes understanding the verbage difficult. Once you get past the words and understand the meaning, however, the explanations are also very inadequate given the complexity of the material.All in all, I have read my fair share of poorly-written textbooks, but I think this one tops them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Sharing the sentiments of the two previous posters, I think this book is a disappointment. For example, the second macro model presented by Romer -- the Ramsey-Cass-Koopman model -- is absent of optimal control theory. Setting up the Hamiltonian and showing how to dervive the Euler's equation of the optimal consumption path of the representative consumer would be a better treatment of the topics. This book, I think, lacks basic techincal tools essential for econ Ph.D. students. I am a microeconomist-wanna-be, this book makes me wonder what on earth is macroeconomics -- something very mysterious to me. Who are going to write a better text for graduate-level macro for non-macroeconomists???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good survey","review":"Different people with different expectations and needs for this book tend to view it differently. This book didn't delve deeply into the formal theory and is appropriate to gain a panorama of macroeconomic theories. Those who're scolding excruciatingly this book please get back to thinking a little about the relationship of economics and mathematics/statistics. The economics studies the a facet of the social phenomenon. The mathematics and statistics act as a way of thinking and deduction imposed on this phenomenon. We can still talk about economics without lots of formal theory and rigorous deduction. We then are just talking about the phenomenon itself. Anyone who has done lots of modeling would come to terms with this observation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Advanced","review":"The level of this book is really advanced even for postgraduate students.It is very good book but you need to know many things before you go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, terrific, but some misprintings.","review":"Listen! i had read only chapter 5 and 9. but i believe the value of this book is the same as your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Advanced Macroeconomics ever written","review":"The Advanced Macroeconomics from Professor David Romer is in my opinion the best Advanced Macroeconomics textbook ever written, due to some points:- It treats in a simple manner several issues regarding the most advanced issues on Macroeconomics,- It's updated and varied,- It's accessible for new comers in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is non-functional","review":"Text is sufficient in derivation and description of models.

This book has neither, and unfortunately it appears to be the standard in graduate macroeconomics courses. I find myself wondering if it deliberately chooses the most obscure way to write its equations. For instance, in the Solow and Ramsey models, Romer retains the population and household variables throughout the entire proof rather than simply write them in intensive form. If you're reading the book after a lecture, it stands a chance of confusing you, especially because it tries to avoid optimal control theory (not a good idea!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW","review":"THIS I60C NEVER GIVIN ME ANY PROBLEMS-ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS I WANT TO SELL IT BUT AMAZON DONT ALLOW US TO DO SO.

The display is rather dark; there is no outside display you have to open it to see who's calling thus meaning you have to disable auto answer. There is an extremely limited feature set on this phone. Some reviewers said that the battery life was good they're either working for Moto or never use the phone.The battery life is terrible, the phone sat in my desk all weekend, a full charge Friday at 5PM and it was dead by Monday morning, never used or received any calls.

If I had it to do again, I would take the pattern pages to a copier shop (or scan them into a computer) and enlarge them a bit. I do sew most of the longer seams on the machine, and learned right away to go over them twice.

The string trio has been a much neglected music form, the only ones of note from this period have been the great Divertimento K563 by Mozart, these 5 from the young Beethoven, and one from Schubert. And they are all fine compositions, very well worth a listen. These from a 20 year old Beethoven are lyrical and joyfull. Despite the age of the recording the sound is very acceptable, and the performance from the Grumiaux Trio is superb.As this recording is about 40 years old it must be expected that there are better performances available, but I would suggest that you don't worry about that, this one is very very good, and very cheap.

By the end of this disc, Bannockburn has our first melodic line that is not extremely large.

An infield single is ruled as an error? I cant even list all the problems with the announcers, one is when they say \\"Wow what a homerun\\" 2 or 3 batters after the homerun was hit. Overall its a good game if you can finish a baseball game and you dont mind the glitches, but i think Sega rushed this game and it is very sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion for Truth","review":"Andrew Harvey has given us a passionate, loving homage to Rumi, as well as a reliable depiction of the mystical path, with its dangers and joys. Harvey is no mere \`academic'; he is an enthusiastic lover of Truth. In an age when Rumi's poems are available widely, this audiobook is a powerful reminder that there is a teaching/learning depth in Rumi that his mere popularity can't possibly reflect. (Ridhwan students, especially: read or hear this book!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grating","review":"The music is appropriately mystical and pleasing, and Rumi's poems are of course peerless, profound, and timeless. But Andrew Harvey's enunciation in performing the poems is grating - overly emotional, and whiney, as if spiritual extascy were somehow a complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book!","review":"I HATED this book. The story was unrealistic is about women being kidnapped and sold as sex slaves. The lead female was also raped. I love erotica but forced sex (RAPE) is not a turn on to me. If rape, being sold into sexual slavery is a turn on, then this book is for you. I wouldn't even give this book one star. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book,often overlooked by many","review":"(Along with Volume 1) This is an excellent book especially if you want to know anything about analysis of variance in a classical set up. It provides in a unified form (and uniform notations) a large volume of scattered literature. If you work with model based experimental data and data analysis where variability is a major consideration, this book should be your academic companion. Certainly, this book is under-recognized for its real academic and practical values."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless and genius","review":"I picked this up on CD when I was in Tokyo a few months ago and was just blown away by how great it was. From it's opening track \\"Says My Heart\\" to the funny \\"You Smell So Good\\" the whole album simply charms you. Jackie and Roy have taken such risks with their music from the begining of their career yet their work consistently is free from gimmick. This is some of the purest jazz you will ever hear. This Storyville session from 1955 has never been released on CD in the States and is a real treasure even with the steep price. When you are ready for even more stunningly progressive jazz, try their \\"Grass\\" CD or \\"Wilder Allias\\" CD. Jackie's voice is timeless and haunting. Roy plays piano and they often sing together. Plus, I've seen them perform recently and they still act like they are in love. I swear you can hear their love in the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This recording of the fabulous grand concertos by Corelli is one of the best recordings that I own. These concertos should not be taken for granted; they set a precedent for the Concerti grossi by Handel, Geminiani, and many others.I Musici employs their impeccable technique, tone, articulation, and dynamics in this recordings. Philips held up their part of the deal; the sound quality on the recording is unbelievable. No other recording that I own is as crisp and clean as this recording is. A must buy for fans of baroque music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accomplished, but not my style","review":"Whoever said these performances are far from the period-instrument performances commonly heard today was exactly right--and I have to admit I found this recording old-fashioned. It's not just that the tempi are slower than we're accustomed to (or have become accustomed to); the sluggish pace and interpretation make Corelli seem un-baroque, and that just doesn't sound right. It's also a touch too sentimental. I think of Corelli as a brilliant light from a very different age, and this performance makes him sound like a not-yet-Vivaldi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!!","review":"I received this recording as a Christmas gift, and it is absolutely amazing! I have listened to every single track, and I can say there is not one note missed. It is flawless. I Musici is spectacular, and I recommend this to anyone who collects classical music recordings of any kind. Personally I find the recordings to be perfect and extremely engaging.The only thing a picky listener might find a bit \\"different\\" is the sometimes heavy interpretation of the music by the orchestra. Corelli was a Baroque composer, and Baroque music is generally performed without much vibrato and dynamic contrast in order to perserve the style of Baroque performances. I Musici does use force, dynamic contrast and, at times, lots of vibrato. But unless you are extremely choosy, this should not be a problem and these things are certainly not overdone in any way, no matter your preference.Bravo to I Musici and Arcangelo Corelli! A wonderful combination, it's worth your money :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thank you !!!","review":"In this recording, Jose Carreras, and Irgmar Wixell, are very weak in all senses. In the roles of Riccardo and Renato the principals interpreters of the roles are Di Stefano, Bergonzi, Gobbi, Bruson and Bastianini. Montserrat Caballe has a pretty voice, but in this rol is very weak and no dramatic. Colin Davis is not a Verdian Director, he has not flame and force. He is a super great director but in Berlioz and Mozart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many fine things in a bargain reissue","review":"I started listening to this 1978 recording without high expectations, not being a fan in particular of Caballe or Carreras. And the notion of Colin Davis as a Verdi conductor was dubious. But by the end of CD1 the excitement of this performance had taken hold. It is one of Carreras's best roles on CD--lyrical, passionate, with many lovely touches. Caballe pairs excitingly with him, and the Oscar and Ulrica are both excellent. Despite the un-Italiante, rough-voiced Wixell, I found this one of the better Un Ballos on disc, and at a bargain price I now prefer it to Pvaarotti-Price-Solti. Excellent choral and orchestral work, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I understand Elvis","review":"The protagonist, Leroy Kirby is Elvis. Childress only changed the names of the Presley family, Col Parker, a couple other rockers of the day, and Sam Phillips. He made up some blues songs to go along with some of the performances. That left him free to give us conversations and feelings to create a personal glimpse into the life of a shy, lonely man who was flamboyant while being insecure. I lived in Memphis and met Elvis briefly a few times. He'd be sitting behind the fence at Graceland, usually with a girl, and would talk to the tourists.All those years of touring and you never heard of Elvis being involved in the kind of parties other rockers were famous for; why? Now I know. If he was a good Baptist boy, how did he get into drugs; the same slippery slope Michael Jackson and so many others slid down. What was Elvis \\"really like?\\" Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start HERE with Childress","review":"If you have never read Mark Childress' work, shame on you! But get over it and start here with TENDER. Yes, the main character's life parallels the life of The King, but that is the charm of the book. This is Childress at his best and the work his most fully-realized.

I am finding the book extremely useful, for many reasons, some of which follow below: Lama Surya Das is an authentic Tibetan Lama, born and raised in the West - he understands the complexities of one of Tibetan Buddhism profoundest teachings - Dzogchen, but is able to convey it in a contemporary and often humourous form. A number of guided meditations accompany the discussion, and some \\"non-meditations\\", such as the 'sky gazing' technique are well explained.

'Every Grain Of Sand' is a quite marvellous album and Barb digs into Dylan's songs so deep that she's actually making them her own. Buy this CD, put it on, and listen. I'm sure you'll enjoy this CD as much as I did. To pick out a particular song is difficult, because they are all excellent. Put it on your shortlist, you are not going to regret it. Dylan's songs have been covered so many times, but nobody has ever done a better job than Barb Jungr. It will be a hard act to follow! Well done, Ms. Jungr!

They are great for electronics, particularly when you have several \\"wall wart\\" type supplies that need to be plugged in. With a regular power strip, \\"wall warts\\" often take up 2-3 plugs greatly limiting a power strips effectiveness. This works around the issue. The only downside is that this is slightly bulkier than a power strip.

How can I rate an item that I did not receive?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy Season VII","review":"If you were a loyal follower of the show, this last season is an insult to your intelligence.The writers couldn't figure out how to end the successful series, so they cynically trashed it.There is absolutely no creativity to their writing -- they took the money and ran.Don't put more money into their pockets by buying, like I did, \\"The Final Act\\".I was a fool.I give it one Star because Amazon forces reviewers to do so, or they will not print you review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody good show/series","review":"ONLY one problem, I was sent an \\"incorrect region\\" version,even though address was plain and clear.Very good show, I have watched it since its' beginning.Good drama, not all the leads are 'goody-two-shoes'THE lead, is the baddest dude of all, his life is a pretext."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shield 7","review":"Absolutely amazing, just like the rest of the series. Best drama ever on television! Great finish to the awesome story of Vic Mackie and the Farmington District."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Season","review":"Once again, great to see the episodes again and again. Shipping was quick, couldn't be more satified."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW it doesn't get any better","review":"I became addicted to The Shield since it's first season. Unfortunately the Seventh season is it's last (unless we get a miracle). As all other seasons, this does not let you down. A lot of action, a lot of story and the ending leaves room for wanting more, hoping for more and satisfied with how it ended. Unlike some series that end, this one is good. Well worth the time to watch. You still don't know if you should root for Vic but you can't help it. All great actors/actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying end to a great show","review":"This season nicely ties up storylines and loose ends from both season 6 and prior seasons. The concluding episode is a satisfying end to the series as Vic gets pretty much what he deserves from his actions during the prior seasons from his coworkers and family. Since I'm writing this review before the DVD release, I'm giving a rating of 4 stars. The show is 5 stars and I hope the extras on the DVD are consistent with the extras found on Seasons 1 through 6 which included episode commentaries, behind the scene features and deleted scenes with commentaries (purchase them too if you haven't already, so watching Season 7 makes sense)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SUBTITLES","review":"I had to watch this over several times to catch everything. I am not hearing impaired, but no subtitles ruins this for me. I have found the past seasons of the shield enjoyable, but I cannot enjoy this without subtitles.If you are hearing impaired, or if you like to have subtitles on, I would advise you not to buy this product...I hope whoever makes the decisions on whether or not to subtitle these things eventually gets the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont like this guy...","review":"Greetings fellow amazonians after my debacle with the friday night lights dvd I decided to switch it up and watch the shield. I had seen it briefly along time ago, but I wanted to see the end (my mom always said that the first and last seasons are always the best). After watching the first disk I realized I hated this guy. He reminded me of all the cops that used to patrol watts in la where I grew up. Once I figured out that was what this was about I said thanks, but no thanks and now an trying to get $10 for it from the security guard at the fairgrounds im staying at.

The writing is very taut and emotion driven. I loved the last episode \\" Family Meeting\\" which gives closure to all the characters......insanely brilliant writing.......If you have not watched this show...go and watch it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am deeply disappointed with this product","review":"I have bought all previous seasons of The shield from Amazon, provided that they all included spanish subtitles. To my surprise, the last season DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY SUBTITLES. Sony should compensate for thie obvious and big mistake, issuing again the season, as the previous ones, with the subtitles.As said, I am deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality DVD.","review":"I wouldn't buy anything else from this company. This DVD was of very poor quality. I threw it out after watching the first episode and decided to watch the rest of the season on Netflix. Better quality and much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Final Act","review":"Shawn Ryan really nailed this final series. It was the best show I've ever watched. The pain of Shane in having to face the threat of a future where he and his wife are in jail while their kids are being raised by foster parents. The selfishness of Vic in sacrificing his friend Ronnie for his own selfish ends. A brilliant \\"hanging\\" ending - where did Vic go, and what did he do with his gun? Did he get rid of some bad guys or did he deliberately get himself in a situation where the cops had to take him out? I guess we'll never know.Congratulations Shawn, a brilliant series from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ending, but left a little to be desired.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the finale to this excellent series. However, the DVD set leaves something to be desired. There are no selections for subtitles. The audio on this box set was substandard and I had to stop/start the playback to hear some of the dialogue. My wife and I watch this series after the kids have gone to bed so we have to turn the TV down to watch the episodes. Why did Sony and Fox decide to leave out the subtitles?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Product","review":"The plastic on the ipod glove is not user friendly.

The other pages are basic, common sense information, including the definition of foods like strawberries, etc. Ridiculous! It is more of a nutrition guide than a recipe book. Most of the recipes involve tofu (yuck!). Lots of beverage recipes.The recipes are simple, I give it 1 star for that, but there's nothing in the book I can't make off the top of my head. Very basic recipes. I wouldn't bother with this book. Get \\"The Voluptuous Vegan\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!!","review":"These recipes are decidedly lackluster. If you don't know how to cook and are looking for a (very) basic primer in vegan meals, you'll do fine with this one.

This is not what vegan cooking is supposed to be. Pretty much they just removed most everything in the way of animal products and replaced it with soy products.

The DVD's deceptively well-drawn cover illustration seems to be the only part of this release to which any sort of craft or care has been devoted. Inside, there's a compendium of tired gay cliches, strung together in the form of a cartoon featuring low-budget Saturday-morning production values, and all of the subtlety of straight animated porn from the 1920s with none of the charm. These delights are preceded by a three-minute commercial for Greenwood-Cooper calendars and other crap, during which such operations as fast-forward or menu or chapter skip (ie, LET ME OUT OF HERE) are \\"not permitted at this time.\\" I couldn't even find anyone to GIVE this DVD to."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not worth it!Just spend your money with something else","review":"When I first saw The House Of Morecock preview at thehouseofmorecock.com website, I was very excited about it, it seemed to be a very exciting animation, but now, I totally regret that I own it. The quality of this animation is really poor and cheap! The sound is even worse!Although the storyline is acceptable, because all of us have our fantasies, it is not worth it to spend $30.00 with this DVD.I got really disappointed because I was expecting something really cool, a better animation like you can see at Joe Phillips website, his official website has animation quality, but the DVD, please!! Really bad!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute stories, weak animation","review":"The animation for this video is just crappy.

I love her half japanese characters and I also loved her Jamaican character (I'm Jamaican as well) and she nailed the dialogue. Ms. Winslow is truly a genius. I love, love, love your writing!!!!

I personally hate vibrato and this had a lot of it. It made it the slow movements very annoying for me to listen to. I admit I might be a little obsessed but vibrato really ruins a performance for me.It was played with \\"heavy fingers\\" especially on the violins. This was a very \\"romantic\\" interpertaion for me.A much better performance in my opinion is one directed by Hogwood and performed by Manze (Uni/Decca - #458129) which was performed on \\"authentic\\" instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be re-named White Wine for Beginners","review":"This is an very entertaining book, but it is also a good overview of wines. The book explains the types of grapes that are used, and reviews the regions of the world where wine is produced. Even though the book has a number of \\"snob alert\\" icons throughout the book, it is clearly aimed at the \\"better\\" wines. If you are interested in Gallo, Paul Masson, etc. type of \\"jug\\" wines you need to go someplace else since they are not covered at all! It seems a little odd that Gallo that sells say 100 million cases of wine a year is excluded, yet a French producer of 50 cases of White Burgandy a year is mentioned. The vintage charts for white wine is dated, but overall the book goes a long way to take the mystery out of wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"This book is extremely hard to read because of the small print--some lines are squeezed together and the print becomes even smaller. The reader needs to be aware that this book is dry and much like a text book. The author concentrates so much time on her lifestory. There are many other books about spirituality that are positive and uplifting for the reader to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged cover","review":"The book came through with a flimsy paper wrap and was damaged during delivery. Otherwise OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"only useful for a beginner","review":"this book revolves around questions like what is spirituality, development of spirituality in her own life and different areas of spirituality- mind body soul. examples of meditation provided. this book is a brief guide for someone reading on the subject for the first time. It is too basic. much better books on spirituality and meditation out there- like wherever you go there you are.it did nothing to enhance my knowledge or my sense of well being.

I didnt get anything out of it except a few quotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has almost become my Bible","review":"This is simply the best overview book of dealing with deeper needs of our human souls. No matter what spiritual background you may be coming from you will find her to be a gracious and very wise host for your own spiritual journey. It seems that there is something of great wisdom on every page, so much to ponder that one never really completes reading the book, but reading it over and over again. And this is not a another self help book of fluff, but one that will challenge you on deeper levels where it really counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"Nicely written, personal and relevant for anyone \\"seeking\\" information on spirituality. It doesn't promise anything but makes a compelling case for meditation. Several tips for meditating are offered throughout the book and a variety of specific meditation practices are available to integrate into your life. I liked that the author understands that changing your daily routine to include meditation takes forgiveness and patience. If it becomes an exercise in obligations too early on, one may be easily discouraged.Well done and enjoyable read promoting meditation as part of a spiritual path."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie viewer for the price","review":"I've used this dvd player and it works great and has a lots of codecs for the price I did not have to upgrade and for the price it can't be beat since the newer ones are so expensive and loaded with options that I never used I wanted a cheap simple player that would just work with my old Windows 2000 pro system and it never failed me.

They sit too low on the hips; I had to cinch my belt an extra hole to keep them up. The worst part is there's an uncomfortable wad of fabric between my upper thighs.

These are nowhere as loose as the ones from Target. I wonder how much tighter these would have been if I got an actual 30x30 in this style. I'd return them but I never wear clothes unwashed.

The Levi's 569 had the fit that they always liked the best, nice and loose. The jeans that I have purchased recently are not nearly as roomy as the older pairs. I compared a pair of 36 x 34 jeans from around 2005 to what is supposed to be an identical pair in the same size that was purchased September 2012, and the newer pair is at least 2\\" less roomy in the seat and thighs than the older pair when laid flat, so that means that 4\\" of fabric are mising in the new cut.Levi's, these jeans are going back and I'm buying the Lee Dungarees.Lee Men's Dungarees Loose Fit Carpenter Jean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control.","review":"I've purchased these 569s both on Amazon and at a Levi's Company Store.

Rather than create a new cut with a new number, Levis completely changed the sizing and cut of the 569, and they are now skinnier and made of thinner material.I'm now back to trying other brands to see if I can find anything comparable as the new cut just doesn't fit, and I don't like the thin, cheap denim being used either. 560's still fit but are way to high in the waist. Very disappointed with Levis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same quality Levi's used to be","review":"Levi's jeans used to be a rugged, wear for years type jean. Unfortunately I am finding that to no longer be true. I washed them twice and a hole formed near the pocket, which was hidable. Upon further wearing and washing (not many more) the stitched seam in the crotch area came unstiched and now has a hole that makes them unwearable.

We also had to get 2 pairs. 1st pair the seam went across the front of your leg, instead of the side. They were also super long. I am so dissapointed. I told Levi's we are going to have go to another company, there isn't anything left for my husband with them. They don't have anything to replace these now that they are changed.

Who did they think they were going to fool? Like all of those existing 569 wearing customers weren't going to notice the difference? Crappy new cut, crappy new material (thin, and a lot less of it), and crappy PR move.Levi's has decided not to to be considered \\"Classic\\", buy choosing to follow the low rise, slim fit, fad of the day. Even with this marketed \\"loose\\" fitting 569 jean. If this change has anything to do with the recent prices of cotton, then Levi's has also displayed their belief in profits, over style, quality, and business ethics.(If coke switched their formula without mentioning it on the bottle, people would freak)Once my old 569s are gone I'm done with Levi's, they don't make anything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either the style changed or poor QC","review":"My favorite pair of jeans are a Levi's 569 Loose Straight.

I thought that it was perhaps an inconsistent production line, but I read many reviews on the Levi's website that complained of the same thing: The crotch begins very high, so the back of the jeans ride way up in your a$s. I can't imagine anyone would enjoy this fit! It looks and feels absurd.So if you have an older pair of 569s that you love, don't count on these fitting the same.
