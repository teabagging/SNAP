If I were you is my fave,Talk to me and I can't wait are a close tie for second but whole album minus The Nightmare(still HATE this song)rates as terrific (especially given the coke addled time in Stevie's precious life).This album would get five stars if both Reconsider Me and Thousand Days were included as planned and I would love to hear the first album of \\"dark\\" songs recorded for this album but ultimately shelved for this group of very good songs.

She sings energetically but the stuff sounds very dated now. The only song I really liked on this one was \\"Imperial Hotel\\" - a spirited rocker with full band (several of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers), sounds great, including Stevie's voice. They should have done five more like that!!! \\"I Sing For the Things\\" is very tender and acoustic-romantic - her soft voice sounds damaged, like it's about to collapse, and yet this adds to the vulnerable feel of the song. But elsewhere, yeah, synthesizers take over, she's lost in a haze on the title track, and in general her songwriting is not strong here. 'The Nightmare' is bad, a half-incoherent train of recycled Stevie lyrics and loud chug-chug synth rock to back it up. Exception: the lovely \\"Has Anyone Ever...\\" but you can get that on TimeSpace and on the Box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one!","review":"Though I've been a Stevie fan since I was a teen, I seriously dislike this album. I'm well aware that synthesizers were used on Stevie albums released prior to 'Rock a Little,' but the synthesized sound is really overbearing on most of the tunes on this album. This effect makes the entire album (aside from 'Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You') sound just too \\"Eighties pop.\\" There's not much on here that is reminiscent of the well-loved Bella Donna era. Only a die-hard Stevie fanatic can bear to listen to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE DIGITALLY REMASTER THIS CD","review":"I'ts time.

It really wasn't worth the effort. The color illustrations are nice looking. But the supporting text bears almost no relevance to the illustrations. There's no description of the materials or construction of the uniforms, no real reference to the equipment worn, and no description of what uniforms were worn by whom or when. Worse than that, there's huge gaps in the uniforms illustrated. For example, there's not a single illustration of a German infantry private in 1914, or any illustrations at all of Turkish uniforms.There are almost no books out there providing anything more than cursory information about World War I unifoms. Sadly, this book doesn't really do anything to fill this gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"While their singing is as precise as ever, the King's Singers probably shouldn't have chosen this group of songs.

I really expected something great from a 2.4GHz phone, but it performed worse than both my VTech and Uniden 900MHz phones. The biggest problem was static even when you were close to the base.

But I'm one of those gotta see for myself people. I really liked the hi-tech design and no one else has anything that looks this good so I bought one anyway, Here is the scoop- this phone has major design problems. First the hard plastic hand piece vibrates when the other party talks which causes distortion (kind of like if you try to talk through a sheet of waxed paper). Second -The ringer on the phone is very \\"wimpy\\" it can't be heard in the next room even when set to the highest level. (IBM/TT should have put a ringer in the base set like Sony did) and finally the talk key which answers and hangs up sticks out too far, it will hang up the phone when you are talking if it gets to close to your face!

It just doesn't have the shaft length to be splitting wood or really bite into thicker limbs though...and when I was trying to use it as such (middle of February with 3 feet of snow on the ground) that's not the thing I wanted to hear.If you're looking for something lightweight to break up smaller limbs and such, but don't need to really be \\"working wood\\" this could do very nicely.

Must have seemd cool in the '60's; now it sounds like \\"The Chipmunks Play the Classics.\\" Johansson's best work is great, but there isn't much of it here.

It has the largest step surface available (approximately 14\\" by 40\\") and sports a slip-free rubber surface for safety. The steps I've seen for this price all have four plastic platforms so the stepper can raise the step level from 4\\" to 6\\" to 8\\". This step does not have these adjustments, so you will be stuck with a 4\\" height. That is fine if you are just starting out but, more than likely, you will eventually want to raise the level to at least 6\\". Just the main 4\\" platform for this price is way too much.

But very few of them offer actually useful maps, and this is not one of them. There are page after page of tangential information, including a breakdown of the many Christian religions and what they each believe (not that I'd trust any one author to get all of that right). But try to find a decent Bible map in this book, and you'll be disappointed. I mean a GOOD map with ACTUAL value relating to the various periods in Biblical history. This book seems to almost be written for a juvenile audience. For serious students of Biblical history, I STRONGLY recommend the \\"St. Joseph Atlas Of The Bible\\" by Tim Dowley. It is a smaller, less expensive, but incomparably superior collection of maps (79 of them) that are ordered in order of the books of the Bible, so you can actually use the maps as you read through the Bible. This Rose Book is basically useless in that regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for serious Bible students","review":"This book would be best for home-schoolers or pre-teen age.

We've addressed this issue to some extent with Children toys manufactured in China but I am hesitant to believe that all their addition of lead in other products have been eliminated."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for cooking with red wine","review":"I bought this replacement pot for occasional cooking. My previous pot lasted me over 10 years. Yesterday after slow cooking a brisket of beef previously soaked in red wine the enamel got seriously stained. Nowhere in the page of \\"instructions\\" it said that I can't cook food soaked in wine! Here goes my coq-au-vin! Bleaching it for hours helped to eliminate the dark spots but the bottom of the pan is no longer white but specked and lightly stained. Now I had to waste enormous amount of energy and time to mail the heavy item back and get a replacement since the warranty expired in just one year. Amazon was, of course, very helpful, but just going through the rigamorole of returning such a heavy item: getting a carton box, packing and mailing it was a lot of tedious trouble. I really wish that the manufacturer read such reviews, and implemented some kind of quality control, so the poor sods like me won't get stuck with the inferior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why should you pay the price of Le Crueset?","review":"I own a 7.5 qt. Le Creuset bouillabaisse pot and love it, but I wanted something smaller for everyday and small jobs without paying Le Creuset prices. I took a chance and got the Lodge 3 qt pot. I love it!

All we need now is for Lodge to make more pieces and colors available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven","review":"This is an excellent value for an enameled, cast iron Dutch oven.

Tried frying potatoes in it once but even after coating the bottom with a generous amount of olive oil, had a one inch layer of potatoes on the bottom which was very difficult to remove. I bought it mainly to brown meat, and maybe I shouldn't have attempted to fry potatoes in it, but I still have brown spots on the enamel from my first cooking expedition. Frying potatoes and browning meat, though, is a similar process so my impression is that this is a cheap dutch oven. My friend has a Le Crueset pot that this doesn't happen to. It's probably best for simmering stews and sauces, but I'd rather use my stainless steel pots which heat evenly, don't weigh 20 pounds, and are easy to clean. I should have returned this dutch oven but I was too lazy so now it sits on top of a cabinet in my kitchen taking up space (because it's so big and heavy, it's also a pain to store). Unfortunately, it just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for a long run","review":"I purchased the 6q enamel dutch oven in early 2010. At the beginning it was working great.I used it for browning meat, making stews and soups.Then I started baking bread in it. I would heat it up to 450 - 475F. My bread was coming out way better than when baked just on the stone.However, shortly after I noticed a lot of bubbles on the bottom of the pot. Later I decided to clean it by boiling some water with baking soda. That caused a lot of the enamel to just chip off, crack even more and now the whole bottom looks horrible.I don't know if I can even use it for browning meat or any frying any more.I'm very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend it for people who want to use it for more than making stews and soups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but not built to last","review":"Looks fantastic and works fine for a couple months then the interior enamel flaked off. I always hand washed it and never over heated it. Since I don't want to risk chipping a tooth the entire thing has been thrown into the trash. What a waste. I expected more from Lodge. While many of the Lodge products are made in the USA, these enameled Dutch ovens are made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Heats up quick and evenly. Doesn't stick like the non-enamal lined cast iron. A bit heavy but a great, quality piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price but still not worth it","review":"I have had this pot for over a year. It cooks well but my biggest complaint is that it stained from the get go and only continues to stain more and more on the interior. I think it is unsightly. Tonight when I used it I was taking off the lid and accidently tapped the lid to the pot and a chunk of the red enamel on the outside of the lid broke off. That was the last straw for me. I am throwing this pot away. I ordered a Staub to replace it because it was a little better priced than a Le Creuset. To me it makes more sense to spend a couple hundred dollars on a pot I will have a lifetime than a $50 on a pot I will keep a year. I am surprised by all the great reviews for this pot. The reviews were why I chose it. But beware - all of the lesser priced pots are made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pot, especially for the price","review":"I have a smaller Le Creuset dutch oven, which I dearly love. But for occasional big batches of chili or roasts I wanted a really big pot. This one is fantastic, and the price is unbeatable.

This is a great alternative to the fancy french brand that gives you great results."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good!","review":"We recieved this item quickly and in good shape. It is exactly what we wanted. We just purchased this in Dec 2012 and have used it a couple of times and see no signs of cheap manufacture(chipping, heat stress enamel fracturing, etc).

Spaghetti sauce didn't stain it though. I'm still learning that it takes only a little heat to cook with. This pot is different from the old cast iron one I used to just set in the fire and let go. I wish the lid handle was a little more sturdy but it's supposed to take the heat. I'm still learning how to cook with this but I do love it so far. Every Sunday I put it on the stove and then figure out what I'm going to put in it for that day. Good price too.

I would've never spent the money on Le Creuset and am glad to find out it wouldn't have been necessary anyway.This pot is ideal for soups, stews, even stir fries.. goes in the oven too and cleans up so nicely. I am amazed! The size is perfect, it handles very well, looks beautiful and really comes through with every meal I've used it for. If I had to pick one pot to keep forever, this would be it. Given how well it's held up, i'm pretty sure, it'll last me for decades...This would be the perfect wedding gift, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"Okay I have not owned this for very long but it seems very durable to me. Also, to those who mentioned that it still has a cast iron edge around the rim of the pan (might have seen that on a review for another Lodge dutch oven but it would apply here), that's mentioned in the enclosed pamphlet. It looks like bare cast iron but it does have a coating over it so it will not rust.

Be careful and look at the different colors because they can have huge price differences.Cleans much easier then stainless. It is my go to pot now for nearly everything.

That was only half as disappointing as the day I opened it (around 6 months after purchase) to find the enamel bubbled and ready to chip off on the bottom.

Really good deal considering it used to be 50 something. Its lovely to use, very sturdy and heavy and the colour is lovely. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because of the glass surround you have to go easy on it, I like to treat my pans badly and whack them on the stove at a high heat to get it going but this you have to wait for it to warm slowly.

I would not recommend this dutch oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent dutch oven for the price","review":"I received a 3.5qt red Le Creuset dutch oven as a gift but needed a larger dutch oven. I did not want to pay the price for a 6qt Le Creuset dutch oven so I saw the Lodge product and thought I would try it. It performed just as well as the Le Creuset. The only difference I saw was while the Lodge was as easy to clean as the Le Creuset the lodge did stain on the inside and the Le Creuset was pristien.

However, Lodge is significantly cheaper and, in my view, just as good as the more expensive cast iron.By the way, when the shipment arrived the lid and pan were separated by little black bumpers which I kept so that the lid and pan would continue to be protected in storage.

I love the idea of this product. I read the reviews about the chipped enamel and I thought, Well, I'll give it a shot! I took a chance and bought this one and before I even used it, there is enamel chipping off of the handle. I can tolerate a good amount of odd cosmetic things and the fact that it is on a handle shouldn't be such a big deal. But! This has never been used. If the enamel is actually flaking off of this product before I've gotten to make anything in it, how long before it starts chipping in a place that is more likely to leave fragments in my food?! Plus, $50 is a lot less than The Mega Dutch Oven Brand, but it's nothing to sneeze at. Back it goes! And I have no idea what to do now. I don't want to try a cheap brand, but I really don't want to shell out a third of a mortgage payment on a kitchen pot that I'll probably use 3 times a month. :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooks anything wonderfully","review":"I received one of these as an engagement gift this year and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE it! I cooks everything perfectly and it is a non-stick pot without using tephlon, which is always a huge plus. I have cooked rice, pasta, and soup in this dutch oven so far and everything comes out perfect. The cast-iron really holds the heat unbelievably well and distributes the heat evenly, which makes a huge difference to me right now being forced to use an electric raised-coil stove where there coils are uneven and do not heat evenly in our rental. :-( This dutch oven is definitely worth it if you want a Le Creuset brand dutch oven but can't afford them. I would honestly take the lodge cast-iron dutch oven over Le Creuset anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality and construction","review":"I purchased this from Amazon late December and have used about ten times.

Last week, the enamel started coming off the the sides and bottom of the pot. I was very disappointed as it was a prized kitchen item. It is back to the older pots and pans that I have. I would not recommend the purchase as it will not last very long.

Mind you, I did not ever get to cook in it! I had read a few bad reviews that referred to chipped enamel, but since I'm very careful with my cookware and not too hard to please I thought I'd be fine. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. Maybe this is just an occasional problem, but I'll be returning my dutch oven for a refund.

Furthermore, the claim that there is no bare cast iron around the rim of the pan appears to be untrue, because it rusted immediately. The lid, in fact, left a circular rust stain on my countertop. Despite the fact that Lodge constantly touts the fact that they are a US company and their wares Made in America, when you get the box you will find that all of their enamelware is actually made in China, which may be the problem.

The blue is gorgeous, the pan worked beautifully, the bean soup was delicious, and all was well until I washed it--the enamel was completely non-stick, cleanup was a breeze--but when all the soup was washed off with a dishcloth, there was a chip! I had used a wooden spoon, no metal. My poor BF, not very internet savvy, somehow mistakenly ordered this through an external site, Ron's Home and Hardware. Not only did he not get free shipping, but we now have to hold our breath wondering whether he can return it and whether he'll have to pay return shipping, putting him out nearly $30 to be empty handed.

I've only used it about five times now so I can't speak to its long-term durability, but so far it's been fantastic! It cooks the food very evenly, and, as long as you spray it beforehand with a non-stick cooking spray, cleans up very easily with a simple sponge and regular dish soap. I've also been using it in a 450-degree oven, and the knob has been just fine. Definitely recommended!UPDATE 8/5/10: I've had this for almost three years now, and it's held up great. Even though I routinely use it at 450 degrees, I've had no problems with the plastic knob on the top, and it's easy to clean. It's been a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for no-knead bread...","review":"...as long as you replace the plastic knob with a metal one.

Just finished my first \\"pot boule\\" loaf (Kalamata olive/rosemary bread from Nancy Baggett's book \\"Kneadlessly Simple \\"), and it came out perfect!The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is that as with some others here, mine arrived with a small chip (about 1/8\\" by 1/2\\") on the rim of of the lid. I smoothed it with an emery board, and I'm not worried about it; I know from experience that sooner or later, all enamelware gets chipped in use.My advice: don't waste your money on Le Creuset's overpriced pots.

For one, the lid handle is metal (and thus oven safe for higher temps) and the weight is more in line with Staub or other high end dutch ovens (Le Creuset runs a tad light). Lastly, the fit of the lid is especially good, which is usually the fatal flaw of the non-brand name dutch/french ovens. I would recommend this over a Staub or Le Creuset even if they were all the same price.

Heats quickly and evenly and is easy to clean--even when you neglect to stir the contents and they burn on the bottom. Just a boil a little water in the bottom and the stuff lifts off. The only minus we have is that the inside is stained--but that's from the cochinita pibil, which braises in a red achiote sauce.

I had a very hard time cleaning the pot, I had to use baking soda and a soft scrub pad (nothing else worked). I was very lucky that it did not scratch the finish and I was able to clean it as if it was brand new. I do not think it needs the vegetable oil since I cooked another loaf and did not use the oil and the bread came out perfect.This is a very beautiful pot and not too heavy at all, I leave it on my stove since it looks so nice and gives my kitchen a splash of color.

I followed the instructions and heated this pan with oil in it. My pan cake stuck a bit the first time. After gently washing it with soapy water I tried eggs and the eggs just wouldn't leave the surface. Had to return it. I bought a plain cast iron pan as a replacement.

I feel like I was deceived, and I doubt I'll buy anything from them again. It's a shame that they make everything else here, and they hold themselves out as a proud american company, then they turn around and sell cheap chinese junk. Very disappointed.

Sure enough, the knob on the lid cracked and when I took out the bread, there was a nickel-sized hole in the enamel finish at the bottom of the pot.Just a word of warning that if your recipe calls for temperatures over 400 degrees, this oven is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"get what you pay for...","review":"I wanted a cast iron to make stews in and to bake bread in. Unfortunately this isn't up to the job.The enamel on the bottom of the pot bubbled and cracked. When I contacted Lodge, they told me that heating it in the oven isn't proper use of the pot! I know lots of people use cast iron pots to bake bread, which requires preheating of the pot in the oven. If it can't stand up to 450F in the oven, I want a different pot.The machining of the top of the pot also isn't up to the quality you get with a more expensive version. Rather than machining the lip of the pot flush with the cover, it has three small nubs that make the cover appear to sit flush. You don't get a good seal and lose moisture that should be sealed into the pot.Do yourself a favor and skip this Chinese knockoff, and save a few extra clams to get the real thing, and deal with a company like Le Creuset that stands by their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic enameled cast iron dutch oven","review":"I've always wanted enameled cast iron dutch ovens, and year after year I kept waiting for Staub or LeCreuset to go on sale. Of course it never happened. So back in 2008, I ordered the Lodge dutch oven in caribbean blue. I've been cooking stews, pot roasts, Chinese stewed pork, on my gas stove or in the oven. I have to say that I really really really love this dutch oven. Even heating, great for browning before braising or roasting, this pan works like a dream. To clean up, I always let it cool down first, pouring some water in to let it soak for awhile, then everything wipes up with a damp sponge. I loved it so much that I got the 6 qt too. The pot is very heavy, and I recommend a sink mat if you have a porcelain sink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important: they've just improved the knob","review":"Several reviewers have mentioned that the knob can replaced by a more heat-tolerant one available from Le Creuset.

But I have to state that, as a chef, having high-quality equipment to cook with makes a world of difference. While Le Creuset might be the Cadillac of enamel cookware, this is much more affordable and works incredibly well. This is so versatile and perfect for soups, roasts, or even duck confit. While enamel cookware does require some patience when it comes to high-heat cooking, it can withstand just about anything you throw at it. I love cast-iron cooking at home and have a standard cast-iron dutch oven, but find it unsuited to some soups and such. That's where this comes in. I find myself using this for more and more tasks, more than I anticipated. For the many of us who can't afford Le Creuset cookware, this is nearly just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I was so happy to find these and bought two sizes.

I was left with ruined meat and a pot with a large piece of the enamel missing. Needless to say, I returned them. I then went out and bought a \\"Chasseur\\"pot which was so much more expensive but in this case -you get what you pay for.

It cooks well, it cleans well (you can hardcore \\"caramelize\\" and bake things, leaving crusty rings and it cleans effortlessly) and I'm a bit rough and tumble...

The enamel didn't hold up very well. After about 3 uses food started to stick to the bottom. And I'm not talking about the nice brown bits you look for to deglaze. Food just sticks and in turn burns while you are cooking.

I returned the first one without ever using it, and the replacement pot has the same problem, but slightly less spots. I return the second one and was willing to try my luck with a third pot.

The top edge of the porcelain where the white part meets the black also had rust developing but I figured I could live with that. I have one of the more expensive French made pots that had many more years of use and still looks new. I would recommend spending the extra money to buy a better brand.

I then stored it carefully to prevent any rubbing. I opened to the pot for use for the first time--noticed a spot on the interior bottom & moved to gently brush off what I thought was a piece of fluff. It was not as more of the bottom interior also fluffed off. It was bubbled so it looked more would fall off into the food at the first stir. I took the pot to a Lodge Store in TN. The employees were dismayed at the quality and agreed that it should be returned. They however would not exchange it as it was purchased from Amazon.

Another reviewer posted that Lodge's website now states that both enamel lines are made in China. I recently looked at this product at a brick and mortar (Walmart) and it was indeed marked \\"China\\". The enamel was thinner than the product that was made in the US, and I note the review made just 2 before mine states that the enamel peeled off after 1 use and they're returning it. I'm looking for a better quality product.

I have always hand washed this pot and have never placed it in a dish washer. Don't waste your money on this pot. I have this pot for less than less than three months and have used it less than ten times. I have contacted the seller. I'm hopeful for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I Originally ordered this as a wedding gift, but had it shipped to me rather than the bride as I wanted to check it out. I have been looking for this very thing for several years now, but have not wanted to pay the high price for the more popular brands. As soon as I examined it, I ordered one for myself. It's terrific! I braise & saute a lot and this pot heats evenly, does well in the oven, and cleans up beautifully. It also looks great on the stove as it's pretty heavy to be moving around after every use. The free shipping was an added bonus b/c the thing weighs about 16 pounds. Thank you, Lodge, for producing such a durable, attractive product (& testing it to be sure it contained no toxins, as it was made in China)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dutch Oven","review":"This is a great multi-use dutch Oven - stove top, oven.

She had asked for one she saw for $20 at a local store but after looking at the ones in the store I was a little underwhelmed. I did my research and found that if you want a good cast iron dutch oven and can't afford the expensive price tags of le crucet then this Lodge dutch oven is perfect!Amazon offered a variety of colors, I went with the blue one because it was cheapest and my mom didn't care what color it was.

The enamel already has about 8 chips, the enamel has hairline cracks throughout the inside of the pan, and there are rust spots beginning to form around the top edge of the pan. We own a smaller Le Creuset pan that belonged my great grandmother, which we still use, and it is in better shape than this 2 year old Lodge.

But what really made me literally to toss it out into trash container is that there was no single time when food would NOT stick to the bottom and burn. I used all oils I could get my hands on. Olive, Sunflower, Corn, Vegetable, Soy, Sesame... even tried bacon fat. Last week it was the last straw and down the trash it went.

This is a beautiful dutch oven and it really gets the job done. I have made a couple soups and a roast or two in it so far this winter and everything has come out perfectly.

Would recommend purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dutch Oven","review":"I have used this cast-iron dutch oven for beef stew, soup and chille so far and everything came out delicious. The heavy lid does a great job keeping the steam in the pot while cooking and it is easy to clean. It is much more affordable than the french-named competitor out there.

I noticed another area on the bottom where if you press it gently you can see the enamel is not bound to the cast iron and when I pressed it down with my thumb it chipped also.

Sad, because the pot in itself is very beautiful and a great size!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely NOT the same as Le Creuset","review":"I purchased this exact item and was elated at first. It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. But in time I found that the bottom interior surface stained and it chipped easily. I was unhappily surprised to say the least. Lodge's non-enameled cast iron products,which I also own are superlative.Despite this experience with Lodge's enameled dutch oven, I purchased a Le Creuset enameled cast iron dutch oven because I found it on sale. There is a world of difference!!!The Le Creuset is flawlessly beautiful and it will last you forever just like my French and Belgian Friends said it would. After many months of use.....there are no chips, and no stains. Food comes out as expected. It is Non-stick, reliable cooking and easy to clean. So don't pinch those poor pennies of yours. Give them a rest. Purchase a Le Crueset dutch oven and you'll never need to have regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Developing muscles everyday","review":"I love this dutch oven, and the price is absolutely unbeatable. I use it to cook everything from roast chicken, to risotto, to chili. I use it at least twice a week, and I only really cook 4 or 5 times a week. The main draw back is its weight, but there's really nothing you can do about that if you want even cooking.However, I did have to go out and buy a rubber covered whisk for this thing because the enamel that lines the pot is delicate. You can't use metal tools in this thing which means you can't mash potatoes in it, which is pretty much the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.Overall, great workhorse, and completely affordable, even for a barely paid graduate student like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, cooks wonderfully","review":"I love this dutch oven. It's not only beautiful, but it cooks evenly too. I haven't had any trouble with the porcelain finish chipping like others have complained about with other brands.

I'm impressed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I ordered this for my mother as a gift after using mine for several weeks. I find I use it more than I thought I would. I have the read on, but it was reported to me by my mother that the green color is very pretty. It is nice and heavy. It heats evenly and I love that it can go from the stove to the oven. As others have said, the handle will melt above 400, but this is not really an issue for me. No problems so far with any rusting, but that can be scrubbed and oiled if it does rust around the top edge. This costs less than some premium brand names, but gets the job done quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pot I got!","review":"I have used this Lodge enameled oven many times and for many recipes since getting it. I could not be happier. AS a long time user of cast iron for cooking, this is my first enameled version, but not my last. Fantastic slow cooking on stove top and does a great job covered and in the oven. Most likely I will replace the knob on the cover as it is not heat resistant over 350F. Will be easy to do.I have not yet used to to deep fry, but I expect it will be great for that also.This will be on my shopping list for a couple of folks next X-Mas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lodge is no le creuset - evaluated for a year before writing this review","review":"I can't say I enjoyed this product, which I finally threw out. Thin cast iron, means burned food (a lot!), it stained horribly, the enamel chipped off the outside around the edges of the pan and the lid, and ultimately it was more trouble than it was worth. Finally a badly burned interior meant the enamel came off before the burned substance.In contrast to my le creuset pan (admittedly smaller), that never burns, never stains, never chips...Yes cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Interesting experiment, I won't buy one of the lodge enamelled products again, though.FOLLOWUP: Tramontina has a lovely alternative (which is holding up much better than the Lodge, after about 4 months of use) - similar to Le Creuset except much heavier. You might want to check out my evaluation on that product here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!","review":"If I could give this zero stars I would. I actually bought this from a Local retail shop and returned it 4 times because every single one was chipped or damaged (before I even used it).

The enamel just is not applied properly and its easily chipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Logic EC6D43 6-Quart Dutch Oven","review":"I'm very pleased with this product. I use it for popcorn, deep fried fish, chili, spaghetti sauce etc. It's great for tomato based recipes, unlike cast iron, because you don't have to worry about the destruction of the seasoning that protects the iron from rust. I don't know if people aren't heeding the warning that comes with the pot (Don't heat too quickly; start with medium heat, don't put in dishwasher, use wooden spoon or plastic spatula), and therefore having the rust, cracking and chipping issues, or just unlucky and getting a rare but badly made pot. Also common sense that if you shouldn't heat too quickly don't cool down too quickly either. I let mine cool completely before cleaning it, and it's still very easy to clean with just soap and water and a sponge. If you have need for more scrubbing power use baking soda. I ordered another one in the casserole size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Condition, Better Handle","review":"I received my dutch oven, and it's in superb condition. One note though for people looking to make this purcahse. Lodge has started making this dutch oven with an all metal handle (about time). I took the advice on the earlier reviews and purchased the le cruset replacement handle only to discover on delivery that I did not need it. The picture on this product still shows the composite handle that is only good up to 400 degrees. What you get is much better, don't waste your money on the le cruset handle.This is a magnificent piece of cookware and I have been wanting one for a long time. The price is also amazing for what you receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I bought this after reading many of the reviews here. YES I know it is made in China. It is still the BEST out here for the money. You could spend $150 more but this pan is great. I checked it for any chips etc. upon arrival and all was well. If not I would have returned it for a replacement. It cooks really well. Everything I have cooked in it has turn out just fine. I use it daily. The ONLY problem it the plastic knob. I did as others mentioned here and purchased a metal knob to replace the plastic one.

I have a Le Creuset 3 1/2 quart dutch oven, which I have used for almost 20 years. However, the recipe for the bread calls for a 5-6 quart oven, and not wanting to spend a small fortune, I opted for the Lodge. Boy, that was a mistake. I just unpacked it, and as one reviewer noted, there are three raised areas on the lid which don't allow it to seat properly on the pot, and in my opinion that pretty much renders this pot useless. I was hoping that was an anamoly, but apparently not. What good is a dutch oven that doesn't have a tight fitting lid, might as well use a roasting pan. It's going back. The best thing I can say is that it did have a nice color and weight to it. But they really need to fix that problem with the lid. That old adage really does apply - \\"you get what you pay for\\". Guess I'll start saving my pennies for a new Le Creuset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Dutch Oven","review":"This is evetything it promises. Easy to clean,I use it often!

In the beginning, it was great. Le Creuset on a budget. But over time, the enamel wears on the base of the pot, causing food items to stick. By comparison, I also have two Staub cocottes which I have had zero issues with food items sticking.If you're looking for a dutch oven for the long haul, I would not recommend this. However, if you're satisfied with as short-term pot, this will do just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tad expensive, but perfect!","review":"It was a bit expensive... Is that normal? Other dutch ovens I've tried aren't worth it, but this one holds up like a dream! The enamel on the inside has taken a beating from all sorts of utensils and acidic sauces and the damage has been minimal, barely noticable. A good investment in the long run. Great for spaghetti night or dinner parties for 6-10 people! Whenever I cook in this thing my guests seem to develop larger appetites...hmmmm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I've had the 7.5 qt. dutch oven for about 6 months and use it at least two or three times a week, cooking for 7 people, and I really love it! I will say though, that it has started to chip on both the inside and outside and from day 1, there was a slight rise in the center that made foods burn and stick in that one specific spot.One reviewer commented on the discoloration at higher temps and we've noticed that as well. I don't know if that's a real concern or not but it did surprise me when it happened.Considering that I've read reviews where people with Le Creuset have chips as well, I would say that the Lodge dutch oven is well worth the price and is not a disappointment. I've definitely gotten my money's worth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and practical","review":"I love cooking in enameled cast iron for the evenness of cooking and the lower cooking temperatures you are able to use. I purchased this one as a gift for my mother for Christmas, and she has really enjoyed using it. As a bonus, the vibrant red looks gorgeous on her cooktop even when not in use. The size is perfect for cooking for our family of six. The interior is easy to clean, but you need to use silicone, nylon, or wooden tools. Metal will damage the interior enamel. That black edge is not exposed cast iron - it is matte black enamel.I noticed that the product description and photos indicated that the knob was plastic - which is not oven safe over 350 degrees. When it arrived, I was very pleased to see that it actually had a metal knob that can withstand 500 degrees in the oven - perfect for making great rustic artisan breads that require a 450 degree baking temp. If yours does not come with the metal knob, le creuset makes a metal replacement knob for about $11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great","review":"Browns well, easy clean up, very even heat. This thing is a tank though, so not for the weak armed. It is Chinese made (what isn't these days) but the workmanship seems very good. Nice color.

The lid also fits the matching skillet.Lodge Enamel on Cast Iron 11 Inch Skillet, Caribbean BlueOverall I'd rate this a bargain, especially stacked up against other enamel on cast iron cookware.

The price is great and I like to buy American whenever I can. Alas, the quality is not what I'd hoped. I've had it for about a year, and use it perhaps once every two weeks. The inside enamel is covered with little cracks. I'll get a few more uses out of it but I'll have to discard it soon.I own one of the pricey French pans, a small one. I've had it for 20 years and it's still in perfect condition.

One thing is certain, it is a bargain. However, it chipped within the first month of use, revealing the cast iron underneath. Then, something peculiar began to happen. The interior cream enamel developed a million little micro-cracks, so much so that after about 8 months of use, the surface resembled an ancient oil painting. This was after the chips continued to develop and grow. Pretty soon, I had to throw it away because I couldn't trust that I wouldn't bite down on a piece of it and break a tooth. I now own two Le Creuset pieces and have yet to see a chip, crack, or any defect after months of use. I supposed you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceeded my expectations","review":"I always used Lodge for my cast iron camping dutch ovens.

Because of the high heat and rough treatment, the enameled surface inside the pot \\"crackled\\" - I had to replace it for her (it wasn't really hurt...my niece was proud to get it!). I checked the Wal-Mart price (about $70). Amazon's price was $50 with free shipping. How could I beat that deal!! All Lodge products I have used have really been good and have held up well.

I declined a replacement as I was very worried that the same thing would happen again. Amazon was very good about my return of the item and refunding my purchase price which I appreciated .

Of course, when I ordered it, it was back ordered and when it finally arrived, after the Christmas holidays, I didn't have a need to use it until recently (after the return window closed).

Right away I purchased the Lodge Dutch Oven in spicy red and have been using it to braise meat, put together one-pot meals and cook up homemade jams. The heft of the pot is a mixed blessing -- great for the cooking part, but a little cumbersome when washing it. (I don't have a dishwasher, remember I'm a poor free lancer).

What has happened to NFG's catchy tunes (My Friend's Over You, Hit or Miss, etc) ? Where are the heartfelt songs that you can still rock out to (The Story So Far) ? I just can't believe it. The majority of these songs are so BORING that I didn't even want to listen to them ONCE. Some of the songs are actually annoying.This one was highly anticipated, and now highly disappointing. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh well","review":"I never write reviews for the cds I buy, but felt the need for this one. NFG seemed to be maturing with Catalyst, but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote. I tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked, but it's weaker than their self-titled. They grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better, and then lost it all. This album is super poppy, which is ok, but the lyrics are some of their worst. I know some might disagree, and that's fine. I just wanted to warn people, if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst, then you'll probably see this one as a step backwards. Sorry NFG!

This album has the best vocals I've heard from Jordan on any album. It also had the best lyrics of any of their albums. Catalyst has a different sound than this album, so if thats what hooked you to NFG then you probably won't like this one. If you're a fan of the pre-Catalyst then this album is for you. It sounds like a more mature, pre-Catalyst, NFG."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more mature sound.","review":"First off, I think that Sticks and Stones and Catalyst are two of the best CDs I own.

If you are a New Found Glory fan then you need to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it will grow on me... but I doubt it","review":"There's nothing here but a departure to a crappy emo/pop sound including handclaps and other various misplaced garbage. A few catchy riffs don't make up for the lack of quality or energy of previous NFG releases. I guess a lot of great bands put out a turd of a CD once or twice and on this one, NFG dropped a stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still their most developed, mature release thus far.","review":"I've been listening to NFG for over a decade now. I've been a very big fan of theirs growing up with their newest release always playing in my CD player. This review comes years after owning this album but listening to their new March 10th 2009 release urged me to rate this one.This is by far their most developed and mature album to date. The song topics portray adult love, growing up into adult hood, and the loss of a loved one. All of the material on this release touched base with me on a very emotional level. I was great seeing these group of guys mature and yet still deliver to their mature audience.Sure it does not sound like \\"old\\" NFG but I'm glad for that.

These shoes ensure you are placing your weight down on the proper part of your foot - not on the outside, for instance, which is the tendency of runners. Correct foot placement ensures the knees bear the weight correctly and off loads the hip joints. As an old runner and athlete, I began to have serious pain in my knees because I had worn the cartiledge down on the exterior part of my knees; these shoes have saved my having knee replacement at this time. I now walk properly and, consequently, my knees are rolling over the central and interior portion of cartiledge, areas which are not worn out.

England is producing some attractive books, but the truth of the matter is that the United States is where the \\"action\\" has been for the last half century as far as peony growing and hybridising is concerned.

He had a positive impact on the music scene and popularized the organ as no one since E. Power Biggs. His playing was controversial, of course, but always musical on its own terms. This book is written in a gushing tone that grows frustrating. As you turn the pages you begin to wish the author had not chosen to relate his acquaintance with Fox through a succession of amusing anecdotes; the \\"look what he's done now!\\" approach loses its effect quickly.

The soy sauce was all I used other than a pinch of pepper and it was all that was needed. Kikkoman's is flavorful without being overly salty. (That's a lot coming from me being as I can't stand overly salty foods or condiments.) It's no where near as salty as those soy sauce condiment packets you get at the restaurants.I actually found myself adding more after the dish was done to add more flavor.I think the sauce is a tad pricey, so if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, great."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Galway Enchants with \\"Dances for Flute\\"","review":"I purchased this CD after hearing a couple of tracks on our local fine arts radio station, but was completely unprepared for the richness and beauty to be found therein.

The dialogue is written in modern speech, although the setting remains in the early seventeenth century. The feminist treatment is heavy-handed, the humour isn't funny, and the pathos becomes bathos. As a piece for the theatre, it also suffers, with numerous overly-short scenes. I don't think this would translate well to the stage.

All the advise is useless. It's a bad design. You can hear the impeller cavitate - it's trying to pump, but it takes a cup and patience to fill and refill the thing until IT finally decides to pump some water. And if you have it pumping, it's barely enough to get the wheel going. Did I mention that it eats cartridges - one a week is not uncommon at all since the floss is too fine. It cost a fortune to operate this thing and then the time it takes to clean the impeller that clogs to easily. When I first got it I thought, well people just don't know how to operate and maintain a tank, but let me tell you: This filter is great when it is new but after 3 to 6 month you have it figured out.

What annoys me most of all is that the replacement cost of the impeller is 2/3 the costs of the new unit. I've now replaced all but one Penguin with an Emperor. It seems silly to have an Emperor on a 10 gallon tank, but they last and perform flawlessly. Save your money.

As time went on, however, the noise gradually became more and more of a problem. Now, after about a year and a half, this thing has got to go. It buzzes obnoxiously loud, and it has become unbearable. Apparently, Marineland sells a replacement impeller that'll fix this problem (or lessen it), but the price of the impeller is only 10 dollars less than a brand new filter. Seems like a waste of time to me.So overall, this filter is nice looking, and it'll work for a while, but it's not a quality long term solution.

Which is really lame, because Marineland also makes Emperor products, which last a lot longer and are much better designed. You get what you pay for in aquariums, and it's definitely worth putting out the money for a better powerhead or filter up front, so you don't have to pay more to replace the cheap product later on anyway.I replaced my Penguin Bio-Wheel with an Emperor 280 and now I have just ordered a Hydor Koralia Nano to replace my Penguin powerhead.Do yourself a favor and just buy a better product from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"restart problems","review":"I have been using the Marineland 200 Bio-wheel Filter on my 30 gallon tank for less than a year.

It is very well written and beautifully illustrated. The text covers every detail of the art of making a violin. It does lack in a few areas however. I would have been thrilled with the addition of some information on original design and or mechanical drawing of a violin. Also, the book is a bit thin in the areas of plate graduation, tap toning, wood selection, tools and varnish. Overall though, I highly recommend this book; it is more than enough to get anyone started on building their first violin.

The story shows the reality of the violence of adolescence. It's a really moving movie, the kind of, you can't forget when you've seen it once. It's done with human feeling and human blood, if you're the kind of personn who love films to be lively, alive, and beautiful, don't miss this one.

With his style reminiscent of the beatnick writings which inspired his generation, Zelazney builds many versions of the same irreverant character facing the same bewildering challenges which seem to be presented solutions from nothingness at the proper convenient moment.Lovers of such works as Ender's Game, Sword of Truth(s), and such like novels will thoroughly enjoy this work, while those who prefer more sophisticated character development and less contrived solutions to the protagonist's problems will find this work very plodding and well... annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfinished","review":"Great story well worth every moment reading it however one must brace yourself that the story is not entirely finished, the author left considerable leeway for a final chapter but he had died before any serious work on it and the author's son has forbidden any other author to take up the flag."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Science Fiction","review":"If you like science fiction, then please read this book.

It is definately a classic, even for those that aren't fans of fantasy fiction (which I am not). Great story, great characters - it's easy to become obsessed about this series.The book itself has some issues because of it's size - the binding doesn't hold after a couple of readings. This is actually the second one I've purchased over the years. The first one (read by 4 different people) had to be taped back together a couple of times before it finally fell apart completely. I purchased it again and after two readings it was already falling apart.

A large, ancient, and powerful royal family is competing for control of their homeland Amber, which is the center of a universe that spans all the known worlds, our own modern reality being a shadow world of Amber. Although it crosses into modern settings, the core of this story is derived from classic fantasy. The members of the royal family share unique powers and loyalties; the intersection and opposition of these elements provide plentiful material for this long series. Zelazny managed to bring many new concepts to this genre that have been copied shamelessly by many of his successors. Required reading for all lovers of fantastic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I masterpiece.

I guess I was not ready for the The Great Book of Amber 10 years ago. Some of my friends kept on telling me that only the first 5 are interesting and then only the first 2 books, the rest are boring, especially the 5 last books. I must totally disagree with them. I enjoyed equally throughout all 10 books with a slight disappointment in a book 9 (I had a feeling like I am reading a book written after a PC quest game). Otherwise the series are great. I wish Roger Zelazny was still with us and could write a sequence, because even when you are done with 10th book, there is a feeling that there are a lot more to tell us...this is a reason why I would give it 9 of 10 stars and not all 10.Who knows, maybe one day some genius will accomplish such an feat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever in Amber","review":"I share the opinion that this is one of the best fantasy series of all time, and the first storyline comprises my favorite storyline of the last few decades.

I know he's been around forever but I never got around to it. So when I saw that I could get a jump start and buy 10 books in one, I thought this was a great idea.And the books are good. Don't get me wrong. The story takes you through 2 characters. The first 5 focus on one character while the 2nd five focus on that characters son.One thing that I realized right off the bat. If you don't like the characters or the story line, you're screwed as you bought 10 books in one.The second thing I realized is that reading this book while on your back is a chest crusher.

This Amber stuff was very slow, dull, and border line boring to read in comparison. Yes, it is a new concept to be able to travel back-and-forth from 'real time earth' to/from fantasy Amber, moving through shadows and the physics involved. But overall pretty dull story. I only made it through the first 5 or 6 books, the first half... it stopped clean, solid ending, but then it started all over again with the kids, born from the hero's in the first 5 or 6 books. I couldn't take the same crappy story all over again with the kids, so I didn't even bother continuing any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring pulpy grind","review":"I purchased this full set after stumbling onto the \\"Guns of Avalon\\" which I liked. Having all these books together exposes just how bad a writer Zelazny is. I think if I read these individually over a period of years I wouldn't think they suck but one after another they just wore me down. The constant inner monologue is just so tiring not to mention the pages of \\"walking through shadow\\". It got to the point where I was skipping whole pages when I could see they had no dialogue. By the end I wanted to chuck the book in the wood stove. Maybe if they had been split into Corwin/Merlin books it would have been better.

Her perspective is completely in-line with so many women writers--a mother, trying to juggle children, home and family time. I can see how some men might not take this book as seriously, but perhaps that's because they come from a different place. But as a mom and a writer with few writer friends, this book made me feel good about myself again and not so isolated in my struggle and passion of writing.Keep up the great work, Marcia.

Well it did, theoretically speaking. It showed pictures and examples, and it had some shots of the Ford AOD transmission. However, when it began to give diagrams showing the bolt hole patterns - it left out the AOD! When it showed the in-depth diagrams of all the transmission parts, it also left out the AOD. To top it off, the book barely covers any model-specific instructions but rather showed vague and \\"universal\\" instructions. I'm going to try the ATSG AOD manual and see how that goes. But this book is a waste of money, try to find a model-specific guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Turtle loves this stuff.","review":"I have had a problem getting my turtle to eat anything other then meat.(shrimp, meal worms......)

It's easy to see why, because she had a terrific voice that was suited to singing pop songs as well as country songs. The Patsy Cline Commemorative Collection is a set of three albums on two CDs. The albums are12 Greatest Hits,The Last SessionsandLive at the Opry. You can look up the individual listings for those albums to get the track listings.

Ofcourse, it makes you laugh but then you feel, Gosh !!! why are today's comedy films more of bathroom humor and not an intellectual entertainment. The musical goof is bound to make some feel embarressed. The DVD is well made, lots of extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room to breathe","review":"There is nothing hurried about this disc. That said, the music is focused and will stretch your mind. Lewis employed masterful melodic improvisers here: Paul Gonsalves, Eric Dolphy, Jimmy Giuffre, Jim Hall among others. Listen to \\"Body and Soul\\" as it builds powerfully and the soloists explore every possible melodic theme, where the quiet power of these master musicians is almost too much to take. Listen to \\"I Remember Clifford\\" where the players are essentially the MJQ with Jim Hall replacing Milt Jackson. Listen to \\"The Stranger\\" (written by a young Arif Mardin) with that harmonious-yet-discordant brass. This set swings, but oh-so-elegantly. Just like Mr. Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick","review":"I enjoyed the film very much! I need to preface this statement with the fact that I really care for Nicholas Cage movies. With this being said I feel I have made my opinion possibly a little slanted. If you like an actor it makes it hard not to care for their films.With this being said my review for this film is four stars, with looking at the storyline, action, and the interface between actors. The storyline kept you on the edge of your seat and the action was superb, interaction between all the actors was very believable and it had many surprising twists at the finish. January Jones and Nicolas Cage were very believable as were the bad guys.Keep in mind I am getting a bias because of the actors involved and my own opinion of them being positive. Take time, to rent this DVD or purchase it you will not be sorry. It is rated R and there are some very graphic violence in the scenes as well as language.I hope this review is helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly decent film.","review":"I have to admit I had never heard of this film before I watched it. And I was shocked that for a film that had very little publicity it was actually not bad. Usually Nicolas Cage's acting can be pretty over the top but in this film he isn't bad. Also I am not a big fan of January Jones but in this film I actually liked her performance. The film has a decent plot and kept me drawn in throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent B movie, Great Nic Cage movie","review":"While this may not be a \\"Big Budget Movie\\", this was a very entertaining almost 2 hour long movie going into this movie you should not expect this movie the be on the level on some of Nic's earlier movies such as, the rock or the national treasure series. But if you saw some of the other bomb's he has made such as Drive Angry or Knowing. then you will be pleasantly suprised by this movie as i was. there is an even a twist to it that i am sure not too many people will pick up on but you will not \\"lost\\" during the movie if you watch carefully. keyword being \\"lost\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say","review":"I LOVE this movie. If you like suspense, this is it. Nicholas Cage plays an amazing roll in this movie. Keeps you guessing, which is what I like. Anyone who likes a movie that you can't figure out until you see it, this is it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Seeking Justice is, at times, a suspenseful if also fairly implausible and poorly acted movie. Nicholas Cage is merely passable in the role of the man-in-too-deep character, Guy Pearce is flat as a smooth talking bad guy, and January Jones is tepid as the victim/wife. I never felt engaged in the characters and this made the hundred minutes or so seem longer despite some fairly quick pacing once the movie turned from suspense to action.On the whole, the flat acting, a shortage of truly unique twists, inexplicable scenes (the Superdome....why??), and an unsatisfying end left me feeling disappointed in Seeking Justice. It's not an awful movie by any means, but it's not anything I'd care to see a second time. I'd not recommend buying it until after you've had a chance to see it for free on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too implausible to enjoy","review":"Nick Cage's movies are sometimes really good, but often just fair. This movie was too implausible for me to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST OK","review":"This movie is just ok with me it is well made and the acting is ok but the plot is like so many other movies and that is why I only gave it 4 stars it was intertaining. My daughter liked it alot but she likes nick cage so what can you do it is worth watching only once but the action is real good we did enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not worth your time","review":"Nick Cage is way past being worth watching as an actor which is why I only bought/watched this movie to see Guy Pearce who still is. Alas, in this psychologically dumb \\"the vigilantes are killing everybody\\" movie Cage runs around trying to figure out what's going on while Guy Pearce just walks thru his role and adds no 'menace' at all which would have helped. January Jones is beautiful and complicated and more interesting in the film then either 2 men. Unfortunately, when January turns into the hero at the end using her new found \\"Annie Oakley shooting skills\\", the movie just tanks and you regret wasting your time like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in a while for Nicholas Cage","review":"Great acting and stunts, none of that dumb acting or small budgets in many of his movies. The large and mysterious organization centered in this movie drags you in as you actually need to pay attention and think about what is happening. And the more you know the more you realize just how possible this movie is to being in real life making it a truly breathtaking film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch!","review":"This reminds me of the movie equillibrium, if any have seen it. In the sense you do whats right no matter the cost. Nicholas cages' wife is raped and beaten in the beginning of this movie. while in the waiting room Guy Pearce aproaches him and says he knows who did it and he will take care of it for him, for a favor in return. Thats how he hooks all grieving spouses. Its this group of once traumatized men who are then asked to murder someone else who commited a simular crime. it just goes on and on. Like the movie the box, press the button you can have a million dollars, but you have to murder your wife or husband to get it. Messed up moral deliema that proves what kind of person you are. Well Nicholas Cage is asked to kill a child pornographer, what happens from there is twisty and turny and keeps you guessing. HIghly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeking Originality","review":"Nicolas Cage keeps churning out forgettable films - the latest being a \\"Death Wish\\" rehash. Initially titled \\"The Hungry Rabbit Jumps,\\" the competently slick \\"Seeking Justice\\" (2011) is familiar stuff. However, Cage and director Roger Donaldson have done worse. The always-watchable Guy Pearce steals the show as a sinister vigilante mastermind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"I rate this show right up with my favorites. Definately worth watching. I am about to check out every Nick Cage show I can, the last couple were great, especially \\"Drive Angry\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Any Nick Cage movie is expected to be good. At least by me. But his latest string of 'not so wonderful' movies has left me wondering what his strategy is. I have followed this man from a punk rocker on a date, to 'The Rock'. He's a superb actor, in my opinion, yet wasted talent in the recent past. Seeking Justice, I will admit was your everyday, run of the mill, predictable adventure. Yet, I liked it. It held my attention, which is what I seek in a 'good' movie. It probably couldn't have been pulled off using the same script, with different actors. The movie isn't 'The Rock', but it keeps you entertained for the duration. Grab some popcorn and a coke....enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Leave You Feeling Paranoid","review":"Solid suspense thriller with all the usual stuff: chases, foreshadowings, thickening complications, some real surprises, etc. Cage's rather stuffy style works well in his role as a high school English teacher, even though he turns out to be one who's remarkably adept physically and learns to play his criminal opponents' game incredibly fast. Good all-around acting, meaningful dialogue, and use of the New Orleans setting. Has its share of improbabilities and implausibilities, but no more than most films in this genre, and nothing that is completely ruinous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Journey into America's Past","review":"This book is a must read for all those interested in the American Presidency, as well as the history of the birth of America.

Two CDs pack in a lot of music! This isn't the Hollywood version of Jewish wedding music. This is the real thing, with 'Od Yeshama', 'Yasis Alayich', and other traditional songs. Also the haunting melodies of 'Yadid Nefesh' and 'Erev Shel Shoshanim'. (OK, so they did include \\"Sunrise, Sunset\\" but I can forgive them that, considering everything else that is in there.)There is some repetition of songs, as it's set up to follow the progress of the wedding, from Bedekin to Chupah to the dinner and dancing. But this helps the sense of reliving the event. On a few songs the vocals and sound quality are weak ('Ketzad Merakdim' is one), but most of the music comes through with energy and passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than bad","review":"Worse than bad! I would have given zero stars if I could have.The audio was missing from all but 2 of the songs on the second CD. Actually, that was a relief considering how badly the music was performed. The recordings were poorly done, with songs ending abruptly before they were over. An overall bad experience.Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very informative book","review":"This book integrates objective values with consistent romantic love values. It has terrific information as well as many books analysed in detail. The information about sex is very well researched and honest. In addition, it gives clear distinctions of what is morally right and wrong. The author is a great champion of individual rights, and holds them as the absolute law to be respected. He cites many examples where governments and religious organizations have restricted and deprived these rights, especially of women. Overall an extremely valuable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southerns like pasta too.","review":"I had the same company's pasta bowls before losing them in a fire.

I knew he was a \\"budget\\" skeleton, but there were so many issues with him he had to go back. He did not come with directions for assembling. The stand with four wheels is not suitable for stability in a classroom of young children. A fellow teacher has a model with five wheels and it is MUCH more stable. The stand that the wheels were attached to already had rust on it.A thin metal rod was missing at the end of one humerus so the lower leg could not be attached. The rod could not be attached even if one had been sent - it was something that had to be inserted during the manufacturing process. Finally, there were a number of sharp places sticking out on the bones that should have been filed smooth. I actually cut open my finger on a sharp spot in the middle of the sternum. Maybe I just got a \\"lemon\\", but there were too many things wrong for me, even at that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"His music speaks for itself","review":"Nothing that I can write approaches the eloquence of Ivan Moravec's pianism. Since you are reading this \\"review\\", you almost certainly know him already, and you know you must have this recording. The only flaw in this recording is its length, but there is never enough. In every recording of his I have heard, Moravec's thoughtful intelligence, the integrity of his repertoire, and the restraint and elegance of his artistry coalesce into a rare treasure that I keep for special moments of reflection when I can take his music from its box, hold it to the light, and marvel at the purity of its crystalline beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding compilation of Baroque music!","review":"Not only a superb selection of great music, but equally important, performed by the finest musical artists of our time.

The only thing that this DVD would be good for is a gag gift, because it is actually so bad that it makes you laugh - but only in a painful kind of way. What it is, is a series of amateur footage of different breeds of puppies, with each breed being shown for about five minutes. While you are viewing the puppies, you listen to the inane chatter of the narrators, whose dialogue is so pathetic that after 2 minutes you will wonder why you are still sitting there watching. And it only gets worse. My 5 year old watched for about 5 minutes, then said \\"This is too weird, Mom\\" and left the room. Not being as smart as a five year old, I sat and watched about 20 more minutes of the moronic \\"skits\\" before turning it off. So, consider yourself warned - save your money for something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad one-act play stretched out to 86 minutes...","review":"The first ten minutes of DEVIL'S ROCK are tense and gripping - so, two stars instead of one... But once the Allied soldiers are in the Nazi stronghold, the movie devolves into a three-character, two-set play, with NOTHING happening, for the bulk of the movie. Somehow, the demon summoned by the Nazis to win World War II is the ultimate weapon - except for the fact that she can be shackled with ordinary iron shackles, and then is completely powerless. That leaves the surviving soldier, and his Nazi captor, to BICKER, for the bulk of the endless 86 minutes. Tedium ensues...and when the demon finally stops shape-shifting into the soldier's dead wife - gee, where have we seen THAT before? - and shows her true red horned self, she looks like a pissed-off extra from HELLBOY.

There are infinite number of such frames through which consciousness traverses contiguously.Then Mr.Franks writes that the case is so becoz nature doesn't like voids and hence creates all permutations and combinations of frames possible.So my question is that if nature doesn't like voids then why accept quantum states as constant.

There were some temperature extremes between when they were packed and when they were unpacked 6 months later, but I never expected 3 of the 10 utensils' handles to break cleanly where the silver meets. They looked as though someone snapped them over a knee, and all in the same place. There was no impact or pressure - they simply apparently committed hari-kari.

Although pretty, I returned this item to the manufacturer. The metal pieces (knobs at top and utensil itself) easily detaches from plastic stem. My kids turned it into a game a meal time to see if they got the 'lucky broken utensil'! So many came apart that we all won! The utensils themselves are huge as well. Open wide for the soup spoon! The salad forks and teaspoons are the size of regular pieces in most flatware sets. The soup spoons and large forks are long and wide. Never seen a utensil so large. I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dissapointing","review":"Although quite pretty and pleasing in the hand, these are not terribly well made. As noted by another reviewer, the plastic handles don't seem to be at all well grafted to the metal (I don't have kids pulling mine apart, but nonetheless, half of them are wobbly), and additionally, the design element wears away quickly. I don't have a dishwasher and have always carefully washed these by hand, but in less than six months, the blue in the pattern is fading, drastically reducing their visual appeal. Apparently from the school of cheap and cheerful, except for the fact that they're pricey and, after a few months, kinda sad looking...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth History Revised!","review":"This video is a well done (for the era) translation of a late 1960's narrated slide-show presentation to video.

This is the best rock album to come out since the mid '90s - every song is solid. It's rare to find a CD you can listen to all the way through. Usually it takes me 3 or more tries before I really warm up to a new band, but as soon as my friend let me borrow this CD I was in love and had to get my own. Ian's voice is amazing, the sound is full and addictive - so good, you wake up humming these tunes.

Needless to say it isn't. Ian Thornley's vocals are similar and the sound in their bands are almost the same....but they are definitely 2 different players. I like this and \\"So far, So good\\" is one of those songs that you sit down and listen to it and you kinda connect with it. The songs are totally original. Why he went from Big Wreck (his prior band.....and also great material) to Thornley I have no idea....unless it was just a name change or something like that. But still.....this is a good album to listen to. It's not like Creed or Nickleback or any of the new rock bands out there.

The rest of the songs are rather uneventful and mundane. However, those three good songs aren't amazing enough to pick the rest of the album up to a higher level.This band is just missing something. They don't have their own sound or style to their music and it unfortunately makes them just ordinary.Ironically, buying this cd had the opposite effect that I was looking for, in that it increased my anticipation of the release of \\"Potter's Field\\" instead of dulling it."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time!","review":"I am so glad that there is a band that knows how to play some good music!

Always around fascinating personalities from the 50s to 2001, Dick Schaap had the reputation as quite the name dropper. And he acknowledges this participating in the joke early on. This book is an accumulation of anecdotes from his life. His early life and how he gravitates to sports journalism is quite interesting with many great stories of the writers he worked with like Jimmy Breslin and Thomas Wolfe. Then, he spends some time on well-known sports personalities. This was the weakest part of the book for me as he retells stories that further the reputation of already known figures. But the last third of the book turns into classic Dick Schaap with story after story written with his dry wit. I would strongly recommend this book if you have interest in sports or pop culture from the 60s on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of a wonderful man and the life he lived...","review":"Dick Schaap (may he rest in peace)had speant his life writing about teh stories of other people. Finally, he got to sit down and look back on those memories while sharing them with anyone who reads this. Many people have said this book is one giant ego. How can you not like this book if you are a sports fan. Schaap takes you through all of his wonderful memories and tells you all about the people he knew. For half a century he did this, don't rag on him for finally writing his own autobiography. He always put others before himself, and now he is finally sharing a life time of memories in one book.

I've read previous Dick Schaap books and for the most part they've been pretty good, but this one is all about his ego. He writes that a good interviewer will let his subject take over and be the focus of the story. Well, he should've followed his own advice and let the stories of his subjects take over. After all, I don't think anyone really cares if Schaap smoked pot with losers like Bill Lee and Joe Namath and I know I don't care that he has problems staying married since he fools around too much. He sounds a lot like Geraldo Rivera. This book is almost a carbon copy of Geraldo's ego-filled autobiography.

The first few pages invite me into a world of self-discovery and fun. However, once things got going, I just felt like I was reading the diary of an insanely insecure woman living in France. Instead of exploring the mystique of French women and the secrets to their confidence and flair, it goes on incessantly about waxing, matching underwear, dieting, and how thin (elite) French women are. I've been to France and I felt that her obsessing over the \\"perfectness\\" of French women was over-the-top, and all it left me was feeling like I was reading a Cosmo article or some other trashy women's magazine.

This is something every Anglo-Saxon supervisor working in France should take to heart, as 'not taking care of oneself' implies lack of intellectual rigor and self-respect, resulting in an immediate loss of authority.This is why Frith Powell's book is an illuminating -as well as funny and provocative - reading that will be useful to anyone interested in (even remote) contacts with French women. \\"What is the difference between English and French women?\\", asks the author one of her expat friends. His reply: \\"10 kilos!\\" This book discusses in entertaining detail the diet, dressing habits (with inordinate focus on lingerie), marital practices, child rearing etc., in France.

I was thoroughly disappointed by this book and WOULDN't recommend it to anyone. It's simply no fun. Clearly Miss Helena Frith Powell didn't get along with a group of French women and then went on to write this out of revenge. It isn't witty, if anything it's a little heavy handed. If you don't mind a dull read, obvious hatred and exaggeration, then by all means, read this book. Personally, I think it is a little asinine, but some may still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price","review":"You can get this magazine on the magazines website for 18.95 for one year or 24.00 for two years.

There are always several minerals I have never heard of before, and this magazine does a wonderful job of educating its readers. And I LOVE the fact that there is a kids' section! I fell in love with rocks when my Dad came home from a trip to the Badlands of S.D. with several minerals, and a big amethyst crystal.

After purchasing the DVD, I could not have been happier about it. Shannon is very good at demonstrating different modifications for every stretch and exercise. She also kept me very mindful of the position of my body, ensuring that I was always aware of not putting too much pressure on my knees, keeping my back straight, engaging my abs, etc. All of the exercises and stretches were so easy to do, not to mention it was great to work out with an olympian who was going through the same thing I was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Track listing","review":"1.

Edgar winning author, John Morgan Wilson, teams up with society bandleader, Peter Duchin, to create an evocative series set in the world of the high society movers and shakers of 1963. Like Mr. Duchin himself, the protagonist is part of the social set that includes celebs of the time from DiMaggio and the Kennedys--a unique and clever milleau for dramas high and low as murder follows murder, and our protag is pursued as well.I enjoyed the bright and complex characterizations and the intricate, noirish mystery plot as much as the authors' stylish, clear phrasings--in all, a piece of tantalizing music set into novel form.This mystery is a winner. You will be glad to discover this series early."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it. buy it now.","review":"Great book. Well-written, humorous, well-plotted.

Some might say there are too few patterns in book, I disagree. The patterns that are included work and will form the base to tie any other nymph pattern out there. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars, many of the patterns are of Mr. Morris's own design(though they do work). So if traditional patterns are what you are looking for thas may not be it.

It was considered a somewhat revolutionary show for it's time with the use of screen images (for the character that Goulet played who was a photographer).Being a Robert Goulet fan I have always felt that he was extraordinary in \\"The Happy Time\\". Remember he won the Tony for Best Actor in a Musical and he really gave it his all which comes through on the recording.David Wayne and Michael Rupert are delightful and who would have dreamed that the character actor Charles During would be appearing in a musical. Bottomline, this is an intimate musical that they tried to give the Broadway touch to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Musical that just didn't last long","review":"I saw this on Broadway when I was in college.

In fact this song is one of the highlights of the score. There are some nice tunes, such as \\"I Don't Remember You\\", but unfortunately most are warbled by Robert Goulet in the most Las Vegas-y style imaginable.

They take 2-3 DAYS to respond to e-mails and never once returned a phone call (I left at least 5 messages trying to get information.)I ended up returning the item and ordering it from another company.

I love the classic look of the watch itself, its slimness, and the Bulova reputation. However, the expansion band was several links too large for my small wrist, so I had to take it to a watch repair shop to have some removed. The links are large enough so now the watch is a bit too tight, yet would be too loose if I had one of the links reinserted. Nevertheless, the total look is great and suits my purpose well. I bought the watch at a reduced \\"Black Friday\\" price, so am very content and can always switch the band later if necessary. I looked at lots of watches in stores and read all the Amazon reviews before selecting this one and still think I made an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed","review":"This watch looks stunning. As others have stated, the watch is smaller than the pictures would have you believe. I wouldn't call it dainty, but it is about average size for a woman's watch.

I did not receive these pins, and I contacted the seller to ask if it was a mistake or if they weren't supposed to be included with this sale. I did not hear a reply from them and that is disappointing. They do not seem to be concerned with customer service.

They were so populat that all throughout the world these singles were sold and garnered big prices on eBay. Now the US has done the same thing. But you get all the singles in one box, not issued one at a time. There propably is no radio station that would bother playing them. After all, American Rock n Roll is more appreciated in other countries than in their homeland.BMG/Sony did a very nice job with these. They are the correct sleeves, and for once the correct versions of the songs. If you remember Elv1s 30 had four wrong versions on it. These are the right ones.

Anyone who remembers the original, powerful 33rpm recording will be disappointed with this CD. What ruins this CD is the perceptible reduction in the audio, making the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra sound more like front music in Tin Pan Alley. The other problem is the castration of the sound effects. Gone are the roar of big guns from \\"Allies on the March,\\" for example. Also oddly lacking are the fighter aircraft sounds from \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot,\\" the multiple horns and whistles from \\"Ship That Pass,\\" etc.,etc.,etc. Suffice to say those of us who remember the original...please pass on this CD, not worth a bucket of warm spit by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victory at Sea Volumes 1 and 2","review":"What an utter disappointment.

When I recieved it, I realized it was different, but came to appreciate the great sound.

Why can't they just remaster and leave the masters alone! Wish I had volume 3 on record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is THAT bad","review":"Why, why is it so difficult to reissue the originals, in full? The music is wonderful--well, if you're a fan, you know that already--but the sound effects really are laughably bad. And as the sound effects were integral to the atmosphere of several tracks, it really does matter. Now, instead of the jungle sounds that accompanied the original track, you get to listen to some house sparrows chirping and flitting cheerfully from tree to tree, as if you were sailing toy boats in the park instead of slogging through the jungles of New Guinea. If the original sound effects are missing, minimal effort from RCA could have secured at least reasonably realistic substitutes. Instead, we get this pathetic garbage. Really a shame. That second star is only because the original music is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music of Brave Men","review":"I found the score moving and nostalgic evoking memories of allied heroism.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Pop Rock album out right now","review":"I have to say i'm not a big latin rock fan or pop for that matter, I like salsa, merengue, reggaeton. but this is an album that I find myself listening to a lot. the production to me is perfect, I know every song down to the last lyric, wich I can say I can do with some of my reggaeton albums, but Juanes music is just so energetic, it gives you that extra spark to get through your day, I fell in love with the video for \\"a dios le pido\\" the lyrics were so honest and the girl on the video is so beutiful that I bought the album not really knowing much about Juanes or the album and I was shocked to how good this album is, I'm actually going to go ahead and buy his new album \\"mi sangre\\" so as an artist he's got everything working for him right now and his work shows the hard work and dedication he puts on every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love","review":"My mom made my listen to Juanes; there's a song on this album that reminded her of ska. So I said allright mom, expecting to hate it. But, I was rather astonished at how wonderful the album was; what a wonderful voice, awesome lyrics and great music. I have to say that I'm very happy for people like Juanes, Shakira and Carlos Vives who are drawing a great deal of attention to my wonderful country. They are a definite honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as Fijate Bien","review":"Although I enjoyed a lot of cuts on this cd, I have to say Fijate bien still is magical for me. It seem like un Dia normal is trying to hard to imitate some of the magic and power that Fijate bien had.Some beats are almost imitated in this cd, and it is more lovey dovey than the other one. I really believed in Juanes' messages from his first cd, but this one seems more like pop and less controversial let's say.Some tunes are really great like A dios le pido, very catchy and mala gente."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed something 5 times","review":"I picked this 2 disc set up and have tried to listen to it on several different occasions and it is tremendously boring.

Now.By far the best prog CD EVER MADE. A little dark and intense, with muddy, burping, evil frog noises. But I like evil frog noises. Like in \\"In Too Deep\\" on the first disk. Sounds great. Tribe and Trance is like pouring chocolate syrup into your brain. Digger's own Flanker is marvelous, and the Baggio Track here is intriguing. The low point of the first disk, \\"Music Saved my Life,\\" stinks, what can I say. Skip over it.Angry Skies is one of the best trance tracks ever, ever, ever sung by a chorus of evil burping frogs. Worth the braincells you lose listening to it. Although it really should be called Angry Frogs. The Breeder track is stellar as always.BUY THIS CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compilation...","review":"The opening song \\"Cups\\" by the Salt Lake City Orchestra was one of the first songs I downloaded on my ipod. It is such a great mix! I just love it!Oh yeah... and the rest of the CDs aren't bad either... ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD","review":"I'm going to keep this simple: I could go on and on about how smooth the mixing is, about how flawless the track selections are, even about how I listened to the first disk for 3 days straight before I could unhook myself from it long enough to listen to the second one. The plain fact is this is probably the best house/trance CD I've ever heard. If you stole it from me a million times I'd buy it a million and one times. It represents the best of deep-house/non-epic trance and if you like 4/4 beats you should do yourself a favor and buy it right now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellow Trance","review":"For those of you who are searching for ripping sounds, this is not the CD. Although Digweed does a good job at selecting the tunes and mixing them, this CD does not have that 'housy' beat many of us tend to find in other Global Underground CDs, like in the Nick Warren collection. This is a good CD to play while you are hosting a few guests for some drinks-and that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digweed is the master of control...","review":"If you've seen the movie Groove you get a taste of this. He's one of those rare DJs that just knows what moves people. He'll keep the music spinning just long enough, he'll dangle that carrot and drop the bomb at the precise moment that sends you into a bit of a frenzy.Of all his sets, this one is probably the best example of that. He just knows. It starts out with a pretty straight ahead beat that builds and builds so subtly you don't even notice until you're absorbed into it.It's not as dark as his Los Angeles set or as diverse as his Sydney set but this one is perhaps his most consistent effort. It'll put a tweak on whatever it is you're doing when this is playing. You'll either lose yourself in the task at hand or just lose yourself...It's worth it for his placement of the Baguio Track alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"This mix is flawless. I can't imagine any other mix being better than this. I have Foundations, Stark Raving Mad, Bedrock (which is also hard to beat) and Renaissance Transitions, and this tops them all. The uniqueness with which Digweed operates is amazing. It even has Heaven Scent on the second disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hong Kong...","review":"This G-U set is proabably one of the top 5 that will ever be released. The beggining of cd-1 is my favorite starting track of any album. CD-2 is very appealing, I found non electronic people dig it easily. I agree with them CD-2 Is Flawless the whole way through. I recommend that anyone who can purchase this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read for everyone","review":"This historical fiction novel was an excellent book. I am not a history buff - but I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I even learned some things about our Country's fight for independence. The story is based during the Revolutionary War. The characters were very well developed and interesting. It is not too factual while also not being too fictional.All I can say is -- it kept me reading! A must read for anyone who enjoys a good story. Especially those readers who wouldn't normally read anything historical. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriots cause","review":"\\"Patriots Cause\\" is a wonderful historical fiction novel of the times during the American Revolution Era. It highlights the lives and spirit of the men and women during this time of Independence and Freedom in the forming of a more perfect Union. You follow Emma Geiger from childhood to adult with an unquenable spirit to help the cause at any cost even death. Kathleen A. Goodrich weaves her characters through the events of this period using actual battles and locations as an artist with a paint brush. The story continues to move and elevates the reader showing the reader the true spirit needed at this time in American's history to win the battle for Independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapoined","review":"I was really dissapointed with this book. After reading 118 pages out of 300+, and browsing over the rest, I decided not to waste my time with this book anymore. Most of the time, the author doesn't talk about the markets, trading systems, or mental strategies to win in Wall Street. He talks about word definitions, stories when he was a kid (not related to the markets), abstract philosophy, what separate us from the animals (how is this related to the title of the book?), repeats a lot of his stories 2 or 3 times... in summary... a book that has been mis-titled. Don't buy this book without doing research on it first. I spent $50 on it and I am debating if donating it to the library or trashing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video!","review":"I'm so happy that someone put all the information I need to know about working in the health care field in one place! Seeing real people working on the job and hearing them talk about the pros and cons of their work was really helpful. The salary and education required at the end was also really helpful - and seemed very realistic and accurate. It's so much more interesting that reading a book or surfing for hours trying the find the information. This video really gave me an idea of what it would be like to work in health care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap stock for sure","review":"You get what you pay for....this is not a quality stock.

CONS:the 8-10\\" upper part that snaps down onto the top of the gun stock needed thicker molded 'snap-tabs'...the first gun stock I ordered already had 2 of these tabs broken off before I even got it out of the package, and other places aren't staying firmly snapped together and keeps sepating even where there are still tabs on it.The second stock they sent had all ytabs their but still didn't fully keep the the upper part from sepating from the lower part."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice up-do","review":"I was very excited to get this item... i have had my model 70 marlin 22 a long time and this was a great make-over for a great rifle. my wife said \\"ooooh, that looks dangerous.\\" when she saw it. nice directions, pretty easy to accomplish... i wish if gave guidance on the snug fit and techniques for getting the trigger asembly to fit in the well. also, if you have a semi-auto clip-fed, you definatley will need to drill... i used a zip-drill with a dremmel to achieve success, but you could use a drill bit and then a metal-cutting jig saw... it doesnt need to be pretty as the magazine well plate covers the rough edges you will create (it does have a guide... make sure you cut out ALL of the area or the magazine catch wont work after assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"ati Marlin stock","review":"Its an okay product.

No real issues there. Put it back together, tighten down the trigger guard and we're done. Except the trigger doesn't work. A quick look at the trigger guard and it's broken. And I took particular care when I tightened it because it's plastic. No real crack - the plastic just sort of \\"mushed\\" apart. Very poor choice of plastic on this model. Called Marlin for a replacement and have been waiting over a month for my part. And the gun will not shoot without the new guard. Nice looking gun infected with a terrible trigger/guard design and horrible customer service. Go buy a Ruger.

During all the cutting and trying to fit it, a spring came loose on the fireing assy. It took me another 30 mins to figure out how to put it back together. The piece that \\"snaps\\" on top of the barrel does just that. It does'nt quite fit properly and I feel that over time it will fall off so I am going to have to figure out a way to make it stay more permenant. That said, once it's on the rifle looks real cool.

Overall I found the book to be slow-paced and lacking interest. Although it is a nice historical fiction of mid-twentieth-century Britain I did not find it to be particularly interesting and would not recommend it to anyone that I know.The author's strongest ability was her ability to describe British class structure but her weakest was probably the pace of the plot line.

I am also writing a letter to the publisher of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book is very poorly written and has a excessive typos and errors, especially in the answer section in the back - it's come to the point where if I get a different answer from the back of the book I usually assume it is the author who is wrong. It explains the concepts poorly, often over complicating them or leaving out vital pieces of information, or telling you about them a page after you really needed the information. It is not organized logically - we've ended up jumping around to different chapters to make it flow logically. Overall I'm not satisfied with this book on any level - I would have fired the person giving the go-ahead to print and distribute it if I'd been the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning book for working with chakras","review":"Having a slightly more than beginners knowledge of the chakras, I found this book to be a great introduction to the charkas. To me, it seemed as though he was writing to a female audience. This book is also good for pagans or non-pagans. Pond goes through all of the chakras and gives some meditations at the end. I found the chapters on the sixth and particularly the seventh chakras to be a bit confusing but perhaps that is the point - that they are hard to commit to paper.The only criticism I have is that I wish there were more meditations. Other than that, I recommend purchasing for beginner / intermediate students"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books ive ever read!","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read and is the best book on chakras ive read!

Mr. London needs to understand that the adoptive parents ARE the REAL mom and dad.

I got back from my deployment and in my excitement, mistook the Stained: Tainted DVD as that product.This DVD is a huge letdown in every way. No music from the band, shady combinations of home video quality and black & white photography, cheesy interviewers with Springfield DJs who's half-sister's, brother's, nephew's cousin used to deliver Chinese take-out to the band, etc.My ONLY consolation for my fellow STAIND fans out there is the comfort of knowing that STAIND is soon to release THEIR official 2-disc DVD set very soon.

It does not talk about the band much at all. This is more of a how to video for aspiring musicians using Staind as a referrence, and poorly at that. They spend time interviewing people, in which only two of them have ever met the band. They actually put a guy on there that tells about the first time he saw the band and it was on MTV, the video for \\"Outside\\", which most of you know was just this past spring. There is no music or performance footage of the band. The background music is terribly cheesy, and the whole thing is just a waste of hard earned money.

Please do not buy this. I lost ...money on this... and gained nothing from it what-so-ever.I was totally looking forward to watching a wonderful and informative dvd... but this was quite the opposite.

The chainsaw worked properly for the first several cuts. However, once the chain needed to be tightened, I realized that this chainsaw is junk. To tighten the chain, you must screw the suspension screw, which is of poor quality. I had trouble with this, so I decided to just remove the two wing nuts and manually tighten it. BIG MISTAKE. To get the cheap plastic cover back on is almost impossible! I couldn't get suspension screw to realign properly. Also mentioned below, the oil factor. The thing leaks oil like the Exxon Valdez!

On the Oregan box it says it is a 16 inch by 40cm. That Oregan S56 fits the saw perfectly and must be pretty common because they had a lot of them in stock. Also the Oregan S56 box says it is for Remington saws. $20 with tax at Lowes here in Indiana.Yes, it's like many of the reviews have said, on my saw, the oiler leaks when setting and does not feed enough \\"bar\\" oil.

As the British East India Company started to worry about Russian incursions into Central Asia, the British became involved in the politics of Sind, the Punjab, and Afghanistan. Thus started the Great Game between Russian and British interests in Central Asia. The First Afghan War was the result of this competition. The British decided to foist a deposed Afgan Shah onto the country and depose Shah Mohammed Dost. The first third of the book details the lead up to the war and the politics. The second third details the British occupation of Afghanistan and last third detail the death of the Kabul occupation army as it retreats through the Khyber. Only one man returned from this occupation army.This is a good read, and something to remember with our current situation in Afghanistan. The British were trying to install a pro-British government in Kabul during this war. It is a wonder how history repeats itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"First, let me say I am a huge Saxon fan. In fact, Saxon was the first heavy metal band I ever saw in concert way back in 1985. But as much as I anjoy their music, this album was a major let down. Biff Byford's trademark vocals are obscured behind a wall of guitars that offer little to challenge the ear. If that isn't bad enough, there isn't a single song that makes you want to sing along or offers a memorable hook like Saxon's earlier works. Their previous effort, Unleash the Beast, is a far better offering. I am a Saxon fan, but someone has to tell it like it is. The boys don't deliver on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same and not so good by the way!","review":"I'm a huge Saxon fan, but I must say this album, sandwiched between \\"Unleash the Beast\\" (1997) and \\"Killing Ground\\" (2001) will add nothing to your collection. It's clearly the weakest Saxon album in recent years. It has \\"formula\\" written all over it, but without the magic feel of Saxon, that's responsibility of Biff great vocals and Paul Quinn's simple and creative guitar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the Saxon I know","review":"Before this one Saxon released \\"Unleash the beast\\", their best album in years. Then came this one: \\"Metalhead\\" - a record that lack everything \\"Unleash the beast\\" had. The material is weak with the exception of two songs (\\"Conquistador\\" and \\"What goes around\\"), and it seems to me that Saxon were trying to update their music without any success at all. Maybe this album deserve 1 1/2 star but to be frank - two good songs aren't enough.\\"Metalhead\\" is not a good starting point to explore this great band that have not only been a huge inspiration to heavy metal, but also managed to stay alive through thick and thin. Thankfully Saxon returned after this musical failure with the much better and more traditional sounding \\"Killing ground\\". If you want Saxon at their best you should get \\"Strong arm of the law\\", \\"Denim and leather\\" and \\"Unleash the beast\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marc Shapiro's book on Mariah","review":"This is a good, well-written current book on Mariah. it has good pics, and its fun to read.

And in pole saw mode, I was able to prune the higher up branches of my two apple trees without having to climb a ladder. The only drawback I've run into is the cord does come undone from the pole occasionally if you get carried away on a job and forget to mind where you are in relation to the electrical outlet - and cord length.

It is a bit cumbersome when fully extended. Not because of the weight, but where the weight is (all at the top). The only issue is the oiler. The cap is also the \\"pump\\". The rubber bulb does not stay in place well. It wants to fall off and needs to be repositioned after a few uses. The pumping action is poor and its difficult to keep the chain properly lubed.

They went so far below that level with this pole saw that you will spend more time taking it apart and fixing it than you will cutting with it. Basically it is a piece of junk.

I replaced the batteries, but the display is now so faint it cannot be read. I only used it maybe 20 times.The manufacture placed information tags - not removable - on the bottom so if the scale is hung up, instead of a nice, modern silver-finish, you see the tags and it is not attractive.The scale shuts off very quickly, so when you are packing and weighing multiple items, the scale has to be turned on every time - and it takes a few seconds to warm up.The material is light weight plastic.

I was looking for a scale that would count the calories and other nutritional facts of my food. Unfortunately, this scale is strictly a scale in the sense of weighing the food. I'm sure it is a very good scale, but I really cannot comment on it's functionality. I can only clear up what the description does not: and that is, if you are looking for a scale to give you nutritional facts, this is not the scale for you. I will say it is small and compact and would not be obtrusive on any kitchen counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find!","review":"I bought this scale last month. It's a great item.

I bought one at the kitchen store and immediately took it back, it wasn't worth the $30.00 I paid for it. After searching and researching I found this one. I paid a few dollars less, plus shipping, but it was worth every penny.

In short, I didn't like it at all. So, I was very skeptical about picking this sequel up. However, \\"Freedom's Gate\\" had me hooked and I pledged to give this one a try. I am so glad I did! Where \\"Turning the Storm\\" was frenetic and unfocussed, I found \\"Freedom's Apprentice\\" to be a well-considered, carefully produced story. Unlike Kritzer's previous sequel, this one had a direct goal in mind, the freeing of the five slaves Lauria had previously tracked down, and it also allowed for a lot of variation in scene and character development without seeming lost and confused. As a writer matures in experience, I am convinced her work becomes fuller and more matured, as well. This is definitely the case here.

Time after time, Blumin reiterates points that had been exhausted in previous chapters of his book. The research Blumin did for this book was extensive, but failed to capture the reader's attention. In fact, nothing in this book was written for the reader. It is full of boring diatribes that leave one feeling worse-off for reading. I had fully expected to be challenged and informed by this book, considering the author. Unfortunately, I was left with the understanding that Blumin just really likes to publish books.

Gene Tierney shines as the woman who's far too good for him. (Or any man, for that matter.) However, Charles Coburn steals the show as the cantankerous grandfather. The supporting cast is legendary, and of course, outstanding.Ernst Lubitsch made what was in 1943 a risque film, but in 2005 is a charming one. This is a film that when we watch it today it literally reeks of charm. That's the only way to describe it.The conversation between the two critics is fascinating.

I don't think a good director could have given the story any charm. It is neither a comedy nor a drama. They try to surround the main couple with outlandish couples and character actors to make the story more quirky or charming but it doesn't work and it a total waste of time.

I watched it with my girlfriend (who loved it) and I found it very charming. I was a big fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Jason Segel did a great job yet again, writing a romantic comedy that is believable and funniest when portraying awkward and true to life situations. Also, this movie has a great supporting cast, Alison Brie (Community) and Chris Pratt (Moneyball) do a great job of taking stage when Jason Segel and Emily Blunt aren't the center of attention. My only complaint is that Kevin Hart was way under used in this movie, but I like that he was in it at all which was a surprise to me since they failed to mention him in any commercials they played for this movie.

The main thing is I got to spew about it. The story is boy meets girl, falls in love, asks girl to marry him, she agrees but has to move to Michigan from San Francisco for school. They move, they stifle each other, fight, break up. He moves back to San Fran opens a taco truck is a huge success has a dumb girlfriend who is too young for him and she moves in with her professor.

They have lots of good reasons for postponing their wedding, everything from moving, to injury and even a breakup. This is a painfully long, slow and dull movie. It has witty moments, but nothing that feels laugh out loud funny moments. More like amusing. The two main characters are to normal and or bland to be all that captivating for a romantic comedy that is longer than 2 hours. Thankfully they have a cast of quirky fun characters that make them look even blander.Please pass on this movie, you feel every minute of the 2+ hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"I had high hopes for this film, but was very disappointed.

Yes, it was that memorable. No, I have a college-surviving level memory.

All the aforementioned - formula studio script hooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Has a Few Belly Laughs\\"","review":"This film is much too cutesy, improbable and slow to develope.

He already expressed agnostic leanings, and I thought this book would help clarify the issues. The thesis of this book is that the Judeo-Christian God is part of a mythological tradition and people believe in God for nonrational reasons. My son was disappointed that the book did not effectively explain why really smart people believe in God. The problem with the book is that it does not present alternate conceptions of God (besides the old man in the sky conception), so the book is an example of the straw man fallacy. Another problem with the book is that it assumes a very simplistic view of belief and knowledge. The book raises the right issues, but it is too superficial even for children. I would recommend it only if presented with another book that scratches the surface more deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want your child to have an open mind.","review":"Nevertheless, your child might decide on a certain path, one taken by her friends, etc. In the long run, it is good to give them this exposure at an early age.

After all, for immediate neighbors we have: Hindi, Lutheran, Muslim, Catholic, Protestant, Buddist, and Morman to name a few.

However, I'm uncomfortable with the harsh way these ideas are presented for children (as if those who hold a belief are bad and that the non-believers are the only clear thinkers). I felt as if I was being sternly lectured on the subject, even though I already agree. I have a 5 year old who has a lot of questions about religion and God and I'm trying not to push my view on her even though we do talk about why I don't believe in God. Anyway, I thought this might be something we could read together and then talk about the different beliefs and reasons people believe, etc. but I think this book is a little too heavy handed, so I'll be shelving it for a while.

Some listeners may find this set less emotionally engaging than others. Personally, my favorite set is the Quartetto Italiano's on Philips, which keeps me from giving this set five stars: the QI plays with more sympathy and feeling, I think, than Tokyo. And any number of comparisons are possible. But if perfection is what you are looking for (and some days, we want polish more than we want elusive emotional qualities) this is perhaps the recording of the late quartets you will want. Tokyo's precision is sometimes breathtaking, and nowhere more so than in the opening of the Grosse Fuge (here played in its original position, as the final movement of the Quartett Op 130; don't worry, the later ending is there also)."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"i really liked this singke it was fantastic. mauro picotto is the best d.j around and this single proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God it's Now in Print!","review":"This author was Lousia May Alcott's mentor.

It leaked oil all over. I had to drain the oil reservior after each use. Keeping the chain tight was impossible. After cutting for about 1 minute, the chain would be so loose I had to stop and fiddle with the thing for 5 minutes. Remington took a chain saw chain and bar, stuck them on some pieces of plastic with an electric motor and called it a chainsaw. I don't usually return items, but I'll make an exception for this POS because it simply doesn't function. [...]BTW- to the other reviewer: yes I did read the directions, actually.

It's lightweight, easy to use, and does just what I want it to, quickly and efficiently. Think some of the other reviewers should have read the directions-- (What a concept!)--- specifically state that the new chain stretches and tension should be checked after a few cuts: very easy to adjust: loosen 2 nuts, turn a tensioner screw-- it's a snap! I knew nothing about chainsaws before I bought it, so I was a little intimidated-- and assembly was a bit tricky, as the directions were a little out of order, but I'm really glad I took the plunge. A wonderful item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as others","review":"I have had this saw for a few years. I do not use it every week, nor do I use it to cut firewood. But I have 18 trees on my property and it has been a great saw to trim tree limbs, thus the name. I have always bought new chains (Oregon S50) and do not reuse my chains. I don't have the desire to sharpen chains for the amount I use the saw. I did notice that a dull chain stretches and I'm assuming that is normal, and at that point the adjustment screw is at the end of it's range. Perhaps that contributes to the problems other have experienced?As far as adjusting only two tools are required to adjust the saw, a 7/16\\" wrench and a 1/4\\" flat-blade screwdriver.I have had one hybrid Poplar tree die amd I took the entire 20-year old tree down with this little saw. I would never do it again, as it took a LONG, LONG time, but the saw survived. I learned why they make larger saws with larger motors.I hope this helps with your decision. ( P.S.

No need to grease prior to use. The cupcakes baked evenly in them and popped out cleanly even after I let them cool down to almost room temperature. There's even an inner ridge (parallel to and approx. 0.375 inches below the rim) that one may use as a guide on how much mixture to put it so that the baked product does not overflow from the silicone cup.The one drawback? It says on the product description that these are 3-inch cups. If one is inclined to generously round-off upwards they might be considered as 3-inch cups.

I like that I can reuse them over and over and I don't need a cupcake pan to use them. However, the cups do fit in the pan if you want to use it. Some tips: I do spray them with pam before. I love the fill line on each cup which makes it easy to have the same amount for each cupcake. After the cupcakes have cooled I'm able to push the cupcakes right out.

I haven't had any issues with sticking, even having left the baked goods to cool fully in the cups. They're also easy to clean; I don't have a dishwasher, so I wash them all by hand, and all it really takes is a quick scrub and rinse.They're sturdy enough to stand up on a cookie sheet on their own, which means I can probably get rid of my muffin tins. That makes me happy, because muffin tins are a pain to store and clean.I've also found them handy for mise en place, especially for things like spices or kosher salt.I only wish they came in other colors.

They bake fine, but keep in the mind the following MAJOR con -- they are a PAIN PAIN PAIN to clean! Especially the ridges/folds where the baked food gets into. Seriously, I was wasting all kinds of water and time, using scrubber, even toothpick and toothbrush to try to get these spaces clean! And yes, of course, I greased these cups prior to baking, I used the traditional butter and flour-dusting, as well as \\"Pam\\" type cooking sprays, and STILL the resultant mess. Don't waste your money! They work in theory, but NOT in practice! I will probably use these as jello molds, since jello is easier to wash of than cake batter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I received the item there were only 10 cups instead of the 12 in the item discription.

However, these are great for condiments and dips and things. They dont break and they clean easily. These would have gotten one star from me if it wasn't for my dips discovery These are the best homemade dips and salsas that you are serving informally. Whip up a batch of dip, portion it out into the silicone cups, and then just serve or freeze them. You can eat it right from the container without a spoon, or flip the cups inside-out to pop out a serving dip and chips. It even looks a little fancy with the crinkled edges I will never use these for baking but I like how they stack so nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great","review":"We first found silicone baking cups in a department store in a small town in northern Germany, and brought them home.

We'll never waste money (and paper) on paper baking cups again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally threw them out","review":"I really loved these or so I thought. I loved them before I started making cup cakes so much. They store easily, are lightweight, and fit so nicely in my cupboard. I started making all sorts of things in them cause they are perfect portions. I made cupcakes, muffins, meatloaf, quiche, and brownies. Luckily for me I don't have to wash the dishes in my house, because these were a pain to wash. They had to be hand washed, not because they require it but because the dish washer couldn't get into all the little grooves. They had to be soaked to moisten the baked on goodness, and then flipped inside out and scrubbed. The family finally revolted and refused to wash them any more.I tried to use a paper liner with them, but I didn't have much like. They had to move out. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy cups for muffins","review":"I use these to make banana bread muffins for my family. They are handy to use and store. I spray them with PAM and the muffins come out fine. My only complaint is that they discolored a little on the bottom. Not a deal breaker for sure.

If you are very new to Matlab, then the scripts are very helpful. However if you're a novice with some exposure, all of the given scripts could be created with relative ease. I was very disappointed with the section on failure theories. The Max Stress/Strain, Tsia-Hill and Tsai-Wu section was only 5 pages long. It looked much like a copy/paste of a Wikipedia page, only showing the fundamental equations and nothing more. There are no scripts provided for failure analysis either, which would have been more useful then the elementary scripts provided. It can be a useful text, but only if you can get a very cheap copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the TV series","review":"I'm a big Dukes fan and I reckon this is the best Dukes game yet.

This game does not have a a \\"easy\\", \\"normal\\" or \\"hard\\" configuration, so if you don't have exact hand-eye coordination, this game is unplayable.The graphics, characters and horns are great, but the game play should allow for a novice player.1) Still Runnin' - Uncle Jesse has to follow a flat bed truck. For key turns, the truck is off the screen, so you have to guess which way it turned, instead of being able to follow it. A camera control would have fixed this, but you can only look forward or backward, not sideways.2) Bully around - There is one level where Cooter has to drive around destroying bull-dozers within time limits. This game's time modes are drastically unfair. One slight mistake and you have to retry the level. For someone who doesn't care enough to be 100.00% perfect, 95% should do.

You need to exert a lot of pressure against the metal on the first pass so that the edge roller does not arc off of the bend line. Once the crease has been put in the metal, it is almost impossible to correct the bend if it is not where you want it. On the other hand, it beats using a hand seamer to bend the edges.

Not the easist product to use, but beats most of the alternatives, just takes a lot of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative!","review":"I bought this tool 2-3 years ago, unsure of whether I really needed a chainsaw long term. As I have trees on my lot and feed a woodstove, I have found the tool indespensible. However, I am not at all happy with Remington's version of a chainsaw. The positive, and the negative, is simply: this tool is cheap. I liked the fact that it is quiet and emits no pollution at the point of use. The power was always acceptable. The problem comes at the point when you (inevitably) need to adjust the tension in the chain. The tensioner is worthy of a matchbox car, not a power tool. The adjuster travels a plastic track, based on your turning of a thumbscrew. The mechanism bent at first stress, and works no more. Too bad, as the motor and chain are still as good as ever. As they say, the bitterness of low quality lasts longer than the sweetness of a low price. This function could have been more robust. The tool is worth less without it. Spend the extra money to get a real tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"REMINGTON ELECTRIC CHAIN SAW","review":"I RETURNED THIS SAW ON 02/20/2006 VIA UPS.

Used it on a larger piece, making sure it was full of oil (the oil will leak out when it's being stored), and shutting it off every few minutes to keep the electric motor cool. Had to adjust the blade twice. After setting it aside for about fifteen minutes, I found it wouldn't turn on. No problem with electric service, it's the chainsaw. Having it repaired (if parts are even available) would cost more than the price of the chainsaw. It's Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"do you enjoy replacing the chain on your chainsaw every 5 minutes?","review":"then this is the saw for you. The shoddy cheap screw that serves as the chain tensioner arrived bent right out of the box.

The only possible explanation for the quality of this mechanism is malice.If you're looking to try to rack up some hits on youtube with a loose flying chainsaw chain the remington 1635w is the product for you.If you are trying to do what I would consider light work, look elsewhere, or be prepared to finish the job with your teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay extra and get a better Chainsaw","review":"I purchased this chainsaw at a nationally known hardware store and paid more than the price here at Amazon. My problem with this chainsaw began after only a couple times of light use when I cut a few tree branches around my home. The tightening screw for the chain was the first thing to go and became bent and never worked well again. I see in other reviews this is a common problem with this unit. After that the chain started repeatedly falling off as I tried to cut through normal size branches 4 inches to 10 inches. It took more and more time to retighten and adjust the chain, until I just expected it to fall off during each cut. I considered getting a new chain for the saw but decided the problem with this chainsaw is more than just the chain. I recently purchased a new WORX chainsaw and highly recommend it for light use.

The saw had an oil leak from the first use and after two quarts of oil, I have been able to cut only a few pieces of wood.Also, the company has a poor website with no online tips.Again, avoid this saw and find another one.

Seeking to critically reappropriate the Christian realism articulated by Niebuhr, she reinterprets solutions to problems emergent from his theology. She presents feminist Christian realism as an alternative that can reclaim a positive interpretation of divine transcendence and human self-transcendence, while maintaining newer emphases on human boundedness and divine immanence. Theologians and ethicists will find her critical reassessment of the three authors distinctive and her challenging proposal for a \\"positive creative transformation\\" a significant contribution to the development of feminist ethics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only good thing about this book was the pictures.

I have loved Steely Dan's music since they were a band. To pay almost no attention to the song Aja and to the incredible drumming of Steve Gadd on the track was a huge disappointment to me. I am not any richer in my knowledge of this AWESOME piece of work having spent my limited free time watching it. I consider Aja to be The Dan's Magnum Opus and would have really preferred to have more information about the inspiration for the music instead of the technical studio jargon Fagen/Becker employ.

The only thing I don't get is how on earth there was no mention at all of the amazing playing/soloing of Steve Gadd on the title track. Very strange...Non-players might fall asleep (like my wife did) but I personally consider this one in my top 3 DVD's! P.S. If you want GREAT Steely Dan concert DVD, pick up Two Against Nature Jazz-Rock party in Sensuous Surround Sound. DTS 5.1 that sounds INCREDIBLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this Video.","review":"If you are a Dan-Fan you will want this video. This is well documented video explaining the various mixes, behind the scenes looks on the creation of \\"Aja\\". Nice graphics, some neat views of the L.A., N.Y. city skylines and lifestyles, plus a few instrumentals/mixes of the band members playing \\"Peg\\" and \\"Josie\\". A nice relaxing video to come home to after a long day at work. The only place I was able to find this video was on-line, what a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deconstructing the Dan","review":"This is a fascinating documentary about a fascinating band: Steely Dan. A must for Dan fans, this DVD takes apart the dense arrangements of the Dan classic recording Aja. I love the music, and finding out about all the subtle nuances and surprises buried in the arrangements was very interesting. Also included are interviews with the musicians involved, not just Becker and Fagen. If you're a music theory or composition student, or a Steely Dan fan, I recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"How all the pros play the game","review":"Excellent documentary. Becker and Fagen discuss instrumental tracks, let us hear bits of tracks not used, and explain the sounds they wanted. Their discussion is complemented by commentary from session players Chuck Rainey and Bernard Purdie, among others. These dudes are master musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major omission - what about Gadd ???","review":"I have just watched this DVD for the second time. My recent viewing reminded me of the glaringly obvious omission of Steve Gadd. The title track has been cited as one of the greatest recorded drum performances in history. Hearing Steve, Donald and Walter discuss his performance on Aja was my primary motivation for purchasing the DVD. Very disappointing indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Two against nature","review":"Home movie sound and picture quality is good for nostalgia , but not so good for dvd . If you have to have all things steely dan, buy this,if not let this one go.

I was looking for an inexpensive \\"fireplace\\" type video, and thought this fit the bill. Ugh, it's 15 different scenes of garbage. I could shoot a better \\"Atlantic Ocean\\" loop by driving down the shore on a cloudy day. \\"Gulf of Mexico\\" looks like the same beach at a different angle. \\"Sunset\\" is lame, although it's fun to watch in fast forward and see the distracting boats and birds whiz by. All the fish tanks look like someone filmed them in a pet store. \\"Fireworks\\" was entertaining, but too short, as the finale kept happening over and over. The River looks like a still photo that someone animated using the ripple effect. The \\"best\\" one is Psychedelic, sure to induce seizures and/or laughter with it's awful colors and even worse music.

I agree with other reviews that the material could be better, but for the price, it isn't bad. The lace is cute. I don't think that the coat adds much, if anything to the babydoll itself. The coat is just a see-thru short sleeved drape. The underwear is the same see-thru material as the babydoll, but it isn't a thong, which can be good or bad depending on which you prefer. The sizing DOES go by the charts which is a big plus. I made the mistake of ordering an extra large babydoll on another website, thinking that they ran a size small, and it is very loose around the chest. I have to tie it tight in the back to make it fit tighter. This babydoll fit me right in a large. Overall, for the price and value, I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"raunchy!","review":"I love this piece. The size I ordered fitted me well. The coat isn't of much use though.

Hope they last as long as those did."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Portugal to China","review":"I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory.Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rockport sizes not normal","review":"I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven\\"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got one to fit","review":"Quality is excellent, fit is perfect but is two sizes smaller that the boot I normally wear. I went from a 13 to and 11 1/2. Never had this problem with Rockports before. Somehow they are oversized. Had to pay return shipping on two pair before these but was worth it because of price and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Brat","review":"Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score above 700","review":"My previous math score before I used this book was a 690. So I didn't need a book that covered basic methods, instead I needed a more concentrated skills-practice specific to the SATs. Going through most of this workbook increased my score to a 720. I could have done better if I had practiced up until Friday night. But I was pleased and now I am studying at UPENN. Anyhow, good luck to all of you who are preparing to take the SATs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusades","review":"Osprey Books are a must for the modeler and reenactor.

I loved the music and dancing but kept thinking I was missing something. I wasn't. The musical is disjointed but it's music and costumes are absolutely stunning. Unless you can afford front row seats, this dvd brings that right to you. My only complaint was the cutting of the pirate ship scene. It's not my favorite musical, hence the two stars, but, for those who love it, a dvd that's up close is a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic","review":"I've loved this musical ever since I saw it in London.

A good book for anyone that loves Buffy, fairies, and/or both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"Very good. Interesting idea - vamp fairies - and my favorite character, SPIKE, is portrayed accordingly, that is, almost like if he was a member of the Scooby Gang!Spike helps the Scoobies and is treated by them with kindness - Willow and Dawn are sweet to him, Buffy isn't so mean, and even Giles thanks the vampire for his efforts 3 times! Since the novel is set on season 5, it couldn't be different; Spike is already in love with Buffy (the book confirms this fact), and, since he has found out it (on TV), he has been trying to be a better... man.I also liked to see Buffy and the gang having to deal with the \\"little things\\" of life - tooth problems, ant infestation, traffic fines etc - things we usually don't have on the show.And the vampettes - I wish I could see them on television! Those little creatures are fascinating, and their destiny (on the book) although sad, resulted in a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - That basically sums it up. Wow.","review":"Wow.

Once I realized this MERV 8 didn't fit, I looked at my original filter more closely and realized that in fine print it said the actual dimensions are smaller.

I noticed that the device would only stay charged for about an hour before the iPod alerted that it needed to be charged again. I thought this was a bit odd given that when it had been charged by my desktop computer the charge would last much longer. Over the last few weeks I would charge my iPod over night to try to remedy this problem. But even then the iPod would quickly display that the iPod's battery was almost dead. Now when I charge my iPod from my desktop computer the battery does not charge for that long anymore either. I seriously believe that this type of charger has everything to do with it. It was a good thing that the 2nd charger that I purchased was delivered damaged because this charger would have damaged my other iPod.

The dynamic range is awesome on even a lower level hi-fi system and on a 5.1 amp just blows you away.This is a must, not only for PF fans but also as a demo DVD for anyone who loves their hi-fi video reproduction.Thank you PF for releasing this.

The performances are slick and soulless; the remaining three band members go through the motions without much emotion or chemistry, as most of the emotional power and angst that characterized classic Pink Floyd came from the genius of Waters.The over-the-top light show is ridiculous but serves effectively to distract the viewer from the mediocre musical performance.This is a flashy, carefully-produced presentation of Pink Floyd music by three talented guys, but it feels like a stale nostalgia act when stripped of the gravitas, poetry and feeling that Waters brought to the band. These are great songs, no doubt, and it's nice to watch Gilmour lay it down on lead guitar. However at the end of the day it just feels like more spectacle than substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price of admission","review":"Pink Floyd's long awaited DVD release of this 1994 Earl's Court concert from the PULSE tour is certainly worth the money. The audio is suberb,and the light,film, and prop show are vintage 70's Floyd. The DVD technology has been well utilised with excellent extra's including films used during the concert available for seperate viewing. Only drawbacks are lack of interviews(not altogether a surprise, and of course, that by that time Roger Waters was long gone. I'd like to believe there is film in a vault somewhere from the mid-1970's tours, and that we will see that released someday. In the meantime, this is is the best record we have of Pink Floyd(minus Roger), and what it was like when giants like them filled huge arenas and made it work for the fans.

He said it just wasn't played like other versions and it could have been WAY better. The rest of the performances made up for that somewhat.I think we can all agree that when we buy something for one main reason, and that reason turns out to suck, it's a disappointing purchase all around, no matter what the other features are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay with VHS Version","review":"Forgive me...and forgive me David Gilmour. For years he is my hero (speaking as a fellow guitar player) but the audio and video quality is quite bad. I know they had issues with transferring to DVD and I am heart broken.I purchased 2 copies of this concert, excited because I had waited so long to compliment my sister's and my VHS version, and am now too embarrased to send my sister her copy. I am returning both to Amazon and hope they compensate adequately since one copy is opened.Video quality is quite bad, and much of the concert is so blown out with bright white light, that zero detail is retained, (for a good part of the concert!) compared to VHS version. Audio quality will make even the best speakers sound tinny or rumble from bass.David is my hero and I know he was reluctant (and worked hard) to make this on DVD, but I will stick with my VHS version.

Storm came through again with a wonderful design, and I'm not quite sure who edited and mixed this, but a brilliant job on their part.This concert was played in 1994, so this of course means that Roger Waters was replaced by Guy Pratt on bass. Guy is perfect on bass, and his voice works perfectly with the band. I especially like Run Like Hell when David and Guy switch on and off singing.The laser show is unmatched regarding scale and detail, but I wish they would focus on (for example) David's fingers during the comfortably numb solo rather than the laser show. The crowd is as amazing as you'd imagine it to be, and there's no better feeling than the one you get listening to WYWH with everybody singing along.HIGHLY Recommended. Any collection is not complete without this diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must own this DVD","review":"This was broadcast live many years ago.

He never sings Have a Cigar, etc. Every little step Floyd takes is slowed down because of whiney Waters can't get over it.

Gilmour and Waters should just get wasted some night, get over there differences and realize that there music is about their fans.

I cannot foresee or imagine a live concert in the years to come who will match the PULSE concerts. Anyone appreciating PF will have chills from beginning to the end from this dvd. David Gilmours singing skills are ok but not outstanding. But, his guitar skills on PULSE are incredible. The visual effects on Comfortable Numb are superb.

Compared to most Pink Floyd fans, I am a youngen. I am only 20 years old and I never get tired of listening to Pink Floyd, and I never will. I don't think I've ever seen anyone play the guitar like David Gilmour. He is so creative and has so much talent, he boggles my mind even now. This video is absolutely stunning. I liked \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\", but I think Pulse is a more complete video. Before this video goes out of print, like \\"The Wall\\" did, all you Floyd fans out there better go get themselves a copy!

For classic Pink Floyd fans, Pulse is very good. Disc one is a thoughtfully-produced set, opening with \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" followed by an early Syd Barrett track. A solid hour of music. The rendition of Dark Side of the Moon on disc two is nearly identical to the original (although that isn't necessarily important), although it has that vibrant, live energy that David Gilmour seems to command. Finally, the encore featuring \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" fantastic. Roger Waters fans will be thoroughly satisfied despite his absence; there's something in it for every Pink Floyd fan and is a must-listen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lord, people, it was shot in FULLSCREEN so it's the correct way to show it!","review":"So many of these reviewers are complaining that it's not in WS.

This video is so visually stunning it gives me chills even after watching it dozens of times. If you're a Pink Floyd fan you couldn't ask more from David Gilmour and the group as far as entertainment value.

The first soloist was good, a level below all three solos on DSOT, but solid. But your thinking, \\"she was first so we're gonna get better as we go\\". Nope. They're \\"pretty\\", but just not the the journey to the center of our being that you got in DSOT.Disclaimer: If you've never seen DSOT, this won't be a problem for you.

I will never bother buying this stuff let alone re watching it.Completely fridgid production and performance having no energy, soul or mistery.

And now they've missed the Christmas season -- nice work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life after Waters","review":"Pulse proved Pink Floyd had a life after Roger Waters departed. David Gilmour took the lead in two inspiring sets that cover new and old material. Another Brick in the Wall was given more resonance given the patriarchal tone Gilmour had assumed. Not sure where the children's chorus came from, as on these sets, Pink Floyd was backed by three svelte singers. I thought Shine on you Crazy Diamond was the best of the first set, beautifully explored and set the mood for the concert. Learning to Fly was proof positive that Pink Floyd was as solid as ever. The second set took in the Dark Side of the Moon, but somehow rang a little hollow without Waters. The images were what you had come to expect from Pink Floyd. Pulse looks and sounds much better on DVD than it did on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CONCERT IS PRICELESS","review":"When I first got into Pink Floyd all I had ever listened to was the wall, this concert made me see other great works of this legendary band. Pink floyd is in fact one of the best bands of all time, this video proves it. I would do anything to see the pulse concert after watching this video, too bad the tour is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd Fan from Philly","review":"PULSE is an excellent video. I am 22 years old and just got into Floyd about 6 months (and 8 albums) ago. My roomate showed me PULSE and I was hooked. It is an amazing light show with the music sounding precise and excellent. I have to disagree with the person who liked Scott Pages sax playing (Delicate Sound of Thunder) better than Dick Parry. Dick is the man who recorded with Pink Floyd on Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here and I think his playing sounds more like the Floyd I am used to. But to each his/her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody beats Pink Floyd in concert.Absolutely the greatest!!","review":"There is nobody else in\\"rockdom\\" like Pink Floyd.Their live concerts are fantastic and this particular video portrays what a real live concert is really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Pulse Concert","review":"This is one of the best performances for Pink Floyd on dvd I have ever seen.Mason and Gilmour,are in there peak even without Waters.This is a live concert and there is a little more ovations, and crowd participation than I care for,but if I was there ,I'd be doing the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super DVD","review":"The video quality and 5.1 sound rock. Bright colors, looks great on the big screen, and reminds me of the On an Island Gilmour a few months back. Highly recommend for fans or newbies. The extras are way cool, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY...!!!","review":"I followed Pink Floyd on \\"The Division Bell\\" tour through all of their California dates, and those concerts were among the happiest moments in my life. No joking -- Floyd took me on an inrcedible journey. It was an ethereal, almost un-Earthly journey: the moment they opened with \\"Astronomy Domine\\"; ended the first half with the incredible inflateable pigs in \\"One Of These Days\\"; began the second half with a visual trip through space with \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\"; and...well, basically everything else. I'm not a big fan of concert DVDs, but this will be a must-have. No doubt, this will leave me wanting to see it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilmour (Still) Reigns Supreme","review":"This is some of the best footage you'll find of a live concert. The camera angles and video editing are great and the lighting is superb. No dark shadows or slow-motion strobes as you'll find in so many other concert videos which consider only the live audience's perspective. The close-ups of Gilmour on his Strat playing \\"Time\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life\\" are alone worth the price of the video. As an amateur guitarist and long-time Floyd fan, I've always argued that when considering both creativity and dexterity on the six string, Gilmour leaves all others in the dust. If you're a fan of The Pink Floyd or just appreciate great guitar, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert Video","review":"Loved it, but not as much as Delicate Sound of Thunder(DSoT). Nothing against the band, but DSoT was just so much better produced as a video. All in all, Pulse was quite enjoyable, and had I not seen DSoT I would have rated this as a five. IMHO of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough already!","review":"I'm the biggest PF fan I know. Maybe I can purchase and watch this DVD before I attend \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\".

Brings back fond memories of the few times I was lucky enough to see them play. The show really was out of this world.It's a shame that the session bassist \\"Guy Pratt\\" completely misses the sense of Pink Floyd's bass sound and makes many of the songs sound more like Level 42. Jesus - stop slapping the damn thing man! It's just awful! One star deducted for that!Also - it's a real shame it's in 4:3 format or HD - I guess they didn't think widescreen was going to catch on in 1995 when it was filmed. Each set must have cost millions... you'd think they might have had the sense to use real film instead of 'high quality' video! Bad move!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only band member who gets any kind of footage is Gilmour. There are fleeting glimpses of others, but the editing is edgy and rather amateurish. I'm sure the light show was most spectacular at the event, but hours of footage of crowds wandering about and the band in the far distance soon becomes boring. Sound is good, but extras and of little value."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Pink Floyd..nuff said","review":"I won't bother to review the disc since the concert has been known for a long time as amazing. It brings back great memories of seeing that tour twice (including the ONLY indoor performace in the U.S. at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse). The sound is phenomenal. Is it just me or are the some of the cutaway shots grainier than the VHS? Must be one of the \\"technical difficulties\\" Gilmour was referring to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello R.Gearing","review":"There is a Pulse CD with two concerts from the 80s already out and also a Laser Disc of some concerts.

The video production values suffer a bit as a result of coming from an analog source with a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the audio quality is second to none.The Floyd mounted a light show like no other band in rock's recent memory, and what you see on screen during the encore track, \\"Comfortably Numb\\", surpasses just about all the chemically-induced psychedelic visions this writer experienced some decades ago.Hey, Boomer parents: Buy this set as a gift for your rap-infested, Beyonce-addicted teenagers, and show them how REAL musicians put on a live show, back in the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd always in a higher level!!!","review":"Pulse is the best live music video ever made!!The sound is outstanding!The image is awesome!Pink Floyd Played in magnificent way.I just change this: I'd rather add a few more songs.Fantastic DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd--Pulse","review":"Pink Floyd - PulseProbably the most complete Pink Floyd DVD I have ever viewed!

The shortcomings of the video quality have been noted, but I don't think they take away from the incredible effect of the lights, lasers, projection etc. The musicianship is top notch, as would be expected from the Floyd.The only critical comment I'd make is that I found the backup singers a bit distracting or too much out in front on some songs. There were moments when I was wanting to watch what the band was doing (i.e. playing) and then they'd cut to the backup singers or pop the projection footage in. I've always found that irritating in concert videos, although this wasn't anywhere near as bad as what Yes did with their 90125 concert video. I still think whoever put that one together should be strapped to a chair and made to listen to Florence Foster King records for a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"PINK FLOYD at their best (even without Roger Waters). EXCELLENT!","review":"I surely hope they don't keep pushing the date back to release this double DVD. There shouldn't be any legal tape involved because the VHS is still available and this is just the DVD version, so all legal red tape should have been resolved with the release of the VHS. I guess I'll just have to watch the PULSE concert on VHS until the DVD comes out, WHENEVER that will be. I don't know if this is going to be an authentic DVD, if someone is playing a joke, or if EMI is trying to guage how many people would buy it by pre-ordering it. Maybe not enough people have ordered it yet and they're waiting for more people to pre-order.

I like the orchestrated versions of the player piano pieces much more than the originals, they're more emotional, have greater dynamics, are less robotic (they swing at times) and the variety of timbres adds a lot to the listening experience. What were originally studies are now fully realized pieces. Perhaps not groundbreaking in the way the originals were, but so what. The beauty of Nancarrows' melodic and sometimes humorous music is really brought out by the orchestration. Very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly worthless","review":"I couldn't get into this CD. I've heard some of Nancarrow's piano pieces and found them interesting, but when taken to a larger scale with an orchestra or ensemble, it sounds formless, senseless, and lazy.

It reminded me of the movie \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\" where there is a lot of oriental-flavored mysticism, but virtually no effort at explanation (beyond the mumbo-jumbo level). Certainly, part of the attraction of this work is that very little is explained (to the protagonist or the reader), but at some point you get a little tired of the parade of bizarre and improbable events. At least I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Intersects the Phenomenal","review":"As luck, or fate, would have it, I moved to New York in 1996 and lived at the intersection of Waverly and Waverly. Or as close as one could get to it. It was indeed charmed. Magical. This book makes the blood sing and the senses soar. It is not about reality. Reality tells me that the Empire State Building doesn't glow green and white all the time. But when I moved into my apartment, I had an uncanny 270 degree view. I saw those colors and as I read those pages, the experience came alive. This book provided me with the absolute connection to that magical time in my life and provided me with a happy glimpse, albeit with a diaphanous and magical viewpoint, and gave me reason to believe that indeed this Dragon Point existed. Read with open mind, heart and above all, enjoy the phenomenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Fantasy Ride Thru NYC & The Galaxy!!","review":"If you're looking for a wild ride of time/space/dimension travel, this ones hard to beat!

Give this whrlwind adventure through magical and fantastical Gotham (and lots of the universe), and you'll have a thrill-filled ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"I read this book as there are currently over 25 reviews giving it 4 or 5 stars. However, I'm sorry, I didn't like it at all. I usually enjoy fantasy and mysticism adventures if they are bound by some parameters. But the number of times the word \\"suddenly\\" is used gives some indication of the meandering, rambling plot. Characters disappeared, then reappeared, and were telepathic and telekinetic but weren't who they appeared to be but then died, but were invisible...it really became tiresome. There was something in this novel that every other reviewer got that I unfortunately missed, but personally I thought that the last couple of chapters were simple terrible. Everything that I expected to happen happened. It is somewhat ironic that the actual plot and the character development were woefully lacking in imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, interesting and romantic, but somehow a bit lacking","review":"i enjoyed _veronica_ for the most part, but found the author's style a little too-straightforward. no offense to those who appreciate his style, but for me it was a little too... college essay format. i don't know. but! i thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and ideas he presented; certainly his in-depth look at the mystical things of not only NYC, but the world, made me think twice. without a doubt, anyone from or familiar with NYC will enjoy the book more than someone who is not; without having a grasp of not only the locations he speaks of, but the overall atmosphere of downtown NYC, you'll lose a little bit.overall, a nice summer read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will Nicholas Christopher write a new one?","review":"I simply adored this book. What a wonderful blend of mystery, fantasy and fun. While I read this book some time ago - I recommend it often and keep checking to see if the author has written another book (non-poems that is).I highly recommend this book if you are looking to have some fun and don't care about living in reality. Also a great read for a New Yorker like me - it gives you a whole new perspective on NYC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manhattan Noir with a Dose of Fantasy","review":"This is a strange beast - is it a romantic adventure, fantasy, thriller, mystery? It's actually all of the above deftly written by Christopher.

Check it out and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Ugh....I don't know why all of the other reviewers thought this was a great book! There was no character development and all of the magical tricks/mystical pieces of the story became ridiculous. The plot was pretty shallow, I knew exactly what was going to happen - and I didn't care! The intial premise was very cool and had the potential to be very interesting and exciting but it was not lived out successfully. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and tiresome","review":"\\"Veronica\\" is an interesting story if you enjoy fantasy, but throughout I found myself reading through descriptions of symbols and colorful scenes only to come to the conclusion of a chapter and find what happened was exactly what I expected. The narrator gets dragged into Veronica's life, and is compelled to follow every direction she and her cohorts give him. His love for Veronica, which is supposed to be the reason he doesn't resent this compulsion, never seemed believable, so his gullibility and Veronica's domination of him were annoying rather than understandable.This book is unique, and not a complete waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it. Some surprises, as well as a stronger love story, would have improved it greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in St. Louis","review":"I am absolutely shocked that people loved this book. Our book club read this book last month and not one person had anything good to say about it. Most members couldn't even finish it. What an absurd waste of time. Gratuitous symbolism, ridiculous characters, a story that went nowhere. A waste of some perfectly good trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am somewhat of a biased person, because the author of this book taught me a creative writing course at NYU, but I found this book to be extremely dull and trite. It deals with fantasy, myth, magic, and so on, but not nearly as well Tolikien or C.S. Lewis (and I am not even a fan of them). However, if you like surreality to the point that it diverges from any conception of 'reality' (whatever that means) then perhaps you will like this exploration into the world of myth and fantasy.

The string of orange moons are electric lights! Yes?

Well not so with this fantastic series about the de Montforte brothers! So far..they have ALL been keepers! \\"The Defiant One\\" was about Andrew..whom I have to tell you thus far is my personal favorite. I absolutely loved watching him and Celsiana come together. Now, some may say that this story was just a bit too unbelievable..and perhaps it was, but you know...its fiction..and thats the fun of it!...if you havent already read this series I wholeheartedly urge you to..I think youll be glad that you did..I CANNOT WAIT to now read Luciens story..I have a feeling that he is going to blow all of the other brothers out of the water!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love her books.","review":"I enjoy historical fiction.

Very good..If you read one you have to read the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third in the DeMontforte brothers series","review":"I liked this book very much, it was great, but I would not call it excellent. I liked that Andrew as a visionary, and I was able to interpret what most of his visions were, all except 1 or 2. Celsie was great, another strong female. I like the way all the females in this series compliment the males. Everyone is well matched up.On the 1-10 scale, I'd probably give it a 9.7 or so.Not exccllent, but very good. As with the other books in the series, definitely worth the time to read and a very nice change from regency romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Defiant One","review":"This is the 2nd De Monteforte book that I have read and I can say that I enjoyed it as much as BooK 1 .

Well I feel that this book carries it own. There is no need to read the others if you don't want to because this book tells a little about the other two.But I sugjest you do anyways because they are excellent. Ms. Harmon is an excellent writer. I have Read the wild on and the beloved one and they are both great books First the wild Lord Gareth and Juliet then the beloved Lord Charles and Amy(both women are americans) and now the defiant Lord Andrew and Lady Chelesana. it was funny from the first moment and romantic to the last.

She is an excellent writer and I will enjoy reading her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defiant One?","review":"I have to say this book disappointed me somewhat. I guess I just expected more. I found it a little hard to fall for the dark hero, Lord Andrew. Maybe I just like my heros to be a little less brooding and a little more charming. True, Celsiana livens things up a bit, but again, it was hard for me to sympathise with her. I just couldn't seem to get involved in their lives and the plot was just a little much for me to believe. I did however enjoy the scenes with Lucien, Andrew's cunning and very manipulating brother! I'd very much like to read more about him.THE DEFIANT ONE is the 3rd book in the de Montforte series, but of course, I didn't realize that when I started reading. As I haven't read the first 2 books, THE WILD ONE and THE BELOVED ONE, perhaps that would make all the difference. As it stands right now, I can't say that this is my favorate book by Danelle Harmon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit Earlier Books","review":"I read this story because I liked the other 2 books despite the poor background research by the writer. This plot was just plain stupid. Visions? Geez, why not just give him a drug habit? That would have been far more reasonable. In addition, the writer can't even follow a simple time line. While she goes through the effort to describe the deplorable road conditions of the late 1700s, the travel by her characters rarely fit this reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Available on Cloud Reader","review":"After reading the first two books between my Kindle and Cloud Reader I downloaded the third.

I don't understand why all of this authors other books are available to read except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC FOR THE SENSES","review":"I first heard this recording on the radio, a few years back, then decided to buy the CD. The overall offect is quite pleasing - hypnotic at times - and Bernstein's orchestra, the NY Philharmonic, is captured in great form under Temirkanov. The playing is also first rate, the violin solo by Glenn Dicterow is well executed. I found the orchestral contrasts between soft and loud passages to be exaggerated and in general, the various sections lacking in continuity of purpose. Music for the senses, but also music that has to make sense, I mean musically. Phrasing is the key - as in the New World Symphony or the Symphonie fantastique. This is lovely, but the whole thing seems to lack in perspective. The RUSSIAN EASTER OVERTURE is very well done, great sound, à la Russe."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Galway's Flute Sings","review":"Galway doesn't just play the flute, he makes it sing. He plays all the notes and gives them a voice, much as a singer would do. The results touch the soul as only a voice can do. Familiar tunes take on a whole new character. I listen to Galway's Greatest Hits in my car. It makes any trip more pleasant and keeps me clam yet alert."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new-comer and sold","review":"I admit that I'm \\"new\\" to James Galway. Its amazing I've never heard him play before. I'm a devoted listener of Chris Norman's flute music and a die-hard Broadway fanatic. I like how Galway floats back and forth between music of a more \\"classical\\" nature and music of a more \\"popular\\" nature. This has quickly become one of my sets of music listened to during my nightly \\"unwind' time. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring textbooks on the planet","review":"The authors (Lee Galda, et al) of this textbook took a truly exciting and important subject, which I am extremely interested in, and produced the most tedious, lackluster, monotonous, yet overly expensive volume I have ever been REQUIRED to purchase. They should be ashamed for having made sharing the love of reading with children such a mind-numbing experience for future educators. Indeed, there are not enough synonyms in the English language to convey how dull this book is.

I got the replacement in August 05; the battery is now dead. Have spent an inordinate time on the phone (no toll free support at Palm - hell, no support for that matter!), to be told that replacing the battery (despite the unit they sent me being less than 4 months old and an obvious dud) would cost $200 plus handling.

Then, after approx one week, it failed to recognize any signal from the wireless router.

Amazon graciously accepted to return it and even paid the shipping cost for the return when I found that the PDA wouldn't even charge - the green light at the top that indicates it is charging never came on even once. I talked to Palm support first and they suggested I should send this in for repair and that if they could not repair it they would send me a refurbished product. A refurbished product in exchange for a brand new never-used one? I decided to return it and get a replacement from Amazon.However, the replacement has the same problem. Of course, I could ask Amazon for a replacement once more bbut now I am sick of this product. It also leaves me wondering about its reliability.

It seldom works with my home network. It can be working fine one minute and no connection the next. It frequently says there is no signal and no available network even though it is in the same room as my Netgear wireless router. The customer support from Palm leaves MUCH to be desired. Their people can barely speak English (apparently a Call Center in India) and do not acknowledge that the connectivity issue is very common. They had me send in my Tungsten C that was less than 90 days old and they sent me a refurbished one. It had the EXACT same problem right out of the package.

Right now with my whole contact database from work, 4 games, a few other apps I'm using a grand total of 5.4Megs. If you do decide to buy this unit the first app you need to get is Net Chaser. It a WiFi scanner to look for networks. I am amazed how many networks there are out there and they are unprotected.

I was disappointed when it took 2 days to set everything up and then even more outraged that I needed to buy additional software to get basic things (like the enhanced web-brower and games). I also found the battery life to be poor and was disappointed when I couldn't check email from hotmail/yahoo accounts. In addition, the Wi-Fi hotspots aren't as common as one might think (even in NYC), so email and web browsing wasn't accessible most of the time. I wouldn't have minded paying the $500 if its features functioned with ease.Some of the good features: powerpoint, word, excel and the ability to open attachments (was not an option with the older blackberry models), great screen and resolution, small size, and user friendly keyboard.I recommend one of the newer blackberry's if you are a keyboard person and like that functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems great..WiFi did not work..returning product","review":"I will have to revisit and post another review when I get my new Tungsten C...because this one is being returned.

They basically read from the manual to troubleshoot it. Then said I better return it.Other than the WiFi no working, the T|C seems great. Colors are excellent, it is fast, and I like the keyboard.

Recently Verizon implemented a lot of public hotspots for their DSL customers in Manhatan, and I can get on easily with e750, but also have tons of trouble with TC. Most of the time it just sorta \\"hungs\\" when trying to connect. A call to Palm's busy tech support line did not resolve it. I also tried the hotspot in Bryant Park, it worked, but got dropped once, where as e750 was able maintain signal well.

Then, I never managed to figure out how to use the wirelss. No one knew how and PALM was thoroughly not helpful.

I read this at a single sitting, and will recommend it to my friends for its honesty, humour, and intelligence.With surgical clarity he reveals the demons that have beset him in his earlier years, and the reader may well nod painfully in recognition of many of them. The description of his tumultuous life is described with wit and an absence of mawkishness - I await a similar treatment of his next 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just For Gay Brit Actor/Writers","review":"Fry's memoir is not about a subject I'd ordinarily have any interest in reading: a relatively affluent Englishman's reminiscences. Combine that with more than a few obscure \\"insider\\" references and English idioms, and I decided to read twenty pages and then quit. But Fry's writing and sensibility was so fluent, funny and intriguing that I ended up reading it through in one afternoon. Amazing how skillful writers can transport you temporarily into their worlds! Ah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Insight; But Way Too Much Info","review":"I lovedFry: A Memoir, so thought I'd find out about the first 20 years of Fry's life. It's fascinating to see how troubled he was as a child, and how much he turned his life around. Parents, teachers, and those with sensitive stomachs should be warned that Fry leaves no details out of his account of his sexual development and early sexual experiences (including one rather worrying and not entirely consensual one with an older student at school). For those interested in Stephen Fry I would recommendFry: A Memoir, but even that only to those 18+ on account of some very explicit sexual references. Despite these, a highly entertaining and intriguing read. DEFINITELY listen to the audiobooks rather than the books if you're going to read them, Fry's narration transforms them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm what can I say?","review":"I really like Stephen Fry and his work but I found this book tended to waffle a bit and there were chunks where I just skipped over it but other bits where so very entertaining - Stephen is very good a painting a picture with words.

Stephen Fry is clearly a gifted writer, and based on this book I might try some of his fiction. However, a great deal of the middle of this book, say 100 pages or more, are devoted to his explaining and defending and preaching on his homosexuality.While I certainly don't begrudge him his right to tell his own story the way he wants and to spend time on what he finds important, this section really dragged on far too long. Aside from this, his story is really quite interesting and provocative.

It is disapointing as his first mystery was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude for dedicated fans only","review":"If you had really liked the man before reading this your estimation of him will sadly deteriorate after reading it . I just wish he hadn't bothered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stephen Fry","review":"Meanders through his childhood with typical lack of linearity and use of long words - if you like Stephen Fry's style, this book explains and delights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would've guessed!","review":"The things this guy has been up to! One would never have guessed that beneath the smug public persona there is a man of less substance than one might have expected. For fans of the Great Man who might be offended by that, it's perfectly okay. He never reads reviews. He portrays himself as a completely unremarkable fellow who's done nothing to deserve his current admittedly enviable existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it again","review":"I've had this cd for several months now, and when I first listened to it, I wasn't digging it. Like other reviewers, I thought a lot of the songs sounded the same and kind of boring. But, knowing that I was going to an upcoming Train concert, I kept listening to figure out some of the lyrics. Then, the strangest thing happened -- the more I listened, the more I liked it. The lyrics are smart, well-written and entertaining. Bottom line -- if you listened and didn't like it the first time, do yourself a favor and run through it a couple more times. You'll probably like what you hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than what I expected.","review":"Now I have heard Train before on the radio and seen the videos, but never once owned an album of theirs. I picked this up the other day as an impulse and have been blown away ever since. Almost all the songs get stuck in my head and i find myself humming them. If you like good music,and amazing lyrics then get this cd now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This is another great CD from Train. I am surprised that no oneon the previous reviews like \\"Explanation.\\" That is my favorite song on this release. The bottom line is easy. If you enjoy Train, your $14.00 will be very well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Drop of Jupiter but still a great cd.","review":"I didn't think this cd was as good as drops of Jupiter but, as one reviewer said give it a few more goes and you will see it really isn't that bad of a cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Sleep, play this.","review":"Can't sleep put this album on, as it plays you will have a hard time telling when one song ends and another begins. Except for the words to the songs the music sounded about the same. Better to download Train's hits from a service then pay full price for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Cd or download a track or two?","review":"For those without downloading abilities buy the cd. As a whole it is a good album with plenty of soul and mood to simply put on and let it play the whole way through. However, if you are looking for the best tracks possible and not just a nice moody album. Check out Cab which is already the radio hit of the album. It will probably be the biggest song as it is the most mainstream. Nice job a&r guy. Shelter me is interesting if only because it sounds just like paul mccartney in parts. Skyscraper is interesting as well, because it has some definite similarities to the coldplay sound. Finaly, get for me it's you. This is a great gavin degraw style soulful love song. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"What coulda been","review":"The first album was very good. 2nd album ripped my heart out. One of the best bands of the last couple of decades. Drops of Jupiter got me thru some rough times. 3rd album was pretty good also but I could tell some changes were coming. In the meantime some very key and important members left the band and with them some of the things that defined the Train I had grown to love...left with them. This fourth album is a sore dissappointment. Pat's ego clearly isn't enough to carry this formation of Train. He is very talented but IMHO he was only one piece of the puzzle. Now , thanks to him..the other pieces are gone. They should form a new band and leave the name Train to live on in our memories of what it used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than My Private Nation","review":"I was pretty surprised by this album. Train's last cd My Private Nation had a couple of really good tracks, but many of the songs annoyed me. All I Ever Wanted, Cab, Give Myself to You, and For Me It's You are all very good songs. If you like any of Trains stuff, and even if you don't: check out the cd Eager Seas by Watashi Wa... It is one of the best cd's to come out in a long time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Train","review":"I love Train. This CD is full of great lyrics and songs. The band just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD!!!","review":"Train just seems to keep getting better. I bought this CD after hearing CAB on the radio. I was not expecting to hear the first song, All I Ever Wanted. I haven't been able to get past listening to this song because it is absolutely beautiful!! The lyrics are brillant. I'll finish my review as soon as I'm done listening to this song but if the rest of the album is anything like this, then the whole CD is definetely worth your $$$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"One long boring song...","review":"I was never a huge Train fan, but I did enjoy some of their older CDs. The songs had a good blues/rock sound with witty lyrics. This CD lost all of that. The blues sound is gone. The wordy lyrics are gone. All of the songs sound the same and run together. The lyrics aren't something that catch your attention even if they are not witty either. The CD is basically background music because your mind definitely won't be focusing on the music while it's playing.Some people mentioned that this CD has a Coldplay sound. I can not hear that at all. Coldplay's sound is far superior to this CD's sound. The sound of this CD reminds me a lot of some of Paul McCartney's inferior indepentent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me an energy drink","review":"This is one of the most boring new CDs of the year. Yea the singer can sing, pros in the studio, but the songs sound all exactly the same. No hit singles to grab here, nothing catchy, nothing snappy. I hate to say it, but I agree with the other reviewer that said Train has died. After a awfully recorded Live At Last CD, now a very bad studio CD. Members of Train better go and each try to reform a new band, and hope nobody realizes it was them. The Train has derailed, the sales of this CD are unbeliable, pretty much ignored 100%. The only other promising band ignored this badly recently was last year Tatu- Dangerous & Moving, and that ironically was a pretty good CD. Problem is those girls announced they were not really lesbians and were no longer making out on their videos, so nobody cared to listen. If Train was an all girl band, maybe they could make a video and all make out with one another and maybe their new CD would pick up sales? Oh well, too bad that wont happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"This album does eventually grow on you but it's not my favorite and I hardly listen to it. Lead singer Pat Monahan is in the wrong pitch range for pretty much every song, making it really hard to listen to the whole album in one sitting. Better to stay with 'Drops of Jupiter' and not think about the akward direction Train has gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awsome CD","review":"Patrick Monahan out does himself with his strong vocals on this new release. The CD does alot of story telling. It's mellow for the most part but there are a few fun songs as well. Not only is CAB a number one hit, there are several other songs sure to be climbing the charts in no time. Monahan's voice is so clear and strong in \\" All I Ever Wanted\\". I think the band gets a little creative with \\"Explanation\\" and \\"For Me it's You\\". Every song on the CD is worth listening to-Train is definately moving forward. They are so much bigger now than that little band from San Fran."},{"rating":"1","title":"copy protected!???","review":"First off I want to say that I think the CD is a great addition to Trains sound, I would recomend this disk to everyone. Its probably the only CD other than Emerson Harts awaited release, that is REAL Music and not nonsensical RAP or Grunge metal Noise.However;Sony, In its infinite wisdom and greed has copy protected the disk, so you cant make a copy for your Vehicle, or add any of these songs to a best of Train compilation. Dont buy this CD and Boycott All sony products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all cats!!","review":"I thought this fish oil would be a great supplement for my cats after one of them began to overgroom and created bald patches on her stomach and legs. All four of my cats refused any type of food with this fish oil added. I tried for many days in many ways.

It kept my attention and although was somewhat confusing at times, I was able to keep up with the exciting plot. The main character, Norah Gardner was a very relatable Police detective and even had a humorous side to her in this grisly tale. I rarely give five stars but this one is definitely getting a 4 plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Carlin is the King of Comedy!","review":"George Carlin is the best! There isn't anybody he won't offend, but his material is so true about politicians and different groups and organizations. This is definitely worth buying! I would also recommend Back In Town. George is a great commedian and is an inspiration to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle Years","review":"If you don't know who George Carlin is then I truly pity you. He wasn't a clean comic by any means, and he wasn't a \\"family friendly\\" fellow. If you are new to Carlin this is a nice jumping off point, in the middle years of his carrier this is a good album before his rather painful slide into a realm comparable to that of Jack Black.While this isn't NIMBY, or his earlier impressions of the nuns he went to school with it isn't the vitriolic fare of his later years. This is classic Carlin, and well worth the purchase whether you're a long time fan or a newcomer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be renamed to \\"An introduction the Austrian Philosophy\\"","review":"If the reader expects a short and understandable introduction to Austrian Economics (like I was), he or she will be disappointed.The book is in no way easily understandable, and contains mostly introductions to the philosophical and methodological side (Praxeology) of the Austrian school. Not so much on the real economics side of the school.However the book introduces a good introduction to some of the great Austrians and their thoughts.If the reader is looking for a better introduction to Austrian Economics I would recommend:\\"Lessons for the young economist\\" or \\"How an economy grows and why it crashes\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning guide for visual learners","review":"I purchased this book after using the Frontpage 2000 guide in the same series. Features are much easier to learn when presented visually. I didn't think full colour would have much of an impact, but it seems to make commands easier to learn and remember. I'd especially like to draw attention to the way the guide shows the menus just as they appear, and walks you through the menu selections with a picture for each menu option you need to select. No more \\"Insert - Picture - Clipart\\". Every step is shown in full colour. While this guide doesn't have every command listed, it does provide people with the opportunity to learn the more useful commands, like formatting tables, and including pictures with documents. If you're looking for a full reference of every command, this book won't be for you. However, if you want to learn the more useful features of Word 2000 using an easy to understand step by step tutorial, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids wont stop","review":"We got this for our two boys (3 and 6) and they won't stop playing it.

Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I was surprised to see the blatant sexism, racism, and homophobia in this novel. On top of that, the central character drinks when she's pregnant, even though she knows it's not good for the baby. To make matters worse, the jacket copy reveals the fate of one of the main characters which makes it impossible for you to feel anything for him when disaster strikes -- he's almost superfluous from page one. I didn't even bother to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!","review":"BEYOND A PROMISE is a book filled with lies, secrets, incest, affairs, lost loves and broken hearts. This book made my heart ache with the devastation it left behind in my mind. How can his be categorized as a romance when there was nothing romantic about it? Just when you think a romance is budding to life, it gets crushed with a murderous blow. I kept reading it, hoping that something good might come out of this disaster of a story, but it just got worst. I guess I was asking for too much. I felt that the ending was obsurd and callously cold. I refuse to throw away the book because I paid for it, but I keep it out of my sight. I do not recommend this book, it is a waste of time and money.

This new book does not compare. It does not have of what I find special and up lifting from Christian prayer. Some say pray without ceasing is easier to follow I disagree. Pray without ceasing does a horrible job. I also feel that it should not be a substitute for the liturgy of the hours. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills a Huge Void!","review":"This book is an exceptionally user-friendly and comprehensive guide to the universe of home services that a New York City dweller needs to survive. So often, one has a service need but simply cannot go beyond one or two unqualified word of mouth recommendations to select an appropriate provider. And even when one gets a recommendation, a feature of the service may be left out - the recommender may not, for example, want to disclose how much he or she paid. To have a book like The Franklin Report, which rates all relevant aspects of a provider and which furnishes specific statements about a particular job, is invaluable. I can't recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men's Stainless Steel, Bulova Watch - Bulova 96C26","review":"This is an excellent item. Not only does it looks good, it is durable.

This novel was so obviously influenced by \\"The Bridges Of Madison County\\" I'm surprised she didn't dedicate it to Robert James Waller. Of course, since Ms. Steel cannot abide poverty (or even middle class), the book takes place in the swanky Paris Ritz instead of an Iowa farmhouse. I gave it two stars because it's been a very long time since I laughed this hard reading a book. Totally ludicrous and predictable--but, then again, what Danielle Steel book isn't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"I read this book in the hopes of learning what made Danielle Steel such a successful writer. I was looking forward to romance, Parisian atmosphere, tension, soap opera...Blech. This was the worst book I ever read. This author is wasting precious trees, nay forests! Don't buy this book!!! There is nothing redeeming about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"If you can make it past the first few chapters to meet all the characters, then you don't need to finish the book because you can predict the rest. I think Ms. Steel needs to spend more time coming up with a new idea and less time trying to crank out a book every 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Tiresome, Dull... x 3","review":"Are you a busy person who has no free time, but who would love to be able to read a book? Well now you can, thanks to this handy hint! Take any Danielle Steel book - in this demonstration we're using Five Days in Paris, but any one will do - and read every third page! You'll find that not only will you finish the book in a third of the time, but you'll still be able to follow the story! That's right! The secret lies in the way the book is worded. Danielle takes everything that needs to be said, and rewords it three times, just to make sure you (the ... reader) understands. That is, she says the same thing over and over, but in a slightly different manner. By which I mean, she repeats herself without repeating herself in the exact same way.Danielle Steel writes excellent books for prepubescent girls. Anyone over 20 with any brains will be bored senseless by her incessant need to oversimplify every single thing she says. These books need to go on the Adolescent bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and not in-depth enough for me!!!!!","review":"Five days in paris was a short, sappy book. Even a ten year old could read this in a day! I was disappointed with this one. Sort of reminds me of Special Delivery. Not her best, but not her worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN TIME!","review":"Well! This is a first for me... I have never read a bad Danielle Steel book before... This book was very slow and not very intriguig or anything really... I read it but it never spoke to me as her other books all did.. I found this book very boring and not well written... Sorry Mrs. Steel, it is the only book you ever wrote I didn't like..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steel's best - you won't want to put it down","review":"Five Days In Paris makes you realize how an accidental meeting with one person can change your whole perspective of your life and those in it. Even though the main character is a man, I, as a woman, had total empathy with him and wanted the story to go in the direction it did. Although it was not totally predictable, there were enough surprise angles to keep you guessing, it was definitely the story line I wish I had chosen to write. I did not want to put the book down. I would read a few lines in the next chapter and was soon so deep into it that I promised myself I would put it down at the end of that chapter, and again would read \\"just a few lines\\" to see where it was going. Danielle, you get better and better. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Never to Late to be Happy","review":"I would gladly recommend Five Days in Paris by Danielle Steel for those in need of hope either in love or life. This romantic novel has very vivid imagery, you'll feel like you're there. The reading level in this book is a bit difficult but at the end you get what the author meant by it. The reason I enjoyed this book very much is because the author gets you to care about the characters in a way I haven't in the past. She has you anticipate that the two characters should meet, when? how? what will they say? This is a great novel and again I would recommend this book for those in need of a great story. Its never too late to be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Days in Paris","review":"The book was fresh and sweet. Danielle Steel writes easy books to read, so one can easily get into them and interesting enough to stay captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"The is a great Danielle Steel book. I had it for years on cassette tape, but it was abridged. I truly enjoyed listening to the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lackluster story","review":"I am not typically a Danielle Steele fan, but I thought I would try something new and on CD to pass the time at work. The story was just not my cup of tea. It centered around a man named Peter who lived a life where I think you could say he was satisfied, but not necessarily happy. The book wanted you to believe that he had compromised with his wife and her family throughout their marriage, but I never really bought that. He went on a business trip where he meets someone whose more legitimately in a lonely marriage and within a few days of knowing each other, they fall in love. The rest of the book deals with how that love affair affected them long term.For me, this story just didn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Danielle Steel's books seems to have less depth to them as each one is published. I didn't get totally involved in the book and want to learn more about the people in it as I usually do with her books. Usually, I don't want one of her books to end because I want to keep reading about the characters' lives, but this one didn't fall into that category! Of course, true Steel fans have to read all of her books no matter what! I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had such a difficult time getting through this book.","review":"I love Danielle Steel, but it took me quite awhile to get through this book.

So I stopped reading her. I picked up and read this book hoping that things had changed and I find they really haven't. I enjoyed reading this book but by the end I was getting impatient for it all to end. It seems like the same plot over and over with just different names thrown in. At least this one wasn't set in San Francisco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Danielle Steels' best work!!!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Having been an avid fan of the author, I expected much, much more from her. She never really developed the characters, rather she skimmed the surface, not making it possible for the reader to develop any connection with these people. I'm glad I picked this book up in paperback, and didn't pay for the more expensive hardcover edition. I think that it is very obvious in \\"Five Days In Paris\\", that this is Danielles' 36th book. If you have enjoyed her books in the past, you will be unpleasantly surprised with this one. I just could not get into this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche ridden, boring, plot holes...should I go on?","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, so, respecting her opinion, I read it. What a waste of time. It's written in passive voice, totally boring, and filled with cliched characters who have mixed message motivations. Ms Steele drops plot lines like the proverbial hot potato, and her foreshadowing is poor. Though, maybe she doesn't need it, there's hardly an event you can't see coming. After reading this, and Jewels (I'll give anyone a second chance) I have to wonder why Ms. Steele is still being published. There are too many good books and too little time to waste said time on Ms. Steele. Spare yourself the anguish and read something else instead.Oh yes, there was one good thing about it. Victor Garber did the narration and that's the only thing that kept me going til the end.

As always with this author, very detailed and well written. Would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"No, no, no. This is NOT a rousing adventure: it's a good, quick read that ends of going flat real fast half-way through. It starts off entertaining enough - even a jovial, skirt-chasing Herrmann Goering makes an appearance - and the first expedition to Antartica keeps your interest. But then it's as if the author was under a rush to finish it, because it devolves into this strained romance that tries to be Hemingway. By the last fifty pages I was plowing through it just to be done with it. Such a shame: now Nazi UFOs in Antartica - that would be a story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot action in a cold place!","review":"Fans of WW2 adventure novels will enjoy Ice Reich very much. The story follows an American bush pilot hired by the Nazis in 1939 to explore Antarctica. However, the motive behind the Nazi's expedition seems suspect to the American. As the story progresses, the real reason for the expedition becomes clearer, and the American must make a number of serious decisions that will effect his life, his lover, and the future of mankind.William Dietrich's Ice Reich held my attention from the opening sentence, right up until the very end. His writing is crisp, the setting wonderfully original, and the story fast-paced. Dietrich has tied in a remote and desolate setting with a tense plot and fascinating characters. I'm looking forward to reading Dietrich's next novel, and hope that his second work of fiction is as enjoyable as Ice Reich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"If you like Clive Clussler you will love this book! William Dietrich weaves a great tale of adventure and yes, even love. From a plane crash in Alaska, to Germany at the end of World War 2. The Author provides you a wild ride of adventure, love and suspense, that keeps you turning the pages way after midnight. A gamble on a new Author, but well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read from William Dietrich","review":"A US pilot gets recruited by German diplomat for an Antarctic expedition in a prewar 1938. The pilot falls in love in a German scientist and faces off against a SS officer. The expedition finds a deadly plague bacteria and an organism with antibiotic effects. The expedition ends with a conflict arrising between the invloved parties. Years later, near the end of the war, Nazis return to the island with the SS officer, the pilot and the scientist to retrieve the bacteria and use it to win the war. Here, the final battle for survival begins. Good first book by William Dietrich, interesting, full of action and human conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Reich is worth saluting.","review":"Ice Reich is the best Antarctic thriller since Payne Harrison's Thunder of Erebus. A former science reporter for the Seattle Times, author William Dietrich is particularly adept at bringing to life all subjects. His characters are as bright and vivid as the Antarctic scenery he skillfully describes. The plot is brilliant and the action does not get bogged down in history or nature lectures which happens so often in other Antartic-themed novels. If you like Jack Higgins' WW II thrillers, or if you like books about Antarctica, you'll find Ice Reich very entertaining.This a brilliant debut novel and readers will be left very satisfied--except for the occasional pang of anticipation for Mr. Dietrich's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pulitzer This Time","review":"The Ice Reich began with enough subtle intrigue to convince the reader that maybe, just maybe, Dietrich had created a good pot boiler of a WWII novel. Unfortunately by page 100, all has been lost. The authors biggest road block seems to be his tin ear for dialogue - mostly between the male and female lead. His heavy use of melodrama is overbearing. The time period is ripe with fasinating characters, but Dietrich chooses to go with the stock Nazi's who's only purpose is to \\"defend the reich\\" at all costs. Final act borders on preposterous. There is a scene in the sub where the male and female lead make love while being depth charged. It is about the corniest thing ever laid to parer. Skip this one for a good Jack Higgins - \\"Eagle Has Landed\\" or \\"Night Of The Fox\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low budget fun that delivers","review":"Not exactly profound, but it is fun. Hot looking girls and senseless violence. The guy who does the dogman act is actually very good. This movie also features a skinny dip scene in one of the grossest bodies of water I've ever seen, and I'm a fisherman from NJ.There is a bonus scene that is included in the extras section that features a shoe store that I wish had been in the movie.

Obviously done by people with a passion for the genre, the female band was a nice new twist to an often told lost in the middle of nowhere story, if you enjoy your Horror with twisted comedy, cool gore, goofy killers, and great music, then check this movie out. The most entertaining new Horror movie that hasn't come out of France, that I've seen in quite some time, I will be buying it. I don't know how it slipped under my radar, but don't let it slip under yours.

I don't have enough room to describe where McAfee went wrong with this. I bought it, thinking that it was a program designed to work in the backgrounds and do basically do it's thing. Not true!! I had to make a decision about almost every little thing. I consider myself to be very computer literate (using one, that is)... but fixing/repairing/troubleshooting one is a whole different ballgame! For someone who doesn't really know what they're doing 'under the hood', this program can be dangerous (for the computer and the user). I switched to Norton Internet Security 2003 and am very happy. It blocks attacks, files spam (as per my direction), notifies me of potential attacks but does what it's supposed to do behind the scenes.

Problem is in 2 modules -- Privacy Service and Spam Killer. You'll get the Blue screen of death when you boot (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_TRAP_MODE). After many hours, I succeeded installing on another computer only to discover that my POP3 e-mail would not work on either Netscape or Mozilla browser, and I could not surf or receive e-mail until I disabled Privacy Service. I decided this was not the product for me, and tried to ask for refund.

It doesn't block any pop-ups, can't update virus definitions. Actually, it doesn't seem to do anything except add frustration and irritation to computing. Thanks Mcafee, from another customer you cheated out of $69.95 plus tax. If you want a good firewall, download ZoneAlarm...it's free.

McAfee Internet Security is cripled by its lack of information and capabilities. Norton's product is by far superior.The alert boxes nor activity log tell you the full details of the remote IP address or ports not anything about the local communication. This becomes important, because, you might be perfectly comfortable having Internet Explorer access a web site on port 80, but freak out if Internet Explorer was allowed to share you files with \\"web folders\\" on a different TCP/UDP port.In addition, data is displayed in hexadecimal format with no interpretation.

Need I say more? Once I changed them to Everready, the unit bogged completely down on some admittedly thick caulk. With a new tube of smoother caulk in place, the unit managed to nudge caulk out of the tip but did so in a cyclic pattern as the little motor struggled in cycles. Smooth continous delivery was the one thing I thought I could expect from a motorized gun. Cyclic blobs I can create for myself with a hand powered caulk gun.

The choice came down to a pneumatic assist (didn't like the idea of lugging a compressor around the house), a $300 rechargeable battery model (that did not \\"fit\\" my other cordless tools), or this one.For the money, it's fine. Certainly rugged enough for the occasional use I had planned for it, but surprisingly little power. I suspect it would be much easier to use with regular viscosity caulk; the removable caulk (s+p) is not free-flowing in the best of cases. Also surprised at how the batteries have lasted. I thought, with the amount of force being applied, that'd they would be dead by now - not so.

I have bad wrists and squeezing the handle can get uncomfortable on larger jobs. With a lot to do and several upcoming projects I thought this would be handy.Boy was I wrong.This is very slow, and it barely can handle any caulking I throw at it - polyurethane, silicone, you name it. The caulk comes out slow as molasses - FAR slower than I ever aim for. It also needs constant coaxing and fussing with the tube to get the caulk a perfect way out.Worst part? It doesn't save me from the physical squeezing 1 bit. Yep you read it, I have to squeeze the handle extremely hard - just as hard as a normal caulk gun... I just have to continue to hold it down after with this.

First let me tell you that I was Mrs. United States. I met two boys in the foster care program. I was afraid of them, they smelled awful and didn't have the talent to be in my production, but I let them work back stage and I preached to them and now they are Christians.

Students who select this book expecting that the accompanying CD-ROM will include such simulated practice exams will be in for a major disappointment, however, because the CD contains little more than a canned orientation to the computer interface.

These songs are not the original ones you heard on the radio. This is one of the reasons collectors download off the internet. At least if it's not original, it wasn't a waste of time & money.

I have not read such beautiful prose since finishing Gimpel the Fool by Isaac B. Singer. Within a few sentences of each story I felt myself being transported to the tropical local of each story. The protagonist/girl/young woman of each story melded into a single character trying to find her place in a crazy world. I was sad to see each story end, as I felt I wanted to know more. All young women should read this book, so they will know they are not alone in their journeys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique for its genre","review":"The cover is what drew me to this book because of the dark colors and the scary looking mermaid on the back. I was not sure what to expect when I began, but I found it to be unique and imaginitive. Talking stone lions, Egyptian mummies attacking Venice and creatures from Hell-what more can one ask for in an adventure. I am definitely looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more for me, thanks.","review":"2-2.5 starsI was amused by some of the ideas mentioned in the front flap of the book: Venice under siege by the Egyptian Empire; mummy soldiers; mermaids in the canals. What's not to like? Unfortunately, most of these ideas, and the other interesting ones brought up in the book, are never really explored. This entire book seems to serve the purpose of setting up the rest of the series. That did not satisfy this reader at all.Despite the creativity that shines every now and then, the story itself falls flat on its face. There is no actual ending. And even though there is some action and forward motion, nothing big enough happens to justify calling this a complete book.To sum up: this is a set-up for a series and not good on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW! Frustrating ending","review":"This book was very slow, and nothing ever really seemed to happen. It ended right at the climax, and instead of making me think \\"I want to know what happens next!\\" it made me think \\"Well, that was dumb.\\"There were parts of the story that were interesting, but a lot of it was just cliché and rushed. I may read to the sequel if I can find it, but if I can't I won't worry about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you are a true Foreigner fan, and want to stay that way, then don't buy this terrible DVD. I can't believe the band would allow themselves to be remembered this way. Lou Gram is one of my all time favorite vocalists, Long Hard Look, Ready Or Not, master pieces. I couldn't stand to watch the whole DVD, and watch these guys destroy the fond memories I had of the group. I never thought I would think or say it, but their washed up, time to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regardless, it's ashamed its out!","review":"It is understandable that Lou Gramm was given a chance to sing, but, in spite of his surgery and weight gain, the video is poorly shot (there are scenes from a hotel lobby doing registration and taken shots of the tiles!!), the camera work is very poor, the sound is lacking, and of course Lou Gramm is but a shadow of his prior persona. To keep the memory alive, check the older stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"critical review","review":"I bought All Access Tonight DVD.

What a dismal performance","review":"Fourth time watching this video just in case I was too quick to rush to judgement. Spend your money on lottery tickets. I love Foreigner (and still do) but don't buy this video. American Idol performers (even the worst) do better than Lou Gramm in this specific video. In this video, Lou couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. I wish he was drunk but I don't think that was his issue this evening. The rest of the band looks tired and unwilling to perform as well. I felt sympathic for the band afterwards because it felt like they were 90 days away from checking in to their local nursing home. Send you money to me and I'll mail you my DVD. I'll pay for shipping and whatever offer you make I'll knock another four bucks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Vocals","review":"When I bought this DVD I was very excited. \\"What could rock more than a Foreigner DVD?\\". I think a rock could rock harder. The vocals were horrible. The singer tries to \\"change up\\" the lyrics but only succeeds in making the vocals off-tempo with the songs. I think he might be too old to hit the high notes anymore, because he sang very low and sped up through the high-note parts.The editing was mediocore, if that. I got very frustrated at parts where they would have video over-lap the concert or visa-versa. It'd be a nice transistion effect, but it stayed like that for a good while.The rest of the band was excellent though. They rocked. Save your money and don't be dissapointed. Now if you will excuse me, I have to go detox myself with some of my old Foreigner albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe...","review":"no one mentioned the fact that Lou Gramm has lost his voice.

I mean, yeah...use some of it to show the present, but I would have to believe that far greater footage exists that would payng fitting tribute to an incredible rock band.

I have been collecting Concert DVDs for about a year. I only recently came to Amazon, and have reviewed a few of my collection. Please read my reviews if you are an 80s Concert fan.I like some of the others was excited to find Foreigner on DVD. My wife and I sat down, grabbed a couple of Beers and were shocked. It was so bad we couldnt even get through the first song. It looks and sounds like I filmed it from the audience drunk. There really isnt anything good about any part of it, except that you have Foreigner on stage.If only I would have seen this one before I reviewed the Police. I would have at least given the Police Concert 2 stars for sound.Take these reviews seriously, for real...Matt in K-town.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"The music is OK.

What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Not to berate the band, but this is the worst music DVD I have spent money on. The video looks like it was taken from some crew member's personal camcorder. The picture is blurry and washed out - the lighting is horrible. The sound is even worse. I don't know about the previous reviewer's mix, but there is no true Dolby 5.1 or DTS. The noise coming out of my rear speakers doesn't even qualify as sound. The personal vignettes between songs, like \\"Checking In\\", are nothing more than filler. (What's interesting about watching the band standing around at a hotel desk, waiting for the keys to their hotel rooms? There's no real dialogue, and this segment goes on for several minutes.) This DVD feels more a practical joke, than an intimate portrait of the powerhouse supergroup I loved and grew up with in the 80's. Save your pennies and wait for a better quality production - sadly, this one won't see the inside of my DVD player again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice feeder, but beware of corners","review":"I really enjoyed this feeder for a long time, mainly because it has such a large capacity and many birds can fit around it, and it seemed sturdy. However, one day I walked out to refill it and found a dead finch hanging by its little foot from it. Its talon had become caught in a tiny gap between the corners of the lip, where two sections of the lip join. I can't imagine the agony that poor birdie endured before finally dying. I taped up the gap, but really, felt like throwing the thing away.Just make sure there are no hidden hazards when you purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bird Feeder","review":"I have had this bird feeer for several years and it has held up nicely.

I have a double suet cage and a squirrel proof feeder, but they seem drawn to the newer feeder.

However, Diglett continues to have his party even though his friends can't see. I think it's cute to guess what Diglett and his family look like. We get to see the inside of the cave twice: once when the candles on Diglett's cake are lit, and another time when the toy plane that Diglett got for his birthday breaks a hole in the roof of his cave and lets light in.

You can't beat a russian classic when it comes to food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle (Free Version) Table of Contents Needs Correction","review":"The free Kindle version of Gogol's \\"Dead Souls\\" is correct as far as part One is concerned. For part Two, the chapters point to those in part One. In other words, Part Two, Chapter One points to the first chapter in Part One. Not a big deal, but it should be corrected. As far as the book, the worst \\"classic\\" I've ever read. I'll just leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the edition published by Empire Books","review":"This just goes to show that you really should look before you leap. It is posted that this edition is 9\\" x 6\\" which I would have seen if I had looked at the posted details. But, additionally, it weighs a ton! The font size is also unnecessarily large and there is a weird space between every paragraph. These things create a high page count and add to the bulk. Overall, this book is too heavy and awkward to hold and my hands were aching by page 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Souls","review":"Gogol's best novel, and certainly one of the most impressive Russian novels, this offers a look into a long-lost class system - where human beings could still be owned - thus offering the central irony of the narrative.

A classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this crud?","review":"Do not order this edition!My Signet copy had too many underlinings so I thought I'd replace it with this one.But what a mistake. This is one of those mass-printed books that the Internet + Amazon has now made possible. I'm not sure what they're called. But they're monstrosities: custom-printed in a run of one, I assume, shortly after you order one.So basically some machine somewhere took a free, public-domain version of the text and prints it into this heavy, oversized paperback and sends it to me.It has no publisher listed! No translator! And no copyright page! It's like the thing fell out of heaven.What's worst, predictably, is that the text is riddled with errors and may not even be complete.Am I wrong to assume some automated process at Amazon simply \\"realized\\" their free Kindle version?Amazon groups many of these reviews together, so let me be clear: the one I'm talking about has a girl looking out an arched window to her left."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic of Russian Literature","review":"This review is of the book, and not the Kindle rendering of it, though this is the version I downloaded and read. Dead Souls is unquestionably a classic of Russian Literature and one of the foundation stones of the Russian novel. As a Russophile and a strong proponent of Russian literature, I often run into those who hesitate to dive in because they are afraid that Russian novels are too dry, too depressing, or too \\"foreign\\". Dead Souls is the PERFECT introduction to Russian Literature, because it is accessible, humorous, educational, and entertaining. This is a book that should be read by anyone who desires to be conversant in world literature, and it is a deep and engaging study into the mind and heart of Russia and Russians."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great writer","review":"I never read Gogol until now... It is a revelation.

I have had an earlier model for two years, and it has been riddled with problems. Because I bought a service plan, I have not paid for repairs, but the TV has been out of commission for a total of 3 months due to a long waiting period for replacement parts. Problems have included lamp failure, color wheel failure, and fan failure.

We were impressed with the great picture quality and were excited for our new purchase. TWO days later, after very little use, that great picture was gone and all we had was audio. The lamp went out. We never bothered to get it fixed, we returned it right away! There is nothing like dropping $2,000 on something and having it bust in two days. We opted to spend a little more money on a Sony LCD and we are SO happy with it. Sometimes I still hold my breath when we are turning it on, but we have had NO problems yet. Do your research!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still ticking after almost 6 years of constant use","review":"Just a quick review to say that I bought this TV in May 2005, and it still works perfectly in January 2011.

About a month ago we noticed a fairly loud buzzing/humming/whirring noise right after the TV was turned off. Now the noise occurs every time the set is turned on. It's loud enough that you can't watch the TV. Of course the warranty was only 1 year so I guess it's to the shop for me. The set was expensive and I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product due to this reliability issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality picture, worst possible build quality and service.","review":"I purchased the 46\\" DLP exactly 2 years and a month ago. 18 months or so after purchase the unit started shutting off by itself with the red lamp light flashing inconsistent times. On some nights it will barely stay on while it can go weeks without an incident. Again, very inconsistent. Called Samsung and the rep on the phone said \\"Sorry but that is not a known issue and you are out of warranty.\\"Anyways, it's a shame this problem is so common and deal breaking, because the picture itself is magnificent. I will not be purchasing another Samsung product after this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' buy this TV","review":"I purchased this TV new in July 2004. Since then, I have had the TV serviced 4 times. Fortunately, as I was concerned about the complexity of the DLP technology, I purchased an in-home service plan. But it has been a hassle having the service techs come out to the house. The system board has been replaced as well as the lamp. However, the picture just goes dead with the three indicator lights flashing. Occassionaly, you can reset the TV and get the picture back, but eventually it goes completely dead. The same symptoms come back. The service vendor can't correct the problem and both the retailer and Samsung have offered no help.

Many dramatic and important scenes I hoped would be in the movie were either altered beyond recognition or missing altogether, and the \\"politically correct\\" additions are a final blow to this sinking ship. This film is about as true to the novel as the 1970 animated version with talking animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid adaptation","review":"I don't know where to begin. I had to stop watching this movie 55 minutes into it. If you want to watch a movie about a man stranded on an island who adapts to his surroundings and meets cannibals, then watch this movie. However, if you want to watch a movie that is remotely close to the theme of Daniel Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe\\", please go somewhere else. It is akin to watching \\"Finding Nemo\\" and calling it an adaptation of \\"Moby Dick\\". \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" was penned in 1651, the narrative and characters in the book reflect the culture and social mores of the time in which it was written.

It throws prejudices in ones face, without dealing with them. Flies corruption like a banner without the balance of integrity, and altogether butchers Daniel Defoe's account of Robinson Crusoe's escapades. Through gunfight and anger, harsh words and mixed-up sequences this film ambles. Leaving the viewer with the impression that all good things come to an end, but the bad remain forever.

I always thought Crusoe was English not Scottish, and when did he ever kill some one in Scotland? And bodies never washed up on the shore in the book. Friday was not African American in the book either, as he was portrayed in the movie. Even if you want to watch the movie for the sake of it's action quality, there is no action, so move along and pick another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is an abomination.","review":"I think others have summed it up quite well. I'm just adding this to have some impact on a scoring which has been defined by the puerile reviews of those unfamiliar with the works of Defoe.

I mean dang, he was supposed to be on the island for 28 years but they changed it all up so that he is only there for 6!!!!!?? Whoever reads this, DO NOT SEE IT IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!! Also they did not include him living in a cave and having a home in the country and a farm in the Brazils. They did not show how he was able to plant stuff or how he go the goats and sheep that he survied on. Friday was also a ripoff, in the book he was more tanned than African American. And if you notice in the movie he had a toucan but in the book he had a parrot that he taught to speak to him. And more about Friday, he had converted his religion to Christianity but he kept his religion.

Everything the box claims seems true. No qualms there yet, mind you again it's only been two days... but the fry pans come with NO LIDS! Normally you find the lid to the big pot will fit the larger fry pan and so on and so forth for other sizes, but not with this set. What they were thinking, I don't know. Because the average family makes and creates foods such as hamburger helper... and those kinds of recipes call for covering your dish for awhile.

I did not buy this set so I could have lids that were close to fitting. Also. T-fal's web site saysthat this set is made in France.

The day-to-day operations are fascinating as they bring every interview and interrogation to life. They do a great job, considerating the fact that all the action is essentially one intellect battling against another. This is a thick tome, but a very easy and enjoyeable read. It nicely compliments the other action-oriented Special Forces accounts of American's military operations in the area.

Though this may appeal to most readers, it turned me away because the object of Rachel's affection is not introduced untill halfway through the somewhat jumbled tale. Even after they are introduced through a twisted fate meeting, the story is spent dwelling on the young girl's thoughts rather than a real plot.

I would recommend this to everyone who likes music! If you like this I suggest Ozzy's \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" and AC/DC's \\"74 Jailbreak\\". BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to like it","review":"I used to like AC/DC's one good song of this album until I heard it so many times that I got sick to death of it. If you took all of AC/DC's albums stripped the garbage and filler of each you would have enough songs for one good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SONGS","review":"This CD i'd have to say is one of their best amazing guitar in it and O K vocals thunderstruck is amazing (being able to play it myself on my guitar) and Moneytalks is a great song. BUT Razor's Edge, no one can beat that music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PATIENCE'S EDGE !!!","review":"I had enough from AC/DC !!! I bought album after album by them, my favourite band. Then I had to see the band choose a complete uncapable singer (in terms of voice, not live performance) to replace Bon SCott. I managed to handle it, with the great BACK IN BLACK and the very good FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK. Then I had to testify the total loss of reativity from the band, to hera Johnson writing the worst lyrics I can remember in my entire life and the music going nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets the children out of bed in the morning","review":"I found this CD to be a excellent tool when one haveto get 5 kids out of bed in the morning - this CD isthe best one produced by AC/DZ no doubt. Usually one onlylike one or two songs, but here I enjoyed almost all ofit. This is no bad rating coming from a guy who usuallyonly listen to bluegrass and classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an album!!","review":"I love this album almost as much as I love Back In Black, which is probly the greatest album of all time! The gutar work here is amazing Angus and Malcom play some of their best riffs, and Angus' solos are amazing, and the best example of those two things is 'Thunderstruck' Brian Johnson has a great voice and I love the way he sounds here. Some of the highlight tracks are 'ThunderStruck' 'Moneytalks' and 'The Razors Edge' even though every song is a kepper here those are the ones that stood out the most to me personaly. AC/DC was (KINDA) in a slump with their albums until they recorded this, this is easily one of their best albums, it could easily go hand in hand against Highway To Hell, and that is saying a lot concedering that was their best album with former Singer Bon Scott. This is a must own for AC/DC fans, Metal/ hard rock fans, and classic rock fans for that matter! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good AC/DC Album","review":"The Razor's Edge might be the best AC/DC album since Back in Black. For Those About To Rock, Flick of the Switch, Fly on the Wall, and Blow up your Video were great but AC/DC hadn't put out a truly classic rock album in almost a decade. Thunderstruck and Moneytalks are two of their best songs and Are You Ready, Got You By the Balls, and Rock Your Heart Out are great too. Brian sounds better than usual and Angus opening solo for Thunderstruck is possibly one of the best openers ever. This is a cd that more than AC/DC fans will love and I hope it gets the credit it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best drums sound ever on an AC/DC album","review":"It's a pity that drummer Chris Slade lasted for such a short time in Ac/DC. In this album, producer Bruce Fairbairn managed to create the best drums sound ever recorded on an AC/DC album. Even if Slade maitains the tradition of \\"low profile drumming\\" of the band, the sound of his drusm are powerful, crispy, helping the music in a manner AC/DC seldom had witnessed.The songs are very good, the twelve of them. For the first time AC/DC released an album with 12 new songs. Thy were adapting to the time of the CD... And suceeded completely, because this album was much, MUCH better than previous albums Blow Up Your Video and Fly On The Wall (The \\"Simon Wright\\" albums). After The Razor's Edge, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip were also pale in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not good.","review":"THE RAZOR'S EDGE just doesn't measure up to the classic AC/DC albums of the late 70's and early 80's. Although Brian Johnson's vocals are not bad, the guitar is unmistakably Angus Young, the songs are just not memorable. After listening to this for awhile you will want to dig out your Back In Black CD. Not terrible, but not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of theirs.","review":"Of the four or five AC/DC albums I have, including BACK IN BLACK, this is my favorite Most of the songs are really good, but THUNDERSTRUCK and LET'S MAKE IT really stand out. They lyrics are their usual high intensity, scream it out to the world sound and the guitars just rock. The one song I didn't really like on here is MISTRESS FOR CHRISTMAS. All the others are great for popping into the CD player and just crankin', especially if you're on a long road trip. Just sit back, listen, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the best!","review":"I love this band and all their music. they add a little humor and fun to rock.

I love the way it jams and I can have the kids listen to it and they love it. Need to be careful with other AC/DC songs. Money talks makes a great ringtone If there were 1 or 2 more songs I liked on this I would give it a 5 starI bought 3 AC/CD CD's to get the songs I wanted - Money Talks is the only one I really wanted from this one. They don't do Amazon individual songs or greatest hits.AC/DC FavoritesMoney TalksTNTDirty DeedsLong Way to the Top if you want to Rock and Roll - Love the Bag Pipes!!I'll try to listen to some others later to find some I like.

It has one of the most powerful and energizing openers in \\"Thunderstruck.\\" Some of the other non-weak things on the cd are \\"Money Talks \\"Razor's Edge\\" \\"Rock your Heart Out\\" and \\"Are you Ready.Overall I think you should get \\"Razor's Edge\\" by Ac/Dc, because there are some great songs on the cd and it is better than anything else played on mtv today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A back in red, (if you will) a return to their top q stuff","review":"This one probably rounds out their top 5 studio albums with the others being from their golden age in the late '70's Thunderstruck rivals Its a long way to the top as their most creative and is a killer rock song anyway. Money Talks is one of those awesome songs I had stuck in my head as a kid but didnt yet know of the band behind it, the staple of the album. other songs are quite good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"O M G !!!","review":"OH My God !!! I thought I would never get here. I just can't believe that Anyone has Any use for the imitations that you gotta wade through to get to the REAL band. I wanna vomit it makes me so sick to listen to cheap substitutes to this legacy of rock. I don't have anything against these people personally but STOP IT! Only people from a later generation would consider these bands at all and bottom line the tribute bands just don't have the meaty depth of the original AC/DC !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy and good","review":"rounded up from 4.5 These are heavy measuring cups but the insides have rounded corners so you can easily scrape out all of it. Additionally they have level tops and handles so that you can easily level off the top of your scoop. They feel durable enough that I could fry eggs in them and they are easy to clean and easily stackable. The little key ring that keeps them together is worthless but that's alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty, beautiful measuring cup set.","review":"I went looking for some industrial quality measuring cups, specifically for one-piece metal construction - and these are exactly what I wanted. The 1-cup is a bit large - as another commenter mentioned, and a bit shallow - but it does its job, and they stack nicely.The build quality is the selling point - they are durable and pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measuring cup was defective.","review":"The 1 cup measuring cup was defective and did not hold 1 cup. According to my kitchen scale, it was only able to hold 213 grams (which is 213 ml) of water. 1 cup is 236 ml, so it's more than 10% off. I don't mean to be a stickler, but it only has one job, and 10% off will f-up your baked goods.Pulling out the caliper, one side is 32 mm high and the other is 36 mm high.Jeez Amco, what gives? This is supposed to be the \\"Advanced Performance\\" model.Returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cup set compliments the measuring spoon set","review":"These measuring cups are The BEST. They are forged from 1 pc of stainless steel - no rivets, no rust, not flimsy - nothing to break! Durable, and time tested - I have had these for over 5 years, and they still look like new. I bought a few more for gifts as everyone that has seen me use them wants them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"I do a LOT of cooking. All the measuring cups I've had in the past have been inexpensive ones and they always fall apart at some point. So I thought since I'll be cooking possibly another 30 years, that I might as well get some good ones. The only thing I don't like about these is they are shorter and wider than a typical measuring cup which can be a problem if you are wanting to scoop something out of a container that's narrower that the cup, like baking cocoa. But I'll probably get used to it. I doubt these will ever fall apart since they are one piece. I gave a set to my daughter to give to her fiance' since he's the cook between them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it would of been okay...","review":"I was super excited about these. Description said durable 18/10 stainless steel. Well, they arrived...either before, or in transit, nested cups rubbed against each other. Bottoms appeared to have paint rubbed off. 18/10? Stainless Steel? I don't think so. Didn't want the silver polish, paint, whatever it is, coming off and mixing with my food. Returned them, cancelled spoons, gave up and got All Clad. Some day I hope to find a well made measuring spoon and cup set Made in USA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"All I can say is, these measuring cups are not at all what I was expecting. I bought a set of these at Williams Sonoma several years ago. Same brand, same number, not the same quality. These are very light weight compared to my first set. The heft is what I love about my first set, as they are very sturdy. These just feel chinsy and cheap. Save your time and money. Go to Crate and Barrel or Williams Sonoma, and for the same price get the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indestructible","review":"After yet another set up measuring cups got tossed with broken handles and dinged up cups, I got these. Even measuring cup banging by the kids has not dented them and I see no way on earth for the handle to come off. I considered the All Clad for $40, but those still have riveted handles which will come off some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic first novel. Read this book.","review":"Rick Moody mentions Astral Weeks in his introduction. There are worse reasons to read a book, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah,blah, blah, blah....","review":"What can I say about this novel? I thought it would be an interesting tale about disenchanted youths dealing with post-grunge depression. Instead, I was introduced to a handful of pitiful characters with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I would rather read about people's \\"glory days\\" than about a bunch of hateful teenagers with nothing to look forward to. Honestly, I didn't finish this book. 50 pages was all I could take. So, I can't make any profound reviews of this book as I read nothing profound at all throughout the pages. You'd be better off renting the \\"Kurt and Courtney\\" documentary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"un-riveting","review":"The first thing that annoyed me about this book was that I kept having to reread sections to follow where Moody was going. I think the story would have been better at 1/3 the pages, but then I guess it couldn't have been packaged as a novel though. The characters were disagreeable to say the least, I really didn't care what happened to any of them, and the plot is pointless. But what really annoyed me the most was the way all these nonexistant locations kept popping up (the Garden State Thruway???), aren't there enough real places in Jersey interesting enough for this story? If you want to read a good story about working class New Jersey, do yourself a favor and pick up Tom Perottas \\"The Wishbones\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's \\"Style\\" and then there's Rick Moody.","review":"Rick Moody's writing isn't of a \\"style\\" as so many would praise. It's pure redundancy mixed with instances of information that is meaningless to a story. I had to FORCE myself to read through the first story of this book. And that was only in an attempt to be fair.His interjections of special detail (i.e., the kind and color of rug Ms. Rondale purchased in the first story) are not at all \\"genius\\" or \\"challenging\\". They are distracting and pointless. If they do anything to what might have been a good story, they dismember it one organ at a time.I won't call it all bad writing - but it certainly isn't the kind of writing that I'd call good. Or recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ditto to the reader from Miss.","review":"So my favorites are Thom Jones, Denis Johnson, George Saunders, Rick Bass, and the like. Someone said \\"Oh you should check out Moody\\". In a word, this book was slow. I found it hard to care about and the only thing that moved me was trying to see if more would be written about the guitarist's leather pants. It seemed like it was trying to do what Jesus' Son nailed to the wall- contempory non-beautiful people down to Earth honest to God in your face fictional realism. It didn't make it. I hesitate to read Ice Storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christians are Romantic Too","review":"I liked how the author used Christian values as a platform for expressing love. The ideas aren't necessarily creative but romance doesnt always have to be different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace on Earth","review":"This is simply the best lullaby album around. Mitchell's voice is angelic without being saccharine, and the harp is right out of heaven. I have given this album to all my 'new mom' friends, as well as my son's daycare to rave reviews. One mom told me that she played it in her nursery as she put her newborn down, forgetting it was being piped into the living room over the intercom. By the time she walked back to the living room, the rest of the family (including the dog) had fallen asleep on the sofa! You can't go wrong with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"Forget about simply being confined to the Romance genre. These four books are on a par with any top notch novelist. The writing is beautiful and the characters incredibly compelling. Roberts has written four achingly beautiful heartbreaking and ultimately redemptive books about the triumph of the human spirit over all forms of darkness, hurt and abuse. I loved that four men from such broken pasts and four women who have endured their own kind of cold and heartbreak could find the faith to find love. These are novels of depth and passion and of such terrific human insight that they can be read and re-read and savored year after year. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberts best","review":"I absolutely fell in love with the Quinn brothers. My daughter has as well.

Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of books","review":"Quick read, but all of the books are pretty similar. East read for the summer. Nora does not disappoint"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Better Home Movies!","review":"Low budget is one thing, but I have truly seen home movies made with hand-held camcorders that looked better than this film. It is so dark and grainy that it's at times difficult to see what's going on. I had to turn the sound way up to even understand what was being said.Other than that, a few good-looking, young Mexican men stumble through this awkward, melodramatic soap-opera ditty, never really touching on anything that rings true. It's neither moving, nor funny (though it tries at both). Banality would have been refreshing in comparison.If someone lends this to you, you might want to take a look at Mike Ruiz and Irwin Ossa. Then again, why not just look at pictures of them in the internet; it would be infinitely more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherrfully Funny!","review":"Cheerfully cheesy fun is guaranteed in this sexy, melodramatic soap opera about what happens to a Latino pretty Boy whose hormones go in to overdrive, when his goodlooking cousin Angel arrives for an extended stay. Not the best movie, but it does have some great laughs, and at times it seems a bit crazy, it makes up with the great story that seems to captivate you, and dares to go where those few movies are willing to take you. Check it out it, you will have a good time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin Boys Go to Hell","review":"amateur, and the cast isn't that good-looking; but I got sucked in by the title and front cover anyway.

It's a little campy and over the top at times, but suspenseful and gripping as well.. Kind of like those Telenovelas (Latin American soap operas) that are all over this film (maybe not quite as over the top, but if you watch, you can see the parallel)...That's another thing.. I love the symbolism they use...which is so bold, I can't help but love the drama of it all.... That and the attractive cast certainly doesn't hurt either....It's not a provocative, challenging film by any means (who says it has to be anyway?), but it's a very entertaining, dare I say tantalizing gay indie film....I guess I'm a sucker for this sort of thing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love basically everything else Mick Barr does or has done. However, I can't listen to this album. It is one 33 min song, with three seconds of insanely fast guitar, and then four seconds of the same feedback, over and over. The guitar work is awesome, but because the repetitive feedback interrupts so often, its basically the only thing I hear. I wish I could edit out the feedback, the the other reviewer did, then I would enjoy the cd.

Dyme Hit List hits its intended target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish This One","review":"Let me be real as real as can be: this book was not that great I'm almost shocked at how many people rated this book so high. I had this book for a minute finally got around to reading it, I tried my damnist to finish it but I couldn't.The plot to me was not as creative and lacked serious conflict between the two main characters--particularly the primary character, Rio. I felt that character never really paid too much of an enough price for being a player. The rest of supporting characters were forgettable or annoying. The dialogue and humor was a tad boring and was lacking an imagination.I will be readingSins of a Siren (Strebor on the Streetz)soon cause I do want to give Curtis Alcutt another chance to impressive me with his writing.

I'm very skeptical that I would get such a divergence in scores if the words in the post-test weren't just easier.The book itself seems to be pretty informative (just reading it now), but I still think it's sleazy to try to stack the cards in your favour like the author has done in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - use the book with the tapes","review":"This book is fantastic.

They'd kissed once. Obviously they knew they liked each other! And poor Maria. And poor Ken. They would be good together. I also think Andy should become a story line.

The sound is great but the performance they chose to use wasn't the best. I originally thought that this DVD would be the best performances of the whole stiff upper lip tour compiled into the one DVD but it was only one single show. I saw them during this tour at the Continental Airlines Arena and that show was 10 times better than what is on the DVD. I think the reason why they chose it was becuase of it being a huge venue and a sold out crowd. The behind the scenes extra footage wasn't all that great either... just a quick 10 minute or so interview with only about 2 minutes of talking. If you have money to burn and want to check it out, it won't be the most dissapointing thing in the world... Probably just not as much as you expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best AC/DC concert in the world!","review":"This concert rocks!

A little raspy but it has always been that way. Yes they are dinosaurs, but they can still rock. gotta also be one of the most humble bands around.

(Yes, Texas also had a regulated and uniformed Marine Corps and Coast Guards.) Illustrations of associated flags, jacks, guidons, and naval signals are icing on the cake.Details of regulation dress are sometimes obscure or conflicting, and more information may yet emerge, but until then, this is the book to get.

The story keeps bogging down and the narrator isn't likable at all until she reveals her deep, dark secret.

I called the company that produced it (a microsoft vendor) and they have yet to get back with me with the resolution.This program is extremely more complicated than frontpage and does not have a simple way to learn exactly how and when to use all of the many features.

I've been using it for a couple months now, and besides the fairly frequent hangs, it'll occasionally undo the changes you just made when you save, has difficulties pasting in from a Word document, and creates and absurd amount of junk CSS at the top of your page by default. I frankly don't need an entirely new CSS class if I want to bold and italicize one word on a page, yet it'll create one and throw it at the top, so if you do a lot of formatting, you'll have a mountain of junk CSS in your header. It does handle CSS a million times better than FrontPage which offered virtually no support, but it still has a LONG way to go and probably should've been subjected to a couple more months of Beta testing before this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Professional!","review":"I have used Microsoft Frontpage for a number of years. Basically to produce simple websites for local Schools or Societies that felt they needed a web presence. The major convienience of FrontPage was its simplicity and usefull design templates, essentially using FrontPage was like using a wordprocessor. When this came out as an upgrade to FrontPage I bought it. The problem is this is too professional, essentially it functions like Dreamweaver. If you want to make professional websites for a living fine. However, if all you want to do is produce a simple information providing website, without all the Javascript bits and bobs, then stick with FrontPage."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a step down from Frontpage!","review":"I'm very disappointed in the new Expression Web from Microsoft.

If I tried to build anything more complex than a basic html page, it failed. The CSS wouldn't attach.

Wrong intonation marks (and believe me, that is important)2. Very strange choice of transcription signs for vowels. It bears no resemblance to actual Thai sounds. I think that IPA (International Phonetic Association) signs would be better with proper explanation.3.

Abraham tithed ONE time in scripture. God promises His BLESSING on GIVING, not tithing. Supporting a Christian corporation is not God's plan, meeting the needs of His people is. Tithing CORRUPTS ministers who have NO scriptural example of living from tithes. Paul worked and he told the elders and ministers to do likewise. (Acts 20:33-34-55) This testimony is true, read your Bible. Maybe the \\"Matter of love\\" he refers to has more to do with money and lifestyle enjoyed by a huge number of corporate church ministers.

He is 17 and was so taken with it that he read it twice. It is even better knowing that it is based on a real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Credible","review":"I gave up half way through this book. It simply is not credible to me. I'm 66 and have traveled fairly widely in the world and the book just does not ring true.Generalities upon generalities and human interactions that don't match with my personal life experiences at all. Within minutes, interactions going from distrust and suspicion to complete trust.I quit after the three outlaw miners, described as despicable personalities who were ready and willing to beat him up, then suddenly gave him part of their gold dust and their only rifle for no good reason and nothing in return.It smacks of major bogosity.If you want to see what truth looks like, try \\"Adrift\\" by Stephen Callahan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think of buying this junk","review":"I was very, very dissapointed with this book. After having read the amazing story of Theodor Kröger (a German who survived not only the Tsarist prisons but also the communist gulags) I wanted more of this and so I ordered this book. But what I got was a kind of telegram-style book with so much ommisions in the story, that you wonder why did somebody write it at all. If you can't get the story right, then don't tell it. Also, this is supposed to be a non-fiction story, but the dialogues between the lead character and his captors and/or fellow-prisoners are put on paper like they were held yesterday. If you're looking for a Papillon story, you better look somewhere else. I didn't even finish the book, it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me","review":"Entertaining from start to finish.

It's hard to put this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"All the superlatives belong to this tale: remarkable, daring, unbelievable, amazing, incredible, beyond belief, extraordinary. That a person could 1. escape from a Soviet labor camp, 2. in the dead of winter, 3. from the farthest eastern point of Siberia, 4. after suffering from hunger and brutal treatment for three years, and still 5. make it home to Germany safely after another three years is a story for all lovers of survival dramas. The author expertly and faithfully chronicles Josef Bauer's account without glossing over the details of what it took to survive. I didn't come to like Mr. Bauer from this telling, however, I did feel a deep respect for his perseverance and stamina. Two other books of escape and survival that I recommend even more highly are: The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom by Slavomir Rawicz and We Die Alone: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance by David Howarth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, worthwhile read.","review":"While reading, I couldn't help but think; no matter how bad times have been thay pail in comparision to this mans. After reading I had an interesting talk with a fell soldier. I had stated that I found it hard to not feel sorry for the man, and that I had to stop and remined myself that he was a Nazi and earned his punishment. My comrade said something that will stick with me, and I think is worth mention. He said, not to view this man as a Nazi but as a Patriot of his country, just like all soldiers he didn't make the polices of his governmet, but he felt the need to fight for the cause of his country. It made me think long and hard about the way I veiw my enemy combatants and the treatment of prisoners of war. And the great injustice that soldiers pay the heavest price of war.A very good book that I had trouble puting down and was disapointed at how abruptly it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things we need to learn or already know","review":"This is a book about things that you will learn as you live your life, or things that you have already learned by living your life.

About your typical depressed teen dealing with your typical depressive issues. How does this one handle them? By setting things on fire! Well, it is a (relatively) new concept, but who wants to read a book about an arsenist?Perhaps PUSH is simply not the series for me. While Cut (by Patricia McCormick) wasn't half bad, it wasn't half good either. Perhaps they aim to the overly troubled and depressed masses- but what help could this book offer to an arsenist?

I could not put it down although I have a few problems with it. The information was interesting for Apes fans but the author put too many of his opinions on what he felt was good or not good about the movie series. Just report and we'll decide. I particularly disagreed with his harsh criticism of James Franciscus as Brent in \\"Beneath\\". Also, a few inaccuracies:P.114-The Cheinco wastepaper basket has Aldo on it, not just a Gorilla Soldier. P.120-The new Apes cards are by Inkworks Card Co., not Rainbow Card Co.. P.151-Lew Ayres played Mandemus on \\"Battle\\", not \\"Beneath\\". My biggest complaint was chapter nine about other movies/t.v. shows with primates in them. WHO CARES!

I was astounded by the methods that Dr. Green suggests. His advice for the majority of situations is to \\"smack\\" the child. This is exactly what I am trying to avoid in disciplining my child. And his advice for keeping your child in his/her room when put to bed or sent to time-out is to tie one end of a rope around the door handle and tie the other end to something else so the door will only open slightly. Is that supposed to be professional advice?? That sounds almost abusive to me.In addition to what I consider poor advice, the book was written in the 1980's and seems a little out of date in several instances.If you are considering this book and are looking for alternatives to smacking your child or tying them in their rooms, I suggest you look for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a philosophy I endorse","review":"I read this when I was pregnant, and found it mildly amusing.

I couldn't listen to my baby cry for up to 10 or 15 minutes without offering comfort and presence. As for tying a door shut when a child has been sent to their room, again, I couldn't do it.I would recommend T Berry Brazelton's 'Touchpoints' as a better book for parents of young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a doctor who understands!","review":"I am staggered at some of the negative reviews of Toddler Taming.

This book ridicules parents who opt for non mainstream approaches to parenting and basically advocates a \\"whatever works best for you is fine\\" approach to parenting.

However, a romertopf is less than a third the price.I bought this pot because of its dual use.

I wonder why the media have not picked up on her lack of experience compared to other authors. On that experience and her Madonna-esqe publicity sense, she has based a thriving business which by all accounts she runs well. However, that does not make her an experienced admissions officer and it shows in the text. This book will of course give students some case studies to base their own applications on, but ultimately, it won't help all that much besides the many well-published facts it regurgitates about admissions.

Every page in Rock Hard Apps contains interesting facts and pragmatic strategies that are relevant NOW. Even if your child is not considering Ivy League colleges, the suggestions in this book will help him/her submit a strong college application."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book got me into my college","review":"This book got me into my (currently one of the top 10 in the nation) college. It provided the advice and the necessary attitude for me to get into the school of my dreams.Using it, I really learned how to write an application that would maximize my strengths and minimize my weaknesses, and how to present myself to a college admissions department.The principles in this book are valuable for anyone writing an application anywhere, but its greatest value is of course in college applications.The important part is that the advice in this book was worth $30,000 to the parents who approached this counselor, but you can get this advice simply by buying the book.

I only left off one star because, since I have some poor illiterate relatives who never registered births or deaths and lived in isolated areas, sometimes the book seems to assume that one can find treasures in the attic and that there are records if you just look.

It was so bland, predicatable, and corny. I wound up reading a lot of this to my son, who did enjoy it, but I was bored out of my mind. Any excitment that this book tried to introduce, I saw coming miles before. Simply awful. Also, shameless plugging for her merchandise. The kids in the book wear official \\"Carole Marsh\\" watches. Give me a break! The fact that one of the main characters in the book was named \\"Mick\\" after Mickey Mouse should tell you that this author lacks any sense of creativity or imagination.

I am very disappointed, this stuff is New-Wave pop that reminds me more of Bananarama or the Go Go's than her work with Alex or the way Queensryche covered \\"Gonna get close\\".While I can appreciate her talents and singing abilities, this type of music isn't my cup-of-tea at all.

He usually worked alone, most times outnumbered and rarely was outwitted by his adversaries.This should be a required reading for students in Louisiana schools...they should revere and remember the heroes that help build their state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read if you are into intellectual history. No real connection with the Cold War","review":"I was assigned this book for a graduate seminar and had to write a book review on it. Otherwise I would have quit reading right away.I don't see any connection to the Cold War in this book. It was about 3 different think tanks in the 50s and 60s where Gilman goes through the evolution of the drafting of modernization theory. Gilman only shows the so what factor a handful of times as to what good these guys did during the Cold War. One was how Rostow was the driving force behind the Vietnam war. And one think tank briefed the senate in 1960 but Gilman does tell us what happened after the briefing.If you are into hearing about what a bunch of academics did in the 50s and 60s while sitting around talking to each other at conferences and their arguments in the books and articles they published. You would enjoy this book. This isn't what I like about history so in my opinion this was a waste of 2 days of my life reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"my husband loved these","review":"I bought these for my husband for Christmas a while back (he's a HUGE Falcons fan) and he loved them! Wears them constantly, and they are still in good shape after a few years. I'd totally forgotten about buying them here, until Amazon reminded me! I've grabbed them myself a few times to shuffle out to the mail box or something and they are very comfortable. Kinda pricey, but that's NFL stuff for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"fo' real?","review":"Is anyone else creeped out by the all-too adult themed cover for this talented young star-----(sigh) another young star that is being exploited in the wrong way.

As far as what I could tell, this poor quality live Stooges CD was the only title that the French label Starfighter had ever put out. 'Live 1971 & Early Live Rarities' is dubbed as an unofficial release, just the same. First six songs here - \\"I Got A Right\\", \\"You Don't Call My Name\\", \\"See Me Dancing\\", \\"That's What I Like\\" + two more are from a very poor quality fan (obviously) recorded tape. Gig took place at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis sometime in May, 1971. However, all is not lost. The last four songs on this [for completists only] piece are actually okay - at least for demos and rarities. I sort of liked \\"TV Eye\\" and the aptly-titled \\"Ron's Jam\\". On the back cover, this CD notes \\"Due to unavailability of certain master recordings, surface noise may be evident on certain tracks\\". Yeah! You think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"how many pages left?","review":"Lots of original ideas, pretty iffy execution.Some emphasize the feminist credentials of the book, but why? Just because there are no men left on Earth/Mars? If so, the gender aspect just doesn't seem very pronounced or relevant. Could have been all male characters and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. I certainly expected a more radically different worldview there.But mostly, after a while I didn't really care about what happened to the protagonists. I just couldn't buy into anybody's point of view or stay interested in the plot. Or, for that matter, really understand what the plot was about.Your mileage may very well vary however. There is so much cookie cutter sci-fi out there that the writer deserves praise for breaking out of the usual subject matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would help me with my bio class. After reading the first few chapters I felt that the book did nothing but confuse me. This layman guy seems to have no organization, and the chapters seem almost random. He jumps around from idea to idea without transitions. Topics that are completely unrelated are covered in the same paragraph. I have found my biology text to be alot easier to understand after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well written and easy to follow","review":"Excellent book! I found it to be very easy to follow. The author really has a grasp on the subject matter and presents it so clearly. I would definitely recommend this book for any level of student be it high school or college. This book is far superior to any major text that can be very dry and boring. The author makes learning fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY CHEAP!","review":"Was made very cheap, most of the drill bits broke off with a little pressure, would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"multiple parts make for an easier timevarious pieces complete a selection when needed at same placewould reccomend to others"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools kit","review":"Better than expected for the price. Handy to have in the house; beats having to run to the garage for hobby/maintenance work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bits","review":"It's not a horrible deal for the money, but if you're looking for a set of reliable bits don't get this one. Most of the smaller HSS bits snapped within 10 uses and the screwdriver bits had similar problems. The screwdriver itself is not well made and the mechanism falls apart/fails on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I've owned this set for about 5 years. Nearly all of the driver bits are destroyed from proper use. They strip and break very easily. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, many of the bits are identical. Of course, you will be bending and breaking them often, so that's why you need 10 bits of the same size! The screwdriver isn't solid, the magnetic bit holder detaches from the base way too easily, and the set is just lame in general. Buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"Great product for the price. Better quality than some others you pay the same money for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it so far","review":"It seems to be decently well made for the price. Have not used it yet but will have to see how durable the parts are after sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought my first house about 3 years ago and one of the first tools I bought was a cordless drill. When I went to buy bits and drivers for it, I thought I'd save a few dollars and get this B&D set. The second time I used one of the drivers, the bit holder (which is what attaches to the drill) sheared of while driving a screw. Now all the driver bits are worthless. The drill bits themselves have held up OK. I've broken two of the smaller ones, and the others have held their sharpness for the most part. As a replacement for this B&D set, I went out and purchased one of the Craftsman Speed-Lok sets and I couldn't be happier with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get misled 50% of items are the same","review":"It says 109 pc, but what will you do with 109 pieces of same size bit.Don't get misled 50% of items are the same thing, so think it 55pc set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"For the price I guess I shouldn't complain. You do get a lot of little pieces. Unfortunately they won't last long. The screw driver handle on my set started to come loose after one use. Not worth the effort to return. Probably ok if just used lightly around the house, but not in the shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor quality","review":"I've had this kit for some months and never used it much until this past weekend.It seems the driver bits are made out of something like pot metal. In the course of hanging some bicycle hooks in the garage, I stripped seven -- yes, seven -- of the Phillips head bits. This was under minimum torque on an electric driver. The bits each stripped and became unusable. I examined the screws carefully, not a sign of rounding or egging on the screw heads -- the driver bits are made of junk.The same thing happened tonight -- turning a simple T10 hex screw on a clock case, and the bit stripped. Again, no damage to the screw.FYI, I'm not a novice with tools and this was not user error. I'm very precise with fasteners, having spent better than a decade wrenching on motorcycles for a living.This kit is low grade and I am tossing it as soon as I can find a better replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small jobs","review":"The Black & Decker 71-968 109pc Accessory set comes with almost everything you will need for small jobs, plus it has it's own carring case.

It's expensive and the soap bar lasts maybe 2 shaves - after which you can supplement with your own shave gel, but then what's the point of the razor? The worst part is because they rely on the soap bar as a guard around the razor it's very easy to give yourself a nasty cut without realizing it. I had a cut down the entire back of my thigh, which I didn't stop because I couldn't feel it happen. It was so painful I couldn't sit properly for days. After doing that a few more times in various locations I gave up. Shower time is supposed to be relaxing, not a time I have to concentrate super hard to not come out maimed. It's not worth it, try another razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"i bought this because few of my friends said it is nice and handy.but, the soap part was gone really quick and fell a part in a week.it was too quick. my friend said she doesn't shave every day and the razor stays good for decent time. i like the idea of this razor that we don't need to use shaving cream. it is so easy. I guess this is good for people who don't shave everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty between sisters","review":"I loved this book. I gave it to my sister, who is always been there for me. She cried as she read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their 2nd best","review":"This album is good has some good songs like \\"Mouth for a War\\" and \\"A New Level. It is not as good as The Great Southern Trendkill in my opinion, though. Still a good album if you like Pantera I would buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of the heaviest albums ever","review":"I think Pantera is one of the heaviest bands out there next to Metallica,Ozzy and Helmet. VDOP kicks butt with songs like walk,a new level,f*****g hostile,conceit,live in a hole & demons.this is one of their best albums next to CFH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Album Cover","review":"what can i say but wow, the guys in Pantera shelled out one of the sweetest CD's ever, if you go on a trip and can only take on CD take this one it is good, really good. It doesn't deserve a parental advisory though, that was the only thing messed up about it. Dime Bag kicks his 6 string into high gear and goes all out not holding anything back. Phil's vocals are unbelvable too, it is SWEET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure distilled anger and despair","review":"This is my favorite album of ALL time. I listen to a LOT of metal and nothing comes close to the power and intensity that this album exudes. From head thrashing pure power and anger ( F***ing Hostile) to despairing and darkly beautifull ballads ( this love) this album has absolutley everything. If you love metal ( or even kinda like it) YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM, I can't say enough it is just that damn good. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantera at their best","review":"This is an old cd but is still one of the best cd's i own. This is probably their best album to date & is a must for anyone who likes Pantera. Anouther album worth getting is \\"reinventing the steel\\" which is their latest album & is almost as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rock and roll album that makes you feel like a VICTIM","review":"This is the most solid, explosive heavy metal album out there. Such speed with such utter precision is hard to find. This classic continues to amaze me every time I hear it. It pounds around the room with obscene energy, it is filthy rich with guts and talent. Turn this one up loud. You will be listening to a phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Breaking","review":"I notice there are a lot of reviews defending Pantera or the opposite, ripping them to shreds. At the end of the day who cares what anyone else thinks?I listen to most types of music and wouldn't consider myself a 'metal-head'. However, there are times when all I want to hear is some heart-pounding drum beats combined with finger-shredding guitar licks. In this case, I turn to Pantera and VDOP.Nothing really compares to this CD at full volume in the car, stunning my speakers and onlookers alike. I love metallica, but even they seem like Hanson compared to the sheer brutality of Pantera's music. I find it good motivation for that monday morning at work, or before a big football game. By demons be driven, this love, f**king hostile, regular people all get my blood flowing and fired up.If you like b*lls to the wall, flat out, relentlessly hard and agressive music, buy this CD, you won't regret it.If you don't like this music, don't listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever","review":"Pantera is go They were the best metal band to ever exist. Dimebag was the best guitar player ever. To the a**holes who think Dimebag sucks Go to hell you know nothing about him. Anyways vulgar display of power was a great CD. The Best Songs Were This Love, Walk, Hollow, and mouth for war were the best, So if you are a true metalhead you will love this album.Again to all the Green Day Haters F**k You!!! And also Green Day Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar Display of Ineptitude","review":"In all my years of listening to metal, I never got why Pantera was so revered. What puzzles me even more is that the same people who hold this band on such a high pedastal are so quick to bash nu metal bands like Slipknot and Mudvayne when, in reality, they are pretty much the same thing.Repetitive down-tuned chord progressions passed off as heavy riffing? Check.An annoying vocalist trying to sound like a tough guy, but ending up sounding like a fourth grade school bully? Check.Meat-headed \\"you don't understand me\\"/\\"I'm tougher than you\\" lyrics? Check.Formulaic song structure? Double check.Face it, people. This band was never anything more than a high-school headbanger MTV band, and a dead guitarist won't change that. All their talk of killing trends and being the defenders of heavy metal was nothing more than a smoke and mirrors act to cover up the truth that they were just as manufactured, if not more, than any \\"alternative\\" band of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good...better we need!","review":"this album could have been better. there's no great classics except from this love and hostile. if you need better albums: cowboys from hell is just made for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top metal albums of all time","review":"I have bought this album probably 20 times in the last years mostly for friends to discover, even people who normally prefer softer stuff. This album kicks you in the face with a steel toed boot of devastation. This album rocks harder than anything prior or since. In my opinion veteran metal head opinion it ranks in the top 3 albums of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"By Demons be Driven song is not correct on this album","review":"Love Pantera. Love the album. But be aware this download does not contain the original song \\"By Demons be Driven.\\" Instead, there is some sort of bad remix of the song which doesn't even compare to the original. Amazon, this needs to be corrected or at least noted somewhere so buyers are forewarned. If you want the real original album and one of the best songs, download this from somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar Display of Music","review":"The ex- kings of glam who trie to be a metal band only get worst with this one. I think if they replaced Phil Anselmo on vocals, they would have more chance to be a real heavy band. anyway, there are some good songs on this one. And the cover artwork, well, forget about it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull-all they do is scream!","review":"My head hurts and my ears are bleeding. All Pantera's frontman does is scream! He's also a little too high on the explicit lyrics level. If you want great metal, look elsewhere. Vulgar Display Of Power is not a good choice. However, Dimebag Darrell is a very good guitarist, so one star for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACKSTREET METAL FOR LIFE IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE!","review":"YES WE HAVE A MATCH FOR THE BACKSTREET BOYS NOW.BOTH BANDS DOUND EXACTLY ALIKE.EVERYONE PROBABLY AGREES WITH ME TOO.BUY THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH ALL THE REST AND ADD IT TO YOUR'E BACKSTREET BOYS COLLECTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done already","review":"I liked this so much better when it was called \\"Master of Puppets.\\" That was a better, more original album anyways.

Buyer beware"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 20 Metal Album Of all Time!!","review":"This was the best of all Pantera's work, I love all the albums but this one hands down is the best. I would rate this album with Slayer's South of Heaven, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Metallica's Master of Puppets, or Anthrax's Among the Living!! This is real metal raw and in your face, the way it should be!! There's a lot to love on this album Phil's piss & vinegar vocals, and Dimebags (R.I.P.) skull crushing guitar work. Mouth for War, Walk, and By Demons Be Driven will having your grinning in sinister delight!! Grab a copy of this album, and let your aggression flow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Speed Metal classic","review":"VDoP is, without a doubt, Pantera's best work--a Speed Metal classic.

The LP 2 plays way off center, to the point of being unlistenable. I don't just mean my copy; I mean ALL of them, as I've tried several copies shipped from multiple locations, all returned. Stay away from \\"Far Beyond Driven\\", too; Every single copy skips. Shame on whoever works in quality control at the sham of a record plant that pressed these. They better get things straight for the other Pantera releases in fall 2010."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been 13 years since I bought it...","review":"...and it's still the best album ever.\\"Forever, stronger than all!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake metal for rednecks","review":"This is one of the absolute worst albums of all time, from one of the worst bands of all time. This is the ultimate poser album (as Pantera themselves were posers who changed styles constantly to make money) . Pseudo-tough guy posturing, neanderthal lyrics about 'respect', terrible sub par drumming, and border line downs syndrome riffs all come together in the ultimate hillbilly album for people who think they are into metal, but have NO CLUE about real metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic?","review":"dont get me wrong here. this is a very good cd. but is it a classic thrash cd? thats what i wonder. it does include some great songs like walk, this love, a new level, and by demons be driven. but this doesnt strike me as 1 of the greatest thrash cds.i think the main reason i dont like it is because all they do is scream. it takes no talent to scream. as a matter of fact the only song they sing 1 note in is this love. it is still a good cd though but if you want pantera at their best get cowboys from hell. if you like the screaming there is some but they do actually sing in that 1.if your looking for a classic thrash cd try metallicas master of puppets or megadeths rust in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"All eulogies aside...","review":"This is the album where they strike a nice balance between DD's virtuosity and the band's trademark rawness and aggression.More funky and hook-oriented than CFH.Songwriting: 9/10Musicianship: 10/10Sound Quality: 9/10Originality: 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"IN YOUR FACE AND EXTREMELY BRUTAL.","review":"This album is probably their best in my opinion.It is fast,heavy and brutal.All the songs are great with my favorite being mouth for war.If you liked cowboys from hell then you will love this one.When I hear this album I feel like getting in the mosh pit or benching sick weight.If you are feeling agressive then this is the perfect album to quench your thirst for agression.Pick this bad boy up today metalheads."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't breath","review":"What a kick in the face! Few bands have ever managed to be as brutal and uncomprimising as Pantera. The definative thrash metal album of the 90s. When Metallica sold out, Slayer left their best material behind, and Joey Belladonna left Anthrax, these guys came along and saved metal from what seemed to be the end. While not the most consistent album ever made, tracks such as \\"The Walk\\" and \\"Mouth For War\\" show why this is regarded as a classic in the genre of thrash metal. \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" was an okay album, but this easilly beats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimebag Blows kurt cobain to pieces","review":"Dimebag is dead, and the media doesnt seem to care.

Unfortunately, the band splited-up in 2003, but its compilations will always show how excellent is its work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss out, buy it","review":"This is one of the best METAL albums that has ever came out. To call them terrible is just pure studpidity. If these guys suck so bad why do most METAL bands play covers of their songs? Why are they all inspired by pantera? Looking at there past 80s thing doesn't matter people change. Nobody has ever stayed the same since birth. A lot of these bad reviews are from angry kids that would never say the stuff they said to a fan to there face or anybody. But this album is still fresh and an album you could listen all the way through. Phils scream is still incredible the only other scream i really like is tim from vod and now bloodsimple. There hasn't been any great bands coming out lately so if you don't have this buy it. there is nothing like it and will never be."},{"rating":"2","title":"hernan debasto de argentina","review":"exelente todo salio como lo acordado. el disco llego en tiempo y forma.y con muy buen embalaje .muy buen vendedor.se recomienda"},{"rating":"2","title":"My God!","review":"I can't even start!

When I bought it, it didnt leave my player for a month strait and it was on constant repeat. This is how amazing Pantera is. There are no fillers! The riffs are amazing!

DD rest in peace man, you are missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only two good songs.","review":"This album fron Pantera is very overrated. There are only two good songs on this album.

A monkey can learn to pull strings on a piece of plastic, or hit cans with two sticks. This band just throws together the same old vocals with a little different variation everytime.Just because they have been playing for a long time does not make them good. Emotion is where true talent lies, this band is just a shadow consisting of men who cant do anything beyond their pathedic band so they capitalize on people who liked their previous work. They have no emotion and are poor because of it.I would give them one star, but there is one nice riff on the album, nothing special but its a nice ten seconds compared to the rest of the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Metal Album of ALL-TIME!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this album listened to it once and gave it to a friend of mine. Unfortunately, we work together so I am repeatedly exposed to this trash. As someone who grew up with GREAT metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest to name a couple, in my opinion this is NOT Heavy Metal any more than Lawrence Welk is. Heavy metal music is not just fast riffs, there is actually some melodic flow to TRUE Metal music something almost completely missing from this CD. \\"Walk\\" and \\"F***ing Hostile\\" are the only cuts that are not utter agony to listen to. And even those are somewhat ruined by a lead \\"singer\\" who does not sing ONE note the entire album, just screams at the top of his lungs. The thing that aggrivates me most of all is that Testament, at one time one of the greatest Metal bands ever, has decided they want to sound like Pantera II, and that, along with the departure of Alex Skolnick, has COMPLETELY destroyed the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"youve gotta be kidding","review":"Do not buy this album its the worst album ever made. dont get me wrong i love loud intense heavy metal but this is just noize. the singer screeches and you can hear his throat almost about to explode every second he whails out his peverted lyrics. the rest of the band just pound on there instruments. i honestly love loud angry metal. but metal is supposed to be energenic. passionite and have some musical value to it. pantera dosent have any of these qaulities. they think that if they can sound angry theyre all set. does it really take any talent to screech like an insane serilal killer? all pantera are is a bunch of cocks---ng loudmouth mother fu--rs who scream furiously and have no idea how to play theyre instruments. if you want real metal check out 80s metalica. slayer. system of a down. Rage against the machine preferably there self titled album. f-ck PANTERA."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 disc edition","review":"I am sick of these companies re-releasing and re-mastering already fine works. Most re-masters I've heard from heavy metal bands crank up the treble and low-end, effectively de-composing the bands' original sound. The only metal that needs to be re-mastered were our old Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath albums. Read the horrible reviews of the re-mastering of albums like Kill 'Em All vinyl edition, Cowboys From Hell, Cannibal Corpse The Bleeding, Deicide, etc. and you'll find this trend needs to be killed.As far as this new edition of Vulgar, it seems this was not remastered. Here is my gripe; Ever heard the \\"newly discovered\\" piss yet? It smells like it. Hollow is a strong track to end the album and (to companies listening) putting piss at the end of albums as \\"bonus\\" tracks sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad all C.D.'s aren't this great","review":"\\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is easily one of the best records in my collection...probably THE best. Blazing riffs, amazing solos, inhuman songwriting, great drum fills, vocal hooks...this album has it all! Every one of the songs on here is great, everything about this album is perfect, and every song really makes you appreciate great music. You're just not metal if you don't own and love this C.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Disc","review":"Pantera's thrashing metal riffs and screaming vocals are absolutely amazing. When I listen to their songs I hear obvious Metallica, and Black Sabbath influence. If you are even remotely into metal I would buy this album. It just cranks!!!There are a lot of people that don't give metal the credit it needs, and deserves. I am not bashing the pop scene at all, because if something is good I will give it props. I just don't agree with the overplaying of songs on radio, MTV, and such. I just think more people need to expand their horizons and listen different kinds of music rather than listening to whatever is on the radio. I mean, if you are having a bad day and are mad at the world, you don't wanna pop in \\"I want it that Way\\", you wanna hear some rippin metal!

If you don't have this album, you need this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantera's Best","review":"When Pantera crashed onto the metal scene, with Cowboys From Hell, they expanded the bounds of heaviness, power and awesome riffage. Here they refined their groove thrash sound and made it rougher, less melodic and eliminated what was left of the cheesy hair metal singing. The result was their best album and one truly powerful record.Every song has an abundance of great riffs and solos. All dynamic ranges are covered. In a split of the second, the late Dimebag Darrel's riffs could go from acoustic and mind crushingly heavy. Listen to the riffs in Walk, after the second chorus in This Love and Regular People. Thats something you don't hear anymore.Rex and Vinnie were also able musicians who could keep up well. Phil's vocals, cover all territory from singing, shouts, and screams.The highlights are Mouth for War, A New Level, Walk, F---ing Hostile, This Love, Hollow and Rise. All the tracks are great though.R.I.P Dimebag Darrel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Varg Vikernes is a dolt","review":"Vinnie did not die, you goof, it was Dimebag.

Phil Anselmo traded his hairband high pitch yells on Cowboys From Hell for pure screaming metal, Dimebag and Rex turn in some of the most grinding riffs ever, and Vinnie Paul is today's modern metal drummer.

I feel strongly that this song says exactly that. The whole Vulgar Display Of Power album is hard, heavy, and relates to everyday life. It's not about religion, it's about the terrible things that people do in life, sometimes to other people, and to themselves. I give it a high rating of 4 because Pantera shows the emotions in their songs that others may think are too risky to elaborate on."},{"rating":"2","title":"'tis a tragic loss","review":"But I heard one guy say something positive.Bon Scott, John Bonham, Cliff Burton... now Dime.

However, they sold out with this album. The tried to go commercial to reach a greater audience. I uderstand why but I think it wasn't a good idea.

Just listen to the appropriatly titled Vulgar Display Of Power and know what I mean. Phil Anselmo's vocals are never good at all. Dimebag's guitars are tasteless.

WHY","review":"Can someone tell me why an artist re-records their own songs when there was NOTHING wrong with the originals. Like most 80's albums, this one suffers from the 'let's do a remix' thing. Chris Rea has redone most of the songs on this set including a single which had only been released the year before. I refer to 'Let's dance' which was redone to a disappointing outcome. The difference is annoying. The most notable reworking is 'Fool if you think it's Over' which I cannot understand. The original was just beautiful ... why destroy it? The original is difficult to locate on CD, so thanks for being inconsiderate record company! 'On the Beach' is also redone. Once again, WHY?Note that the Australian hit 'Diamonds' is missing, and one wonders why that was never released overseas as clearly it is better than several tracks on this set. This compilation could have been so much more if they had left the originals intact.

I returned the CD and will order another one from a different vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to rip off your mates.","review":"This \\"how to win\\" book focuses on the host of home games. It sets out to explain how to exploit personal relationships and pretend friendship in order to win from less experienced players. There is little or no advice as to the play of the cards. Examples are based around some remarkably dumb cardboard characters. So much so that it is hard to relate the advice to real situations. Most of its advice is of the \\"get them drunk\\" nature, and has very little to do with poker as such. Even if you are as unpleasant a person as the book's protaganist, it would be hard to find the mugs to exploit. Basically the book's implicit moral position is highly questionable. Its redeeming feature is that you can read it as a cautionary tale, just to make sure that you are not slipping into some of the traps described."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish","review":"Kind of fun to read (and not without one or two moments of genuine value), this book lays out a plan to win money at home poker games on a regular basis. The theme of this plan: Surround yourself with losers -- the bigger the losers they are, the more time you should spend playing with them. Wallace's \\"moral\\" is that it's a good thing to deceive and manipulate people who are of weak constitution, because they can be controlled and you can get in their wallets. This is rather pathetic, but it's the thrust of all Wallace's work: If you find yourself losing, bully the winners out of the game and fleece the losers yourself. You may win a few bucks, but your poker will suffer. And if you adopt a general \\"Wallacian\\" mindset, expect your non-poker life to suffer the same deterioration from avioding anything challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"This amazing book is for advanced players as well as rookies","review":"This book has deep meanings and concepts that may not be understood by beginners but lots of these concepts will not be lost and will work for inexperienced as well. If you are moderate then this book is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not quite completed and miserable book.","review":"I have to say that I'm giving the book two stars because I was actually able to finish reading the book. It was SO depressing. There was not even a glimmer of light in this book. The ONLY \\"character\\" I found the smallest bit compelling was Max the dog, and even he was killed!Also, the book left open way too many ends. It was as if the author got tired of writing his own book and just wanted to finish it up as quickly as possible. And who could blame him, it was pathetic.I belong to a book club and this was one of our selections, one of the members said \\"it was like a bad car wreck, nothing good about it but you had to look\\". I guess she was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I usually agree with the Amazon reviewers, but not this time, so maybe it's just me. Lawrence was not a sympathetic character like Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder or John Connelly's Charlie Parker. In fact, I can't think of one character in the book that I didn't think was a total loser, including the dog. Lawrence lies on a police report because he's convinced by the mayor and chief of police that it's the best thing for the town; of course, it doesn't hurt that he's being promised a promotion. From then on, he whines about his situation and is constantly asking for help or borrowing money from his semi-girlfriend who is annoying as he is. And then he wonders why his ex-wife won't let him see their little boy anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"In defence of book and author","review":"I feel I have to defend this book and its author after reading reviews by Bobby 77 and r.smith. I dont know what kind of books they normally read, but if they thought this book was \\"pathetic\\" and \\"depressing\\", then they should read romantic fiction instead. This book is obviously too intelligent and well written for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despair, Depression, Complete Passivity","review":"I could not figure out how the writer spent 6-12 months of his life with a character who thought so little and did nothing. Lawrence's alcoholism didn't bother me, this bothered me: someone kills his dog and tries to kill him: he doesn't try to find out who did it, he tells no one, he barely thinks about it.And that's just the extreme example of his characteristic response to pretty much everything. It is as if Collins set himself the task to write a battered woman as a male cop and make the battered cop the hero of a \\"crime novel\\". And justify it with the \\"noir\\" tag. But I should qualify that: plenty of battered women show more spunk and initiative that our hero. All it is is a relatively un-insightful account on a man sliding into depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Music & No Rachel Dancing","review":"I wouldn't have bought this if I'd realized it was a CD instead of a DVD. The music is as it should be, but I was disappointed because I have Bellydance Superstars 3 and thought this would also feature dancing & not just music.

I am not opposed to more modern music for bellydancing, but I don't like this artificial club beat overlay on these songs. Besides, if you already own some bellydance music, chances are you already own the same or better versions of Bel Arabi, Enta Omri, Bitwannes Beek, Ala Meen and Zeina.The ones I do like on this CD, and find usable are Turbo Tabla 4 and Isham Houshan's drum solo.I use the Bellydance Superstar CDs 1, 2, 3 and 5 for my class, but this CD stays on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"This cd is good.

The story was not able to flow very well as the book is overrun with slang terms (he keeps interjecting to explain the meanings) that I swear he must have made up in his shower, b/c depending on what part of the states you are from you will not understand. It is a typical tale of a hustler on lockdown who has Ms. Perfect (educated, intelligent, affluent with a great career) who hangs on his every word praying for the years to go by as she patiently waits for him to be released and get his \\"legit hustle on\\". It is also full of typos (who the heck proofreads these things).

We do that when we eat animals and plants. If we said that the Yeerks were wrong for trying to survive, then we are wrong for eating plants and animals. Maybe there is a better way to survive then by taking over planets, like symbiosis, but the Yeerks don't know that, just like we don't think about substituting meat and plants with something else. Cassie understood that, and she accepted to be infested by Aftran to show her that maybe there was another way. Maybe what changed Aftran was the fact the Cassie didn't hate her, but pitied her. Maybe thats what we need to change Earth.

I would have had the Ellimist tell Cassie to go ahead and morph the caterpillar and tell her how she would be able to morph out.

Yeah, Your System Restore, Sent Email Files","review":"I recently was forced into installing QuickClean as it comes bundled with Virus Scan and Firewall.

Do you store mail in there, mail you refer to for documentation, back up and to see what you may have, or have not sent a client? Gone, wiped out, totally non-recoverable according to McAfee...not only that, ever had to use your System Restore feature?

Their noted size is not a true one. This doesn't match any other shoe manufacturer in the US. Were these made in China, designed for bound feet? The opening does not allow the foot in more than an inch.Also, if you return these due to their poor sizing (i.e. too small), get ready to pay $$$$ for return shipping.Suddenly, Zappos is looking more attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Lo story","review":"This book has a fairly detailed account of the kamikaze strike on the St. Lo during the Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944.

The author has a wonderful eye for detail and communicates a deep appreciation of architectural detail of the numerous churches that played such an important part in the experience of the pilgrimage. I did have initial reservations about the role of the car in his journey, but his descriptions of the road won me all the same. I particularly liked his quotes from and responses to earlier writers. He has a keen sense of the historical setting and impact of the polgrimage, which I found fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"the armchair guide on the Camino","review":"Having cycled sections in France and Spain of the El Camino, and having read, Mullin's book before and after sets the context of this review. Mr. Mullin's brings both a joy and liveliness to the art, architecture and history of the El Camino that is conveyed in parts with both a serious attitude and often a playful tone. His dialogue with past authors is delightful. Like others, I have returned to this book a number of times. For the cyclist I would pair this work with Bettina Selby's on the Camino. I would even go so far as to suggest bringing both in your panniers for the delight of reviewing their adventures of a day with your own. It is a pity this book is out of print, but used copies, though getting more expensive ( I got mine for a few dollars a number of years ago) are still in circulation. As this book becomes more difficult to get I expect the price will rise.

If the reader can get past the author's paranoia, there's a lot of interesting information in it to be found. It gives an overview of the Mythos, the \\"gods\\", and the basic storyline of H.P. Lovecraft's base that he incorporates into his stories. Good for RPGers, and anyone else whom holds a fascination with Lovecraft's ideas; if they can get past the author's obvious negative view of the Mythos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book expecting some much more than it delivered. I expected a complete and drawn out compendium of the Cthulhu Mythos, what I got was a confusing mesh mash of useless information.

If they are this book won't help you much."},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief","review":"This heretical tome does nothing less than rob H.P. Lovecraft of the one thing he had in his life, his FICTION. Hear that folks? FICTION. So for all the pseudo satanists and poor drab souls who want to believe in the Necronomicon, knock yourselves out. You'll get your fill. If you enjoy Lovecraft's stories this will probably irk you the way it did me. IF Pelton existed, and IF he believed what he wrote than he would have been a great subject for a Lovecraft story, a poor deluded man who loses his sanity dealing with a subject he knows nothing about. If you are into role playing games however, I'm sure you can find some use for this. As for my copy, it does a passable job as a drink coaster for my end table."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this final book of four was i believe to be the most intense.

The prose on the first page of this book is enough to make anyone with a modicum of literary awareness just wince. It's like reading the writing of a self-important fourteen year old who has decided he or she is an author. I can't imagine what anyone saw in this in the first place, but this book hit the wall shortly after I opened it as a gift. There is so much better available out there; don't be deceived by the modestly interesting cover.

Nonetheless, \\"Youth\\" is definitely a more completely satisfying effort, in line sound-wise with 1999's \\"Dosage.\\" The band replaced a guitarist without missing a beat (pardon the pun), and has churned out nine punchy, punctuated, arena-ready rockers to go along with two well-crafted ballads, \\"How Do You Love\\" and \\"Under Heaven's Skies.\\" It's a pull-back to their strengths, which is not surprising considering the personnel shift, but it's fun and it delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best CDs","review":"I got hooked when I saw the Kellogg's commercial featuring the song \\"Better Now\\". I would just buy this CD for that one song. It's hip, catchy, and motivating. But then got to listen to the whole album. This CD rocks!Does anyone think Better Now sounded like Davie Bowie? He rocks too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Wave-ish","review":"Sort of a broaden extension of whatever their last album was. Ed still uses that good ol' keyboard since experimenting on Dosage onwards (Anyone who disses this instrument must go back ten years.) Musical scope has changed dramatically since the alternative boom (Bands came and went. Good or bad). Good reason to give this album a try then if you were around 1995 (Like I was 14. Heh.) Hey, it's not too late to try this baby out. Want a good beginning, get the their 'blue' album in their heyday. Get the compilation for those (like me) who don't wanna search in complete vain for that CD or even a pack of CDs you wanna get specifically."},{"rating":"2","title":"More quality from Collective Soul!","review":"One of Collective Soul's strengths is that their songs sound different from one another. This is no exception with Youth. From the beautiful 'Under Heaven's Skies' to the upbeat 'Counting the Days' and 'Home', each song has a different quality. I recommend Youth to any Collective Soul fan, and for those who haven't heard of this group, give their songs a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collective SELL-OUT","review":"Worst album by a formerly great band I've ever heard. This album is Pop-lite garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Collective Soul CD ever!","review":"I have all CS cds and this has got to be their worst, and after 4 years of waiting. I've had the cd two weeks now and really tried to like it, but just can't. I wish they would breakout of the same old formula they use in writing their songs. Take a chance once in a while and stop over producing everything. Rock and roll is not a perfect art form. I wish there was more edge to their music, sound like a live band blowing real music. Don't need to fix every mistake because that's what gives the music character and realness. The Self Title and Dosage remain their best work. I am a huge fan but will not be blinded to just love everything CS puts out just because it's them. Hope I don't have to wait another 4 years to be disappointed like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE IT UP","review":"I truley think this band needs to give it up!

But this one, I skip past nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Collective Soul Album","review":"If you're a fan of Collective Soul, this is another album to add to your collection.

It's very much a flashback to the early days of Collective Soul and their successful blend of pop and rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collective Soul is back...","review":"...and better than ever. \\"Youth\\" is a fresh breath of air on the radio. First single \\"Counting the Days\\" is classic CS and was a big hit. The new single \\"Better Now\\" is a little edgier and is one of the catchiest songs out today. The album sounds a lot like \\"Blender\\", which is not a bad thing. Go get this album today!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best...","review":"I own all of Collective Soul's CDs and I love them all. I bought this one the day it came out and have been listening to it since to try to have it grow on me. I don't like this album. I can't name one song I like. Nothing stands out on it. I was so dissapointed. I was expecting so much more. My favorite CDs of theirs is \\"Collective Soul\\" - I love almost every song on that CD. This one is NOTHING like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Great!!","review":"I am a Collective Soul fan, yet my review on this album is not tainted by that fact and is as unbiased as anyone's.

This album has a great tempo, balance sound and is not too rock neither pop, sits in a nice sweet spot..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explaining...","review":"Read a lot of the reviews on this album, and thoughts on some of the ones that preceded it...a little insight perhaps. If you'll take note this album was released on a new label...the band was in a contract/artists rights dispute with their original label. They were trying to get out of a contract that left them with little to nothing money wise and minimal control over the product. They didnt take the PRINCE route, and completed their obligations without much fanfare.The lyrics to Counting The Days go into this a bit...and the lyrics to which one reviewer stated made no sense (Perfect to Stay) are mostly a reference to the label rep that sold the bill...Anyway, overall i really like the effort and can appreciate the Artist struggle revealed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it get better?","review":"I have listened to some clips online and thought the songs were catchy but when I popped the cd in and heard it the way it was meant to be played I was blown away. The mixing on this CD is spectacular! Every song is very full sounding but not overdone. Better Now kicks the album off and it keeps kicking until the last song which tones it down a bit. Its impossible to listen to this cd and not have one of the songs stuck in your head...I take that back..its impossible to even listen 1 song and not have it stuck in your head. Go buy this now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I loved it! It's wonderful to have a new Collective SOul CD to add to my collection.

They make good songs and don't pretend to be something they are not. This is an excellent record. Not a dud can be found.

Nice work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great CD","review":"I have liked collective soul since they came out. This cd does not fail. Him, I think is the best song. It has a great hook.

Other good songs, How do you love, Better now are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great CS album","review":"I didnt expect there to be this many reviews. I like that. I think this is another great album from collective soul. they haven't changed much, but why mess with a good thing. they've just lightened up a bit, more like the self-tiltled album of '95 except the drums still hit hard (being a drummer, I like that). 'Counting the Days' rocks about as hard as any anything they've done and the rest of the songs, however lighter are just as well written(as usual) and good. I give this album 4 & half stars really but it rounded out to five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"Just got done listening to the new cd from these guys. I've seen some negative reviews on it, but i disagree ... i think the new one is pretty damn good! I've also read that some of the guitarwork on here is weak due to having a different guitarist on here, disagree with that also. The sound is a (little) different, but there's not much change, the energy is definitely there and they sound sharp, even with the new guy, well \\"Him\\" is a pretty weak track (IMO, u might like that, who knows lol) but i highly recommend this to anyone. Buy this, listen to it and while u listen to i guarantee youll move to it, you cant sit still while listening to it, I dare ya to tell me I'm wrong. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD","review":"This is the best CD. I have listened to it like 5 times already. All of the songs are catchy and everyone that has heard part of them has loved them. We listened to the CD at work, and I promise, everyone loved the whole CD. I hope Better Now is the next single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Going Strong","review":"It's not like the guys of Collective Soul have ever had a disappointing release, but \\"Youth\\" is right up there with their best work. They have always been able to effectively balance heavier, rocking songs and soft, beautiful ballads and that trend doesn't stop here. Songs like \\"Coutning the Days\\" and \\"General Attitude\\" will have you banging your head while softer tracks like \\"Under Heaven's Skies\\" and \\"Satellite\\" will have you mesmerized by Ed Roland's still incredible voice. I highly recommend this album to any Collective Soul fans or fans of rock music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album yet!","review":"I have been a Collective Soul fan ever since I first heard Shine back in 1994. Even during the hiatus since the last studio album, I have remained faithful. After listening to this album, I am convinced that the wait was worth my time. There are songs on the album that are sure to fit any mood. There are hard rockign songs (Counting the Days, General Attitude, Feels Like It Feels Alright). There are songs that fit a more classic rock style (Better Now). There are deep powerful ballads (Under Heaven's Skies, Satellite). If you have not bought this album yet, don't take my word for it. Listen to sample clips and decide for yourself. This is definitely one emotionally moving album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Youth","review":"Youth brings back the energy of their self-titled CD.

And it's prctical. How so? Well, how many times have you taken a chance on a band and bought their cd only to find that it's got 2 to 3 good songs on it at the most? Youth is not a greatest hits cd, but it sounds like one. Every song is a hit. Every song is unique. Every song immediately grabs you. On top of that, it gets better and better every time every time I listen. The cd should come with a warning label because it's highly addictive (vocals, guitar, et al). As for future cd's, I'm counting the days - yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youth pleases","review":"I've been a huge Collective Soul fan for years, my brother and I have all their albums. The new album \\"Youth\\" is another great musical journey from those rockin' Stockbridge boys. A few of the songs \\"HIM\\" and \\"General Attitiude\\" hinted back to previous albums with a more hymn-like feel at times, while \\"Counting the Days\\" and \\"There's a Way\\" get back to those great riff-rock tunes we've all come to expect from C-Soul. However, I have to say, since the departure of Ross the glory days of searing white-knuckle solos and perfectly fitting arpeggios and licks are gone, don't misunderstand me, the catchy multi-layered quality is still there but not as emphasized and imaginative as in days back when. All in all another awesome catchy batch of songs from one of the most underrated groups today."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Back!!!","review":"I must admit that, at first, I was disappointed with the album. I'd been waiting for 4 years for a new release and expected something similar to the style of their last two full albums (Dosage and Blender.) What I heard was something completely different. Once again, Collective Soul, has redefined style and created their own blend of thrilling rock. Their recent live shows have featured many of the songs on Youth, which fit in perfectly with 'Shine,' 'The World I Knew,' 'Run,' and other classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic, wishy-washy pop-rock.","review":"Collective Soul has really lost their soul. The departure of guitarist Ross Childress may or may not have something to do with this, as Blender was as much a commercialized venture into radio-friendly pop-rock as Youth is. I must say I'm very disappointed in Collective Soul. While I do enjoy this type of music sometimes, it is not what made me a Collective Soul fan. I did not start listening to them to get this kind of music. It's interesting how many reviews this album has, though. Perhaps in their worst musical moment, Collective Soul is finding their best commercial success. Which is a depressing comment on the state of the music industry today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love all of the songs!!!!","review":"This is the best CD I have listened to in awhile! I guess I have never paid attention to Collective Soul before, but once I heard the song \\"Better Than\\", I was hooked! I even have that song as my ringtone on my phone!

I was devasted to learn that Chris had been so tragically killed just when he was making his mark on the music world. I for one will not let his memory die.

This story of adventure, treachery, and love takes place during the English Civil War, when fellow countrymen are found enemies, and are set against each other, Roundhead and Cavalier, Parliament and the King. Many hoped for the same thing: justice. But, for a long time, neither could find it. In the midst of all were the Beverlies, the family of a faithful Cavalier, who died in service of the king. His four children were left orphaned when their mother died of grief. Then, word came to them that the Roundheads were going to burn down their estate, Arnwood. Fate sent them into the hands of an old forester, Jacob Armitage, and they escaped to his cottage. From there, the story unfolds. It is a classic worthy of shelving in libraries, in private or in public collections, recommended by many educators, and by me, with all due praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery, action, The Children of the New Forest has it all.","review":"The Children of the New Forest is a lovely book.

I have used the paring knife a few times, more out of necessity than anything, and the wood handle is already discolored and looking as though it's ready to splinter! I have only had this knife set out of the box two weeks. A decent set of knives is something I have been wanting to purchase for quite some time, and I was so excited to see these on your site.

This set bears the respected name of Sabatier, but the knives are actually made in China. I have owned the set for approximately six months. I wash the steak knives in the dishwasher with no problems. The wooden block is sturdy and looks good in my kitchen. The knives perform nicely, but the metal is a little on the soft side. Repeated sharpening is required to keep the knives in the best working order. Still, it is not a terrible burden because the knives are not expensive. This set is good for a beginner or a cook on a budget because it contains all of the necessary knives to do most cooking, and the steak knives are great. I have been wholly satisfied with this set of beginner knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Well, I have Sabatier set made in France and it is beautiful.

The cutting shears do good work and the knife sharpener is an added bonus.One curiosity with this set is the fact that there are 14 slots in the ugly block and only 13 knives (the block unfortunately counting as the 14th piece to the set).

I am definitely not a \\"knife snob.\\" I currently use Chicago Cutlery knives and think they do fairly well. The Sabatier set is incredibly dull. I know how to sharpen knives and haven't put the Sabatier knives in the dishwasher. I was trying to cut a Granny Smith apple and found that it was incredibly difficult to cut with my Sabatier set. I pulled out my old abused Chicago Cutlery knife which has been through the dishwasher a hundred times, quickly sharpened it and it cut through the same apple with complete ease. My brand new Sabatier knives which were just sharpened with the same tool barely got through the apple. By the way there is an empty slot in the block, why? The steak knives are nice and the sharpener works well on other knives, so I'd say it's worth 25 dollars, but not much more. They'd be fine for your first ever knife set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these real Sabatier knives?","review":"I can't believe that these are really Sabatier knives (made in China and not France?)

I always put a new edge on them with a steel before using them and have been very happy with them. They cost a little more than $400.00 for a set of eight in 1992. That said, I was drawn to the \\"cheap\\" Sabatier knife set list here. The best price for this knife set would be \\"free with gas fill-up\\".

These knives have been at the top of the sales list on this web site for quite some time, I'm sure a lot of them have been sold and I suspect there are more people satisfied with them than some of the horrible reviews would indicate. I think the majority of average consumers don't write reviews on the internet, only the more sophisticated ones who tend to be more discriminating and critical . However, I am curious and have to ask this question, with such a wide range of opinions in the reviews of these knives, did we all get the same knives? In other words is there a consistency problem with the manufacturer?

My cheap, Taiwanese-made Faberware chef's knife, bought for a couple bucks at a retail outlet, beat the pants off the chef's knife included in this set. It's junk, at any price, and will be returned.

I was utterly conned. The knives don't stay sharp, they handles are cheaply made and let water in causing rust even if you hand dry the blade. The steak knives work well, as does the bread knife and scissors. But the rest is terrible. Our paring knife's tip broke off while trying to cut an APPLE.

I do a great deal of entertaining and cooking and thought these might be nice as a backup. What a shock when I opened the box and saw these knives. Sight alone told me they were junk. The Sabatier logo was poorly printed on the blades. I tried to slice a tomato and some cold chicken with each knife as a test. As dull as butter knives from the box. And no amount of work with a stone or steel could bring a decent edge to them. These are NOT real Sabatier and should not be confused as such. Don't waste your money on these. Buy one or two REAL Sabatier knives (Provence is a good line) for a little more and you will be much happier.

Note that the 8\\" sharpener that comes in the set is not very good quality, and my 10\\" sharpener will not fit in this block. The sharpener slot will also accomodate a knife with about a 1\\" blade.The steak knives with black handles look great at the table. The Precision tomato knife (size of steak knife) is the perfect size for the 14th slot, if still available.This set is a good value at the clearance price.

I'd seek the services of a professional knife sharpener, but I'm afraid that he'll end up charging me more than what the knives are truly worth in the first place! Also, they are very uncomfortable to work with. I'm not sure if its the shape of the handles, the design, the flimsiness, or a combination of all of these factors, but these knives are next to impossible to use.

They do what theyre supposed to do, but thats about it. They will also rattle a *lot*. I understand that the farther away from the body of a vehicle something is, the more vibrations will affect them, but thicker materials and more reinforcement would negate some of this. you will only have useful mirrors when at a complete stop. Additionally, they mount so close to the hinges, that you have to be *very* careful when removing/replacing doors to not scrape the paint off. If you love your jeep and dont want to scratch it or ding it or anything, but want these to look cool with no doors, take your doors off first, then put the brackets and mirrors on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man of the people","review":"William Jennings Bryan ran for president more than most sane people would ever attempt. A devout religious figure his life was filled with tragedy. While he would never be president he would make many efforts to fight for the common man and give one of the best speeches in American political history telling his listeners that he would not be crucified upon a cross of gold. My one disappointment with this book is that it only spent a chapter on the scopes Monkey trial which I think was a fascinating time in Bryan's life and deserve more attention. Overall if you are looking for a book that can take you decade through decade of the Gilded Age this is a great way to look at it. While it does not focus on the industrialization you get a much better perspective of the common Americans from this book than any other. This is a must read for anyone studying the Gilded Age"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little drawn out","review":"Honestly while the book has good points and introduces a great outlook on William Jennings Bryan parts of it may be wordy and harder to get through. Not something to sit and rush through but worth it for the valuable information it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Commoner?","review":"So.. While this book does have a great deal of very important and useful information, it is boring, and dry! The book is about the life of Wiliam Jennings Bryan, a 3 time presidential loser, who lectured on social reform, and free silver across the nation. He is said to be most known for helping the \\"the little people\\" but i'm still questioning what, if anything, of significant importance did he ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH for these \\"commoners\\"? He may have planted the seed of some great ideas but i don't see much evidence of his helping their growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sheds","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, it sheds.

I also bought the Little Touch animals book at the same time, and he has enjoyed that one immensely. But for some reason he ignores the Mr. Brown book.He likes funny noises, and Mr. Brown's noises are not that funny. Most of them seem to be spoken by a person, rather than silly sounds. There are not a lot of pictures to push on each page, so my son gets bored quickly.The story is good, so I think he may enjoy it when he gets older but right now it is a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best LTR titles with lots of interaction","review":"So far this is our favorite Little Touch Reader title. It is entertaining on every setting for my 2 year old. The background music is great for every page. And there are lots of interactive spots on each page - all of them change for each level. Someone really sat down and thought about where a kid would be drawn to on each page, and what a suitable response would be.I should set the stage by confessing that the book \\"Mr. Brown Can Moo!\\" is one of our favorites - I had the board book memorized by the time my dd was 4 months old from reading it so often.We only own two other LTR books, a spider alphabet book and \\"How much do I love you\\". I was disappointed by the thin gloss of interaction in both of these titles. My dd will only give them a passing glance unless I play along with her. And even then, she'd rather read a regular book. But she'll play with Mr. Brown any time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking color","review":"My least favorite game for the Little Touch.

Then I realized this software had so much more to offer so I went to the manual and starting reading. By about the middle of it I thought I would never learn it. The manual was all over the place and didn't explain anything in human terms so I went online and found this book \\"for dummies\\" and I would seriously recommend this book to everyone. It takes the software and breaks it down in laymens terms with even sarcastic breaks for the long time reader. It was informative and witty. I use it as the Premiere bible and it sits right next to the computer the whole time I'm working. It also offers helpful hints on how to angle the camera and the proper equipment to have. It's freaking awesome and if you made it all the way to the end of this review..you have to get it. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly retread of earlier versions but still good...","review":"I bought Adobe Premiere for Dummies for version 6.5 and was able to quickly master the basics covered in the book, then within a few months, I upgraded to Premiere Pro. I also purchased the Premiere Pro for Dummies book to get a good primer.A lot of the \\"Pro\\" book is word for word the same as the 6.5 book with the additional features in Premiere Pro covered for good measure. I suppose there is nothing wrong with that since they have many similarities. My only point is that if you have read the previous version of Premiere for dummies, it is not neccessary to rush out and get the Premiere Pro for Dummies.If you can use one version effectively you will have no problems with the newer versions. Still a good book if you are a newbie though, I would reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for dummies!","review":"It seems that this book about Adobe Premiere Pro is not only for \\"dummies\\", but it's also for those of us at the Mensa level as well. Being an advanced user of Premiere Pro, I thought there might not be anything new I could learn, but sure enough, I'm only at chapter 6, and I'm learning more new things about it than I new existed. I would highly reccomend this book, not only for \\"dummies\\", but also for geniuses as well, and everyone in between. They REALLY make things understandable.

Instead many, including the U.S., employed protectionist policies that permitted their infant industries to become strong enough to compete internationally. It does raise questions regarding how any nation in the contemporary world could possibly modernize following these policies. Should note, that I have written long articles critical of development discourse and thus may be sympathetic - although it should also be noted that the book is largely factual - the author just documents what actually took place, even if it is a history that is rarely recounted in this context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interlude Body Lotion","review":"Since I like layering my fragrance and lotions, it was nice to be able to purchase the Interlude lotion along with the perfume. The lotion is still nice and fresh smelling as I remembered in the 60's. While the perfume's fragrance seemed to have changed quite a bit, for some reason, the lotion did not. Frances Denny's Interlude is still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"what an amazing life","review":"Frederick Douglass surely led one of the most amazing lives in American history, and I think this video does him justice. I just showed it to my freshman American history class, and I was pleased by how many relevant issues it brought up,while still being entertaining, with good music, cinematography, etc. Charles Dutton did a good job reading Douglass's words, also. I thought he was a suprising choice (physically they're so unalike), but one that paid off. I personally very much enjoyed the commentary by leading historians like William McFeeley and Vincent Harding. Some viewers may be put off by their analysis, thinking that it breaks the flow of the narrative of his life (some of my students, for example), but I think the historians provided very valuable, thought-provoking comments. Everyone should know about Frederick Douglass, and this video would be a fine introduction if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Friends Series","review":"These books teach morals, how to get along with others not like yourself & that you can have more than one best friend.

I own seasons 1 through 9, both the X-mas ones and Bart Wars. My favorite seasons, although its very hard to choose, would have to be 4, 5, or 6.What I dont like is how the simpsons now on fox has that \\"perfect animation\\" and childish humor. It's hard to discribe. The humor is still funny for season 10, but it doesnt have the good ole Simpsons feel like 1-9.It is definintly worth the buy thoughAnd this is abviously not the artwork for the cover. It's just a poster for it until the real artwork for the simpsons season Ten is released from the dvd people. I dont like the heads anyway, the boxes are more colorful and just look cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lame commentaries","review":"I just wanted to add my two cents and say that if you are a total Simpsons DVD geek and listen to the commentaries, they really suck. And the people doing the commentaries readily admit they are bad, simply because they were in the middle of doing the movie. So if you like getting background information and insight in to the show, don't get your hopes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Funny","review":"Speaking as a die-hard Simpsons fan, this season just falls flat. It's like someone wrote a season of jokes and dialogueof what they THINK the Simpsons should sound like, but falls flat. The genius of the Simpsons has always been its ability to deliver the unexpected... even when you're expecting it. Here its just the opposite, the set-ups are obvious and the deliveries are clichéd.Season 8 and 9 are MUCH better. I've watched them with my kids several times and I'm still laughing out loud... But not with 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simpsons 10th Season","review":"Great. Got these for my brother-in-law as a Christmas gift.

Has anyone else noticed that about the same time these new box sets come out, (way too slow but at this point saying that is just being redundant). The syndicated show shows the same season which just came out. In order, no less!! I really pisses me off, because I know it's just a cheap way for FOX to advertise the sets. It makes me not want to buy them. But I do anyway, but not because of that. You're not fooling me FOX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shipped on time","review":"My husband and I love The Simpsons, so when the tenth season came available before Christmas I ordered it. I was very surprised that it not only came in before Christmas, but that it was on time!

(maybe it's better than season one, which was a huge experiment anyways). BUT WAIT! I don't find it unwatchable, it's rather enjoyable, I laugh through it, it's better than a lot of TV over the past ten years (especially in the comedy genre). So I would rank this as a buy, but if you are looking for a gift for someone who does not own any on DVD, I would pick seasons 3,4,7 or 8. The Tokyo episode is the best one. AND, for practical purposes, I would stay away from the plastic simpsons head cases and buy this one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Excellent t-shirt for any youngster who loves drums!

I've found plants in this book that I could not identify on the web or through local nurseries. I was not able to put this book down for hours after it's purchase and continue to use it almost daily.

Having grown up along the Erie's former New Jersey & New York subsidiary and the Erie's original main line the Piermont Branch I was a bit disappointed that there was not enough \\"color\\" in terms of a story about the actual running and operations of the railroad and its interface with the communities it served. Well written, but I must confess it took me two years and some re-reads to get through it. Definitely essential for anyone interested in the EL, but only worth about 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REST OF THE STORY ABOUT EL'S DEMISE","review":"H. Roger Grant has done a masterful job of presenting a side of the Erie Lackawanna story that never was told before publicly. He covers many of the costly mistakes made that had they been avoided, might have kept the railroad alive beyond 1976. He reveals the fact that during its first three years after the merger, the Erie Lackawanna experienced much the same kind of infighting by the Erie and DL&W factions as the Penn Central experienced with the Red and Green team feuding. It was this feuding that almost sank the company. Mr. Grant also points out equipment modifications to locomotives that should have been made to make the two diesel fleets more compatible with each other, but weren't until several years after the October 17, 1960 merger date, which merged the two railroads in name, but remained two in operation until after 1961.This, too nearly sank the company. i highly recommend this book to fans of this railroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed Like a Very Long Read","review":"Hi all. I have been reading this for months and it isn't getting any more interesting as it progresses. A big train buff, I usually enjoy this type of book. Unfortunately this one just seems like a very boring history book to me. Like my favorite train book, The Wreck of the Penn Central, this one moves through the personalities of those who shaped the industry and then overlays what is happening at specific points in time, giving the reader the essence of what is happening. It just doesn't read as enjoyably as the Penn Central book.I really want to finish the book but I truly doubt I ever get through it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Quammen has compiled a thoughtful and entertaining collection of his essays for THE BOILERPLATE RHINO.

He brings out his experiences, and the science of things so eloquently and entertainingly. You'll finish The Boilerplate Rhino - which is really a collection of 25 of his best column articles from Outside magazine - in a few sittings .Quammen's nose for news keeps him on his toes in discovering the reality of the natural world. He won't rest till he's seen or investigated or read up tremendously (Quammen is immensely well read) on a subject he gets a little keen on. THAT is what keeps the reader hooked onto his writings, experiencing an involvement, thereby taking yet another step into the beautiful world we still know so little about.You will enjoy The Boilerplate Rhino as Quammen takes you on his journeys into places as far out as the Sundas to as intimate as your very own backyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"The song selection is great, the sonic quality is horrible.

This is music that bounces out of the stereo and makes you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Front Page book beyond the basics","review":"I have a library of Front Page books, and they each serve a purpose.

Most users of Sharepoint sites do not understand how Front Page can be used for customization, and this book will kickstart that effort to enhance Sharepoint sites.Overall, a solid book for people who want to go to the next level with Front Page. It also does a good job of highlighting how improved Front Page 2002 is over FP 2000.
