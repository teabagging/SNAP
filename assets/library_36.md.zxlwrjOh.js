The book serves as Hacker's stepping-stone toward opening the readers' eyes to the lives of writers-- from quests for equality to the perfect little restaurant.

Easy have his childhood friend dress him up as a girl. the reason is that the school is an elite school for girls. not only does he have to act ladylike (especially when he has to go to the restroom), he has to work hard to keep it a secret. while his friend, the headmistress and homeroom teacher knows, what will happen when one of the most respected girls in his class figures it out. Then throw in that he is a candiate to be the Elder (the \\"big sister\\") for the school, and also a ghost who was in love with his mother, this story has lots of laughs.now while I first though it would be bad since the only track is in japanese with subtitles, i realized that the english language could not handle the nuances of the script.

They take elements of Radiohead, Death Cab, Pink Floyd, and trace elements of Nine Inch Nails (The Factory could rival any of Reznor's ambient, piano driven balads). All these influences are there, and yet this album has a sound that definitely belongs only to The Listening. I was a fan of them as Rock And Roll Worship Circus, but this album I think really solidifies them as the gifted songsmiths and ingenious musicians they are. I caught them live a couple of days ago too, and I am amazed that this band does not have a huge national following by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aseye from Africa, Fun with Culture","review":"This is a great little sticker book which can be used in primary grades to promote knowledge about different cultures.

This should be the best-selling DVD of all time. You can forget the bootleg dvd made from crappy VHS source or the high price reg 2 DVD.The down side, there is no Original Italian language and the picture quality is just OK, nowhere near the pristine transfer of NO SHAME release of some of Fenech movies (but NO SHAME released all three titles individually in ITALY last year but no plan on US release)Until NO SHAME annouce its release, this DVD is a must have for all guys that are aware of the name EDWIGE FENECH.Highly recommended !! Order this before it gets Out Of Print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edwige Fenech Rocks, but movies lame","review":"The rare glimpses of a nude Edwige Fenech are stunning in the three collection group of schoolteacher movies, but the movies are lame, lame, lame with little memorable except the maked Fenech. The acting is abominable and the production values non-existent. Take a nap instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titilation!","review":"Only got this out of curiosity and a spike in my testosterone level! Somewhat fun. Poorly acted, lame script but I must admit Edwige Fenech is not hard to look at especially when she is in burlesque mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edwige who?","review":"Ok, I admit it, I got this movie based on one of the reviews here. Hey if it's something anyone who has heard of Edwige Fenech must have means it's gotta be pretty good, right? I wish. There were a few decent nude scenes, but I've seen better from the first Poliece Academy. And there's not much to see there. After seeing this you'll wonder why anyone would want to know the name Edwige Fenech. Maybe she did better skin flicks than what you got here. Admittedly the English translation may be part of the problem, but even if you mute the volume the story just looks terrible. Only get this if you want a few good nude scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargain?","review":"First things first - Please Amazon I hope you can find a copy of \\" La Pretora \\" and sell it here.Now for the 3 classic films.. it's a mix bag really, don't know but there is something in me that sort of likes the way how the picture quality looks - I'll call it authentic-crap like most of the flicks back then.For the measly price of under 12 buck for 3 films it's a bargain really, but then of the three only one really stands out along with a couple of scenes from the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"S'cool Teach Not!","review":"Not recommended. Somewhat light comedy but not much else. Best to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Tigers I could have done without....","review":"Wow, I have been waiting for this movie to come out for some time. I must say I was highly disappointed. I stumbled across the film while looking at Fairuza Balk's filmography, I read the synopsis, and I immediately wanted to see it. She is great, however she has a very small role.The rest of the film makes little sense. Without the weird imagery, I think the film would have been around 20 minutes in length. There was little to no character development and the plot was boring and weak. Furthermore, there was no real climax nor any resolution. The movie just ends...and does not leave you pondering over anything except what you could have been doing other than watching this movie.From the reviews I read online and the theatrical trailer, I was expecting a \\"disturbing teen angst\\" movie...something with emotion and it was none of that. If you must see this film, I highly recommend downloading it or renting it...it is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut Scenes!","review":"I was looking forward to the arrival of the DVD having only seen this excellent movie as a dark and grainy download from Veoh.

GREAT movie. It's a bit odd, but well worth the watch. I ordered this while I was still watching it on TV, so yeah, it's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Film","review":"If you are into high action or full detailed storylines, this movie is not for you. Otherwise, the low volume in the voices, the extra wobbly camera angles, and real landscape adds some idea that this is a low budget film. This movie is not for young eyes to see because of some sexuality involving young teens, and adult language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit confusing at times - but so is coming of age!","review":"Beautiful, touching, and totally understandable by anyone who grew up as a gay boy. It's a little disjointed, but I have a feeling that's intentionally mirroring the mental state of the main character (who is a very beautiful and sensitive boy). It's a sweet, touching film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice Before Buying!","review":"This movie is even more muddled and hard to follow than most customer reviews tend to indicate. As a fan of foreign films, I am accustomed to storylines that do not follow the Hollywood formula, but didn't just abandon the formula, it was painful to watch. Some scenes were so odd that I have to wonder what the director was thinking, while others clearly didn't play out as the director intended. The pacing was glacial, the acting was stiff and wooden and the characters were two dimensional bordering on stereotypical. Save your money and buy this one at a yard sale for 50 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've ever seen","review":"This movie is awful; after 30 minutes I stopped watching and threw it in the garbage...really.

I also own a Griffin FM transmitter. After placing the Ipod in the case, I tried to plug in the transmitter...........no such luck!! The case is too bulky on the bottom, and does not allow the transmitter to be plugged into the Ipod. Poor design by this company, considering they designed both items!!! Try another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect case for only $3","review":"Short and sweet review. I have a 80gig 5.5 generation ipod. This case fits like a glove. The clear plastic is great quality. You must try this case first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"For those of us still using the video ipod, this a solid, easy to use case. Considering the price (which was low...at least when I purchased the case) it makes it an even better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised!","review":"I orded this case instead of others based on the fact that one of the photos shows it with a lanyard attached, so I thought I was getting a case with a lanyard. Not so much. The case seems to be decent, not great. Doesn't feel as sturdy as I thought it would. That, combined with the lack of a lanyard, earns it 2 stars IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Out There","review":"This is the case I've been looking for - a clear case for my 60 GB video iPod. If fits very snugly, and it protects the screen very well. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is for 2 reasons. First, before I even used it there were some minor scratches on the case where the screen would be. I've noticed this problem in other reviews too. Second, there are weird air bubbles between the screen and the case causing minor discoloration. Its not noticeable enough to really care though. Overall, it is a great case that is not overly bulky, and it does not take away from the look or feel of the iPod's original design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit the 80 gig 5.5. generation","review":"I bought this item based on the positive reviews, but it DOESN'T fit my 80 gig video ipod (5.5 generation)!

The shipment was quick and everything was in tact. over all a good seller, I just misunderstood what the product was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says it does","review":"The case looks nice and fits nicely. The only problem (other than the price tag) is that it does not easily open. I have ihome speakers that the ipod with case does not fit into, and to get the case open you have to stick something in it and jiggle around... I used a credit card. It's frustrating, but as a case it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched and I haven't used it yet","review":"Hi-I noticed a couple of light gouges/small scratches on the packaging but just figured it was on the outside of the sealed blisterpack. I opened it (easy perforated blisterpack thank you!) and the cover of the case-right where the ipod's screen would be-has 3 or 4 noticable scratches on the front. It must have come through the package but either way I didn't pay 25.00 to have scratches on it. So now I have to take it back. Ironic how the package reads that this is scratch resistant.Haha very funny! It does fit my 30 gig ipod great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable Sound and Volume Output","review":"As is the case with all iPod docks, you will most likely be disappointed with the sound quality and volume output that these devices produce. However, it is not so much the device as it is where the technology currently lies at. This dock, which I bought, is basically useless unless you use the iPod's \\"lossless\\" sound conversion format. Even then, the volume output on any home theater will approximately be at 50% the level as your CD/DVD player, set-top box, etc. would be. I am running a $25,000 home theater system and still cannot find an acceptable sound quality and volume level. Do not waste your time or money. This is a poor investment unless you can find one in the $30-$50 range - cables included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I've been waiting months to get my hands on this item and what a disappointment. The menu does not fill the screen on a regular 4:6 TV; there's a bar on the left and the words get cut off on the bottom - and it doesn't even look square. The menu navigation is slow and I couldn't even change any settings. Like I said, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks!","review":"Griffin usually has great products for the Ipod, I bought this only because it was on sale, and it looked like a sweet accessory.

What attracted me to this CD was of course the Delta commercial and that was all it took. The whole CD is one that you can listen over and over again.

Also check out His \\"Adiemus Variations\\" for strings on the Diamond Music album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Melody Rediscovered","review":"Adiemus is a haunting composition brilliantly realised on CD. I heard it on radio in the late 1990s when it was released and it took me until a month ago to track it down. I particularly like the lyrics being \\"non-language\\", a bit like scat singing for a classically trained singer. I was worried that the rest of the album would not measure up to the standard set by the first and most popular track. I needn't have worried!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to be carried on a dream, hear this music","review":"I heard this music on an airline commercial, and searched high and low for it until finally tracking it down.

After listening to the CD, I was surprised by all the excellent reviews. I agree with the reviewer who gave it one star, this CD is boring and monotonous. I should've bought Pure Moods instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing.","review":"I first became aware of Adiemus after purchasing the Pure Moods I CD (the first track of this CD, \\"Adiemus\\", is track 08). Amazed at how the vocals seemed as if the whole of a small nation were singing, I purchased this CD, and Adiemus quickly became my favourite group -- of any genre of music. Potential Adiemus fans and collection builders should begin here.Although all the songs feature extended phonetic vocals, the songs vary in intensity and fervor. \\"Adiemus,\\" \\"In Caelum Fero,\\" the heightening-in-crescendo \\"Cantus Iteratus\\" and \\"Kayama\\" are among the more bombastic songs. Complementing (not contrasting) these songs are the more mellow \\"Cantus Insolitus,\\" \\"Amate Adea\\" (the best song on the CD, IMO), and \\"Hymn,\\" the perfect 'benediction' of sorts for the collection of music. The other tracks hover in between these two distinctions.If intensity is what you seek, your search ends with Adiemus. Wherever you want to go, their music will take you there -- and surely beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 16 yrs old piont of view of this CD","review":"This CD is great! With my choral group I have sung many of these songs. My two favorites are Adiemus and Kayama. We have sung Adiemus for the past 2 years at our last concert of the year.

I dont know why people call it world music, this is no world music, and as a mater of fact not african at all, its very very english.

That said, this CD is so relaxing that I have developed a ritual of listening to it in order to fall asleep. In fact, I am not sure how the CD ends, it relaxes me so much. If you can get past the fact that it seems intentionally Philistine in taste, then go ahead and buy it. The only danger is that it is getting overplayed in advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bears many repeats","review":"The title track is the like the wildest cross between Enigma, Enya, and the choral opening of the Lion King.

I wanted to like this CD, but it's definitely not on a par with Loreena McKennitt or Delerium or Enigma. The songs are too similar to each other. The mood is not reflective or mysterious, and not particularly sensual. The sound is reminiscent of Enya, but without even her range of variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous, repetitive nonsense syllables--not worth buying.","review":"I bought this album on the strength of some of the highly favorable reviews at this website. All I can say is that tastes certainly differ. I consider this the most monotonous, repetitive, uninteresting album I have ever bought. I plan to donate it to our library sale, and hope someone else likes it--I sure don't. I could barely get through one listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"You would normally think that this is once again one of those CD's, where the first track is great and the rest is trash. Wrong! This is actually the first time in my life (36 years) that I have heard a CD/record more than ten times the same day! I have a very discerning taste, when it comes to music, but this CD simply blows me off my feet. I have only bought it today, but it's already on my top three list of my favourite pop CD's (joining Todd Rundgren: \\"A Wizard, A True Star\\" and Mike Rutherford: \\"Smallcreep's day\\"). Since I haven't heard Adiemus II and III yet, it seems that I have something to look forward to..... By the way: People who like this CD would probably also cherish Deep Forest - and of course the almighty Giacomo Puccini."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just gorgeous","review":"I remember listening to Pure Moods Vol.1 as a kid and the track Adiemus was forever on repeat. Then, in highschool I discovered that there was an entire collection of this beautiful music! It's absolutely stunning.It's strange that some people find this album repetitive or uninspired. Really weird. Because whenever I play it, I have to stop whatever I'm doing and just listen. Next thing I know, the entire album is over and I feel like I just stepped out of a dream. It's so enchanting it makes my heart skip a beat.This all probably sounds like a bunch of hippie-hoohah, but I really, really, REALLY love this album. The orchestrations, the vocals, the melody, the flow, everything. It's the best out of the entire Adiemus Project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics suck...","review":"It's a real shame we have clowns like Kurt Harding bashing things way beyond their comprehension. Anyone with the the good taste necessary to appreciate this album certainly wouldn't be deterred by some amateur (wannabe) critic's comments on Amazon. Ask any real musician and they'll tell you that the writing, arranging, and performing on this record is first-rate, let alone the stellar improvisation. Aside from a pure lack of taste, the only possible excuse for Kurt's unfavorable review is that he is one of those sad, lonely old guys who attend a local tango night and are disappointed when Piazzolla is played because it's just too deep for practitioners of Tango For Dummies.This album is killing and I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes good music.P.S. Don't miss Adam's solo on the end of Tangonator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok....","review":"This product is ok, but the relief doesn't last.

I ordered a nada back-up after a few people on a web forum recommended it.One strange thing is that it feels like I have to wear the product upside-down for the padded parts of the strap to line-up correctly with my knees, but it is at any rate one of the best posture correcting devices I've ever used, and it always accompanies me to any time I have to sit and read/study for long hours.It also corrects posture. After finals time, I went on vacation and noticed that for several weeks my sitting and standing posture were incredible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nada ain't much","review":"The Nada Chair product has not proven that beneficial. I put in on whenever I need to sit for a lengthy period of time(15 minutes or longer). My knees seem to do all the work...but I still find myself slouching. I am aware of it sort of pushing my lower back and on occasion sit up straight. Bottom line is that it does not give much actual support to the point where I have to sit erect. As to my condition, I suffer from lower back pain caused by five desicated discs three of which are bulging. It helps some...just not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a kick-aXX DVD!","review":"Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan/supporter of the X-games, or those kinds of sports. I know very little about that whole culture---so if you're immersed in that world, this review probably doesn't apply to you. However, if you're the average sports fan, or enjoy seeing some cool tricks (but would never attend an event like a monster truck rally), this could be a DVD for you. The layout of the DVD is great and easy to maneuver though. Very high production value and great footage of the events they're showing--plus they include A LOT of slo-mo replays, which is a huge plus when you're seeing these kinds of tricks. Kid friendly, as well---although I'm sure if it's shown to kids, you'll have some little daredevils on your hands. Who knows, they could be the next X Games stars (if it sticks around that long)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book for those studying Nagarjuna, as well as for comparative philosophical endeavors in general","review":"This slim volume comprises an overview of the ways in which Nagarjuna's main text, the Mulamadhyamakakarika, has been interpreted by Western philosophers. Tuck covers the major phases of interpretation, from the earliest period in the 19th century, when Nagarjuna was primarily understood as a mystical Idealist, to the more contemporary reading of Prof. Robert Thurman, who sees Nagarjuna as providing a Wittgensteinian remedy to the linguistic malady we call philosophy.This book, surprisingly accessible given that its topic is so esoteric and specialized, not only provides a historical overview of how Nagarjua has been understood by his Western readers, but also more generally attempts to provide a theoretical approach to the heremeneutics of comparative philosophy. An excellent and essential read for any students of comparative philosophy and religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite terrible","review":"wow! i was expecting the great japanese band only to get horrible christian music. did they name themselves \\"bleach\\" because they are polluting the modern music scene?

The first CD consists of the Dvorak and Schumann Cello Concertos, Tchaikovsky's Andante Cantabile and Glazunov's lovely Chant du Menestrel. The Second consists of lesser, but still lovely, cello pieces and transcriptions from Rachmaninov, Chopin, Schubert and Schumann. I wanted a restrospective of Rostropovitch and this fits the bill: classic cello works played by a master of the cello. To my ear and fancy, he does a much better job on the Schumann Cello Concerto than Jacqueline du Pre (EMI Classics). Her's is agitation; his is romanticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst hose i've ever bought!","review":"This hose looks pretty, but that's the only compliment I'd give it.

Cool, the game comes with its own version of Agent Smith! The game would also freeze if I changed controller options, oh DEAR!!This is a trend in PC gaming - releasing games that are not ready for prime time then patching up the code later.

My criticism of this particular cd and amazon as a buyers website, is that nowhere on the product detail page did it say when it was remastered and where it was imported from. The cd was remastered in the early 90's and the import came from British Columbia. The technology has come a long way since the early 90's and I've found that the best imports to buy remasters from, is Japan.

This book reminded me of those great Nancy Drew/Trixie Belden books we used to read, but it has considerably more substance for today's more sophisticated youth audience.

This switch took care of that for me. Now the sound is very good and I still get HDMI video to the TV. In short, I bypassed the HDMI sound to the TV and optical sound from the TV. Sound goes from my HDVR and my disc player directly through the switch and then to the sound system.

The dial selector feels solid and locks into place. However, after only about a week, I could get no reliable output signal from the device. Looking at the end of the optical cable, it was obvious that the signal was greatly attenuated (dim and flickering).

The first unit I received never worked. The replacement unit worked for a few days and then I started getting dropouts on the audio. The switch works by simply moving a flexible piece of fiber between the ports and the switch components are too flimsy to accurately align the fibers consistently.

Over time it has become progressively harder to manipulate the switch and button to obtain a clear audio signal. The switch was probably defective from the start and should have been replaced right away, but the mechanical design of the switch leads me to believe the switch will have a short life span particularly if the switch is toggled frequently between audio inputs.

I wouldn't let your kids muckle onto this thing and twist away to there hearts content.... it's not made for that. As long as you go easy on this switch it will do what you need it to do for many years. I didn't notice any of the losses that some of the reviewers have mentioned, but fiberoptics are EXTREAMLY sensitive so it wouldn't take much of an imperfection in the switch to cause losses and it wouldn't suprise me if some of the switches manufactured had them.

You just press the button and turn the dial to the input that corresponds to the device you want audio for. There is absolutely no loss in sound quality as far as my ears can tell.

HOWEVER, the manual switch does not always reliably lock in place, and it sometimes requires some jiggling, tapping, and coaxing to do so. Unless the switch is solidly locked in position, there is no sound at all. Suggestion: Create/market an electronic (vs. mechanical) switch that detects the output device (TV,DVD player, etc.) that is turned on and then automatically channels the audio signal to that device.

But you have to constantly wiggle the cables in the splitter to get them to work. Once you hit a sweet spot it works fine. But when you switch optical cables, the sound drops out, and you're back to wiggling the cable to get the sound back. If you're tired of plugging and unplugging cables like I was, I suppose wiggling cables is a step up, but I can't recommend this product full-heartedly. Creating a splitter is a relatively simple concept and I'm surprised so many of these \\"audio splitters\\" are just so poorly made.(1.9.2009 update)I'd change the rating to 3 stars if amazon would let me.

Carrie Fisher, by her own admission, has refused to speak to Eddie since the publication of this book, and I can't say as I blame her. I don't consider him to be all that self-effacing. Even when he tries, it comes out as whiny and defensive.

Endlessly preaching to readers of his global fame (bigger than Elvis?)and appeal to women (really? no, really?) are so boring (and doubtful), I skipped right over them. Unfortunately this is merely a long, sordid story of what he REMEMBERS his life as. Not terribly well-written. Those portions that are the most self-engrossed will be too annoying (or far-fetched) for readers to believe.I checked this one out of the library -- I knew it would be embarassing to have on the bookshelf.

My sympathies go out to his kids who were fortunate to at least have had thier mother while their father was too busy to be part of their life.

A waste of time that will validate all the cynical thoughts you've ever had, and an apt punishment for our fascination with performers' private lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I saw this book at a friend's house. I didn't read it from cover to cover, just skimmed a few sections, and walked away feeling very sorry for Debbie Reynolds, Connie Stevens, and his children in particular. How tough it must have been to not only have an absentee father, but also to have this book highlight for all the world to see the intellectual and emotional limitations of your dad.They all deserved far better. Eddie should have just kept his mouth shut, then maybe one of his kids could have had at least the illusion that their dad had a little substance and class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Betrayal","review":"There is only one reason to buy this book, and that is because it includes the legendary Elizabeth Taylor. While she has remained a legend, Fisher faded away.This book, from its covers and within, has only one purpose: to exploit not only Ms. Taylor, but every person, especially the women he encountered, including the mothers of his children, Debbie Reynolds and Connie Stevens. He has committed the ultimate betrayal if indeed any of his tales are true: exposing intimate details of relationships of those he supposedly loved, while at the same time portraying himself as a \\"humble hero\\". Before reading this book, I actually liked Fisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's entertainment!","review":"Fisher gives of himself and proves he's as good a performer on the page as he once was on the stage and in the recording studio.

Don't spend even a penny on this book, unless you just particularly enjoy sordid and vindictive, self-glorifying and absurd \\"versions\\" of truth. I get the impression that Fisher was jealous of a great many of the people he smears in this book, and that he didn't have enough sense or decency to keep his mouth shut. He hurt himself more than anyone else by writing this book, and I don't see how anyose, especially his ex-wives or children could ever have ANY respect for him again---if they ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"been there done that","review":"I'm so glad I didn't buy the book. Eddie Fisher sounds like a highschool sophmore. The book reads in a very juvenile manner. Did this guy ever grow up or what? Is he remotely aware of how he sounds when he talks of his extremely good looks,{questionable} and his disgusting sexual conquests? Probably not.Do yourself a favor, with all the wonderful books there are to read, don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I received this book quickly and it was in great condition, even better than what I was told!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great examination of the surviving spirit","review":"There have have been questions about the truth od this book. What rings true is the deep emotional turmoil of the author as he hangs on to his hatred for his tormentors, and there's no doubt thess dark passions helped spur him on during his long and often seeminly endless trek. It's a sad book. An amazing journey of the mind and the soul can be found in IN THE GHOST COUNTRY by Peter Hillary, a mind-bending account of his haunted journey to the South Pole. Deep stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"The Amazing days ofAbby HayesLook Before you leapAbby is trying to convince her parents to let her have a pet.

The explainations on the code is clear, always re-showing snippits of code to help in the explaination of a program. The only book where you can get in-depth win32 theory and hands on code (code is also on CD in book).Only downfall to this book is that the code doesn't always work directly in the MS Visual C++ project IDE. It takes some tweaking to get it to work (which isn't easy for newbie MS VC++ coders). If you need a good win32 book BUY THIS ONE! Except no alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Intro, but needs polish","review":"This book is organized well for introducing a new person to Windows programming, but, then it should be. Almost all of the applications and much of the text is directly copied from the Programmers Manual that came with Microsoft Quick C for Windows (ca 1992). You would think the author could at least correct the typos in the sample code copied to this edition. Chapter 11 is the worst, nearly every sample code has a mistake. Many are obvious ('3' instead of 'e'), but some are conceptually wrong and difficult to get past. There is enough information in the book for you to debug the author's code for him, should you have the patience. The code on the attached CD is correct, however; which hardly helps when you are trying to learn Windows programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Programming Win32 more like...","review":"This book is for anyone who wants to learn to program Win32.

I must warn you though that knowledge of C is required. If you're a beginner I recommend getting a good C or C++ book before trying to tackle this book, but if you already have a good grasp of C or C++ buying any other book on Windows programming would be a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fela Album","review":"Be aware, there is only one tune of Fela on this album (3.black's man cry).

Example Table 5.5 of the Possibles. After trying for 3 years with unsuccesful design I find this book and my design is complete in a few minutes. Not only does this book give the probable values for good design but with it you can calculate the different parameters like gain, input res., output res., Miller cap., f (alpha). Really cool.

And lastly the book speaks to you which shows the passion of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streisand IS Superman.","review":"\\"Superman\\" was released in 1977 and was a huge commercial success for Streisand across the globe. The album is a mixture of Pop to Soft Rock and includes Ballads. \\"Answer Me\\" was originally intended for the \\"A Star Is Born\\" soundtrack but eventually ended up on this record. \\"New York State of Mind\\" is a Billy Joel favorite, which Streisand gives a great unique accomplishment. \\"I Found You Love\\" is a light disco dance track. \\"Baby me Baby\\" & \\"Lullaby for Myself\\" are quite quintessential. One of the most beautiful tracks on the album is \\"Love comes from Unexpected Places\\" & the superb Hit \\"My Heart Belongs to Me\\", both are touching and warm. \\"Don't believe what you read\\" was co-written with Barbra about her experiences with trashy tabloid... The cover was taken for \\"Playboy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Superman is one of Streisand's best in my opinion. Great pop songs, awesome vocals, catchy lyrics. The highlights of the album include Superman, Answer Me, Dont Believe What You Read, My Heart Belongs To Me, Lullaby for Myself, Love Comes From Unexpected Places, New York State of Mind, I mean pretty much the whole album.

Its a must have to add to anyone's music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Barbra but she just doesnt do it here","review":"Barbra is my favorite singer in the entire world almost to the point of obsession. So believe me when I say that this is a bad album. The songs are simplistic and vague in their subject, and Barbra's vocals don't soar like they do on most of her recordings, and when it does it sounds strained. She also is particularly nasal on this recording for some odd reason. This is unfortunately the trend with the albums done while she was dating Jon Peters, or when Peters produced. Avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More nauseating elevator music","review":"The most nasal pipes in the biz caterwaul endlessly on this embarassment.

The first chapter \\"Spirit of Seattle\\" provides a critical, big picture view of neo-liberalism and late capitalism, which the subsequent chapters dive into the specific historical background of the World Social Forum.

However, about 1 week later, he figured out all he had to do was pull the strap out and it would detach from the lock. It's not very difficult. Any toddler that can reach the latch can rip it right out of the lock portion. I put it as high as I could on my refrigerator (I have a regular top bottom fridge) but it was still within reach of my children. The adhesive did work very well, I just wish it wasn't so easy to just rip the latch out of the lock. I've given up on the refrigerator locks made to keep toddlers out, I'll just have to purchase an adhesive bracket and padlock the fridge or my 3 year old will eat us out of house and home! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - very flexible","review":"This is a great baby-proofing product. It worked on weird-shaped cabinets and we even used to to hold our speakers up (probalby not good for heavy objects but our speakers are light and tall).

It looks like it would work both sides up, but it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the screws","review":"I bought another type of safety latch before which my 10-month old son destroyed in less than 1 day.

Only problem is that as you rotate one panel into the cabinet, the other one is swinging around towards your lock which still protrudes. It's too stiff to allow the other panel to pass, thus I can only open my lazy susan 90 degrees! I'll be looking for another product now and mourning the loss of my $7 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"My 9 month old son was able to rip this off the cupboard not very good.

The drawers are at floor level. I installed the straps and they seemed to work well; the strap catches and prevents the cabinet door from opening. However, my toddler was no longer interested in opening the cabinet. He was very interested in the new strap and proceeded to pull on it. In less than a minute he pulled the strap out of the catch. I was quite surprised. The only way this would ever keep a toddler out of something is if they can't physically reach it, i.e they can't pull on the strap. I was very disappointed. This was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work on our lazy susan","review":"We installed this on our lazy susan cabinet just like the product picture shows. However, if you push the side the lock is on it just pops right open. I'm almost positive I installed it correctly. I think the problem is with the strap part of the lock - it is very stiff, and gets hit with the door every time you open the cabinet, and ends up getting bent. Once it's bent, there's no way to get the lock to align correctly. I guess I'll be trying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My 14 month old loved taking all of our canned goods and spices out of our lazy susan, multiple times a day. We installed the regular cabinet locks, one of each side, but they didn't catch right since it spins, and she could still reach her arm in and pull things out. I ordered this lock and it came the next day. It was very easy to install. It is very easy to use, and saves me the time and hassle of picking spices and cans of soup up a few times a day.

It's been a few months now and it's still holding strong.

Following the directions I let the adhesive adhere for 24 hours before use, however each one became unstuck when I tried them out. I would advise people not to use these for drawers. They simply do not stick. However the one used for cabinet drawers has remained adhered and is doing its job. Therefore I suggest to use this product for cabinets only.

This is Ms. Christie's time. This script is terrible and the direction rises to that particular occasion. For a actor who has a such limited body of work, you'd think Ms. Christie would have been a tad \\"choosier\\". Giving her the benefit of the doubt, perhaps the money was good and the free trip to Argentina seduced her. What a waste!Now, for the rest of the film. Oh, forget it. It stinks; and, more obnoxious and cloying child actors haven't graced the sceen since Jane Withers grew up.If you've nothing to do, just drag out \\"Darling\\" and watch Ms. Christie at her very best and most beautiful.

I think this book covers those areas except in its ignorance or perversion of historical Judaism and Christianity. I have an MA in history/philosphy so I know a bit about those areas. The authors have a lot of uninformed, extremely left, and malicious views about religion--esp. Christianity. They are too quick to run with some of the bad moments or possibilites of religion and never point out the overwhelming good. If their blindness and falacious statements and attacks were expunged from this work, then they'd have a solid work worth teaching to kids. Instead, they have historical revisionism and lies.

The emotions cover the entire range that we all experience in these relationships. The formal range is almost as great, although there are few poems in traditional forms. The poems are accessible, so that readers who do not usually read poetry will find much to love, while those of us who live with poetry as we live with our mothers will also find much to challenge us.

Endlessly fascinating details about movies, stars, bloopers, box office and production, you'll love each and everyone. It even includes the big \\"Pink Floyd/Wizard of Oz\\" connection legend. The story behind the movies are the best, and you'll learn a bunch of things you never knew you needed to know. Great gift for the film buff of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle John at it again","review":"The Uncle John books always have so many funny, interesting stories that it is hard not to like reading them.The many stories in this issue cover many things associated with Hollywood.From the many scandals (Fatty Arbuckle, The making of Cleopatra) to the Oscars, to celebrates who died to soon to interesting Hollywood stories (Clark Gable going to court in the mid 1930's because an Englishwoman though he was the father of her daughter even though he did not get a passport till 1930) If you are interested in Hollywood this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BZOTS","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best children's shows I have ever seen. The creative storylines combined with the loveable characters make for an irresistable adventure. What is especially attractive about the BZOTS is that it's not only a show that teaches about life's little lessons, it's a show that appeals to all the senses. The graphics are amazing and the music even makes me dance. Above all else, it's cool. This isn't your average everyday children's show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bzots are the BOMB!","review":"this dvd is such a blast to watch! i take it babysitting with me all the time. the robots are a fun new twist on characters and the music is great to listen to. if you have a young viewer, get this dvd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical but thrilled","review":"I figured the subject matter--robots and all--would mainly interest boys, not girls. But our young daughter loves it and this video quickly knocked Baby Einstein off the front burner. The songs are catchy and the very quick and colorful graphics keep her attention. Good, very original stuff. Highly recommended for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Comedy","review":"I was duped, I thought this would be a serious action movie. I would rather have subtitles than watching a movie where the words do not line up with the speech. The first few minutes had a serious gunfight that bordered on comedy and bad scripting. I didn't complete the movie, maybe I'll try again when Im bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey Fun","review":"You simply cannot take seriously a film like THE BODYGUARD. The only reason I watched it was that Tony Jaa was given top billing. Jaa is one of the most exciting martial arts stars of the decade. Here, he is in only one scene, which is played for laughs. In fact the entire movie is too. The plot is merely a device upon which the director allows the stars to mug for the camera. The villains are straight out of the Snidely Whiplash school of acting. The hero alternates between playing it straight and for laughs. For those who have seen Tony Jaa in a few of his other films, you might recognize the same actors in similar roles. Though this is a pretty silly film, there are too many scenes of gratuitous nudity and graphic violence to make it suitable for the very young. For those who can appreciate the numerous \\"in\\" jokes and allusions to Jaa's other films, THE BODYGUARD is mildly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy 1 pair of maternity pants, make them Noppies!","review":"I purchased 1 pair of these pants when I was about 4 or 5 months pregnant, and had I realized how often I'd end up wearing them, I would have gotten a pair in each color. These are a little tight in the rear and thigh, but not too tight for the office. Just make sure you purchase the correct size. I am currently 1 week from my due date, and still comfortably wearing them. (I loved the adjustable waist band, which lets you comfortably wear them from the beginning of your pregnancy to the end.) All my other maternity pants have gotten uncomfortable - too tight, or just dig into the bottom of my belly. These have held up well through the washer and dryer. Definitely a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild weird and wonderful","review":"This CD is totally unlike any other kids' CD we own. Most kids' CDs have catchy songs that you can't get out of your head, and so does this one, but the songs are electronic and dancey and GOOD. My son sings the cellphone number song all the time, and the is it true that your mommy is a blender song sounds like a radio hit. The Power Down lullabye is what we use to get the kids to go to bed (time to power down, kids!) Just about every song on here is new, different and really 21st centruy sounding. Yay Bzots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"Totally agree with iowacomputerguy! Found this in a bargain bin bundled with 2 others (the others were garbage) but I would pay full price for this one if I would ever lose it! It is one of the few CD's I listen to over and over at Christmas. Laid-back, but upbeat. I've never heard of most of the singers, but it is an awesome mix of Christmas music. When I play it at parties, I always have people ask what the CD is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money or buy used!","review":"I was required to buy this book for a class at school. Otherwise, I would never have spent that much money. We discovered several errors in the book and labs during the term, and the enclosed cd does not even include a trail version of W2K Pro such as comes with the Server books. I passed my MCP for this subject using Exam Cram and hands-on experience. I did not find this book to adequately explain the material needed for the Microsoft Certification exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win2000 Profsnl/Labmanual/cd","review":"This book was in good condition even though it was use, one ding, lab book was new, cd was mint in the book, this coud have been sold as new in the school bookstore at City college, smood transaction, shipping was fast, 3-5 days I'll be buing my MS books from you guys from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien step aside","review":"I nearly quit the first book over the graphic violence. But stuck in there because it was necessary. I got hooked. Goodkind is able to write such varied characters with incredible different \\"voices\\" that he is awe inspiring. No skimming (as I do... sorry... with much of Tolkien) over descriptions & info... trust me you will NEED it all. Goodkind has become my favorite author. His characters stay with you, his story hauntingly real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell In Love w/ the Series","review":"I am not one to say a lot, but wanted to say that these are great books. I love this type of \\"fantasy/fiction\\" and these are excellent, i am swept away and can hardly put them down. I have just finished book four in the series, and i am dying to start book 5. But i am sad to say i have packed it away due to we are moving, and it is driving me crazy to know what is going on with Richard and Kahlan. Seriously this story line is great..will be reading them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the story but not the typos!","review":"I won't go into a long review on the Sword of Truth books. The story is fantastic as are the characters. I'm currently reading the fifth book. I just read (on page 583) how Jangang's troops were visiting cities, giving speeches on \\"piece and prosperity\\". Really? Piece? The other books (1-4) all had typos too and the print was running off the pages cutting words off. How does the author write such a fantastic story and have his work go out to the public this way? I think he needs a new editor! If you can look past all the typos you will love the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a quick fix","review":"This series of books is not for someone looking for a quick fix to catch up with the American television series. It's a rich, detailed journey with enough bumps and drags along the way to keep it's authentic feel running smoothly throughout.If possible, I would have given it four and a half stars. Only because each book wraps up to such a declarative stopping point that it can be a bit jarring. However, you're always left wanting more and no book in the series has yet to disappoint.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sword of Truth Box Set","review":"This author rocks...you will not be able to put these books down. Don't be intimated by the thick books...you will finish them in no time and will start the next one. Best books I've ever read. I introduced my teenage son to the first book (he never reads) and he could not put it down. A must read even if your not typically a fantasy book reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories","review":"I have only finished the first book of this series, but they are just as good as the first 3. I think they will even get better now that there is so much back story to work on. Really imaginative stories and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"temple of the winds","review":"The fourth book in Terry Goodkind's series mantians the same momentum of his previous novels. Each of his books are like opening a door to a new yet familar world. I find that reading Temple of the Winds returns the reader to familar ground vistiting characters we have come to know and love. Some story elements are a bit contrived in order to give the main characters a strugle to fight against but at the same time the struggle is what these books are all about. An engaging read that will propell the reader further into Goodkind's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sword of Truth Books 4-6","review":"Book 3 sets up the scene for book 4. Book 4, 5, 6 are all very good like 1 & 2.I already bought the other set and the reading continues! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Avoid the series at all costs","review":"People like Weber or Turtledove make it hard to tell which side is the villain because they make people on both side real and sympathizable. Goodkind does it by making them both equally reprehensible. The political platform of both sides boils down to: The other guy is pure evil. Ally yourself with me to stop him or I will kill you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Goodkind is like Hitler.","review":"I used to laugh at people who compare things to Hitler; it's too much Hyperbole which takes away from the point. Yet Terry Goodkind IS like Hitler in some ways. Case in point: Devoted followers who are blind to the truth. How anyone can think this is good writing is beyond me. If only they read something, anything else, which they could compare this to. It boggles the mind. Just another sign that these are indeed the end of days.1.God forbid he have characters that say or do things that make sense, or because they adhere to a shred of logic or cause and effect.2. I LOL'd on some of the dialog, it is so bad.3. Terry proves that the Wizard's First Rule is correct: 'People Are Stupid.' If you think I am joking, that is actually the first rule, 'people are stupid' wow, thanks captain obvious. Yet people are stupid enough to buy this book in droves.4. My God...so bad...it's just sooooo bad...I've never seen writing so bad...............so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't gotten yet","review":"I have been charged for the book set but haven't even received confirmation that it has even been shipped yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krusell Multidapt - Swivel belt clip metal","review":"The reason I gave only two stars is because I have to grind the button in order to fit into my phone holster......otherwise it looks very well finished......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"'Club Bizarre' is the most exciting album of U96 whereas 'Heaven' is the most boring !

It hasn't been imported in France"},{"rating":"2","title":"22 YEARS LATER, I'M STILL LOVING IT","review":"For the young woman in the middle of teenage angst, seeking music as a balm, a audio healing, this album was it for me.Phoebe sung my woes, my hearts, my joys and my sorrows. My heart may have been broken, but hours listening to Never Letting Go, Something So real, Majesty of Life and We're Children always gave me relief.Phoebe is as much as part of my younger years as Earth, Wind and Fire Concerts and disco's. Yeah, I was there and so grateful her music allows me to return to it again and again.22 Years later? Her music is still as fresh and vibrate now as it was then.Love you girl...Margaret"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one that made me a Phoebe Fan for life","review":"My first intro. to Phoebe Snow was the single NEVER LETTING GO. I had to have the album. Rarely do you find a work were every piece is a treasure. Miss Snow feels and makes you feel the music. Her interpretation is inspiring. Her voice a delight.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic Coloratura","review":"Dame Joan's Amina is by far the best ever recorded ! She has the trills, coloratura, the purity of tone, and the big beautiful voice to make this role her own. If you prefer acting to bel-canto, Callas's is acceptable, but next to Joan Sutherland's clear tones, I find Callas's \\"hollow\\" sound difficult to take at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I think this is a terrific album. Yes, it might be a more experimental sound, but I think is great nontheless. The sinner has become an outright classic. The whole album should be a classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"Sorry but I will never be able to understand this group ( I tried for years ). Rob Halford may be a good singer but he is mostely screaming far too high for me. This is one of my \\"favorite \\"albums from this group, with at least one song \\"last rose of summer\\" being memorable. The rest is just simple riffing with a rythm section that always plays the same thing and a voice that doesn't sound very tight in my ears. sure, they maybe an importent group for metal development but I don't hear it too much. sorry again"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!!!","review":"i may be only 13 but let me tell you i trully appreciate my music.Sin After Sin of one Judas Priests finest and in my opinion \\"here come the the tears\\" to \\"dissident aggressor\\" is one of the greatest fade ins of all time. the songs on this album show so much emotion its amazing. its also no wonder how judas priest set the stage for many bands. Thanx for reading this, jake"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Priest Album.","review":"Few bands are able to pull off two phenomenal records in a row, but Judas Priest was one of them. Though not on the level of \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\", \\"Sin After Sin\\" stays true to the original Judas Priest--a bluesy, psychedelic heavy metal act trying to make its mark on the music business. Its easy to understand why many fans of the later Priest fail to see the beauty of an album like this...it doesn't \\"rock\\" the whole way through. Not to say that it doesn't at all, \\"Sinner\\" and \\"Dissident Aggressor\\" are two of the most kick-ass Priest songs of all time. But all it takes is one listen of \\"Last Rose of Summer\\" to let Rob Halford take you to another world...where the sun is always setting and there are flowers everywhere. And a leather-clad blonde Englishman is standing in the middle of it all, singing. Whoops, looks like I'm drunk again."},{"rating":"2","title":"STRONG - GOOD - SUPREME","review":"The first album in Columbia / CBS by Priest. IT's just astonishing how Judas could always change their sound completely from one album to another, and still sound good !! As for the music here, reviewer DAniel Pinto said it all. I particularly love this album, love all the PRIEST albuns with the following exceptions: TURBO, RAM IT DOWN, JUGULATOR and DEMOLITION. They do not suck, but are not in the same league of their other albuns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cappella Country!","review":"Ed \\"Edlo\\" Cohn, Larry \\"Blue Eyes\\" Venza, Eric \\"Duke\\" Morris and Craig Knudsen (the worlds tallest living Edlo) have a real winner here. While you should really see this gang in person to fully appreciate their musical range (from Gregorian chants to Country to Acid Rock-appella), this CD is a great introduction to their Country tunes. This is the only version of Tupelo Honey that I like (I love it), and my four year old daughter loves to sing along with Eric on \\"Born to Yodel.\\" Country music fans of all ages will love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold a charge, even unused","review":"These Power 2000 batteries have shown me very poor performance. A single \\"real\\" Nikon branded EL3e outlasts TWO of these Power 2000's in my D90 grip by many times over. Further, the Power 2000's will not hold a charge in my case, not installed in the camera at all, for just a very few days. So, they are never ready to shoot when I am. Yes, they are cheap. Yes, there is a reason they are cheap. If you want a reliable battery to take on an important shoot, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power 2000 for Nikon EN-EL3e","review":"Don't waste you money on this. Bought this battery as a spare for a D300. Fully charged from the charger and showing 100% in the camera, the battery lasted about 30 images before running out. No flash or other process draining the battery. The original Nikon battery lasts hundreds and hundreds of shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good deal in the long run","review":"I purchased a Power 2000 EN-EL3e replacement with my D90 (which came with a Nikon EN-EL3as well). For the first year the Power 2000 worked well, holding about as much charge as the Nikon battery, but now after only a year the Nikon battery is still going strong, while the Power 2000 serves mostly as a paper weight as it won't charge any longer. I tried various things, charging it repeatedly, discharging it completely, etc. All to no avail. The thing is dead and on its way to the recycling yard.The worst thing, in my opinion, it died pretty much without warning. No big deal here in CT, but potentially a major headache on a photo trip far away from an electrical outlet or camera store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"This battery did not hold a charge.

They get a rude awakening when they land out of the flume, as two gangster thugs are there to greet them. They are no sort of friendly. The traveler from \\"First Earth\\" save them from the gangsters, and bring them back to the safety of the Manhattan Tower Hotel where Bobby and Spader take jobs as bellhops.

MacHale makes you think with these books that he writes. \\"The Never War\\" is one of the best books in the series because it shows the past of our world and a supposedly given future. Bobby tries to save the territories and earth is one of them. Earth is seperated into three seperate sections though. Our past, present, and future. MacHale writes in a point of a teenager which makes preteens enjoy the book more. Even though there isn't a great word choice,I love the series entirely and I rate \\"The Never War\\" a 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Of the nine books that Mr. MacHale has written, this is by far the best! Full of suspense, foreshadowing, and many cliffhangers this book is sure to please people ranging from ages eight to sixteen!

All in all, this book is a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughh...","review":"This was an okay book. I liked the first 200 pages but it started to get cheesy. The characters (especially Spader) started to get old (old as in boring). Most books I read to the last page even if I don't like them that much, but this one... Ughh. I read to the last 20 pages then returned it to my library. A very bad read unless if you don't care about the characters acting like real people."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow.","review":"D.J.

That is, it is not for absolute beginners, unless they are guided by a teacher. Otherwise, the book is excellent and one's studies go smoothly. A student using it should have access to a dictionary and, preferably, some extra exercises. The exercises are rather limited (which is one reason why the studies go smoothly :), but one could easily compensate by memorizing parts of (or whole) texts. The texts are fun, though, and it is not difficult to memorize chunks of them. The audio files are a huge help, as long as pronunciation is concerned! Repeat them as many times as you can, but I am repeating myself (see comment above on memorizing chunks of text).Service was excellent.

This was an excellent choice for me and allowed me to jump right in and start reading French again.However, I think it would be difficult for someone who didn't have even a faint grasp of the language and so I wouldn't recommend this for the absolute beginners - just people like myself who are re-starting the language. If you want to do more than just read French, compliment this with another book that comes with a tape. I would also get a French-English dictionary. There's one in the back, but it is not as inclusive as it could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"With very little French (what I got from a phrasebook on holiday for a couple of weeks), I bought this book and started reading it on the train to work. It was great. It has a good lexicon in the back, and as you progress most new words appear in the margin with a translation. It still takes effort, but is a great way to get your vocab and reading up and running. I am now reading it again, as my French improves, and it is still improving my vocab and comprehension.It has been the best book I have had as a beginner learning French."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an absolute GEM and great value!","review":"This book is one of my favorite French resources. I agree with the other reviewers that it has entertaining stories that help you REMEMBER vocabulary and absorb grammar. It starts out with basic French, but it advances quickly. There is a version of this book that comes with a CD of a native speaker reading the text. This is a VERY BIG value added feature. Interestingly, however, only 2 of the 3 sections are recorded and this is NOT an error. I contacted the publisher and they didn't get around to it! It might be present in future additions, however. Either way, it's a good solid book for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"For even the weariest of language learners","review":"I personally have about as much luck mastering languages as I would have trying to single-handedly launch a space shuttle. And I know that I'm not the only one, so, fortunately for those of us who are challenged, this little book exists.I picked it up and was reading French. Better yet, I was understanding it. It really gets you into the language and then subtly challenges you to stretch your comprehension.I would like a better grounding in grammar, but the fact that this book doesn't provide an intense explanation of grammar shouldn't count against it. That's simply not the purpose of the book.If you want to learn to read French and feel like you're actually getting somewhere, get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for adult novices","review":"My friend and I are in our 50s and started studying French on our own several months ago. We wanted something we could each read during the week then get together over coffee to talk about, in French, of course. We tried several French magazines and Le Monde, but their level was beyond us...way beyond us. It was laughable. Easy French Reader is perfect. We read the little story, answer the questions, and have a conversation about the characters. New words are discreetly defined to the right of the text and there is a more thorough vocabulary section at the back. We will continue with the series when we finish this reader. I highly recommend Easy French Reader. Maybe next year we can handle Le Monde!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I am a French native from France and I teach French for a living for 14 years. I was looking for a book for a client and found this book. I clicked on \\"look inside\\" and the first few pages came up. In this book, the adverbs are placed the way people speak English, (example: \\"I speak English well\\"). In French, the adverb \\"well\\" (bien) would be placed before the word \\"English\\" (Such as: Je parle bien anglais). I saw a couple of mistakes like that. Also, there was another big mistake: there is a sentence that has an indefinite article and it should not have it (those are very very basic mistakes). That's 3 mistakes on 1.5 pages..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"Great little reader with short articles on French history and culture that are just right to whet a student's appetite for learning more about the country and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome resources for French teachers!","review":"This is a great resource for French teachers. I use it in my classroom all the time. It also has a great section of history articles that is very easy to read for intermediate students and if you supplement a small activity to go with each reading it really helps the material stick. The history sections are short enough that they give you all the information that you need to know, but don't bore the students. The other sections are also fun and are great for quick activities for when you have substitutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrectly described as beginner to intermediate","review":"I WOULD NOT DESCRIBE THE ENDING PASSAGES AS INTERMEDIATE WHATSOEVER. If that's so then I must be advanced......20 yrs ago I had a fluent but simple French after 6 months in France. It was enough to carry on and understand a decent conversation but no use of fancy tenses beyond past tense and -ing and future. Rusty I am.What this book is is an easy French reader for beginners. It's tenses don't extend beyond what I was using in France.Surely intermediate is more challenging grammatically. The vocabularly at the end of the reader is as to be expected at the end of Beginner's French. ....meanwhile PATHETIC intermediate vocabularyThe description of competance covered is a RIP-OFF.Yes I am annoyed at the editors and publisher product description Nor do the low reviews here take the bull by the horns on my account.Worse it comes up when type in intermediate French on amazon. If book stops at intermediate clarify as such.

I am happy I did. I took frech for one year in college and tried to improve a bit on my own. This book eases you into french reading gently and very subtle progression with interesting short stories and later little comprehension excercises makes you move ahead smoothly. Had book for over a year now, and have it in my bag for my commute to work. light weight and small size makes it ideal for travel. some illustrations added, to keep you connected more to story and letters are good size to read. Also more difficult word meanings spelled out right on the margin, so you can concentrate reading the story. Smartly done little help to better your french without much effort while you enjoy a good educational story about french history or culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool!","review":"Great book. My students were surprised how easy it was for them to read. After last year's rigorous grammar program, they were pleasantly surprised that their hard work is paying off so nicely. The bite-sized stories and background info for each one help build the students' interest in and knowledge of the characters presented throughout, as well as continuing the on-going process toward enlarging their vocab base. I especially like the questions at the end of each story that prompt the students to pay attention to the details of the story and challenge their memories and skills at answering in complete sentences in French. I always assign this aspect as homework. Highly recommend as a nice addition to French I or II student curriculum."},{"rating":"1","title":"cha cha cha","review":"I took this to my dance lesson and was told there wasn't a cha cha on it.

The first was priming and painting a bookshelf. Despite thinning both the primer and the latex-based paint as much as I could without affecting the quality, straining/filtering, removing the inline filter, and ordering a 2.0 needle/nozzle set, I couldn't get a good flow and atomization of the primer or the paint. The second project was applying stain/toner/sealer to my fence, but I ended up returning the spray guns before attempting this project because of the complete failure on the bookshelf.

This book desrves a five star rating because of how realistic it seems, it just sucks you in and turns you into the main character and shows you there problems and how they were solved. This book also shows you what it was like to be an African American in the south in the 1930's, it also shows the hardship of what they went thru,like how they got treated not listen to and walked on ! Since they had different skin color.When the KKK (Klu Klux Klan) comes the, most of the blacks life are threatened (by not treating blacks right). So you can see why this book deservse a five star rating for how realistic it is and seems, so that's why I gave it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry","review":"When I read Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry, I could not stop reading this adventurous yet touching book.Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry takes place in Mississippi in 1933. The book is filled with joyful times but also hard times for the African American culture. For me this book was also a learning expericance to learn more about how prejudest the white people were aganist the African Americans. The way Milderd D. Taylor described the charcters in the book made you auctually see the scene taking place while reading the book.In this book there was never a boring paragraph. You were always entertained. I love this book because it made me really think about how people were treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry was not one of my favorite books. I loved getting to read about the 1930's and what really went on in those times. But it was not very easy to read and had no real climax.I kept waiting for Logan's house to get burned down, or for Papa or Mr. Morrison to get revenge, or even better for Uncle Hammer to come be beat the snot out of the Wallace family. Yet none of this ever happened.The author also never really went into the details of who Jeremy was and why he was friends with the Logan kids. The biggest complaint is that Taylor never wrote about what happened to T.J., was he set free, hung, what?I was truly disappointed in this book, yet could see such great potential for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How dare you criticize this book","review":"This book is great.

It was truley a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!!!","review":"Mildred D. Taylor is an brillant author and this is one of her best books! I have read everyone of her books and they are just as fantastic as this one is. Her perspective on African-American history is beautiful.

I love this book! I never thought about racism before Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry. After reading it I learned about how bad it was back in the 30's. I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the sequel, Let the Circle be Unbroken. This book is very sad though. I was crying (I never cry in books.) It is about all the hard ships in the Great Depression and how bad it was to be African-American. If this reveiw was helpful, go out and buy the book!

This book was hard to put down because i wanted to read what was going to happen next. There was a lot of suspense and humor throughout this story and i enjoyed all of it.It was also really hard to read although at times because it open's your eyes to the history of African Americans back then.

The thing is there are books before it so you don't totally get it. And what I don't get is that they use words such as \\"natily\\" to describe a nicely dressed person, but can't say \\"I'm not going to do that\\" instead of \\"Aw shoot I ain't gon' doin' that.\\" Maybe Mildred Taylor was confused but who knows? I really thought our class should've read a book that focused what it was like for EVERYONE and not just black people (not being racist. come on the depression was horrible for EVERYONE!) because it really only focused on what it was like for one race. I do not recommend this for anyone who likes to stay interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this book was a very boring book.

My cousin, the biggest reader I know, was required to read this book, but he thought it was so stupid and surfacy, he didn't even finish the book. (He chose to read HARRY POTTER instead!) This book has no depth and symbolism at all and should be used as a good example of how not to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a BORING book!!!!!!!","review":"How boring can you get??? This book is about a black family who tries to keep their land. I kept getting lost and confused all throughout this book, and all it is is just another predjudice book. There's a lot of these out already. I'm not against black people or anything, I just really hated this book. I'm only giving it one star because it did have some sad and happy scenes in there, where you begin to feel more like the character, Cassie Logan. It also had a nice setting. Well, that's all I have to say about this book.

Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is told by the young narrator ,Cassie Logan, who shares the struggles her African American family faces in their small town of Mississippi during the 1930's. During these hard times young Cassie Logan learns the hardships of growing up as a young African American facing racism and poverty. She develops each character bringing to life their individual personalities and struggles especially the children, especially the troublemaker T.J. one in which we begin to dislike but later sympathize with once we see he is just a young child who is lost and troubled. Although this is a novel told from a young girl's perspective it is enjoyable for both children and adults. It is a very useful tool to help today and future generation readers to not forget the unfairness African Americans endured during those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book for kids, with messages.","review":"I am a parent of a 12 year old 8th grader who read all the required books that my child has to read. This book was one that I could not put down. It really gives great insight on how the people were treated during this period. It showed how \\"Little Man\\" knew he deserved better by not wanting a discarded textbook. It showed how peer pressure can do more harm than do. Mainly, when Stacey is tricked by TJ. TJ makes fun of his new clothes because he wanted them for himself and Stacey falls the trick. It shoulds how a family fought to hold onto to their land and dignity. It shows how a family can work together as one for the ultimate aim of keeping the land in the family. This is true family unity. This is a great book for child and parents alike. Parents can sit and discuss feelings about this book with their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an excellent book","review":"I liked this book very much, because it had a good plot, explained a lot about blacks after the Civil War, and was very interesting. It was touching, and was hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anybody over 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Storm","review":"This book spoke to me like a storm pounding on the windows of my mind.The story is so profound because it doesn't have all the loose ends tied up at the end. I felt the theme of racism in America's earlier years was revealed in a more personal way then in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" yet the seriousness and social issues are so similar (especially in the second book).The main character, Cassie, is so fiesty yet so likeable. Sometimes all she wants to do is hit someone...scream at her world. Other times, all she wants to do is have friends, play games, enjoy being a kid.The family dynamic is amazing. The author really put a lot of effort into this book and it shows. It's fll of suspense and very thought provoking. It will make you want to read them all (which I did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reality of The Matter","review":"This book is an unsettling depiction of what life was like for African Americans in the south. It is unimaginable to us today that these travesties actually happened, but this story is so detailed that you can almost see it happening. When the kids are walking to school and the bus for the white school is coming down the road, you can see the faces on the bus laughing and making fun of Cassie and her brothers. You can see the dust rise up and settle on their clean clothes. You will feel the pain and the confusion that Cassie expresses throughout the book.This book will pull you in and you will feel like you are seeing it unravel first hand. The author does a magnificent job getting your attention and keeping it up until the last moment. Just when you think you know what is going to happen, you find out you are wrong. You will laugh and you will cry, but it is definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!LOVE IT","review":"I absolutely love this book!!!!This worked very well for a class I needed it for and is a great product to have apart of a home library.

The main character and her family are simply trying to make ends meet in order to keep their land.

All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the \\"colored people\\" for no reason at all. Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past. But that was then. This is now. Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe. Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","review":"This book is a fictional narrative of a black family of the 1930's in rural Mississippi. The entire book basically descibes one abuse after another that a black family experiences from whites. It is an exaggeration of life of those times, is a gross misrepresentation of reality, is nothing but liberal propaganda. Some of its references to the past are simply lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll of Thunder","review":"Imagine if you were wrongly treated discriminated against, socialy unequal, poor and you don't understand why. Cassie a black 11yr old souther girl from Mississippi is finding out why she can't associate with white people. Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry is a very historicaly acurate novel but is not a tad bit boring. Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry will keep you guessing until the very end and then still amazed at waht has happened in this quality book.If you're like me then you want plenty of action in yuor books.

That is definitely true for this book. This book taught me what the lives of black Americans were like for seventy years and beyond after the Civil War. I think it also gives a glimpse of what led them in the direction they have gone culturally, since.Even white readers will begin, through this book, to sort of live empathetically through what they lived -- the struggle to make ends meet in a system designed to continue to enslave them, the struggle to keep a good name while being blamed for the crimes of white men, and just what life was like for the descendants of slaves in the 1930's.I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age who hasn't yet read it. It will captivate you. It will make you laugh, cry, and experience every emotion in between. But it will be well worth it, and you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A student view","review":"Bought this book for my class on children's literature. We're using this and other texts to build knowledge of coming of age novels and stories with historically accurate content to add to use as teaching material, as this is a class for future teachers.

This story portray's a realistic view of how the deep south Mississippi during the depression might be. The book really focuses on how close the family and how important owning their own land is. The main character, Cassie, is a very intriguing character. She is so couragous and proud. She dosn't fully understand the value of owning the land. This book looks at the different relationships with her family and her friends. The trials and tribulations that the family goes through being an African-American family in the south. Cassie dosn't understand why people in the world feel that they are superior to her and that she is inferior.

Throughout the story she and her family really have to stick together to protect the land they own. They also have to help her deal with the racism that is happening all around her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this book is a wonderful book for children to read!","review":"I think this book is great! I recently read it for my college children's literature class. I think she did a great job of developing the characters and really made you feel like you were living in their shoes. I think it is very educational for children to learn about what African Americans went through in the south during that time period! I'm very glad she won the Newbery Award in 1977.

Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry was a great book. It was like what happened in the world in the 1870's.The story was when the white people were racist. In the story Whites had a lot more things than Blacks. Each time I read a chapter I always had tears in my eyes. When a chapter or a sentence came up they always had a meaning to it. The kids in the book were always getting into trouble. They were the Logan family. The Logan family had 2 whole acres of land and they wouldn't give it away. Then on a stormy night nightmares hit the family, and tragedy started to happen. No matter how bad the terror was, the family always stuck together. After I read this book I never really thought about how bad Blacks got treated. Just for warning, this book is a tear-jerker.

This book is taking place during the Depression. This excellent book is about a family (the Logans) that are having troubles with certain whites and keeping their land. Further through the story Mrs. Logan (the mother) gets fired from her job. Mr Logan gets a broken leg and gets shot. But if you would want to find out how, you would have to get this excellent book and read to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny","review":"When I heard that this book was about friendship, possible and impossible friendships, I thought I did not going to like this book. I considered that literature about friendship is often a thing for girls. But I was wrong. This was a very interesting book about friendship in the Southern States of America. The theme friendship was mixed with exciting stories about the difficult position of the blacks, and about the courage that was needed in those days to do the things you wanted to do. It shows how important a thing ( in this case a piece of land ) can be for someone. The book describes this struggle for self-respect and pride by telling the story of the Logan family. The book is very fascinating. A real must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that starts too slow","review":"This book was the slowest starting book I ever read.

It was one of my first \\"big girl\\" books as it was in chapter form and I felt as though I were reading a grown up book like my parents. The characters in this book were so real to me, I cried when things went wrong and was happy for them when things went well. Great story about an African American family in the south. When I became a teacher over 5 years ago, I read this to my fourth grade class who loved it, and I have read it every year since with my classes.

The father of the family is gone in the summer while the children stay home and help pick cotton. Although he is home in the winters, the children dearly miss him.

There is a token nice white man thrown in to make it somewhat PC!I found the episode where the main character Cassie beats up a white girl who has been verbally abusive to her disgusting.This book does not set the stage for a discussion of kindness, respect and understanding about racial injustice.Awful.

I will surely read the other books of her, I'm sure they are as good as this one. She writes very good about all the things that are happening, she is telling them so clearly and without any doubt, almost as if she was there at that same moment.

In the book, Mildred Taylor depicts the life of a little black girl in the 1930's with the utmost detail. In my class, we had discussions about reading between the lines and not taking in the literal meaning of the quotes. Mildred Taylor shows that you must first have pride in who you are before you take any further actions. It was so sad and touching yet so triumphant. Through this book, the life of a black in the 1930's fully shines through. The book also shows the inequality and hatred that fills each persons mind. Overall,I give the book an A+++. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of vulgar language to make it funny","review":"it could have been funny without the use of vulgar language but the comedian used a lot of cursing and foul words as a crutch to make his comedy. what a pity. the use of foul language means you don't trust your talents in making people laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ad Hoc Humor","review":"Pryor is obviously a skilled comedian. He has the audience eating out of his hand from beginning to end. The concert takes place in 1982. The audience appears to have been born between 1942 and 1955. They laugh from beginning to end. I didn't laugh once. Aside from the riffs about working for the Mafia and Visiting Africa, I didn't even know what he was talking about. Particularly distressing was the audience calling out for a certain well-loved bit. Pryor acquiesced. \\"Okay. This is the last time.\\" It wasn't funny. (The audience was in stitches.) It wasn't funny to me. So, I don't get it. Boomer drug culture?

Again, I'm sure age difference plays a part. People dropping F-bombs and being raunchy in comedy isn't new or outrageous to me, it's in everything I watch. I don't want to take anything away from Richard Pryor, he paved the way and inspired alot of the people that I \\"DO\\" enjoy. But I didn't find this funny.

Never.","review":"I must first preface my comments by saying that I think Larry the Cable Guy is funny guy, but he is no Richard Pryor. I am a white anglo-saxon who thinks that Richard Pryor was one of the most funny people who ever lived, and if you asked Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, or Ron White who was the better comedian I think they would all pick Richard Pryor because Rich could find humor in the most unlikeliest sources, whereas Larry is rather obvious in his basis for humor. Good though, but not as profound as Richard Pryor. This along with the other two Richard Pryor stand up films should be the proof of what a comedian is all about. Yes, Rich used rough language, but listen to words between the cuss words, he was a very smart comic who had all the ablities needed to be the legend he was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King","review":"Richard Pryor may be the funniest man to ever grab a mike on stage. This set has some moments that are absolute classics. His routine about the Mafia guys in the club he worked had me crying I laughed so hard.His moments of reflection about his \\"freebase\\" accident are funny but meaningful and cautionary at the same time. Whatever material he was riffing on his intelligence always shines through. A real comic genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't call it a comeback...","review":"Richard Pryor is in good form on the Sunset Strip. He seems to be a bit uneasy at the beginning, but as talented as he is, he manages to deliver a great show regardless. The laughter ceases during certain periods - such as when Pryor discusses his freebasing accident, his drug addiction, and his abandonment of the use of the N word - but there are still plenty of laughs here. Live on the Sunset Strip is not quite as good as Live in Concert, but still to be highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Pryor: Live on the sunset strip","review":"Just 2 of his routines on this video are funny enough to rate it 5 stars, the ones about the prison, and the one about the mob.

In fact, I'd be willing to bet that the 2 people that wrote negative reviews are only reading the title and have never read the book. This is proven by their responses. They provide no opinion of the actual content of the book.

I've also purchased the recent live concert release of Muddy, Johnny and James Cotton together following the release of Muddy's Hard Again. So Johnny's vocal style is no surprise.But here he reverts to this \\"growl\\" technique that for me ruins this otherwise fine CD. I think Johnny could have done just fine without it.(EDIT 8/10/10) I've lived with this CD for while, plus have greatly enjoyed the recent release of Johnny's Woodstock performance. I've pushed this review up one star, and I don't feel the same way about Johnny's vocals as I do today.

The album flows like a good album should and the end product is clearly greater than the sum of the individual tracks which is rare indeed. It also sticks to a theme and pulls it off very well (Gypsy-style, exotic music).

A test of man or woman and machine against the elements. For those who have a love of aircraft and have done their share of \\"scud running\\", this book will have a lot of appeal. For those who have only participated in aviation as passengers, the book may reinforce some of stereotype fears that people often experience with flight. A couple of locations covered in the book and some of the maintenance procedures sound dubious but despite those few exceptions, the book has an air of authenticity that kept me engaged. So You Want to be a Ferry Pilot is a real-life adventure story and was much enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pilot With a Lucky Charmed Life!","review":"I would love to meet Spike, the author of this book. Perhaps some of his good luck would rub off on me! I loved reading this book and about all the close encounters Spike had while he flew his ferry flights around the world. As a pilot with many hours logged, I can relate to his passion for flight and how the adrenaline flow can be addictive. As the old saying goes; hours and hours of sheer boredom followed by moments of sheer terror. No doubt, Spike must have had his share of the later. I highly recommend this book to any pilot who thinks that ferry pilots lead a dull life.

But this one, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY is a bore.Rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. This information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.For this reason, I do not recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY.-- Regina McMenamin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't know what I thought this little toy would do but it does virtually nothing.

It fits well enough for outer wear but not as a functional corset."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, but we shall see how it holds up","review":"I ordered this corset for a costume and first off, I will say the correspondence and delivery time was very quick. Customer Service was excellent. It came with a nice little mini-garment bag for storage and appeared to be decent upon first glance. I had not tried it on until the night of my event, but it was a little small and I followed the size chart to a T. I was a bit disappointed in that. I guess it will be a learning curve for next time. It faired nicely, but I am a little concerned about the stretching of the fabric at the seams just a bit. All in all, for the price it appears to be a nice corset and the boning is decent. I am pleased at the moment, but I will wear it a couple more times before I make my final decision.

Ok, I'm a sucker for those old 1960's shows. The only problem was the episode from Flash Gordon, the 60's TV sci-fi show. How can I say this? That show stank. It was awful. It was made in West Germany with supporting actors who had such a heavy Germanic accent that it was hard to understand their English use. The acting was D- at best and it's just a shame to include such a stinker with Rocky Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important contribution to the current literature in ethic","review":"Hutchinson writes with grace and flair. His judgments of Moore are penetrating and wise, neither adulatory nor inimical. Unlike most writers on Moore, Hutchinson is at home also with Moore's epistemological and metaphysical works. He correctly ties Moore's realism (\\"objectivism\\") in ethics to his defense of common sense in epistemology. Moore's \\"innocence\\" (Keynes's word) regarding the existence and knowability of values is nicely compared with his much discussed, with derision or admiration, \\"innocence\\" regarding the existence and knowability of material objects. Moore thought that both are obvious, and that only intellectual confusion leads to thinking they are not. Hutchinson's book is an important contribution to the current literature in ethics.

What this film does is portray a little known yet historically important culture in a fairly authentic and entertaining manner. it is ideal for history buffs and fans of Russian movie directors.I watched this with my Kazakh wife, who loved the portrayal of her people, even though the main actors were not Kazakh. After renting it, she insisted that we buy the DVD so that our kids could watch it for some perspective on the culture they come from. What we agree on is that it is beautifully filmed, with good cinematography. There is a bit of the \\"Russian movie\\" effect in that it can be slow at times, but by Soviet film making standards, this is the Russian equivalent of \\"Speed\\" or \\"Crank\\".Personally, I liked \\"Mongol\\" better, but the fact that anyone managed to make a watchable film out of Kazakh history is still pretty impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly good.","review":"Not expecting too much from this little movie I was delighted & suprised with how good it was. You don't need to know where Kazakhstan is or who Ghengis Kahn was to enjoy this film. One group of people wants to take over another and the fight is on--the languange & location really don't matter once you get that. The scenery is unbelievable; the charcters honorable and heroic; the violence mild by the standards of any American slasher movie; and the love story touching and \\"G\\" rated. It's also refreshing to see an action movie for a change which has absolutely nothing to do with Americans. I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous premise","review":"While this movie has some good fight scenes and the cinematography is quite good, the basic premise of the movie is ridiculously flawed.From the very beginning, Jason Scott Lee's narrative talks about the Kazakh's people having ancestors like Genghis Khan, and having to fight off invaders such as the Jungars. The Kazakhs are only partly descended from the Mongols, as they were primarily a Turkic people whose cities were DESTROYED by Genghis Khan and his Mongol army. Jungars were more direct descendants of Genghis Khan than the Kazakhs ever were.In the movie, we see the Jungar Khan getting cannons from what look like the Russians. Funnily enough, historically it was the Kazakhs who sought protection by the Russians against the Jungars...I'm curious as to why the Kazakhs participated in the movie when the historical references about their people were so wrong..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, what a bad movie!!!!","review":"First thing first they ripped the 300 font and then released it a week before 300 is released. Talk about tacky yet intriguing enough to see what it was about.Well the acting is horrible. Jason Scott Lee has fallen so far.

The setting and characters were well-drawn (except, perhaps, for Evan, who struck me as slightly one-dimensional), and I kept turning the pages because I truly cared about what happened to Nell, Zach, Mia, and Ripley. Adding in the magic kept it from being a rehash of previous storylines. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good story about love, magic, witches, strong women... basically, just about anyone. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping with the Enemy - revisited!","review":"This is a great book if you haven't already seen the movie, \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" with Julia Roberts. This story tracks so closely to that movie (which was out several years ago) that it totally lacks originality. Since I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, I'm very dissapointed in this one. I'm hoping the next will be more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment to say the least","review":"I love Nora Roberts but this book does not reach me at all. I have read every N. Roberts book written, but this book is disappointing. I much prefer her Seaswept Trilogy where there is realism. Lately, she's on this mystical thing similar to the book, Enchanted, that I cannot appreciate at all. Please Nora, if you read this... I'm begging for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"I never like the victim heroines. At least Nell did fight back and escape, so that helped somewhat.I also didn't like that Zack was more upset that Nell was still legally married than he was that she hadn't confided in him. The Trust Issue isn't my favorite romance plot, but in this one it was okay--Zack & Nell had been together long enough for it to make sense.And since the witch stuff was plot-related, that was okay, but paranormal is right up there with math--not Nora's strong point. I winced every time they said a spell--it was so cheesy.But other than that... I sounds like I hate the book. I don't. Nice characters, nice family/friend relationships. Good dialogue. Yadda, yadda, yadda. I expect all those things when I read a Nora. That's probably why I'm so picky about the parts I don't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this was one of her best!!!!","review":"\\"Dance Upon the Air\\" was spectacular.

I am waiting for the next new one to comeout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story, light read","review":"This is the first book in the three sisters trilogy. Ms. Roberts is a great writer so the writing flows well and the story manages to surround you as you read. Wonderful imagery and setting pull you right in and make you feel at home.Overall, this is a sweet romance and almost a \\"coming of age\\" story about a young woman finding herself after an abusive marriage and life on the run. The magic and witch-craft aspect of the story line is more just a little bit of context for the romance. Unlike other books in the paranormal genre, this one only touches upon it. The story is driven more by the characters and a need for healing than anything else.If you are in the mood for a story of healing and homecoming with just a dash of magic, then this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nell won't sleep with the enemy any more","review":"This is a very charming book, the first in a trilogy. The heroine, Nell Channing, had to fake her own death to escape an abusive husband, but her trials aren't over yet. Landing on Three Sisters Island, she gradually finds friends, creates a career, meets the perfect man...but she has to deal with her past before she can enjoy her future. Along the way, she also finds out that she is an hereditary witch, and will play a part in averting a 300-year-old curse. I have read this book several times, and always loved it, but I have one small quibble...the silly rhymes used in witchcraft wouldn't convince a toddler, much less the powers of Air, Earth and Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance upon the Air","review":"I have read all of Nora Roberts books, this is not my favorite. If you enjoy her as JD Robb, you will like this book. She seems to be trying to merge the two writing styles.

But, what I can't understand is why she isn't getting popped for plagarism. This is straight \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" plus a little earth, wind and fire sister magic thrown in. The story is good, so buy it used if you saw the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Get Real, Please!","review":"If you're into all that hokey-New Age-witchcraft stuff, then this is the book for you.

Nora Roberts is the best romance writer out there. She always has a different story to tell. This trilogy is very unique and imaginative. I just couldn't stop turning the pages! The relationships of these characters are filled with love, humor, and passion. I had so much fun getting to know these characters and have missed them since I have finished reading these books. These books have a lot of excitement and great love scenes. I can't say enough about Nora! I stay up till 3:00 AM to finish one of her books! She takes me to a different world every time.

I have bought many products from Amazon with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Magic","review":"Nora Roberts' books that involve both romance and magic are always my favourites. \\"Dance Upon the Air\\" is no exception. I can hardly wait to get my hands on the second in the series (\\"Heaven and Earth\\"). I read \\"Dance\\" in one sitting--that says a lot. Her characters are well drawn and the story is fantastic. Nell's plight--running from an abusive husband and building a new life for herself--blends seamlessly with Nell's discovery of her hidden legacy--witchcraft. Under Mia's guiding hand and Ripley's grudging assistance, Nell blooms and rediscovers herself--and rediscovers the joys of loving.I highly recommend this book--as I do all of Nora Roberts' books. If you like the combination of love and casting spells, I advise you to read \\"The Donovan Legacy,\\" a 3-in-1 book about three hereditary witches and their loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of three sisters ....","review":"I was drawn to this trilogy because the three sisters of the island are witches. When Nell Channing arrives on the island all three of the positive forces are back on the island together - the three descendent daughters of the sisters have come together as the fable says they will. There is Nell, who escapes to the island to start a new life after running from her abusive husband. She comes to the island and finds work as a cook in Cafe Book, owned and operated by Mia. Mia is a modern day witch and becomes Nell's older sister in friendship and witchcraft. The last of the circle is Ripley, who is the Deputy in town - once a close friend with Mia she now has turned her back on witchcraft.I look forward to reading the next two installments in the trilogy; 'Heaven and Earth' and 'Face the Fire' and learning more about Mia, Ripley and Nell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Magical!","review":"I recently finished reading this title, it was my first time too read anything by Nora Roberts. Absolutely wonderfull! Excellent read. The book portrayed good and evil with just enough suspense to keep the reader torn to each page. I read the book in two days couldn't seem to tear myself away, I love the way the author puts in just enough romance to keep you waiting and wanting more. The characters seemed real and true to life, it was almost as if I could envision the story coming to life as I was reading! A must have for any book lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I fell into the third book on accident while on a trip and wanted something to read. I fell in love with the three sisters in this story. The characters are so real and the imagery that you get when these women are working their magic is wonderful. She did wonderful research on the occult terms that are within the book and are used correctly. I enjoyed this book so much. Although, I do have to say the third book in the series is a bit better than this one. But, in the first we are getting to know the characters and so in parts in it is a bit slow and tedious. But well worth the read. I love how she can just write about magic and make it seem so romantic and your heart goes out to these women in the story. Everyone can associate with the characters. We all know a friends like these ladies in the book. Get this series and read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another incredible book.","review":"This was one of those fantastic books of Nora Roberts, where I lose myself in the writing. Roberts writes this trilogy with a strength not seen since her Born In Trilogy. I felt this book was made up of several different story lines, but instead of Roberts stuffing them into a readers throat at once, she allows them to gracefully develop and emerge as nescesary for the story. Nell Channing is a woman who grows as the story continues, growing in her knowledge that she is a witch. I would say this is an essential summer read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Captivating","review":"From the prologue this story hooked me! Being a working mother, I never have time to read.

Perhaps they seemed a little bit rehashed, the men are always beautifully written but the women seemed petulant and annoying. Well with \\"Dance Upon the Air\\", the Nora Roberts I so enjoyed reading is back and I'm delighted! Nell, Mia and Ripley are lovely! Nell is a wounded spirit without being a pathetic little lame bird. She's scarred but strong, Zack is gorgeous of course and the whole feel of the island is wonderful. I really enjoyed this book and believe that Nora Roberts captured the 'sanctuary' feeling of the island perfectly. I can't wait until the other books come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to the next....","review":"Like all Nora Robert's trilogies, I can't wait to read the next installment in the Sister's series. Origional and touching, Ms. Roberts has combined magic and imagination to spin a tale of love and escape, independence and safety.I loved the book's setting and the characters. Their lifestyle on a tiny island makes us all wish we could live there, dream there. I'll be looking forward to the next book, due out in September."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Nora Roberts read!","review":"Very good storyline, somewhat familiar from other books with added touches. I like the connections the three women have, whether they want it or not. Nell's story is first, followed by Mia's, then Ripley's. It kept me reading even though it was pretty predictable. I eagerly await the next in the series.

I couldn't put it down...and was disapointed that \\"Heaven and Earth\\"..the 2nd of the trilogy wasn't available yet.

The longer it went on, the more I found it drifting into the familiar stereotypes of \\"poor abused woman\\", \\"... Obsessive man\\" and the \\"knight in shining armour\\". So what started out as well characterised intriguing story, ended up conforming to the basic formula... and Nell and Zack lived happily ever after... (give me strength).I must say though that the characters were well developed as were the scenes and I really felt part of it, at least until the predictability took over....It made me feel like I was eating a fresh cream donut and then suddenly I realised there was no strawberry jam on it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Definitely not one of her better books.

Yes, I will be buying the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Upon the Air, delightful....","review":"This first of a trio, was terrific. I liked all the 'sisters', and look forward to the tales of Ripley and especially Mia. Zack, I thought was great as are all of Ms. Roberts hero's. The right mix of toughness and caring. The island is portrayed as somewhere I would like to visit. All in all this is the type of book that made Ms. Roberts a favorite, great characterization, snappy dialogue and just enough twist of the plot to keep it from being re-hash. Enjoy a day at the beach/pool with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite Authors","review":"I have most of Nora Roberts' books and was glad to add this to my collection.

Just wonder why, when I ordered both from the same place, why they didn't come together?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun, suspenseful, magical read!","review":"This is the first book in Nora Roberts' latest trilogy. It's set on an island called Three Sisters Island off the coast of New England. The island is home to 2 women with a magical legacy in the past and future. Enter person number 3 (the 3rd sister) -- our main character. She is running from an abusive husband, has changed her name, and taken a job offered by one of the island's magical inhabitants. She has never heard of the legends the other two have heard of and only learns slowly about her own powers and her place in the legend of the three sisters. As a side note, each of the three books deals has one of the three key \\"sisters\\" as it's main character.Though the suspense portion of the book was quite predictable, this was a lot of FUN to read. It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and witchcraft - you can't go wrong!","review":"Set on a charming island, the story that unfolds will keep you turning the pages. Nell Channing and Zach Todd are the two main characters and they are so likable. Nell is trying to find herself after a horrible marraige. Zach is the town's sherriff and you're going to wish you could take him home with you!As the story unfolds you get a glimpse of an old legend, but for Nell and two other women, Ripley and Mia, it is more than a legend. It is part of who they are, as they are decendents of these witches, and Nell is stunned to find out she has power in herself as well. When Nell's crazy husband comes a calling these three women must stand together to protect her.Feel the thrill of that first kiss and all that follows when you read this book, it is definetly worth your time. If you are anything like me, you'll enjoy it so much that it will hardly take you any time at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nora's own craft","review":"The book is about a woman who is running from her former life for a life she can live and finds a super natural gift she never knew she had to begin with . nell is a wandering soul when she shows up on the island and Mia guides her to new fond talents and a new love . and helps Nell belive in friends and love again .nora roberts makes me belive that her craft is in writing and Nells In learing what Mia will teach her as a friend and new fond witch ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I have read this series multiple time, and still love it!! I can't wait to start the next one about Ripley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel or \\"Intro to Witchcraft 101\\" ?","review":"I have read many of Nora Robert's books and have usually found them reasonably enjoyable. They are well written and tell a good story. Actually, Dance Upon the Air is also well written, very well written....however, it lifts up and glamorizes the Art of Wiccan practices, so that basically, it is a primer in \\"how to\\". This was a surprise to me...as I Christian, I found this highly unacceptable and dangerous to the uninformed reader. What was most disturbing to me, was the beautifully seductive picture drawn, which could very easily entice someone into thinking these types of practices were not only acceptable but beneficial. I suggest to readers that they need to be aware of the content of this book. I would not encourage anyone to read it...I was saddened and disapointed to find this in a novel meant for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read!","review":"I read this book in one afternoon sitting by the pool. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down - my tan speaks for itself. Definitely a winner. You go, girl! I also would like to recommend: The Color of Revenge by Millicent Hart. If you want an exciting and different read, try this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!","review":"This is my favorite book written by Nora Roberts. If you liked the movie Practical Magic this is the book for you. I've read it at least three times and it never gets old. Right now I'm anxiously awaiting the third book in the trilogy. I thought the story of Nell and how she has to start her own life and not jump into a relaitonship was unique. Most romance books have the heroine becoming totally dependent on a man. This book to me was more about Nell growing as a person then a romance. Zach is a great guy (I wish I could find one like that) and the rest of the characters are equally likable. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"how does she do it? :)","review":"\\"Dance in the Air\\" Nora Robert's first book in her Three Sisters Island trilogy is an amazing beginning to a complex and idealistic community. The amounts of characters that are developed in Roberts' books engender that sense of a small island town.My review for \\"Dance..\\"? I loved it. The main character Nell is a beautiful example of facing huge odds and overcoming them, all the while building a reputation for a stunning cafe and catering business. This book made me want to travel to New England, find a small bookstore/cafe, and cozy up to enjoy the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things that Happen in a Good Place","review":"Truely Nell was a darin person. She did things that normal people won't. She faked her own death to escape an abusive husband and then falls in love with this incredible guy who is laid back enough to be sexy for me. Are there men out there that are really like that? *Sigh* Read it, love it, then reread. Enjoy.

While this is a teen boy telling his story, his experiences may well remind any of us to pay attention to relationships. \\"Everybody deserves a second chance.\\" AND we should realize that things are not always as we think they are -- nor are people always as we think they are. I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and Heartwarming","review":"Notes from the Midnight Driver is narrated by your average teenage boy (Alex)- its bound to be funny. But when an accident brings Sol, a grouchy man, into Alex's life, the story takes a heartwarming turn. At first Alex and Sol don't see eye to eye- Sol constantly verbally slams Alex, they argue- but after a while they find one thing that holds them together- music. It's a good read for all ages- it's got old people, cars, a little romance, and lawn ornaments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and fit","review":"I love Galco, always have - but they just keep getting better and better. This holster is beautiful quality from the stitching to the closure. The snap is crisp and the fit is perfect. I expect to get a very long life out of this product. I was really happy to find that Galco was making a holster for this gun, and really glad I didn't buy the only other one I've ever seen for it at the store. That holster was both more expensive, and much lower quality. If you need a holster for your .500, look no further than this series from Galco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix review","review":"I purchased the holster for my S&W; .500. I'm an archery hunter and I purchased this holster to carry my \\"bear\\" gun. The holster fits my revolver well and is comfortable to wear. The leather is very nice and sturdy. This holster ought to last a lifetime.The only downside to this transaction was the length of time to ship. I ordered it with two day delivery so that I'd have it in time for a hunt...... Unfortunately, (two days later) instead of recieving the holster, I received a notice that it was back ordered. Too late for me to find an alternative. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and this is the only negative experience that I've had. I probably should give a poor rating for that, but the holster is exactly what I expected.

The seller not listing the brand name should have been my first clue. I despise Rothco, and for good reason. They produce garbage. The bags appear to be of decent construction, and they are of the same style as GI M3 bags. The buckles don't fit together correctly, which is typical of Rothco. These bags were given to people who didn't have the same concerns that I do, which is the only reason I didn't send them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for both work and play","review":"I spent a lot of time looking for a pack that was large enough for an overnight trip as well as using it as a carry on for a trip, but also small enough to use as a laptop carrying case. Although this does not have a laptop sleeve, it works great for me. I really like all of the different pockets as well as the seam sealed zippers. I live in the Pacific Northwest and it can get quite wet up here. I do not have to worry about my stuff getting wet. In addition, it has a place for a hydration bladder.

It is so well acted by the superb cast! Of course, I have my favorite, Chris Meloni!

I guess I expected the top surface of each DVD to be less worn, plus which number disc, eg; 1,2, is barely visible. The seller should have listed it as 'fair condition' at best. The DVD quality on screen appears to be without imperfections. I still paid more than it is worth in it's present condition; live & learn.I kept the set because I did not want to go thru the hassle of returning.

I'm eagerly awaiting the release of newly televised episodes onto DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"SVU has personal touch","review":"Law and Order--SVU 8th season does not vary too much from the path, it is the most successful Law and Order franchise, the same chilling sex crimes, the fast pace, the personal touch that other Law and Order series sorely lack. You always feel a lot of pain watching the show, since the stories are sickening at all times. The two main detectives Stabler and Benson grab most of the screen time, they are compelling characters,the other detectives are featured on certain shows. Stories are still ripped from the headlines, and resonate well with the viewers. Emotion sometimes outweigh reason on SVU, but that is what SVU is all about. If you are a \\"Law and Order\\" Series fan, you might want to grab it. If you are looking for depth, I suggest shows like \\"Wire\\"(all five seasons) and \\"Oz\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every episode is the same","review":"This show went from a pionering idea to just repeating itself.Every episode is the same their all about rape,doesnt the writer know their are other kinds of \\"special victims\\" out their.check the credits their all written by the same person who might have a rape neurosis.Anyway this show is a waste of time now.Aqua teen hunger force,squidbillies,archer,metalocalypse or even the x files is a better use of your tv time.personally I wish this would get cancelled like the rest of the series did.nothing against the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Episode kind of stupid ending","review":"Great episode great acting and was pretty intence. What i do not like it is the ending. It kinda puts elliot in kind of a bad light in that.

I get what he says about she needs to do it for HER not him. but he still could have consoled her or you know held her for a while or something but maybe seeing his wife/ex wife or what and his daugther he realized he needed to distance himself from her? I dont know. I just felt he was a little cold in the end like just to let her walk away obviously kind of a wreck.

(Isn't that what reviews are for?) Benson and Stabler have many tests of their partnership in this season and without spoiling the details they do not work together the entire season. So if you are a huge Benson and Stabler fan you may not like this season as much. In real life at the time of this season's filming - Mariska Hargitay (Olivia Benson) was pregnant in real life.However, if you aren't as \\"attached\\" to the dynamic duo of SVU - then that might not be a bad point for you. Otherwise this season is SVU! Some would argue that even now (in Season 13) it's still the great show that's been charging on for 13 (and almost 14) seasons.

I knew it would be a pop album, but I thought it would have more diversity. It does not. Almost every single song sounds the same. Of course, you have your fast ones and your slow ones, but nevertheless, they all seem to sound the same. The lyrics lack depth also. If you just want to listen to a fun cd, go ahead and buy this album. But if you are looking for deep lyrics and lots of diversity, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true vocal powerhouse!","review":"Her voice is amazing. Thats all that really needs to be said about Rachael Lampa. A true vocal powerhouse. The songs are wondeful as well. It all can be considered pop and similiar to that of Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson, but she sings about her love of God. Standout tracks include the lovely ballad No Greater Love and the upbeat Savior Song. The one track that will blow you away is Give Your Heart Away. A stunning ballad that Racheal sings her heart out on. She hits the notes with such power and emotion you can't help but fall in love with this gifted and talented singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well,","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Rachael Lampa, but Live For You is pretty good and Rachael Lampa is good too.

Pus she shows off with her voice TOO MUCHNo offence anyone, but it's not a good album really, in my opion. Her others are okay, apart from Blur, Im not really a fan though, there are lots more enjoyable albums. If you're totally serious about RL, than grab the CD after listening to the clips.

This story is told in the same manner as \\"A Matter of Faith\\" and continues to be an interesting presentation. We find out more about how Jack's extended family works and how they interact with each other in this one. There is danger and mystery enough in this story and how each person reacts to it. This story is in many ways about everyone but Jack. Everything that happens to them takes place because they either know Jack or are related to him. Of course, it wouldn't be a Jack Collins novel without his presence as the unifying character. Once again, the book was very hard to put down until I found out how things worked out for them all. Mr. Rozhon has captured a style and manner of storytelling that I find compelling. Looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As adversited","review":"Tormek's SVD-185 gouge jig will fit on this arm.

If you purchase this book beware of the many, many mispellings and typos throughout the forms.

It's fine except that you can't convert files from 6, because they changed the platform--something I found out after the fact, of course. My problem is that there was no warning that upgrading wasn't the right thing to do, that I should have bought new. I ended up having to upgrade the upgrade before opening it--for another $120, and with a bunch of rigamarole that included strings of ID letters/numbers longer than my arm. Just plain a hassle.

In fact, the CD is full of one minute interludes (deemed as tracks) that instead of bringing people into a worship experience, many of the spoken words are undeciperable (because so many reverb, gate, and delay effects are used in the vocals in combination that the music drowns out the vocals), the atmosphere creepy, dark, and dreary. In summary, this CD is just another CD of Tesh's typical cheeziness with overkilled keyboards, piano sounds, and beat boxes trying to sound like a celestial experience instead of leading people to the heart of worship. Natalie Grant and Nicole C. Mullen should be ashamed for providing their awesome talents to such a bland project."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described","review":"In very good shape. Arrived quickly.

He has gone back to rescue his fiancee, Angie, who had also gone back to this world. But unlike Angie, Jim is in the body of a dragon! This book is not only interesting in that Jim compares the 20th century world to wear he is now, but the fact that he has been transported into the body of the dragon Gorbash makes it all the more interesting! It makes you wonder what it would be like to be a dragon for a while, and in a way, it lets you know the answer!

The packaging from Legato looks professional, but the tape is a badly done pirated performance, blurry at times, washed out color, and frequently jumpy. The sound quality is just about acceptable. Those wanting to see Caballe do the Dance of the Seven Veils as a striptease will be disappointed. She accepts each veil from a slave, fondles them and tosses them away. The most she lost was an earring, and this fan, who thinks she should have stuck to her Bel Canto specialty, where no-one could float a beautiful note like Caballe in her prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eloquent and beautiful book","review":"Forgiveness is perhaps the most difficult thing to actually pull-off in life, but in this book Kent Nerburn has given us several portraits of how it is done.

You know, during some classic rock station's album of the day feature or whatever. I also recall the title song being practically the only listenable cut on the entire album. Hell, the ultra-dull \\"Dust In The Wind\\" almost sounded palatable next to the rest of this dreadful mess. Yet, several reviews posted here for this album claim that it's the band's best. That's a very scary thought.One problem with well-established bands like Kansas is that people who are already big devotees of the band are about the only ones who'll bother to post a review. Thus, you get a dozen five star reviews to every negative one. If you're unfamiliar with Kansas, just remember to take that into account before falling for all of the praise in the numerous reviews here. Take it from me - you'd be better served putting your hard earned dough towards that root canal you need, which you'll probably enjoy more anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"No return indeed","review":"Altough all the musicians are really gifted, the sound here is so thin, polished, outdates, that I think these great songs deserved a \\"re-recorded\\" album.I had heard great thing about these albums and, before buying it, all I had from Kansas was a live compilation from 1986 (King Biscuit Flower Hour), that I bought due to Steve Morse being in the band at that time, not for Kansas! The sound there is much more heavy and crispy and tight than the original versions (maybe it's just the difference from 1977 to 1986).So, I surely am dissapointed with POINT OF KNOW RETURN (and what a silly joke this title!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Kansas","review":"The ying to the yang of the Kansas production that put not only the state but the artistic group on the musical landscape.

This book is also interesting as a history of the evolution of rhythms and drumming.If it had many more examples of drum patterns I would have given it 5 stars.

I found, after a lot of searching, that it was available at Amazon. It arrived promptly and was packaged like an ordinary CD but when I opened it, it looked like a blank CD. I could not tell which end was up. When I did play it, it was o.k., only I had to crank up the volume to the highest level to hear it at all, and then it was barely a whisper. I also had to mark the side that was not the play side so I wouldn't have to guess next time I played it.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas in a poorly made movie.","review":"It's disappointing when a movie full of creative ideas fails to build a story to support them. The Last Sentinel IS that movie. It stars Don \\"The Dragon\\" Wilson, and Katee Sackhoff - the latter I originally wanted to see this for. Unfortunately, Sackhoff isn't in it nearly as much as I had wanted (The cover is totally misleading), and the movie suffers perhaps because of it. Don Wilson isn't a great actor... he's pretty monotonal throughout, and doesn't bring much of anything to the table. I actually preferred Keith David's (Who voices a gun, of all things, in this movie) voice acting over Wilson's. You can definitely tell this was made-for-TV, and it suffers a lot for that. Its biggest problems are the numerous head-scratching moments. They really stick out more here than in most any movie I've seen. This could work as a bigger budget movie with a better fleshed out story and director. Keep Katee and drop the faceless cast, and you have a real movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS big time","review":"This movie sucks a big donkey's honker big time.

Second, the storyline didn't make any sense, like they cut out parts of the movie that were real important for understanding. The picture quality was of an old vhs quality. The fight scenes were the worst I have ever seen (and I have watched some bad movies). I would rather have watched grass grow or paint dry than go through this movie again. The only reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is a cheap blu-ray movie and someone will hopefully like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that bad but yah... it is.","review":"Forget the cover - this is a Don, the Dragon, Wilson movie. Katee Sackoff is in about 1/2 the movie. That's a good thing as Sackoff plays the same role she plays on BSG - just a little more whimpy. Much of the movie without Sackoff isn't too bad. I liked Wilson's backstory and what happens to him to make him living alone. Of course there are really dumb activities that just waste time.The first time Sackoff and Wilson go to the refinery - that whole trip has no value and could have been edited out and shortened the movie.It's bad in the way SOLDIER was bad but without the budget of SOLDIER.Keith David has an interesting two part role.Another renter or buy in the cheap bins as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The video equivalent of waterboarding","review":"This was the worst movie I saw in 2007, by a comfortable margin.

I'm not sure where to start on what's wrong with it. It didn't some much have a plot as a bunch scenes strung together where drones get shot and it didn't so much have characters as several people who kill drones. The material, such as it is, is bad and the execution is pretty poor, too. I'll forgive them the crappy effects, which are surely because of budget limitations, but the nonsenesical plot and poor editing and uneven acting are less forgiveable. Forget trying to explain what the movie is about. I can't really explained what happened, such as why the police drones started killing everybody. If you like a bunch of gunfire and stabbing and don't care a lot about it making sense shot-to-shot, much less as an overall story, this may be the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu ray?","review":"Putting everything else aside, the movie on Blu ray looks like I was watching an old VHS tape.

I believe the producers are attempting to play on her popularity in Battlestar Galactica. The story line is absolutely terrible unbelievable and laughable (especially when they try to pass off a 1980's IBM computer as the latest in high tech electronic equipment, yes they still have the old green and black screens). DO NOT waist your money on this. I'm sure at some point the Sci-fi channel will re-run this movie and if you must watch it (again for Katee Sackhoff) then do so. I have no idea why this was put to blue ray before even BSG was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post Apocolyptic Meltdown","review":"It is unfortunate that Kate Sackhoff was part of this. She is better than this movie. Still it had potential, but the dialogue was largely too adolescent, as was the \\"love story\\". The IT probably had the best dialogue in the script. There could have been a great love scene, character developement for all, in fact, if you put an actor on the cover, shouldn't they be the main character? Oh well!

Number 2 was so bad we stopped watching within the first 20 minutes. The budget differences ($48 million for the first one and $5 million for number 2) was oh so painfully obvious. The casting, effects, and acting of Tooth Fairy 2 was lame. Dwayne Johnson, Julie Andrews, Ashley Judd in the original vs Larry the Cable Guy (who I do like, but not in this) and a cast of unknowns. The original gets 5 Stars and number 2 gets only a single star, and I'm being generous with a single star. Pure trash! Don't waste your money! If you have Netflix, watch it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I just purchased this along with another movie today. I had a coupon and it was on sale so I only paid $4 for it.Some people disliked this movie but I thought it was a nice sweet movie. I also have the first movie and I thought this one was better than the first. I did have that fear that it wouldn't be such a good movie because it was one of those direct to video movies. I have to say it was funnier than the first as well. Our family really liked both movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"It's been a while since I've seen the first Tooth Fairy starring The Rock, but from what I can remember, it was way better than the sequel that came out on DVD March 6th. I don't know if Tooth Fairy 2 was professionally considered a flop, but it definitely was in my opinion.I used to be a fan of Larry the Cable Guy but after seeing the roles he's chosen to play, I no longer consider myself a fan. The funniest part of the movie was seeing him in the fairy getup with the tutu before he changed to the pink overalls.Children ages 5-8 would probably find the humor in this movie, but as an adult I found it seriously lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUPID IS NOT IN MY VOCABULARY","review":"This is a great movie for kids at that tooth fairy age. Larry the Cable Guy, a caricature individual commits a faux pas by inadvertently informing a child the tooth fairy is a fairy tale. As penance he must collect ten teeth in ten days. He has to do this while attempting to win back the love of his life, who is engaged to the town's car dealer, who is also running for mayor. Larry shows he has a big heart and always wants to do the right thing.The humor was geared toward kids. There were no innuendos for adults to ponder. I would think this film is geared more for girls than boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry Fans Will Love This","review":"Well, it's a cute movie for kids who find a big, hairy guy wearing a pink tutu funny. We were fans of the Toothfairy starring Dwayne Johnson in fact the kids still watch it. While there was no original cast members for the toothfairy age kids this movie is fun.Larry does an OK job being embarrassed. My favorite scene was when he turned into a toothfairy in front of two of his male friends while watching the game. Too funny!While I expected more laughs from my kids, they were not bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Bought this movie on blu-ray. It was great! I had just wanted to see this because the first with \\"The Rock\\" was so good; this really surprised me and was worth the watch. My wife also liked this movie (and she has no time for dud movies.)Definitely worth a watch, different enough from the first to keep it interesting and maintain focus.It obviously has similarities with the first in that he becomes the Tooth Fairy for putting his foot in it! From there its all new stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real disappointed - no original supporting cast members","review":"The little girl that plays the main part of the main tooth fairy was a poor choice. The movie could have been way better with just keeping Julie Andrews, Billy Crystal and the tall skinny tooth fairy from the original movie. You can change which man becomes a tooth fairy, but the original cast was awesome and I found this one to stink. In this movie the main tooth fairy lady (kid) does all the parts that the supporting cast did in the other movie ie checking in on Larry, equipping, critiquing etc. Really was disappointed that I bought the movie new instead of waiting to purchase it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, soooo bad.","review":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen.

I can't say I was completely disappointed, but I can't say I liked the book either. The entire plot seemed to be centered around the heroine, Karen Jacobs,' complaining about her job and backstabbing co-workers. Mixed in were some amusing stories about Hollywood celebs and their outrageous requests and shocking demands. It never seems like Karen gets comfortable with her position at Glorious films however, and because of that the reader really can't get comfortable with the story. We keep waiting for something more, a tidbit about Jacobs' personal life, something we get to know almost nothing about, or a hint as to why she was puts up with the mundane work she complains about throughout each chapter.

The heroine has little insight and less wit and, worst, was eminently unlikeable throughout the book. To call rest of the characters two-dimensional would be an insult to squares.If you want fun chick-lit, go read Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary again - a far better use of time than this, even if it is your tenth read. Even the occasionally painful purchase-binges of Kinsella's Shopaholic series are better than this fluff - fluff that, like cotton candy after the age of 8, only tastes sticky and leaves you nauseated that you tried to swallow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read The Twins of Tribeca some time ago, it is not my kind of book, it is very shallow and ultimately quite boring. The reason for my review is that I have just watched the video of The Devil Wears Prada and IT IS THE SAME STORY!! How can they do that? Who copied who? There are differences, one is a film company and the other is a fashion company, one works for a male boss (or two) and the other works for a female boss, but the characters are the same. As soon as the film started I recognized the story so I knew I was not going to be thrilled with the film either.

As a musician myself, this inspired me to create a remix, which I did send to Mr. Strong via E-mail, and got the highest opinion from Mr. Strong about my parody.

Imagine my surprise when the album's contents turns out to be nothing more than typical early eighties music, highly-derivative of the Cure, U2, and Echo and The Bunnymen. Even the production sounds thin compared to those other bands' sounds.The liner notes mention that Bono was a fan of these guys, but remember--he also liked the Alarm. Seems he liked any band that sounded like his own, no matter how awful and obvious it was.For me, the Sound is like that local \\"art rock\\" band we were all forced to put up with in the 80's: they had the hair, the effects pedals, but none of the talent.

It's a cliche to say it, but they really sound like a cross between Echo & The Bunnymen and Joy Division. This is truly a timeless album from a period where such things are a rarity to say the least.

The music is extremely well played, especially compared to the sort of stuff groups like The Cure, New Order, and Echo and the Bunnymen were releasing at the time. And there's not a bit of filler material. Sure, from the first note you know that this album was recorded in the early to mid eighties. But in terms of the quality of the songs and the poignancy of the lyrics, \\"FTLM\\" may be one of the best albums of the last twenty years and should appeal to even those with minimal interest in New Wave music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good showcase for silent movie star","review":"The majority of silent films are lost forever and this one starring Olive Thomas, who died two years later in Paris under mysterious circumstances, is a good addition to your film library. The film itself is better than average and a good example of a film of that time.

But here she takes the features of a typical gothic romance and skillfully turns everything on its head. The man and woman set up as the hero and heroine are not in fact the hero and the heroine. The prize is not romantic happy-ever-after, but rather something apparently more pragmatic (a neat solution to a problem?), and perhaps even more idealistic than romance (social justice?). And this delivered in Ms Michaels' usual competent and readable writing style. Is there such a thing as a sensible, mature gothic romance? If so, here it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable gothic with a twist - possible spoilers","review":"I wish Barbara Michaels would write again.I really enjoyed this book - Michaels takes the usual formula - \\"governess comes to mysterious house in the countryside and falls in love with a man who may or may not be a villain\\" and gives it a different take.I noticed a lot of reviewers dislike the heroine; I have to point out that:A) she is very young - eighteen years old.B) every other character in this book (except for one) adores the villain.

Those raised on Michael Schenker (or Richard Thompson for that matter) will be embarrassed by the proceedings, but they should keep in mind that rock was never all about intelligence or restraint, and should be about kicking out the jams.

However, shipping charges were very high didn't realize that when purchased. Candy was of good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost tooooooooooooooooooooo much for what you get.","review":"This item is not worth the price as it is only 2 lbs. worth of candy. You can get a 4 lb bag at Walmart for less than $9.00 and afford to throw away the flavors you don't like. This item would be worth 5 or 6 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and Heartwarming","review":"The best book of the series, this story follows The Train to Estelline and A Place called Sweet Shrub. Set during the Great Depression in the bleak, gnarled landscape and drought of West Texas, the characters Josh & Lucy, now with a 4 year old son, settle into their jobs in a troubled school. The deprivation and desperation of the depression sweep over the reader on almost every page, but the high spirited, high minded scholars meet each challenge as it tumbles into the schoolyard. The characters are sketched with a light and usually loving hand, and the situations are not sugar-coated but realistic and often harsh. The \\"West Texas-isms\\" are accurate and amusing. The book moves quickly to a ending that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. And completely true to this reader's experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance A Little Longer by Jane Roberts Wood","review":"Once again I picked up a book and read it, not knowing it was actually the last book in a trilogy. But the book was still very good even not reading the other 2. Lucy and her husband Josh have just bought a new farm and are going to start work in a West Texas school. While Josh works hard getting the farm in shape, Lucy spends every minute she can with their 4-year-old son John Patrick. Even tho times are tough, they help many others who are down on their luck. Some of the people in town do not want the school in town and try to run them off. But when tragedy strikes the Richards' family, the town pulls together to comfort them.Even tho I know how this trilogy ends, I'm gonna see if I can find the other 2 in the series.This review was written for Connie's Book Reviews and More on Facebook.FTC disclosure: I bought my copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"This was a good book. Funny dialogue, absurd characters, and an enlightening theme. Very challenging ideas. I recommend it heartily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Just a Couple of Days, by Tony Vigorito is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. It's a very amusing story about the end of the world. I enjoyed it, and I wish I could have given it 5 stars, but there were moments when it didn't shine. That's just my opinion. But still, I recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not keep my interest","review":"I don't understand the rave reviews of this book. It really offered nothing that kept my attention. The characters were quirky but not in a way that made me want to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all too much","review":"A blurb on the cover calls this a Dr. Strangelove for the biotech century. Well, it turns out that review isn't even half correct. Don't get me wrong: at one level, Just a Couple of Days could be considered that, but there was so much more going on here than a wicked satire of military madness. That would have been enough for me, but Vigorito went ahead and dished out poignancy in the main character, suspense in the plot twists, hilarity in the dialogue, philosophical, psychological, and sociological insight, a bizarre assortment of trivia, and sublime beauty in his descriptive turns of phrase. Simply awesome. I can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"This is one of the great unknown books out there. The writting is terrific and the story is wonderful. You will not regret reading this book. The end of this book will leave you smiling and wanting to be outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inspiring","review":"While reading this book, I felt stupid. Mostly because Tony is a brilliant writer with beautiful concepts of reality that although resonate loudly within me, was never articulated with as much clever wit. The reader, if paying attention, is taken on a journey or morality, that will leave you (at least it did for me) happy. But that's because I love questioning my morality and investigating what most people blush at: that said, anyone with a good sense of humor and joy in believing that life isn't just what is said on tv will enjoy Tony's writing style and philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read! You won't be dissapointed!","review":"Just a Couple of Days is, hands-down, my favorite book. Ever. The plot kept me hanging on and coming back for more while the author's humor, quick wit and attention to details kept me laughing and scratching my head. As word of this book catches on it is going to snowball into a best-seller. The book is jam-packed with hilarious situations, outrageous dialogs and a wide array of characters �C some that you will love and some that you will hate. So go on and read it. Kick back and laugh your head off. Ponder the future of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"subtle, comical, and enlightening","review":"I was sitting at Starbucks on a Saturday afternoon, when a very nice girl overheard my guffaw about reading another one of Bush's intelligent statements, \\"I didn't know the camera was on me!\\"So we began to talk, and after a few minutes, she pulled this book out of her bag, and told me that I should read it.All weekend long I did read, and I could not put it down. Intense, exciting, exhilerating, comical, a rush of relief in knowing that the end of the world could be an amazing wonderful experience.This book is everything, philosophical, sociological, psychological, comical, dramatic, and your not-so-common, \\"it just made me laugh at loud and feel good\\" type of book.My advice?I highly recommend this book, and periodically hanging out in coffee shops to meet really neat people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the book was a good read..","review":"I highly recomend reading this book when you have to time for all the intricacies. The constant stopping of the story with the poetry and the dialogue between two of the characters may throw someone off, if they are not paying attention in the fist place. I tried reading this book throughout Europe and I enjoyed it immensely. There are alot of good natured themes and anticdotes that are fun and philosophical. The ending was absolutely brilliant and the voice of the author kept coming in through the reading the entire time. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bizarre novel involving existential quandary","review":"Tony Vigorito's Just A Couple Of Days is a bizarre novel involving existential quandary centering on Dr. Flake Fountain, a scientist enlisted by the Committee for Peaceful Conflict to devise a cure for their new viral weapon. Dancing, laughter, the spiritual life of dinner plates, and the conundrum \\"Why aren't apples called reds?\\" (maybe because some of them are green?) all figure prominently in this unpredictably adventurous and singularly ambitious novel. Especially recommended reading for anyone with a literary interest in the surreal and metaphysical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good for me","review":"I know you want to know if you will like this book...That's hard for me to say, or guess. Language does not allow ample symbolism to convey the true meaning of the symbols it hopes to address. It's all a guess at what we hope to experience.\\"Pat your head, rub your belly, and beat on your chest and roar!\\" This book invites participation.I intend to read everything Vigorito writes. You should too. If you hate it, keep it to yourself, because others will know that you don't get the joke. Wouldn't that be sad.This book is fun, non-linear, intelligent and stupid -- all at the same time and in alternating pulses. It uses science in the fictional sense, genes, jeans and beans. You get to decide what is most important, but the author does give a few hints.Read it, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sigh...","review":"A wild, exuberant, hilarious, impressively written, consciousness-expanding, life-changing experience. i loved every minute of it, and my only disappointment is that this is only fiction. crazy, but i actually wanted to be infected with the pied piper virus. sigh... highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as cool as it thinks it is","review":"Some random graffiti written by a college professor gets him thrown in jail and enlisted as a test subject in top secret, privately-funded biological weapon testing project. The protagonist, who is the professor's best friend and also a successful microbiologist, is forced to help find a cure for the weapon after his friend is infected.I was very disappointed in this book. Not only did I not care for the main character, who doesn't really seem to mind when something awful happens to his dog, but I also found much of the writing to be unnecessary and boring. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hyped","review":"... Maybe the hype set me up for a letdown, but I don't think the book deserves all the praise it has received. It is not particularly readable. The text is too thick and often superfluous. It is metaphysical, but the metaphysics doesn't lead to any arresting conclusions, or take any unexpected routes. It felt more like random thoughts expressed too wordily. The overall feel is that of a Ecotopia (the couple of are the protagonists friends), plus Brave New World (the power-structures are mildly reminiscent), plus Andromeda Strain (the virus, obviously), plus 12 Monkeys (germs and a bit of horror). Except more turgid and slow-moving than any one of them. I would have given it one-star, but maybe I got set-up by all the praise I read before I bought it, so I'll give it two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"I did not actually get through this book. After 80 pages, I could no longer bear to read all the forced similes and the blatant rip-offs of Tom Robbins' style and Kurt Vonnegut's plots. Not to say that Vigorito succeeded in ever writing as well as either one of them. His sentences seemed to last forever, and paragraphs droned on and on with no end in sight. Avoid it. Read something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Bad Jam Band","review":"It just goes on and on.....This novel is an unrelenting procession of dismal plot, introspective asides, and languishingly bad characterizations. Mr. Vigorito should keep his personal journal and memoirs out of print for sake of mercy on us all. I made this book a Christmas present to myself. I should have gotten the wheelbarrow as I had originally planned.I conclude with a rhetorical inquiry: How could anyone find this book entertaining; let alone worthy of five stars? This work isn't of the same standard as Mother Night or Dandelion Wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone love this book?","review":"I read this book, not because I wanted to, but because I had to for a class. I want to state that because it may be different had I just picked it up on my own to read. I found the book to be rather slow moving, 50 pages into the book I was still clueless as to what the author was trying to communicate. I thought the occasional wit and humor was overshadowed by long, rambling paragraphs that pertained to nothing. While I did enjoy the underlying theme, I think the book is better as an example of what not to do with your thesaurus. Too many 'big words' distracted me while I read the book. However, if you are in the mood to substantially increase your vocabulary and look at the world a different way, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific and entertaining ride to a wonderful apocalypse","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was stupendous. The writing is great, a definite joy for those who love words. I could not put this book down, and carried it with me everywhere I went for about three days while I read it. The characters are so entertaining, particularly the bad guys, you just want to know what happens to them next.There's some very interesting views on the ultimate evolution of human communication. But it's the characters that steal the story. You have to love the personification of a heartless military industrial complex personified in the General. The political, self -aggrandizing, money hungry academia is there represented by University head Tynee. And the rotten stench of self serving, all controlling, old money surprisingly the form of chain smoking horrible old bossy woman. You will love these characters. Entertaining, thoughtful, and beautifully written, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, witty, unique... brilliant!!!!","review":"This book is truly earth shattering. It makes you think and look at life in new ways. I count it among my top ten books of all time, and I read a lot! Vigorito's style reminds me a little of Kurt Vonnegut and Tom Robbins, yet it is totally unique. It's funny, witty, and brilliant social commentary. Give this book a try. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"mostly marvelous","review":"This was a terrific novel. If you don't mind poetic prose in the telling of a story, this one's for you. For me, the writing worked marvelously 98% of the time. 2% of the time, I could see what he was reaching for (and Vigorito reaches some remarkable heights with his linguistic faculty), but for whatever reason he didn't quite get it, or didn't quite get what he could have gotten. It's extremely heartening to know that this is his first novel. I expect perfection in his next.Esoteric writing critiques aside, the story itself was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurdly Real","review":"I don't know how he did it. Well, I do know how he did it. I just finished reading it, but I'm still amazed. Tony Vigorito has crafted a beautiful novel with what seems like it should be an utterly absurd premise, but which has hauntingly familiar overtones to possibilities in the real world. I recommend this book if you enjoy any or all of the above: wild theories, spirited rants, wordplay, a compelling story, a humble protagonist, that beautiful feeling of sharing something with someone you've never met when you catch a glimpse of their true art."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Luckless is sent on a mission to New York City.","review":"A good thing about this book is it goes into alot of description about the different difficulties in traveling to New York City. A disadvantage is the book ends abrutly. The book leaves you with many questions. A thing that somebody can relate to is the dissapointment when John Luckless finds out that his message is fake. John felt very misled and dissapointed because the British Army let him down."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!!!!!!","review":"this polyester string is really garbage it breaks after about 20 or so shots so don't get this try to get something better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt last ..","review":"Well, as other reviews said the bowstring unraveled after about 20 shots, i think some crazy glue on each end of the wind where the bolt is contacted would maybe help, but the knot without glue, as is, comes undone and the reinforcing wind just unravels off. bought two, 2nd one I am gluing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good service","review":"Item was delevered on time. One of the clips was broken out of the package. Company was able to send me another item and made good on product that was broken. Shot my crossbow 10 times and the string broke. Not very good string. Thought it would hold up better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this!","review":"Hey I am not sure if I have written these before but let me just say get another string.

Merry Christmas by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"the shipping was fast but i fired the crossbow two times before the string broke. it was very disappointing to say the least. i would not recommend this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior","review":"First of all, I read various reviews on the 80# crossbow strings available. This wasn't the cheapest one, but I figured spending a little extra couldn't hurt. After all, your string is a very important component of your weapon. This string is still a cheap p.o.s. (piece of schunck). It's made of polyester which stretches a lot more than one might think when attached to the prod. This results in weaker propulsion of the bolts. Case in point: when a bolt should've passed clean through the target, it instead got stuck in the prey; which inevitably escaped. However if your not going for range (attempting shots at less than 20 yards) and primarily just doing target practice, then this string will launch the bolts. 2 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"My second all time favourite record","review":"Something of a concept album, named by the epic 'Glass and Smoke' with it's building spasms and internal tensions. The synth work constantly emphasises sheets of glass, metalic substances and steel being torched. This harshness is combined with moments of heart stopping beauty and romance. Love in the urban jungle? There are some truly sublime guitar breaks which act as almost a bridge between the two contradictions.A very modernist record that still sounds fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this was their worst, I'd like to hear their best","review":"This was the third album of the great underrated band The Sound, and considered by many to be a weak follow-up to their classic From The Lion's Mouth. I wasn't going to get this album from all I heard about it, but I saw it marked down in a store and bought it on an impluse. And I was surprised to discover many songs I can't live without! I had Monument in my head after one listen. After playing the CD a couple more times, I came to love In Suspense, Where The Love Is and We Could Go Far. The biggest treat was the bonus track Sorry; I'm completely puzzled why it was left off the original album. The only reason I rate this four stars and not five is that there are several not-so-good tracks. That doesn't matter; I still got 8 cuts for my iPod out of this CD and they're great ones--what more can you expect from an album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job.","review":"This hard-to-find item turned out to be exactly what I needed.

Impossible to find in stores, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I hooked it up effortlessly within minutes, and it works flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High Quality from Amazon","review":"These boxes with sliding backstop for card storage are very difficult to find. I ordered 6 of these and all were basically falling apart when received. I decided to put them back together and use them anyway as there does not seem to be other brands available. I would not recommend these for the poor quality (the sliding bar, backstop and rear bulkhead are marginal) but if you can't find an alternate these boxes will do a mediocre job of storing your cards anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One year after my son in law died suddenly , we are left with so many questions.

I have received this immediately through the electronic transfer to my Kindle Reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This looks like a very good book however I am yet to read it but I am looking forward to doing so"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"This is an excellent book full of truth. Often we struggle to understand life's hurts and this book truly helps to bring peace in all situations. Also, there is a tendency to question God's character in times of hurt. This book addresses these issues Biblically and reminds us that God is indeed sovereign!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE CHANGING!","review":"After reading the first book to this series (The Fall of Lucifer), I was hoping the second would be as good, if not better than the first. It was awesome! I couldnt put the book down, it really gave me a bigger picture of our eternal God, his plan and his goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I received this book as a free audiobook download for the month of February 2012 from Christianaudio.com. This book is all about the sovereignty of God and explains how and why God is in control and charge of everything. Bridges is not writing an academic or theological book on the subject, but is writing from a practical standpoint and has written a book to aid Christians in their lives. This book has aided me and helped me re-think things and parts of my life. God is in control and nothing we can do will spare us another minute on earth outside of God's sovereign will. God is fully in charge and can change circumstances as he sees fit. Why he sometimes chooses to do things and why he sometimes chooses to do nothing is a mystery, but he knows best and should be trusted as such. Overall a great book and a recommended read for all christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for trying times","review":"I have been in pastoral ministry for almost 20 years and often have people come to me for encouragement in their time of need. This has happened with increasing frequency as many people look at the changes in our world and desperately desire hope. This book provides a clear, Biblical view of how we can find that hope from the hands of a God who loves us. It is well written and incredibly practical. I was blessed in reading it and saddened when I reached the end. I am sure it will be a help to me and my congregation for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I read all of it and some things were helpful and some were not. Would recommend to others most likely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you believe GOD is all good? Or Do you believe GOD is all Powerful?","review":"These are the questions that we ask ourselves when life turns on us. When we see injustice, when we are hurting... Why would a good God allow such and such? Or why would a Powerful GOD not stop this? We fight with our own understanding of the situations and our faith can take a hit. This book is amazing. I feel either we tend to believe in our heart of hearts one of these two questions. Typically we are either in the camp of; 'God is all powerful and therefore he must not love me enough or isn't really all that good.\\" Or we believe in our hearts \\" God is all loving, and therefore because he allowed this to happen he must not have been able to stop it.\\" With either of these two mis-interpretations we can loose heart. This book will create a stonger FAITH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very DEEP but very helpful!","review":"This is one of those books which you do not just 'skip' through. You have to consider the authors words, sometimes you might find that you are not too certain about the train of thought, but of course you can refer to the Bible quotes or verses that are given just to see just what the Word of God says.So this book is thought provoking. Which is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me...but I have problems with this book","review":"I just have some problems with this book, maybe it is just me.I do believe God is in control, but I do believe that He has allowed Satan to be in control of this world.I cannot believe God chooses for someone to have an abortion, that this is part of his plan...or that a 99-year-old woman to be beaten to death in a home invasion is part of His plan. I think this is Satans work...not Gods.If I were not a Christian and read this, I think I would run from God.I think God helps us through the rough times, but I don't think he scripts ever single bad thing that happens to us. What is free will if he plans every thing down to the wire like this? Then why are we held accountable for our sins, if it is planned that we lose our temper or say something bad to someone?I just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking","review":"I enjoyed this book.

This book was exactly what I hoped for and will be re-read many times I am sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"very timely","review":"This book will greatly help those today that are going through difficult times. This author is easy to understand,and he makes his points effectively. The chapters are short and the application of \\"Trusting God even when Life Hurts\\" is excellent. This was written by a man that had gone through rough times himself and shows what great help the Lord was to Him, and is to us also who have had hard trials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious book","review":"Too far right for my religious thinking. I found myself not getting into the story and not wanting to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating Varies Based on Theology","review":"If you are Reformed, this would probably be a 5 star book.

This is a good read for all who believe in God, listen (and study) God's Word and strive to do what it says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"i would recommend this novel to anyone who is interested in building a relationship with God. It deals with every day topics which every christian is faced with who has been challenged with such things as death, failures in marriages, heartache, disappointment and especially faith. The focus of this book concerns how we can learn to trust God especially when we are faced with situations and challenges which we cannot understand or explain, especially in times of adversity. It also deals with the area of obedience to God, and the question of God sovereignity in our lives. The book is well written and interlaced with examples which we can all relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree, don't buy, until they are uncut episode!","review":"I can't believe people are still buying these butcher up episodes, after buying season 1, and discovering they were the syndication version, I resold it on eBay, there is no way I would buy cut episodes.

Also it is sad that there are reviewers who give this 4 or 5 stars even though the program is not complete. To illustrate to those misguided 4 and 5 star reviewers next time you go to a baseball game stay for only for 7 innings, or when you watch your next football game watch for only 3 quarters. Or next time you watch your favorite program turn it off with 5 minutes left. We all know the show is very funny, the bad ratings is because of cut-up syndicated version. I will give all of you 4 and 5 star reviewers a dollar, if you will use it to buy a clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for another set of laughs","review":"I now officially own all the ALF seaons on DVD. I love love love the show and will happily continue to enjoy it for years to come. However, I have a complaint against Lionsgate (aside from the whole syndication issues) - the last disc of this season, they screwed up the order of the shows. Kate is pregnant, the baby is born, and then in the next episode they appear to have shoved the baby back in because she's pregnant again. Apparently when they edited this DVD, they didn't notice the discrepancy. I was only six when this season would have aired, so I have no idea if the shows were actually in that order, but I'm pretty sure the person making the collaboration put them in the wrong order. Otherwise it's a great set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alf Rules!","review":"If this show had had better writers, it may still be on. This was the last good year Alf had. True fans should probably get season 4 also but be prepared, it has definitely jumped the shark by season 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Packaging, but...","review":"I bought this book largely based on the prior reviews and the appeal of the cover. I was very disappointed in the content though. The pages are all 8 1/2 x 11 formats and I do 12 x 12 formats. Although there were some appealing layouts, I thought many of the them were very simplistic and not anything I would care to get inspiration from. I don't like that fact that it only has ideas from 3 different scrapbookers because they each have a particular style and therefore there is not a lot of variety in the layouts. This is a book more suited to a beginning scrapbooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great layouts","review":"If you're looking for a book of layout ideas, this one is for you. It is mainly a book of pictures of scrapbook pages, but it does have some tips and instruction. I was looking for a book with ideas for new pages and this one is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless......","review":"This has to be the worst built item on all of Amazon. This thing is worthless and doesn't work for anything. It makes a bunch of noise, then pulls on my hairs. I am returning it immediately and insulted by being sold this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well but quickly went dull","review":"I don't recommend this product. They went too cheap on the blades and it went dull after only a couple of uses. It now yanks and pulls as it cuts. I have regular hair trimmers and shavers I've used for years without this problem. I now need to purchase something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where","review":"First time I used this item, I was very happy, it did a great job. I blushed ou the hairs and oiled the blades and put away. A couple weeks later when I went to use it again, the blades weren't moving, and I can't get anyone to replace or reimburse me. Don't waste your hard earned money on this product, look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good but cheap","review":"Still have a hard time reaching my back. I needed something cheap and this was it. I mean if I had the money I would pay for laser treatments! Buy something else if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trited, corny, pedestrian and unoriginal. Awful!","review":"I ordered this book expecting to learn something sophisticated and original, but instead I got a list of cliches that wouldn't impress any on the ball, modern woman. Save your money and pick something else. Any other book on pick-up lines would work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for outstanding books","review":"I had never read any of these books before, but had heard so many good things about them, I decided it was about time I looked into them. I shopped around, and this was the best value I could find. It really is a great deal, and the reading is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facinating subject, Yawner of a book","review":"This book is more of a travel log than a text about megaliths. The author tells the story of his sea journey to visit European megalithic sites. At each site he provides a brief description of the megaliths and a bit of background information as well as his emotional reaction to the site and conclusions about which he has \\"no doubt\\".The information is too shallow and the author to opinionated for the book to be a useful text about megaliths. It does provide a good sense of the vast quantity of megalithic sites. It does also support well the author's premise of a shared European megathic culture.But I had to force myself to finish the book. More photographs and illustrations would have helped. Leaving out the bad poetry and fuzzy-wuzzy feelings would have helped. Leaving out the words \\"no doubt\\" (which he says over and over again) would have helped.The bibliography at the end is appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rossini","review":"This is a very balanced production of Tancredi with excellent singing throughout. The production style is very generic, but artistic and certainly not eurotrash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best compilation..","review":"Better than the previously released \\"Essential\\" compilation CD. This was a great band that never got the respect they deserved in America. If you want to own a real good overview, then this CD would be it.I would also recommend \\"Strangers in the Night\\" their double live LP from around '79 that captures them at their finest. One of the best hard and heavy live albums of the 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I bought this after hearing Tesla play \\"Rock Bottom\\" and at least one other UFO song at the New York State Fair. \\"Rock Bottom\\" is my favorite song from this CD, and I would buy it all over again just for this song. Michael Schenker was on top of his game with this song, and I have since watched multiple videos on Youtube with Michael (with or without UFO) that rocked my socks off with this song. I never really cared about the vocals with any version of \\"Rock Bottom\\" that I've heard, but Michael's guitar more than makes up for it. Check it out on Youtube, then buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic hard rock riffs start here","review":"This is a great intro cd to British hard rockers icon UFO. Theses dudes tore it up in the 70s (80s stuff is weaker after Michael Schenker left solo). Every track rocks the house and great way to get into this band. Dig a little deeper and check out their catalog from this decade for some deep cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum Ordinary","review":"Don't waste your money. If this is the Best Of UFO, then I'm thankful I don't have anything else of theirs! This will be lucky to get another playing. Woefully ordinary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome collection!","review":"UFO's legacy is a large one and this collection delivers. A fine place to start and discover what all the hub bub is about.After that, do get the live \\"Strangers In The Night\\" (Schenker at his UFO best)!BTW, who's the bonehead that designed the cover. Whoever it was, apparently didn't do their homework as there are two pictures of Pete Way and none of Paul Raymond. You think the label would at least have somebody who is familiar with the band do the cover. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Near the Best Of","review":"This is nowhere near the \\"Best of\\" as there are too many classic UFO songs missing. This is merely a selection of a few greats and an overview of the Paul Chapman era when to be honest none of the songs featured would ever make a true best of selection. Check out \\"Essential\\" for a more realistic best of collection for the period. Better still buy the Live \\"Strangers in the Night\\" album, which is excellent value and has all you need to start to appreciate a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get what I thought I would get","review":"I looked forward to getting the original AND NOT A SMALL VERSION WHICH IS USELESS.

Boy was i mistaken. Don't get me wrong, what's in the picture is definitely better quality than what's out there right now, the problem is that i didn't receive what i purchased. It is the same low quality NewRay toy. The description of the item here says Maisto but the item i got was NewRay (which i was trying to avoid in the first place).

I bought it to use for an exercise ball, and before the ball was inflated, the motor simply stopped and wouldn't start again. Also, it is noisy, like a vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not functional","review":"This pump comes with a hole on each air out/in tubes which make the inflatation and deflatation not realizable. I never saw this type of design before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"Do not buy this or any other high end watches from Amazon!!!! This is a grey market item sold directly by Amazon that is not supported by a Cartier warranty. Moreover, the watch arrived inoperable and although I returned it the same day it was delivered, Amazon has refused to accept the return because of \\"scratches\\" on the clasp.

Unfortunately, there aren't any cases available as of this writing. And thats the big let down. Already I have a few small scratches, and thats not good in my book. Anyway, I love how the nano can finnaly play video. At first, I thought it wouldn't be easy watching an episode of Heroes or LOST on a 2 inch screen, but then I watched it. AWSOME. Unfortunately, most of the shows have widescreen, making the already small screen even smaller, though I hear you can change the aspect ratio. Anyway, best iPod ever, at least until the iPod Touch comes out.Bonus points for it getting people to talk to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs up - I'm returning my second one already","review":"I went to the Apple store when they received their shipment yesterday (9/6) and purchased my new Nano. After connecting it to charge it and put some music on it, I tested it and it froze after about 10 minutes of use. Couldn't get it to turn off - it wouldn't accept any input. So I let the battery die down over night and connected it next day. Still in frozen state. So I took it back today and exchanged it for another one. Connected it, put some music on it, and this one froze even before playing a tune. The software must not have been tested very well. It's not like I was doing anything unusual. Back to the Apple store tomorrow to return this, and I think I'll wait awhile to get it.The product looks great otherwise. The screen is bright and clear. Can't wait until they work out the bugs so I can get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Purchased this Nano for my wife for Christmas. She loved the 3G Nano she had and had no desire for any of the new units, so I wanted her to have what she wanted. Got the Nano in a sealed case, all looked good and unused. On the first battery charge, a spot appeared under the glass on the display like there was moisture in the Nano. It did not hold the charge and was unusable. Brought it to an Apple store and was told the unit had been used/registered before. I had them swap it out with a refurbished unit with a new battery. The unit from Apple works fine. From now on, if I ever need or want an older model of something Apple, I will always get it from Apple. I did not bother to work with the seller on getting this one fixed. Didn't have the time or energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Fast shipping and good service but the refurbished units are just no good.I went through two of them a then gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect BUT it does not come with a case","review":"I got the 4gb because it was the cheapest and and highly rated. The Ipod got delivered fast and it was all that I expected, a good, small, easy to use Apple product.

I do recommend springing for the 8GB over the 4GB if you think you will use the movie feature much. I have a couple movies that I leave on there all the time for boring moments. Plus I have ALL the cd's I own loaded on iTunes and only the songs I like synced to the iPod. That's amazing to me. Did have to reset it once after I loaded all my crap on it, but no big deal.

I looked at online reviews and talked to a lot of people and overwhelmingly the iPods were the favorite. I have really enjoyed mine and am excited to get even more music loaded.

It's really that simple, there is no need for anything more. Why is this such a difficult concept for Apple, Microshaft and others?

It's pretty pathetic actually, when I pay over 200 dollars for a MP3 player, I expect it to have decent sound quality! The only reason I gave this player 2 stars is because it is a very nice looking, very portable player. Other than that, it is a piece of crap and I will be returning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple needs to be more compatible","review":"I gave my daughter the iPod nano. What Apple doesn't tell you is you have to have the newest operating system on your Apple Computer. That means you have to have Mac OS X v10.4.8. You can't use it if you have Panther OS X 10.3.9. So you have to spend an additional $129 for a new operating system! Making the total for an iPod $129 more! We have Windows Vista computers too, and have ITunes installed on them. Apple does not have the correct Vista software to be compatible. I had to go to Microsoft and download an old XP file in order for the IPod to work on our PC Vista computer. This took a long time, and my daughter was not happy most of Christmas until I could figure it out. When you spend that kind of money, is it too much to expect it to work. I, like most people, I am sure, are not computer savy, and what I had to do to get this to work is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"This is the worst service i have received from this company ever.

Why put all that effort into a great design only to force you to tether it with an ugly cable instead of simply docking it with it's convenient port.

They did this so that in a couple of years they will be able to sell you something else. It's called 'scheduled obsolescence'.There is very, very little bass in the music. To save battery life, there is next to NO BASS. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Save your money. Buy like eight personal CD players, or maybe two or three MP3 players from anyone but Apple.

Another thing is I think this nano is not designed for guys since it's so small esp. the wheel. The body is shorter than the 2nd gen. too which makes it harder to hold.

Even though its a small gadget the video is great, at first it's kind of difficult to watch movies/tv shows, but if you stare at the screen for a couple of minutes, you forget how tiny it is. I have to say that I was impressed with the battery life also, I can play like 50 songs, watch 2 tv shows (42 min a piece), and watch movies (over an hour and a half each)...very impressive.

I went with the earbuds from zen they actually fit inside your ear canal like ear plugs. They rock and come with 4 different sizes and do not fall out when u run.overall happy with this purchase.

I'm very disappointed with my purchase. I've also heard there's a glitch in the iPod that doesn't let you use all of your GBs. I'm not sure, but if thats the case, then Apple is getting a call today.

I have a 2-year-old mini iPod, and I'd seen these new ones and loved them. Only problem: I run OS 10.3.9 on my computer, and this thing requires 10.4.8. So basically, if I want to use this gift, I need to shell out $180 for a system upgrade that from what I've read is fraught with problems. No thanks.When I called Apple to see about exchanging the present (still in original packaging) or getting a store credit, they told me that I would need the original receipt and it had to be within 14 days of purchase. Well, I received it 3 weeks after my grandmother purchased it, so I'm out of luck.Every time I look at it, I get more angry. It uses the SAME cord as my mini iPod. The SAME version of iTunes that I currently use. Yet it won't work! It makes me think Apple just wants to get $180 out of me for a system upgrade.

What they did not tell me (and yes, admittedly, I did not bother to research the question myself) was that iPods ONLY play iTunes music, which you can't subscribe to but have to pay for by track. So not only did I just buy the most expensive brand of mp3 player, but now I also have to spend over $500 to PURCHASE every single song I have as a subscription through Y!Music. It seems to me that something as universal as the iPod ought to allow for other services. I think this is an incredibly poor customer service issue that rips people off.

Does not work with subscription music.- Must sync with only one computer - very limiting- Display and font size is too small to see clearlyAfter having used iTunes and iPods for 6 years, I tried Rhapsody subscription with a Sansa View, ibiza, my Sonos system and TiVo.

I had to thoroughly disinfect the headphones. It was almost worth buying them new. It honestly looked like they were dropped in the mud picked up and wiped off. It had black stuff caked in all the little grooves and the little gray rubber part on the buds were completely off, not to mention the battery needs to be charged like every 1/2 hour or less.

The video users wanted more storage so they upgraded those because 30G etc... isnt enough to hold much video, so who need video with 8GB or less. How much video can you store with 3000 songs as well?

I included a better earbud set in her gift after reading in a review that the problem with the Apple line of MP3 players is the sub standard earbud fidelity and bass response. Otherwise this is a fine product although a little pricey. There are lower priced MP3 players that are just as good or better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great...","review":"I've had this Ipod for a little while and it stopped working randomly.

Ever since I bought this, I have had problem charging the unit. Even though the battery icon shows that it is only half-charged, when I plug the unit either to a USB port in the computer or to the battery charger (bought separately), the unit still says \\"Charged.\\" And it won't charge at all. After I juggle with resetting the unit by pressing together the menu and the middle button , even then it won't charge. And I have the latest version of iTunes installed. Something is seriously with the battery charging with this nano. Buyers beware. This is not working all right.This is my 5th iPod, and every one of them died after a few months.

The screen is small (bad font) and boring. The controls are hard to use and don't respond well (too sensitive or they don't move at all).

Many of my files wouldn't even convert. I had no trouble doing any of this on my iriver clix (no wonder it was stolen, the iriver also has a much better screen picture and user interface.

One year later, I was the greeted by a swift kick in my pants when Apple announced they were updating their nano with a longer, sleaker version. I was very upset to say the least. I paid a little over $200 w/ a protection plan and come to see that the 8 GB version of the 4 gen is $50 cheaper than the previous version. So what is so different from this version to the new version. Well, it has the flip thing the touch has and it has a new case design.

He was able to load songs he already had on the computer onto the iPod, but has been unable to load songs he purchases from iTunes onto the iPod. No one has been able to figure out what is causing this problem, including the iPod help folks. This has been very frustrating for everyone in the family. The problem may not be the fault of the iPod itself, but we have been unable to determine whether it is or it isn't. We would not purchase another iPod for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a ZERO star option for the Nano 3rd gen","review":"WOW, this is truly a piece of crap. I've bought 2 now and both cannot be recognized by my APPLE laptop. Thats right, I love my apple macbook pro but this nano does not like it. Tried everything on the ipod support page but nothing works. Can't even get a reservation to have it looked at by the local apple store, I guess they have too many others with the same problem. I wonder how many people have spent the holidays trying to get their nanos to work properly. Thanks Apple for making me waste time and money this holiday season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, a music player can be too small","review":"The nano is thin and pretty, and picture quality is amazing, but the device feels too insubstantial. It's so thin and lightweight that it frequently falls from my pocket, and there are no sleeves available yet. Also, the selection wheel is inconsistent - at times, it is so sensitive that it will rocket up the volume or advance to the next song at the slightest touch, and at other times it has to be carefully manipulated to get it to do what you want it to do. I also prefer the set-up that puts the headphone jack at the top - with the jack at the bottom, the device can only be slipped upside down into a shirt or pants pocket.I wish Apple had made some of the traditional iPods available at smaller sizes (with corresponding price reduction). I liked the feel of my old iPod photo in my hand but don't care to shell out that much money again for a device that only lasts a couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love it. i got the ipod as a early christmas gift.

I like the features on it, like viewing video podcasts and the controls (especially the screen lock). Sound quality is very clear and the volume control allows a wide range. The games are really fun. Since there's a small screen, the movies and music videos are very small, but they do play well. Wireless syncing and bluetooth would be huge improvements. The Notes and Calendar would be better if you could create/update them on the nano, instead of only syncing them from your computer.

Sensitive direction by Dana Packard. Jennifer Porter creates the fragile, tormented Lila with delicacy and underlying passion. Eric Schweig (Skins, Big Eden) shines as Samuel, Lila's tender husband who seeks to unearth her secrets and lend his tremendous strength to her struggle for survival. The story moves at a hypnotic pace (sometimes a little too slow) that draws you into Lila's past and the riddle of the odd but charming stranger on an old-fashioned bicycle from a bygone era. Who is he and what does he want from Lila?Superb ensemble acting and haunting locations. I hope this indie film will be seen by anyone who enjoys a good ghost story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"This little guy is worth every penny, and more! When he arrived, I put him out by the road and watched from my deck. It was amazing to watch how everyone driving past slowed down.

My cats are always crossing the street and we recently lost one to a speeding motorist. I had seen these in another neighborhood and realized that, I would drive well below the posted limit and be on the lookout! I figured maybe others would as well. I purchased four and placed them on both sides of the street on the approach to my home. They work! I would say 90% of the passing cars slowed considerably below the posted limit. Even a neighbor that is always speeding by slowed. Cats or kid's this is a very effective product and well worth the investment. One 50# bag of play sand and a funnel made weighting the base of four a breaze. They also store quite well. The flourecent green color stands out too."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality, Far Superior Design to Cheap Alternatives","review":"You can't tell from the picture, but the little yellow man is probably bigger than my toddlers and stands out perfectly! We ended up buying two, one for each side of the road in our little loop so that we can feel safe about riding bikes in front of the house.

Also, on a side note, in response to another review, it is not the police who REFUSE to lower the speed limit (Trust me, I am one. All we do is enforce the speed limit). It is traffic control. They are the ones who you need to contact if you want the speed limit lowered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea","review":"Parents should not rely on this gimmick to give them a false sense of security. It is widely recognized by traffic engineers that motorists do not slow down for Children At Play signs and that children take the signs to mean they have license to play in or next to the street, and that parents falsely think they no longer need to pay close attention to their children's playinghabits.Further, this item is not a toy and is not a substitute for parental supervision. Children simply should not be playing near the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have children, you need these!","review":"I bought these for my son's birthday party which was the day before Easter. Since we were having an egg hunt outside, I was VERY concerned about the number of children outside and since we have a corner lot, I wanted some sort of warning to oncoming motorists. So, I bought two of these signs and were they the hit of the day! They work so very, very well, they're extremely brightly colored so they're very visible from all angles. Plus, the red flag the little boy waves is an extra extension for folks to see. We have a couple of speedsters around our neighborhood and these guys provide just enough peace of mind whenever we're outside with out little one. He's never out of sight but still, if you have careless drivers around, these guys are awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mom's Best Friend","review":"This is a very handy item for every yard.

It will become very handy if you live on a street corner where cars are turning or near a busy road.

You should consider getting this item if there are constantly alot of kids in your yard. This is also useful if you have pets outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"This is a great safety item to own. We put it out in the middle of our cul-de-sac and it is very visible. The color is eye catching along with the height and bright flag. All of our neighbors have commented on how easy it was to see from a distance so that they can slow down and are aware of the kids well before they get up to where we are. You can never be too safe. We looked at other safety signs, but found this one to be the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful tool in a parent's arsenal...","review":"I just purchased this item to place on the edge of our property on our semi-active street. We live at the entrance to a horseshoe neighborhood and I'm always upset at the neighbors and visitors that fly around the corner heading down the street, especially with children playing obviously in the yards.I would NEVER substitute my parental guidance and attention with a plastic neon sign, however along with bike helmets and knee pads, I feel that this is yet another tool in a parent's safety arsenal. I don't allow my children to play in the street with the neighbor kids, but even sidewalks can be dangerous in the path of a speeding driver who isn't paying attention. I wish I had found this when we first moved in. I hope every neighbor with children will be following suit this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great idea","review":"i have a 5 year old who loves to play outside and cross the street to visit nieghbors. i got one to slow down traffic on our busy street. unfortunately the next day after putting it up someone stole it. make sure to secure it in place if you get one. i assume it is just to tempting for the teenage population."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best guide to trails in Michigan","review":"All you need is this book to find the perfect trails for you anywhere in Michigan.

It reveals a lot more about God and life than some people are willing to admit. The principles are true and the style is unique. I've talked with dozens of people whose minds and hearts have been transformed by this book.

Because this friend and I always seem to be on the same \\"wave length,\\" I automatically assumed I would love it. But, both my husband and I didn't. I think my husband summed it up in 2 ways:1) It didn't inspire us to want to investigate God.2) It is like a bad version of \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul.\\"A \\"blog\\" is generally random thoughts about various things...but this was just too random. We found ourselves not really able to get into each little story. We both just expected more.The one thing that bothered me was all the font changes and scribblings. As a writer, I understood the intended purpose, but there were just too many and they were too distracting.The good thing about the book is that it is NOT filled with bible passages and such - which can also be rather distracting and annoying.Overall, I think the message about God being this loving, caring, nurturing *being* was overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative and funny but definitely fiction.","review":"Although this book is creative and funny,it still remains fiction.

In two days I completed reading Fragile X - simply because I could not put the book down. Seldom, if ever, have I read a book of fiction that so honestly spoke to the problems that each and every one of us have or will face in some way or other - whether it be in health care or some other facit of our lives. Fragile X has all the ingredients to make it a great novel - interesting characters, intrigue, fascinating plot and a tender love story. It also sends a message of how one small, rather insignificant person, can change the direction of a large and powerful company that only sees profit as it motivation for success. Five stars plus - all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING","review":"Stuart Rice does an exceptional job at portraying the real life nightmare individuals face within the world of managed care. The author captivates his reader within the first few pages of Fragile X. He creatively takes you through all facets of life so that one becomes deeply intertwined in the challenges and decisions the characters must make. Dr. Rice inspires the reader by creating a rich blend of life's experiences including medicine, religion, truth, honesty, hate and love. Fragile X is definately a \\"stay up late\\" \\"get nothing done\\" novel. Fragile X is a must read for all and is guaranteed to make you laugh, cheer and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragile X","review":"The business of managed care is upon us daily.

We'll see if they last the entire 12 weeks, which is really long for a teen study, but so far it's holding their interests. I think that it might be a little basic for older, more discipled teens. For very young teens, it is pretty G-rated. The only mature subject matter that I have noticed so far is Week 6 when the author covers Tamar, David's daughter that was raped by her brother. But the subject is handled very tastefully, and the week's focus is about letting God heal your hurts. Beautifully done.

I figured that it would be no big deal to get a replacement - the few times something similar has happened with other products typically all it took was a call to customer service and a replacement would be sent in a few days. Not with Panasonic - they directed me to one of two local repair places - one of which was over 25 miles from my house! I went to the closer location - about 9 miles away, but in the city - round trip it took over an hour.Well, it has been 10 days and I called to see what was happening. The owner of the business was a real jerk - he told me that it would take as long as it took and that he would happily sell me a replacement if I drove over there again (they had kept the damaged nozzle that I had duct taped).Wow - terrible service all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"this vac really sucks!","review":"great suction power. It works really well on hard floor surfaces. I use it to clean hardwood and laminate floors. I love the dust brush attachment - it's really great for cleaning dust on glass, furniture, or any delicate surface(now I only need to spray and wipe those surfaces much less often).The reason for one missing star is that I'd like it to have longer power cord(like 25 ft) and the hoses could connect more securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update to prior review.","review":"The vacuum itself turned out to be extremely effective, it cleans up as previously mentioned, great!

Choose another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good! I am surprised!","review":"I really like this vacuum for the price. I am aghast to see how much dust and stuff I get up when the floor doesn't seem all that dirty. The vacuum gets up dust - like the kind that you see accumulate on the computer - great....I don't think I realized how all that dust settles on the floor just as much as on the hard funiture. It's great to be bagless and to be able to empty it each time and get the Lego toys out of the vacuum. I don't worry about losing anything now. I wish it cleaned out just a little easier as the hair get stuck inside. Also, there is a felt gasket that looks like it won't last too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little vacuum","review":"I already own this vacuum and decided to purchase one for my grandmother as well. It's not too big or heavy and has great suction. The only annoying thing is that the hose attachment separates often.

I have 4 cats and endless cat hair, and this vac is a breeze to use on the floors and above ground. It's very lightweight, but has very powerful suction. I also love the cord rewind! Being bagless is a big money saver, as I would go thought a couple bags in a week with all the fur. The twisting mechanism on the dirt cup is quite helpfull as well. I don't think it would be as great for carpeting, but I have all hard floors and I'm thrilled with this vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hate this vacuum!","review":"I got this vacuume to replace a National brand vacuume which I got whilst in Japan. The National one was small, compact and was so fantastic I wanted another similiar one and since I had heard Panasonic bought National I figured the vacumme's would be equally great, not so.This bagless vacumme needs to be emptied all the time, and that is a very messy job especially when you have to clean the filter inside. Dust sifts through the air everywhere and when the filter has even the smallest bit of dirt of fluff attached to it then the suction is really impacted and you will be forever at the bin trying to clean the wretched thing. On top of that, the cord is short. I hate this vacumme, I've had it for 6 months and am so sick of cleaning it and the slack suction I am shopping for another one today. Do yourself a favor and get a vacumme that needs bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice item......... More than expected, many features","review":"Great price for this above average item.

There is NO WAY you can use this on carpet, or even area rugs. My home is 80% hardwoods and I still am unhappy because who wants to have to switch between 2 vacuums while cleaning? Plus, it is very flimsy (hence the lightweight, I guess.) It is comparable to a shop vac with an attachment, except a shop vac is much sturdier. Buy a shop vac instead!! I really wanted to like this, but know that I need to quickly return it before it breaks! I hate to pay return fee plus return shipping, which will almost equal the price of the vacuum, but I don't want this piece of junk in my house.

I was able to pack enough stuff for a two-day business trip in it. My only (minor) issue is that the zippers seem a little stiff, and I'm afraid of working them too hard. That's one of the things that typically fail on these things. Probably just need to give them a little time but I've had other packs that disappointed at the wrong time so I'm being gentle with them. Otherwise it seems like a good, solid pack with lots of compartments for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pack","review":"This is the best backpack that I've ever owned. Great for books or a student, but still rugged and sturdy enough for a hiking or camping backpack.So many pockets and places to put things that you can literally forget where you put something if it is small enough. I love the additional zippers for the two main compartments (one for easily sliding in and out your laptop and another for the front main compartment for removing things without opening the whole zipper.Plus a built-in rain-cover on the bottom, I think I am in love.Super versatile pack, great for anyone who cares about quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag for the price","review":"Purchased this item for a trip where I didn't want to bother with checked baggage. This backpack easily holds enough for four-five days, while being small enough to carry on, even when other people had to check their rolling carry on bags. Two things of note. I got the black version, and the white stripes you see in the pictures are reflective and very obvious. Just something to keep in mind. Also, some pictures show a zippered side-pouch, some mesh. Mine was mesh, with nothing on the other side. I sewed on a MOLLE pouch to help balance things a little better.Overall, great item, would definitely purchase again (though hopefully it is high enough quality that I won't have to!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy and spacious.","review":"So far so good. I like the design and color, the numerous pockets and straps. Brought the bag to an event and I could stuff a whole load of things in it without any trouble. Time will tell whether it will last me for at least a couple of years with heavy usage. I am, however, quite annoyed with the zippers of the main compartment. They seem to get stuck way too often for no good reason, unlike the zippers of the smaller pockets. It was quite a hassle to open and then zip up the main compartment again, whenever I had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backpack","review":"Very convenient and well thought through backpack which holds a lot of different items of all different sizes.

I also needed a pack that would protect my laptop, audio recorder, etc. This backpack did all that and more. I was especially impressed with the suspension shoulder straps. When lifting my pack fully loaded, it is very heavy, but when I put it on my back the weight seems extremely manageable. I feel this pack is well worth the money. Haven't used the rain cover yet, but love the idea it's there for when I need it. I found this pack to be extremely versatile with many compartments and a convenient external bottle holder.

The pocket on the shoulder strap is too small for my iPhone, but I can still cram it in there and leave the flap open.

There are a ton of compartments to keep things separated. The seller for me was the rainguard. I ride my bike everyday with this backpack and getting caught in the rain would have been a real bummer, especially with my laptop. Not with the rainguard.

The bag held up well across 4 countries and a dozen flights. You can read the other reviews for the positives of the bag, so I'll focus on the minor items that I did not approve of.However, if you nitpick, the bag is a bit too heavy (due to extra zippers and the rain fly), and the 2nd pocket is difficult to use by reaching backwards, unlike some other bags I have used that are more intuitive to use while keeping the bag on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good High Quality Laptop/Bookbag","review":"This seems like a very good backpack so far since I got it for use in graduate school with having to put multiple books/binders along with a laptop all together. I didn't want to take multiple bags to class, and there is enough room to fit two/three textbooks, two/three binders, and a laptop along with a battery. It can be a tight fit, but some different arranging helps it all to fit.

Mine had one of the elastic bands half ripped already. I just had my elderly mom sew that back up. (she like that kind of stuff).

So today I called Revere to verify this info, and they said that the Copper Ellipse pans are only to be used in an oven up to 350F.I purchased this set because I wanted a 10-inch pan that would go into the oven, specifically for a tart tatin recipe that goes to 425F.I am upset at the time this has taken to receive the WRONG product."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS COOKWARE CAN MELT!!!!","review":"There should be a warning about the bottoms melting!Just be aware that the bottoms are encapsulated copper.

I don't know how much truth she re-wrote, censored, rose-colored, or left out altogether but but I didn't really care this is a hell of a good read.

As I began to do the exercises within the Abundance Course I began to experience how I have held abundance away from me in my life, and how I can change it. This book isn't for you if you think you can just read it through like a novel and have something happen. It is a sit down, read it, feel it and experience book. More than a book, it is a course.

This book is repetitive and confusing. For example: You can have anything you want as long as you don't want it. WHAT? Then later: The worst thing to do is to suppress a desire. Wait a minute--aren't desires and wants the same thing? First you're to let go of wants, then the worst thing you can do is suppress them. Early in the book the reader is told you're not supposed to want control, but in a later chapter the reader is told that if you take responsibility you will have control. Okay, so there is a difference, but it is so slight, so subtle, it only adds to the confusion.The quotes at chapter headings attributed to Lester Levenson are succinct and clear.

Writer, Music, Rhymes and Reasons, and Fantasy are all excellent, underappreciated albums that you should check out before this one.

Obviously due to the stellar line-up the improvisation would be good and it certainly exceeds this expectation. But this album goes further. It has the best sound of any live recording I have heard. Hancock's piano can be heard swirling away over every subtle nuance of William's ferocius drumming. Carter's bass is heard amazingly well. I amagine he would have been using a fingerboard pickup aswell as the bridge pickup to get the sound of his bass' deep rumblings. Being a bassplayer myself i am pleased with this outcome. As always the horns of Hubbard and Shorter ring out loud and clear.Overall I recommend that you purchase this album whether you be a fan of Hard Bop, Be Bop, Free Bop or even perhaps Fusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"great swing","review":"The swing is durable and fun for small childern, especially twins.

And the lack of leg room is really a turn off - I think it should have leg openings, rather than a seat.

Finally, for Java programmers who are a bit frustrated with the quirks of that language, C# is a Java clone that is easy to learn, that has most of the power that Java left out, and that has a really spectacular IDE.

For example, there is an advise in the book \\"to follow the slalom of direct line of pylons with constant throttle application\\". This is quite inefficient. What is much better upon my opinion is to release the throttle (or even press brake lightly for slow turns) on straight to transfer ahead the weight of the car, wait until the front suspension gets loaded, rotate the steering wheel to make the car enter the turn, and then apply throttle while you are unwinding the steering wheel exiting the corner. Any beginner who takes autocross courses, two hours daily, will be able to effectively apply this \\"brake-steer-throttle\\" technique on 5th or 10th lesson.What I recommend is \\"Secrets of Solo Racing: Expert Techniques for Autocross and Time Trials\\" by Henry Watts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but probably dated","review":"If you are looking for a very general idea of what these markets are like with nice pictures, then this is a good book.

I'm sure that there are similar vendors to those described in each market, but unlikely to be the same ones listed in here.

When Bobby arrives on Veelox, Aja told him it was under control and that he should leave. It's a good thing he was sceptic about the territory. Aja's Reality Bug could really have done a lot more damage if she didn't have help. Too bad that Saint Dane had a counter for every attack Aja had. The ending has left me in much suspense. ALL the rules have changed. It's a good thing Mark and Courtney can help a little more, now that they are Acolyte's.The whole book is suspenseful and the end leaves you hanging for the next one.

You'll just have to go and read it for yourself but be warned. It's not what you think it is.You find out really interesting things when you read this book. You also watch Bobby mature into a young man. He becomes solemn, tired, and worn out. This battle isn't about a little kid being a hero anymore. It's a real fight between good and evil and there's a chance that evil will win out in the end.Definitely one of the best, but also a very sad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great purchase.","review":"As an aficionado of Ace Reid cartoons for many years, I knew very well what I was getting and I was certainly not disappointed with the book.

That wanting has its roots in wanting to feel safe/secure, wanting control or wanting approval. It is only when you get rid of the wanting, that nagging, gnawing feeling inside that you can allow yourself to have whatever it is you want.Lester has discovered the shortcut to eliminate that feeling of lack to allow you to open up and receive what it is you desire. There is nothing wrong with having to have approval, control, or security, but it is the mere WANTING of these things that creates the attachments and aversions you have to whatever you are wanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Attachments, No Aversions: The Autobiography of a Master","review":"NO ATTACHMENTS, NO AVERSIONS, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A MASTER is an inspiring look at what it is like for someone to truly let go of the grip of the ego and move into a place of peace, intunement and utter unconcern.

My daughter could set it up herself by the end of the first month. She loved sleeping in it! She is tall for her age, but fit just fine in it. She used a pillow and a sleeping bag for most of the summer and it worked well.I think our only negative reaction was that after 90 straight nights, it began to squeak a little bit when she moved.

It is real easy to take out of its bag and set up..maybe 2 minutes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the bar in the middle is really hard and seems uncomfortable.

He's four now, but was a 25 lb three year old when we got it. So long as he was short enough to sleep with his trunk on the upper half of the mattress, it was okay, but now that he's long enough to need to stretch out, it's a total waste. It sucks.

The bed set-up quickly, however there is a thick band in the center similiar to the support bar on pull-out couch bed. My daugher was very uncomfortable and said that it hurt her belly and back. She ended up sleeping with us. It is a good concept by the design for comfort is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but...","review":"The cot is great in size, but not very sturdy. The construction of the cot is not very strong to support the weight limit referenced in its description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regalo Cot","review":"I was very disappointed with the bed. We ordered the bed for a vacation and unfortunately did not open the package until we arrived at our destination. The bed was broken so we had no bed the first night for my son to sleep in. Not sure if the bed was damaged in shipping or if it was manufactured incorrectly either way we were disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional, but uncomforatable...","review":"The cot serves its function (allowing my 4-yr-old daughter a place to bunk out in mom and dad's room if she gets scared), but it is not comfortable. She's a tiny little thing (so it's not a weight/size issue) and she told me after about 20 minutes in it on the first night that her hips hurt her. There's a strap that goes through the center that allows both ends to slightly sag while keeping the center tight. We put two bed pillows on top of the cot to smooth it out for her and it has been working out ok. Disappointed though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"There is a strap kind of thing right in the middle of the cot that is higher than either end. It's very uncomfortable for my toddler. We returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, uncomfortable design!","review":"This cot has a raised, 3-inch-wide support band that runs across the center width of the cot, right where the child's waist goes. Then the material drops lower above and below that band, so the child's upper body and lower body are literally 3 inches lower than the waist. It was so uncomfortable for our daughter that we bought an inflatable bed for her future travels after our first and only trip with the cot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"While my daughter sometimes likes to play with this by climbing all over it, the bar in the bed makes it way too uncomfortable to really use to sleep on.

I wish we had returned this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"I am so glad I got rid of the pack and play and purchased this for our 2-year old. It is lightweight and easy to transport. We use it whenever we travel and our little guy sleeps great in it. I am contemplating one for our 4-year old too. I think he would use it for a few years which would make it well worth the $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sending it back.","review":"The cot is a great size for a toddler except it has a cross-strap dead center of the cot and the strap is higher than the rest of the cot.

Maybe if someone was heavy enough it would stretch, but my son is as tall as the cot is and he didn't weigh enough to sleep flat. We ended up using a blow up bed for sleep and will be returning them. The picture of the 2 kids sitting at the beach is probably more what is intended for this product. Sitting, not really sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Our 2 Year-Old Grandson","review":"This is great for little ones.

Not worth your money, skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Bed","review":"My 2yr old grandson visited us during Christmas. He is really too long to sleep in a pack & play and I don't have room for a baby bed. Found this product on the Internet and research it through Amazon. I really wasn't sure if he was ready to sleep in something that didn't have sides. After putting it together, we decided to try him out. My grandson loved it & slept in it every night he was here! He never tried to get up and slept straight through the night. Low to the ground so we were not too worried about injuries if he fell off! Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeps well","review":"I am very satisfied with this cot for my 2 sons my youngest is 19mons about 24lbs and my oldest son 8yrs old about 53lbs can sleep well in it not together but they have sat on it together and no problems It folds up very easy and I am able to carry it where ever I need to go. The only thing is I needed it to be more softer but once you add a lite child comforter to it.It works fine for cushion. I am very happy I brought this product :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"met all our needs","review":"Just purchased 2 of these for our 3 year twins for our summer vacation... They are to big for the pack N plays and we would not have had a bed to put them in, so we decided to try these. The price was perfect especially since we needed 2. I believe these are new ones that have been updated b/c We did not have any type of strap going across the middle that everyone was complaining about. They were perfect! Very sturdy. We did pad them with some padding under them and used our old crib pad and sheets that fit them great.. Without the extra padding we used, I don't think it would have been comfortable to sleep on at all. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was I wish it was a tad bit longer, b/c once you add a pillow it takes up some room especially if you have taller kids. Our boys slept on them for 10nights with NO ISSUES they loved them and so did we.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy! grandchildren love sleeping in them","review":"I bought the cots for my two grandchildren, 3 and 4 years old. I had read the reviews and was a bit concerned regarding the 'hard ridge' that people mentioned. But I have to say, both my grandchildren love sleeping in them! They sleep well and do not seem to be bothered by any 'hard ridge'. I bought sleeping bags for the added fun, not because I felt it would make the bed softer. They are taking their naps on them even as I type this! I am very pleased with the cots and they are SO easy to store, which is big plus!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable for 2 year old","review":"We took this cot on vacation with us, and my 2 year old slept on it fitfully each night for a week. I don't think he was comfortable - I know I wouldn't be with a big strap/lump running right through the middle of the cot. He didn't sleep, so nobody slept. It made for a very difficult vacation. I may use it for sitting on the sidelines at games, like the pictures suggest, but we won't be using it for sleep again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service reps for this company are rude!","review":"A friend of mine ordered this cot for her 3-year old and seeing how well it worked out for the little one, I decided to get a portable cot for my 1-year old, solely for sleepover purposes. Well, I never received my product, although I do not hold the company totally accountable as the error was due to the incompetence of UPS. However, I contacted this company twice; the first time to get delivery information and the rep never called me back and the second time, the representative was just plain rude. I believe the product is good, but this seller should remind their representatives about the importance of good customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requested as B-day gift","review":"Portable and met request as gift. Useful for travel. Would recommend and does not require a great deal of packing space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support strap down middle is uncomfortable!","review":"I was optimistic when I opened this cot, as we had borrowed another kid cot in the past. Unfortunately the support strap that ran perpindicular across the center of the cot makes it unusable. The cot sags on either side of the strap and it is just sitting there all stiff in the middle. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable bar across center","review":"Was so excited to find this because I needed a travel bed for a boy that had outgrown his pack-n-play. Unfortunately I had to return it because there is a very firm divider bar across the center of the cot. Makes it impossible to sleep on your stomach (like my son) and uncomfortable to sleep on your back. It divides the cot into two seat areas. Would be nice to take as a portable couch type seat for two kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"MyCot Review","review":"This cot is tighter in the middle than on either end; it should have the same tautness from end to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"great size but it doesn't lay totally flat like the picture. the middle of the cot sticks up and there is a hump in the middle of the cot. the legs don't \\"lock\\" into place to keep the cot a flat. we have to put blankets on both sides to \\"build\\" up a flat surface then put a sheet over them for our grandson to lay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This didn't even last a 2 weeks before one of the bars bent.

We gave it the dogs, as least they are enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cot is DANGEROUS!","review":"I picked this up today and it is already on it's way back. Worse than the raised \\"bar\\" in the middle is the fact that the cross bars all the way around the darn thing are a serious finger pinching hazard. I cannot believe the pain I experienced when MY finger got caught....and it would have BROKEN a small child's fingers for sure. I shuddered when my one year old crawled up on the cot & reached over the edge.

Unfortunately, it has a strap right in the middle of the cot so that our toddler's torso is up high while his head and feet are much lower.

This one is WAY smaller than it says. My 2 year old could not comfortably fit- and my 3 year old's feet were hanging off the end. The child in the picture must be scrunched up into a tiny ball under that picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bisecting strap","review":"I wish I had read the detailed reviews before purchase - I bought this as a travel bed for my nearly-18-month daughter. She adored it as a place to sit, but lying down on it was impossible because the strap that runs through the middle doesn't yield at all (leaving her with something digging into and raising her middle). We tried to open it out as much as possible, thinking extra tension on the rest of the cot would help, but it didn't. It would definitely require something like two pillows or a thick pad of some kind, which renders it useless to me because I would primarily be using it for the times when I travel alone with her and need to pack as lightly as I can manage. I am in the process of returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not verry comfortable","review":"Bought this for the 2 yearold to sleep on when we went on vacation, Its handy that it folds up but the kid just slid around on it and fell off and there is no way this thing is comfy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible to sleep on!","review":"I got this for my 4 year old to sleep on when we traveled. I was excited and read all the reviews. But, I don't know why everyone is so excited about it! There may not be a bar in the middle, but there is still a band of fabric that goes across the middle which does not give with the rest of the bed; so the head and the end of the bed are lower than the middle. Very uncomfortable to sleep on. Although, my children had fun climbing and sitting on it. No good as a bed, great beach couch! I am returning it, and buying a blow up bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD, DON'T BUY THIS COT","review":"I cannot believe that this cot has not been taken off the market. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, there is a strap that runs across the middle of the cot and essentially makes sleeping on it like sleeping on a bed with a couple of 2x4s running straight across your back. No parent who loved their child would make their child sleep in this most horribly uncomfortable item. I know, you'll be tempted to ignore this based on the good reviews. Buy at your own peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I purchased this item for my 4 1/2 years old daughter. She really likes sleeping on it when necessary. It is sturdy and compact. My only problem is it is hard on the back. So if you plan on having your child sleep on it from time to time make sure to cushion it with a thick blanket or pillows. Other than that minor issue, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good!!!!","review":"This cot is no good!!!! My poor child, said that she hated it. The cot has a bar in the middle and that is all she can feel. I even put extra padding in that area and it did nothing for it.

What a waste of money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childs sleeping cot","review":"Loved it till my son laid on it and the huge bar in the middle was very uncomfortable. None of the reviews I read before purchasing mentioned it. It's a very nifty cot, but if my son can't sleep on it without back pain the next morning then what's the point. I guess for only $29.99 I figured something had to be off since most cots started around $70.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel cot!","review":"My son is in a crib but too big for a pack n play so we had no idea what to put him in for our vacation. He sleeps on a cot for naps at daycare so I thought we would try this out. He slept great on it for four nights. We did add some blankets under his sheets to make it a little more comfortable for him but he had no trouble falling or staying asleep on this travel bed. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 year old loves it and is serves its purpose well","review":"My sister found this and we are sharing. My toddler sleeps in it every Mon. through Fri while my sister babysits at her home. She said if I pay half, I can take it on our weekend trips... Can't pass it up. My little one loves it, and climbs right up without any trouble. It does make it difficult, because she is not confined, but during the day my sister is awake, and when we use it on the weekends, we will be in a hotel so she can't get two far if she wakes up in the middle of the night. She still is in a crib so I think is she got up she would call for us first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not luxurious, but my daughter loves it.","review":"I ordered this for my 3-year-old to use as she's recently outgrown her portable crib. She really loves it and I love how portable it is. I can see this item being used at picnics, the beach as well as overnight stays. What a great idea and amazing how small it is when folded up and stowed!I wouldn't use this for more than a few nights. It's not plush in anyway. It would be great to use with a sleeping bag or with a quilt under it. Check the weight limit as well to make sure that it's going to work for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regalo Cot, worth it's weight in gold!","review":"I am a Grandma with small grandchildren that like to stay at my house. I do not know what I would do with this little cot.My granddaughter just spent the night and I found out something about this cot I did not know- it is water resistant! She had an \\"accident\\" and it did not leak through to the rug below! The kids love to sleep on this, it is light enough I can carry it around, it keeps them out of my bed so we both sleep better, and it folds up to store in a closet when I don't need it.I do not let them \\"play\\" on the cot, it is only for sleeping. I have had mine for two years and it is just like new. It has a cover sheet that is washable. It is the perfect place for the little ones to sleep on at Grandma's house. You can not beat the price. The cot costs less than having the bedding dry cleaned! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"I searched a while for a cot to use when my 2 1/2 year old daughter goes to the babysitter, we stay in hotels, and we visit grandma. I bought this at a Target store. I was leary after reading some of the reviews saying pieces broke off and it was not sturdy, however, we have had no problems at all. It's VERY easy to set up and pack away again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not be used for sleeping","review":"I do not know how people are giving this good review. This thing can not be used as a bed at all. It has a one inch strip of enforcing cloth running across splitting the bed into two chairs. So if a kid, no matter how small he is, tries to sleep, he would be pushed up in the middle. This could be best used as two backless chairs at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for extremely \\"occassional\\" use....","review":"We bought this cot for a short trip to the beach to use in place of a pack n' play for our 2 yo. The manual showed two \\"anchor\\" pieces that were not included in the box...The cot does not stay \\"tight\\" for sleeping, and there's a bump on either side because of this. I was concerned that it would keep my son from sleeping soundly and comfortably. I emailed the company to ask for those parts that were missing. I was informed that the pieces are discontinued from the design for over a year now and shouldn't be needed for use. The manual obviously needs to be updated!Anyway, we will use this for very very occasional use since it isn't the sturdiest thing and isn't very comfortable for sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too small for 5 year old","review":"I bought 2 of these cots, one for my 3 year old and one for my five year old! My 3 year old fits perfectly in the cot...However, it is just too small for my 5 year old. It says its holds up to 75 pounds, but that's when using for two kids for seating! I don't remember reading that it was for ages 3-5, but thats the first thing the owners manual states! If I had known that, I would have only ordered 1!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed","review":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. Stay far, far away. Amazon should be ashamed for even offering such a useless item.

When we got it, our three-year-old daughter laid down on it and immediately did not like it! Looking closer at the cot we realized there is a strap which runs from side to side right in the middle of the cot... very uncomfortable! Additionally there are two 'X' criss-cross marks on both the upper and lower sections too.In short, this may be a useful cot for playing but for sleeping I'd look elsewhere. We returned the item to Amazon and as usual the no hassle return policy is the reason we feel trying products is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable BUT portable","review":"We were able to fit this inside a carseat bag (WITH the carseat) when flying to the beach. It is very portable and not heavy. BUT, it's horribly constructed. There is one strap that goes underneath the cot that serves as the brace in the middle to keep the pad up. All it does it create two holes on the top and bottom side, and cuts into the waist of your child. I tried evening it out by piling blankets on top, but it still doesn't work. I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for the kids","review":"This is a great item but the bag that it comes with has no handle to carry and the plastic piece to pull the cord broke in half the first time using.

Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"I love the idea of these but they keep falling apart.

Instead she sits on it to watch tv... Go figure. Toddler won't stay in her bed all night long and must come get us to put her back to bed. We thought if we set this beside our bed she would get in it and fall asleep beside us, not the case.Product is good quality for what it is. Will use it for kud while traveling instead of pak n play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"Bought this bed for a 3 year old to sleep on while she visits with her family. On the first night she could not sleep on it because it was so uncomfortable. She was more comfortable sleeping on a blanket laid out on the floor! The bed has a support seam that runs from side to side half way down the bed that makes it uncomfortable and unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost awesome.","review":"The cot is easy to use and stores very easily. The big problem is the main support strap is right in the middle and it sticks into my daughters back so she cannot get comfortable. This makes the cot almost unusable. Just like the picture shown above, my daughter would curl up in a ball on one end of the cot. Once she gets just a little bigger, we'll have to use something else to travel with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cot and great price!","review":"For $20 I thought it was worth trying out this cot. I needed a bed for my 27 month old to nap on at my office. It definitely sets up and folds down easy and is easy for her to get on and off. I just folded it out and put a folded quilt on top for some extra cushion and a regular crib size sheet over that. She naps on it 3 days a week and seems to sleep on it great. It will also be nice to take with us when we travel as it folds up so small and is lightweight too. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product.","review":"If you have ever used a bag chair then you can set up this bed. Literally pull the cot from the bag and open, place a sheet on it and you are good. We used to tote around a pack and play until our son moved up to a toddler bed, and we were worried about a traveling bed for him. After our first trip using this we are considering getting another to leave at Gramma's house. This product is light, compact, easy to use, and best of all cheap compared to the inflatable beds we have seen. If your child uses a cot for nap at school then they should have no trouble with this.

It does not! The center pulls up so it is extremely uncomfortable and wavy. I purchased for a day bed for children, and have to put layers of sleeping bags on top to make it suitable to take a nap on. Very disappointed. They really need to invent a small tramp just like this...that seems to be the only thing the children want to do with it.... as it is...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of works","review":"I bought three of these cots for my grandchildren. I intended to use them for the under 4 yr. olds. They did work, but please note that the weight of an average 3 yr. old causes the sling-type sleeping area to almost hit the ground. One of the leg frames broke, and for the most part the kids only found them comfortable when padded with a thick comforter. Also, sleeping on this for more then a few days was not as comfortable as one would want it to be. All in all not the best purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up, but has some drawbacks","review":"This cot is super easy to set up, but it has a ridge that runs across the sleeping surface between the two center supports. It is an area of reinforced fabric that gets pulled tight when the cot is set up, but it was a little annoying. We ended up placing several layers of blankets across it to help even out the bump. It has a metal frame and a removable cover that can be washed. It folds up nicely and easily. It is quite small so it wouldn't fit a child larger than an average four year old comfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this for my grand daughter for sleeping when she came to visit.

I loved the thought it could be used for both her and my son later on, but once I got it, there was belt that ran right in the center of the bed. I had to use a few blankets and to pad it up so it would be comfortable to sleep on. After the second day, my neice was asking her cousin if she could sleep in bed with her. I can't tell if it was because it was uncomfortable or if she just wanted to be with her cousin. I will be returning it. I will keep on looking for a better cot for my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for sleeping!!!","review":"This cot arrived after a lot of expectations.. The moment I unfolded it, the middle portion of the cot caught my attention. It had a bump in the middle and would definitely be very uncomfortable for a child to sleep in it. I tried to put a cushion on one end and made my son lay down on it as a trial, but still he was uncomfortable in the middle raised area. Not good!! Definitely not for sleeping!!! But it was great for my son to sit on it!! Im sure it would be great to use on the beach or park for kids to sit on it, but not for sleeping. I returned it!! My main objective of buying it was to use it as a travel cot which will never happen.. Dont give your child a backache by making him/her sleep in it. If the manufacturer would fix this problem, I will surely buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"It is lightweight and compact. However, there is one primary center support that runs the width. It is very taught and tighter than the areas at either end. As a result, it creates a bar that the child's back wraps over leaving their head and butt in the saggy parts at either end. I am so surprised that parents rated this so highly. Would you really be comfortable in something that does not offer consistent support the entire length of the cot? I saw one review where there used to be a bard in the same center location that was replaced... but the replacement doesn't address the bend in the cot part. I am returning it and made the decision within a few minutes of opening the product. Too bad as it would have been perfect as the better cots are 3x the cost. Guess it doesn't pay to cut corners. I am going to try the Go-Kot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good portable cot","review":"We got this before a trip for our 1 1/2 yr. old. At home he sleeps in a crib, but I didn't want to transport a Pack-N-Play across country. So we got this, it worked great. It is easy to setup and the storage bag makes it easy to transport.

Then I opened the second one and setup it up (Very easy) as he laid on it the middle piece broke (Same exact area on the first one I opened) he slammed his shoulder on the cross bar and was in pan for a few seconds. I sent these back - maybe they had a bad batch of them. The reviews were great. Sorry guys not a gambling man.

It's a great concept, very easy to transport, folds very small, and he loves it. But, after sleeping on it twice, he complained (the 3rd time) that it hurts his back (he weighed 31 lbs. at the time), and the cot had sunk a bit in the middle so that his back was right on the middle support bar. Like other posters here have written, the middle is up higher than the head and foot area, so it's very uncomfortable and digs into his back. We've done like the others have mentioned. . . put pillows and/or rolled up comforter underneath the entire cot (and over the brace) to make it all an even surface to sleep on, but it's a lot of trouble. We're going to sell it and buy a different cot. The design of this one needs to be reworked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"We ordered 2 of these for an upcoming camping trip. The first of the cots arrived broken. Both fasteners for the middle supports were cracked off.

Each song is unique and has an insightful, provocative, and inspiring quality about them. Their sense of humor is quite prevelant in even the titles alone. I mean, really, who would write a song about a Head Cheese Log? The melodies are catchy and you will find yourself humming the tunes on the bus on your way to work.

Gundula Janowitz takes that honor. Although she's not as technically proficient as Te Kanawa, her singing of Four Last Songs with Karajan's orchestra is the high mark for this work. Janowitz is not a showy singer, which means that Americans need to slow down to hear her sublime voice. Te Kanawa's interpretation also suffers from a tempo that is just a tad too fast--which makes her sound a bit hysterical in some of the ascending passages. But this is a four-star recording, in part because Te Kanawa's singing of Strauss' other orchestral songs included on this disc is swoon-inducing. I especially recommend her \\"Befreit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"Magnificent recording by premier soprano.

When I lost her last Starmark collar, she started pulling hard, disobeying commands, and stopping whenever she wanted to smell something. Now that she has a new collar, our walks are much more orderly, and a short tug reminds her to heel. The collar doesn't hurt at all - if you put it around your arm and tug you can feel the pull, but it doesn't cause pain. This collar is especially useful for my kids, who otherwise have a hard time walking the dog. The only downside is that it can be hard to put on and take off, especially when it's new, since the links are very tight. Once it's on, it doesn't come off though. Overall, I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best on the market for your dog","review":"I have this collar for my Yorkie which worked ok.

The first time i put this collar on him was the 1st time he walked without pulling. After that day though he got used to it and started to pull but the collar never hurt him. One day i took him out with out the collar and my back was killing me from all the pulling.So to conclude, my dog still pulls with the collar but nothing compared to without the collar.

I noticed an improvement immediately. Please note I have two German Shepherds that are leash trained prior to using this collar. I purchased this because I have two large dogs and walking them when they are excited is difficult, normally after 15 min match of tug of war they would be good dogs. This collar I hoped will help me to train and control them more easily and it did. The largest collar is a bit snug I am pulling it over the head and not using the snap, so I have ordered the extension links for more room. I am nervous about the plastic links breaking if one of my dogs really wanted to pull away so I clip the leash to the training and their normal collar too for extra security.I like the design of this collar better than the metal prongs.

He would pull, jump, lay on the ground, etc. and drive us crazy.The collar does not appear to hurt him, but it does get his attention. Now we can walk our pup and truly enjoy this outdoor time with him!This collar is similar to the Don Sullivan dog training collar. I would say that the design of Don's collar may be slightly better because it looks like it would be easier to put on your dog. That would be my biggest complaint about the StarMark collar...you have to twist the plastic collar sections to remove it, and snap the pieces back together to put it on (which is not always easy).

Her trainer brought this over on her first lesson and said it is the only one he uses to train all kinds of dogs. He trains sentry dogs, therapy dogs and trains for the military personal for dog handlers. This collar has hands down worked wonders. A firm but loving hand must be used when training certain dogs and this was an ESSENTIAL tool. My puppy is just about a year now and has her Canine Good Citizen certificate and I owe a lot to this collar.

That means I have to constantly adjust it since it keeps sliding down.

It works well, getting the dog's attention back, and isn't harsh, but the thing is FRAGILE. It made it about a week before one of the plastic links simply snapped, and I was left holding a leash with no dog attached.I subsequently purchased and highly recommend theHerm Sprenger Prong Collar 22 inch XHeavyweight. This item is more expensive (not by much, once you purchase the extra links necessary for the StarMark, which the Herm Sprenger doesn't need), but it works just as well - and it WON'T BREAK.

She still pulls but I have much more control and she has gotten better walking and running on the leash.

Well my 4 month old didn't even notice it was on didn't listen at all didn't slow her down from pulling, so I put the metal one on her she started to pull and then quickly noticed it was on and stopped.

My dog has alot of fur around his neck so it doesnt work so great. Its USELESS as far as trying to keep my dog from jumping up on people, or stopping him from pulling. He still pulls, not always as bad but it doesnt stop him when he has his mind set on something. As far as putting it on him-- RRIIIGHHT---- What a joke! If you can manage to Not get your dog to move for 2 minutes, maybe, but good luck with that! Its a pain in the### to get on him. I honestly stopped using it because its so frustrating trying to get it on his neck. You cant just slide it on or off your dog, you have to mess with it and twist and turn it until it snaps on or off. I could see it working if you have a tiny dog, but on anything bigger-- good luck! I wouldnt reccomend this product to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good training collar","review":"I bought 2 of these collars for our young, unruly Golden-Doodles.

While walking, the prongs tend to slide to the underside of her neck instead of staying on the top.

Consequently, her pulling is somewhat lessened, but not completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"This book is a nice start, when working with low-functioning children with autism.

Gorgeous playing throughout this wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated, but excellent","review":"A friend of mine from back home sent me this album for the purpose of showcasing what he believes is musical brilliance, and generally an underrated artist.Upon leaving the Stones (for a myriad of reasons, none of which are particularly important), it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that Mick had some blues of his own, some great songs of his own to simply kick out (as well as kick back). So he played the crap out of it, and what we're left with is a great Stones album without the Stones.\\"Leather Jacket\\", \\"Baby, I Want You\\", and \\"Broken Hands\\" are killer tunes just WAITING to be given the Stones treatment, and if Mick's musicianship lacks a peer, his lyrics and vocal delivery are found wanting. He's a capable enough singer, but the abundance of instrumentals backs me up on this fact.The production of the album dates it a little, but since the songs are so good, you can't let that ruin your appreciation of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Mick","review":"I bought this CD because I love Mick Taylor's work with the Rolling Stones and John Mayall. What I discovered is that it's Mick Taylor's playing of blues and rock that I love, not his playing in general. This CD is his playing in general. Almost no rock, no stinging searing lead guitar runs. There is some blues, but it's not his best. Not as good as when he played with Mayall or Albert Lee or other sessions he sat in on. To me, these songs are elevator music. There's nothing biting about them. I don't know how to categorize them except to say their NOT rock, NOT blues, NOT examples of his brilliant lyrical guitar runs. I listened to the album twice and threw it away the same day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see this again","review":"This album was a treat back when it came out. Glad to see it available again on CD. Single remix of Leather Jacket is fun and interesting, but the original still trumps. Only recommendation to Mick and his publicist is to ditch the hyperbolic liner notes accompanying this release. They, or more likely the record company, evidently recruited some adolescent Demosthenes wanna be, raised on Rolling Stone Magazine and Skittles to research Mick's history and craft painfully over the top tripe that only cheapens the real deal. Great tunes and fine playing.Mick, how 'bout something new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"The songs are forgettable. Is this guy a good guitar player? I'm not impressed.

Even now, after four or five readings with my daughter, I stumble over some words because the text font is almost illegible in places. Added to that problem is the overall dark and gritty background throughout the story that washes out the similarly dark text. They really should have thought about function before form on this book. The graphics are wild and different but be prepared for your child to ask what things are the first few times through. For example, the main character (a little boy) is scarcely discernible as being humanoid. This will require frequent explanations until the child knows from memory what these abstract drawings are.

Too many of the selections are actually very poor, I believe being selected only because they mention the oceans, not for their inspiration, beauty, or literate value.

Each song and video is based on a different story/person from the Bible, for example Daniel or Esther. The music is pretty good from artists such as Chris Tomlin and Mandisa, however the videos are random and some dull. Some of the videos are short clips from movies (the Story of Jesus) while others are in the style of silent films with grainy, black & white film. Others are nature shots with lyrics. There is no continuity from one video to the next. So that being said, that's what it is. In this DVD there is also a promo / trailer for the docu-drama, \\"The Story of Jesus\\", which is narrated by Joel Osteen... I personally wasn't moved by this random assortment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story","review":"Unbelievably inspirational. The music is so powerful in lyric and melody.

In fact, it hardly feels like a romance novel at all. The first few descriptions of food in the middle ages were interesting, but got very old after the first 50 pages. The hero wears a steel nose band the entire book and is often described in a manner that reminds me of a sniffing-dog. Not much romance or sparkling and witty dialog here.

I wouldn't even rate it one star. I really use to enjoy Betina Krahn's books, but her series of the Husband Test, the Wife Test and now this latest bomb are good only to put you to sleep. The characters are wooden and never fleshed out, the male character whines throughout the whole book. They barely kiss but all of a sudden are in love. There is no chemistry in any of these books. Either the author is writing a love story in an historical period or the author is writing a historical account and just throwing 2 people in it. There is no heat, no interest, no nothing. What happens with these authors? They get famous and then start charging a ton of money for books that are good for 12 year olds.

She trains with a kung fu teacher learning the 8 strikes of the wildcat and then takes revenge at the end of the movie.This is as ordinary as kung fu movies get. The girl is not a bad fighter, and they use a ton of stunt doubling. The rodent styles are nothing special, not even funny. The kung fu fighting itself is pretty good. There are plenty of fights and training scenes so if you really like kung fu movies where the woman is the hero you may want to check this out.2.5/5The Videoasia DVD is widescreen and the picture quality is decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Better Way To Get Started!!!","review":"This book is very insightfull, entertaining, interesting, a very easy read, and best of all it is based on the Word of God.

Manyof the features of Java and C# were lifted more or less intactlyfrom Modula-3, and the designers of Java have regretted thatthey didn't lift more, as they have had to add generics later.That being said, this is a terrible book.

This entire album is nothing more than boring tripe for the 30 and over non-adventuresome mainstream sheep who think what they listen to is cool and makes them cool. Get a clue people.

I especially love Joy of Life and the excitement it brings when you listen to it. Sharon's violin is mesmerizing throughout the entire CD/concert (minus Would You Be Happier) and Caroline on the drums just kicks a$$ in Ruby Tuesday.

It's fun to compare and contrast the modern version against this Ginger Rogers vehicle. Check out familiar characters (such as the prison matron \\"Mrs.\\" Morton and Mary Sunshine) new characters (the reporter who has a crucial role in the end) and even missing characters (no Velma Kelley.)This 1942 film has the title character as a woman on trial for shooting a man who is strongly implied to be her lover. Unlike the Roxie Hart in Chicago, this Roxie is innocent and only on trial for publicity to bolster her show business career. Rogers is a lot of fun and chews the scenery as the gum snapping Roxie. In retrospect, it seems a natural that this story became a musical. Aside from a brief tap dance sequence, it's too bad Rogers couldn't show off her musical talents here.Make note to watch for the totally different but funny ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Watcher","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie \\"Chicago\\". Roxie Hart is the 1942 version of Chicago. It has a great cast (although the kids of today aren't likely to recognize any of them), and stars Ginger Rogers, and a great director, William Wellman. Roxie Hart was very enjoyable and entertaining. I was NOT disappointed. And it also has English subtitles for the hearing impaired (for which I was very grateful)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the beginner, lacking details for the Administrator","review":"I expected more from this book.

Both are no longer acceptable, but both contain strengths we ought to retain as best we can.

The writing is choppy, and the plot lines are overly complicated.The screen, from what I saw, wasn't very helpful, and the character sheets don't seem any different than what I can get online. This product in no way lives up to the hype.If it is true, and this is being produced by the official fan site...then I can certainly see why the quality has gone downhill.

Disney should go for the full meal deal or not release the dvd at all: this gives the consumer a real price comparable to $67.50 retail where the other two came in at around $40.

With these two choices, I'll take (and did take) too much information any day.

Too many references to histroical developments. Lots of information but well not well developed. In fact that's all this book is, a bunch of disjointed facts. The people who wrote this book spent way too little time developing IDEAS and the MATH that describes them. Instead, they skimmed over TONS of details and spit out formulas in pretty pink boxes. Anyways, the writing is dry, lengthy, and dodges the point. It's like reading an encyclopedia of physics history. Inelegant.

Ian Anderson continues to be the ultimate showman for those that appreciate a performer with a tendency towards clearly intelligent tongue-in-cheek sarcasm. If you're a Jethro Tull fan that loves the Sardonic lyrics of \\"Thick As A Brick\\" as much as the hard driving beat of \\"Locomotive Breath\\" as much as the classical crossover \\"Bouree\\" you won't like this concert ....... you will LOVE it!

Really, there wasn't a better live rock band than the early 70's Jethros.Jump to Montreux 2003 and you have a much kinder and gentler group that spends the first half of the concert on some pretty cheesy Christmas-meets-new-age instrumental meanderings, with a few gems thrown in.The second half sounds a lot more like the Tull we grew up with, unleashing the heavy riffage on songs like Nothing is Easy, My God and Locomotive Breath. Martin Barre is one of rock's greatest unknown guitarists, and his playing here is first rate as always, and Ian still makes the flute sound like it was invented to drive a rock band.Both video and audio quality are superb... too bad DVD technology wasn't around 35 years ago... but this Montreux performance may be the next best thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance dvd","review":"This is Tull's best dvd effort. Superb audio and video, in my opinion. Ian Anderson may be the most under-rated rock icon out there. He is tops in my book (even when he says some off-color things.....which he always does). I'd love to sit in a living room with Ian for a couple of hours and talk. I bet he's got stories and insights that would keep you totally captivated. Also, it was wonderful that Tull included a song from the old \\"Benefit\\" album. \\"Benefit\\" is a great, and yet, over-looked masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tull Video","review":"After a few months anticipation my DVD of Tull: Live at Montreux arrived in my hands....to my suprise i felt a true concert experience right in my living room of Ian Anderson and Company and their par excellence of performing.

The language is incredibly simplistic, the plot devices make no sense and are totally unbelievable in any case. If the rest of the books in this series are of the same caliber, it's a wonder that the author has continued it for as long as he has. In short, this book is awful.

David Arnold had done an incredible job scoring this film and naturally, fans wanted to be able to listen to every piece of music . Although I love the music, in an not in love with the CD. The total score for this film is close to 100 minutes, with 50 of it (not counting the Moby que) on the first CD. What we should have had was a 40 minute second volume instead of a 75 minute volume with only 26 minutes of new music and still having certain pieces of music missing, such as the second part of the pre-title sequence, Bond's briefing in the limo, etc. In spite of 2 volumes of music, fans wanting the definitive score will still need the special edition DVD. I am very glad we have this second volume, but wish we had it all. David Arnold's music deserves all the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomorrow Never Dies, but the other album did","review":"Unlike the OTHER Tomorrow Never Dies soundtrack, this one shines. David Arnold's fast paced and energetic score certainly is better than the GoldenEye disaster by a longshot. The James Bond Theme is used often, but never too much, and there is plenty of non-thematic elements. The love theme between Paris and Bond is a great piece, and the WAH-WAH's that appear in \\"Surrender\\" are a sure Bondlike music piece. Let's hope Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli stick with David Arnold for several films to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond is taken out with the Garbage","review":"Having been a James Bond since Dr. No, I also have enjoyed all the soundtracks up until this one...I literally stinks...BIG TIME!I have tried several times to find ANY redeeming qualities about it, but I am at a total loss.

I live in California and I do understand the real estate prices are much higher on average than most parts of the country. However, he uses an example of an average 3BR, 2BA home selling for between $10,000 and $15,000 and continues to use these numbers throughout his book. Somebody tell me where these homes exist? Downtown Baghdad? He gives an example of how to determine the value of a rental income property. He says to take the monthly rental amount and multiply it by 100 to determine the value of the property. His example was $150 monthly rent x 100 = house value of $15,000. I own a rental that rents for $1500. If I used his example $1500 x 100 = $150,000 right? Wrong!!! This same property will sell today for $375,000, which means a buyer's tenants would have to pay $3,750 per month. Gee, do these numbers ad up? You figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this book but as I worked my way through it I kept finding myself attempting to puzzle out the author's meaning because of typographical errors, poor proofreading and poor editing. Sometimes I literally could not see the connection between what the text was saying the sample output was and the sample output that was printed on the page. I expect a technical book to be technically clear and this one let me down too many times to instill confidence. I also came away with the sinking feeling that it was at heart a grand advertisement for the WISE software; another confidence killer. This is my second Rampant book and I think my last.To be fair, I learned some new things and will undoubtedly improve my skills because of this book, but I would say to the authors and publisher that you made me more mad than you made me smart. You have lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other wise good book spoiled by incorrect scripts","review":"This is a well written and good book targeted for senior DBAs. I gained a very good understanding of the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reading this book. But there is a huge and fundamental flaw in many of the scripts used throughout the book. Let me explain this:Most the tables in the AWR stores cumulative data for various Oracle statistics. If you think about it, it makes sense because Oracle can get the delta between two snapshots by doing subtraction. The scripts in this book does not consider this fact. I fail to understand how the authors can miss this point. Because of this the output of most of the scripts is wrong or meaningless. Of course, it is not a big deal to fix these scripts ourselves. But the fact that the authors missed this fundamental point annoys me and that is the reason for single star rating from me. I will be happy to be corrected if the authors (or some other oracle experts) can explain that scripts are indeed correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"DB Specialist","review":"Very good, enough internal tips, common sense tips etc. I have read those parts that are interesting for me like AWR/ASH and some tuning spots.

Each sentence is a work of art and a pleasure to read. I smile as I read. The stories themselves are so clearly placed in a post-WWI setting that they are a glimpse into life in the 1920's - as, I believe, Fitgerald wanted to show. Also, to me, any Fitgerald work edited or or explained by Matthew Bruccoli is informative & interesting.The above, though, is to those who like Fitzgerald. To me, his is special beyond many other authors' writing. If you've never enjoyed his work before, this book won't change that.

Made a world of difference taking her for walks and getting her attention when she got excited.Unfortunately, it is not that strong and pulled part when she went after a cat. This is the second time it pulled apart. The first time it happened, I thought maybe I didn't click the links together properly. But this time, if you look at the links, you can clearly see the plastic deformed to allow the separation. I am returning to Amazon and recommending that they inform the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great; gentle correction safe for puppy","review":"We used this on our full-of-energy Bernese Mountain Dog puppy (4 months) to train her to walk on a leash without pulling (or stopping). It works great, she's very responsive, and it's very gentle. I put the collar around my bare calf and tugged as hard as I could on the leash, and can personally testify that the discomfort is minor - no piercing of the skin at all. more like a tight grip with fingertips. Highly recommended.[[Update]] - As our puppy grew, the pressure she could put on the links by pulling increased dramatically. Also, the method of opening the collar to let her out, namely disconnecting two adjacent links, started to wear down the plastic nubs holding the links together. Eventually the links started to pop open when she pulled on the collar, which led us to purchase a metal prong collar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry my dog almost got run over because of this","review":"I was really happy with this collar, and would give it four stars. But the design appears flawed. The pieces come apart so you can adjust the size as well as place and remove the collar, perhaps too easily. Maybe it's because they wear out from use, even though I've only had mine for several weeks. On three occasions now, the collar has spontaneously come undone. On one, my puppy ran into the street in front of a car."},{"rating":"2","title":"gentle control","review":"This collar seems to work well without hurting the dog. It is difficult to put on over the ears (which may relate to the following). One reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's just a little too short and I have to order some extra links which, with shipping, will end up costing as much as the collar itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too short but works","review":"We had to buy extra links for our blue heeler which is around 35 pounds.

It's not like the prong collar, it has no bite like the prong collar does. My dog after a while started pulling and did not care or notice the corrections.

It works well just walking with no distractions, I've used it for several weeks, but when a woman came close with her dogs, my dog pulled so hard the collar came apart (where it is supposed to come apart to take it on and off).

Walking them on leashes with a standard collar was a nightmare- pulling and lunging and they were nearly impossible for me to control them separately, much less together. Our trainer recommended this type of collar and I was able to loose-leash walk both of them together with one hand the first trip out with very minor tugs to keep them in check. The collar is tough for me to open and close the recommended way but I'd rather that than too easy. These collars are a must-have for us and our girls are happy they can get out more and explore the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humane training collar","review":"We love this collar. It has been a great tool to minimize pulling from our now 55 lb. puppy! We somehow lost the collar and used a non training collar, and it was awful. We ordered a replacement since this proves it does work. Murphy's law says when it arrives, we will find the other one. This is totally humane, does not hurt, but does get the message across to ease up. The only thing is it is sometimes tricky to get it one and off, but once mastered, it is a good collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design Makes This Collar Impractical","review":"I bought the small version of this collar thinking it was the same as a similar looking Command Collar that I had previously purchased from Don Sullivan for our giant breed dog. The Command Collar by Don Sullivan is an excellent product that I would rate 5 stars. In my opinion, this StarMark collar rates 1 star.I encourage would be buyers to read the other 1 star reviews. This collar is so poorly designed that it is extremely difficult to open and I think borderline impossible to put on a typical dog who will be excited to go for a walk. I struggled to open the collar. I never tried to use it because my dog would not sit still for the length of time that I would have needed to close it properly. I found it completely impractical."},{"rating":"1","title":"star mark collar","review":"not nearly as good as the original \\"good dog\\" collar as seen on t.v. which I own.

Especially since this is a training collar the last thing anyone should struggle with is placing it on the dogs neck. Save your money and buy the one on t.v."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really hard to get off and on","review":"I don't like this collar at all. I didn't look at the picture close enough when I ordered it, so I didn't notice that there's no way to hook it. You have to separate the links every time you put it on or take it off. Since you're not supposed to leave this type of collar on the dog except when you're training, that means every time you use it. It does work well once it's on to keep the dog from pulling. I bought Don Sullivan's dog training kit and needed a 2nd collar for my other dog and thought this was the same as the one that came with the kit, but not having a hook makes a big difference. They should have spent a few more cents and put a hook on it. I would recommend buying Don Sullivan's collar and not bothering with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I purchsed this product to help train my two young dogs. The design of this product requires that you take the collar apart and put it back together again on the the dog. It's virtually impossible to snap the collar back together on a dog that won't sit still and is squirming around.(That's the whole idea is to train them not to move around when not wanted) I thought this was a very poor design as it makes the collar pretty much useless if you can't get it on. It is evidentlly a knockoff of another product from a well known dog trainer, but his collar has clip hooks that allow easy on and off. This could be a very useful product, but you need to put a little more thought and development into how to get it on and off on a dog that won't sit still yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"StarMark traning collar is great!","review":"This was just what was needed to train our puppy how to better walk on a leash!

When I saw it as an adult with my wife and 14 year old cousin, we laughed hysterically throughout the entire episode. No doubt, this is Buck Rogers meets Dracula with Wilma playing the object of desire. You know, the classic Dracula story with a pinch of 70's scenery, corny special effects, a visious looking villain with a bad eyebrow, and a few other things. In my opinion, this was one of their best crafted episodes. I think the writers already had quite a bit of material from a previous well known work. The special effects guys must have had a budget as they did wonderful work. Don't expect Star Wars Episode I as this was 20 years ago and made for TV but that's hardly the point.

Domingo sounds fine, but delivers a rather faceless interpretation (he could be singing Don Jose for all I can tell). Wixell is intelligent, but gritty. Maazel is simply dull.

This new one broke after the third roll and I haven't used it since. Who cares about the warranty? What a waste of money - I certainly don't want to have another one of these. I am now using my old reliable 10-year-old camera and am sucking up the expense. But I also don't have pictures of Tahiti and Egypt. Am I supposed to carry two cameras in case this one doesn't work?

I really wanted to like it.Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. To begin with, the backstory (for those who hadn't read the preceding novel) was wooden and clumsy. I thought, perhaps this was a first novel from a novice who shared a well-known author's name...but no, the back cover made it clear that this was the \\"New York Times bestselling author\\".So, I perservered. But it never improved. If I had to choose one word to describe it, it would be \\"dull\\". I know how well Anne Perry can write, so I have a hard time believing she wrote this.

I'll say that again: YOU CANNOT TURN IT OFF.I've been using this kettle for 6 months, and I mostly didn't mind it. But it was frustrating how I had to physically unplug it sometimes if I wanted it to stop, since its automatic turn-off feature rarely works. (The plug is a tight fit so it is a lot of effort to plug in and out.)Lately it seems like the auto-off switch has been getting worse and worse. Yesterday I walked into the kitchen and noticed it TURNING ITSELF ON AND OFF, even though I hadn't used it recently. Obviously I immediately unplugged it, and noticed that the power cord was physically hot to the touch, as though the insulation on the cord had been heating.Although it does boil water as advertised, it never STOPS boiling, which seems like a ridiculous requirement for the designers to overlook. I regard this product as dangerously un-trustworthy, and will be throwing it away. A simple hard off-switch would be a big help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best by a long shot","review":"Frankly, this is very overated recording, as is the so-called legendary Gulini. Best in my view are a) Josef Krips (Decca) and Mitropoulos (Sony Classics). The latter is live, which this opera can take and in fact it adds to the frisson and excitement particularly in the final act. And the singers. Nobody has yet bettered Grummer, or Della Casa as Donna Anna or Donna Elivira. Hear them and you won't be able to listen to others doing this opera. The sound for a 1956 recording is excellent as is the Krips one which was recorded around 1959. In both recordings Siepi is the Don and his voice is a marvellous mixture of suave, erotic and downright sinister. In short he encompases the whole role.

So I am not some liberal atheist just starting trouble here.I had some doubts about the \\"supernatural\\" aspect of the Bible, and someone suggested I read this book.This book is flawed at best. His reasoning and justifications are so laughable I feel bad for the people who read it and agree with them.Regarding the author himself.....

I imagine it is difficult enough creating a pair of well-drawn, fully realized characters and developing their romance in a satisfying way, but Donna Simpson achieves this with not one, not two, but three couples. Each character is distinct, and each romance is compelling.The main couple -- politician Sir David Chappell & lady's companion Beatrice Copland -- are a refreshingly mature pair in their forties who think that their chance for happiness has passed. The assorted young people include a wild Canadian hoyden, a demure yet determined daughter of an earl, a reckless young lord who hopes to marry an heiress, and a vicar who dares not hope he can marry above his station. They are all brought together for Christmas by an elderly lady with matchmaking schemes, but love finds its own way in the end.One of the best Regencies I've read this year.

However, this cd in no way compares to his early works and as a point of fact, probably is one of the worst bands I have ever heard recorded. The drummer lacks any imagination, doesn't listen, and does not reflect the rest of the band that is playing. The lead guitar work adds nothing and a Blues band without a solid lead guitar has an empty sound.

Our laptops work fine when on campus and at friends' houses, but at home the wireless frequently drops even when in the same room as the router, and every 2-4 days, the wireless will totally cease to work, not allowing any wireless connectivity whatsoever until the router is rebooted.Might have gotten a poor model. Wired connectivity works as expected, so not 1 star.(The wireless just dropped in the time it took me to write this review. \\"Repaired\\" the connection in WinXP in order to post.

The customer service was fairly good and they gave totally different steps for installation. I think they better include those steps as the installation guide.

WEP and 128 bit WPA didn't play nice with my Macbook, and MAC Address filtering didn't work with my HP laptop.And now, a month into its life, past the return period, it cuts out periodically and requires a hard reset to get working again.Trendnet makes good products... like KVM switches.

I found out about Trendnet, it was way cheaper and served my purpose of a normal day-to-day router. It doesn't really have as many functions as a high-end consumer router, but it is well-suited for home usage. If you are running a small business from home, for example, you do not want to get this. My experience with cheap products in the past has almost entirely been bad, but this one has yet to disappoint me. I would predict the longevity of this router to be about a year.

I am often surfing and my laptop will disconnect; when I try to reconnect I am unable to do so. The router has to be restarted and for those of you who have done it you know it is a time-consuming process. The router, cable modem, and both computers have to be restarting. Takes all of 10 minutes.To me it just wasn't worth it. I am using my linksys router again and will probably do so until I NEED to replace it.

I said ok, but no one ever called back.Maybe you'll get one that works, but i think it's a roll of the dice.

The first sentence of page 71 is \\"Today, hundreds of thousands of Muslims residing in Europe embrace, to varying degrees, a militant interpretation of Islam, favoring the introduction of sharia law and despising Western value and principles\\". Vidino provides no source for this statistic when one would assume some sort of public opinion poll or academic study to be necessary for such a statement.

Although it is primarily geared toward the faults of the Catholic church, Mr. Carroll is quick to point out the mistakes on behalf of Protestants, and the Orthodox church, as well. Along with this, he does not fail to mention the fact that many people see Jewish history as one big painful misery, and if looked at this way, the ability it has to cloud your vision of the past.I would recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in religious history (Christian or not), and for those who are looking for a better understanding of current day events. It may be a little heavy at times, but if given the chance, and read with an open mind, it is a very enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the Shoah?","review":"The author, in painstakingly brilliantly researched detail, presented a clear time line of the evolution of hate advertently and inadvertently spawned by the church towards Jews, whose culmination was the Shoah. Changes have taken place and more can be done to reflect what Jesus, whose message was compassion and love, should represent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endgame","review":"As professional reviewers have argued, this is not a work of history. Carroll systematically distorts, suppresses, and makes up evidence to prove his preconceived point: that the Catholic Church is an anti-Semitic institution. He makes this point to discredit the church that excommunicated him and which he now despises.Even more bizarre than the laughable \\"scholarship\\" in his pages is his plea for a new church. This church will not only reject the Catholic church's moral positions. It will reject both the Old and New Testaments as inspired books. It will abandon belief in the divinity of Christ and even in salvation.And this is supposed to be the work of \\"a Catholic who so loves his church,\\" as the book blurb and many amateur reviewers on this site insist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not history","review":"The work is simply not the work of history it purports to be.The author rarely uses primary sources and leans heavily on secondary sources (many of them with a clear anti-Catholic odor.) The constant switch to autobiographical musings does nothing to advance the argument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage Theology","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I thought it would be serious, scholarly study of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Judaism. Instead, it is a ranting, raving, endless criticsm of just about everything the Catholic Church stands for. Invective is not an argument. The cloying autobiographical passages in which the author offers up his strange blend of new Age theology and old-fashioned anti-Catholicism are incredibly sophomoric---and incredibly long-winded.This is a tantrum, not a scholarly history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical","review":"The book is not convincing.No one disputes that some Catholics have engaged in anti-Semitic activities, just as no one disputes that there are Catholics who have lied, stolen, cheated, procured abortions, and committeed armed robbery. How could it be otherwise in such a huge religion?The question is: did these people commit such crimes because of their church's doctrine or in spite of it? Carroll seems incapable of dealing with the issue. To insinuate that somehow this violence was the product of church teaching, he has to do incredible violence to the evidence. He simply ignores many clear papal condemnations of anti-Semitism: the encyclicals of Pius XI, the radio addresses and well-publicized diplomatic protests of Pius XII against anti-Semitic laws, the many statements by medieval and Renaissance categorically condemning the anti-Semitic violence committed by bogus Christians of the period.This is country-club anti-Catholicism disguised as history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This biased history of the Church's attitude toward Judaism is completely unreliable. It is really astonishing how any reader could take this unscholarly piece of anti-Catholicism by an ex-priest seriously.For some excellent reviews of the book, see Eugene Fisher in America and Robert Wilken in Commonweal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudice on parade","review":"This book is not a work of history. It is the painful autobiography of an excommnicated ex-priest on why he hates the Catholic Church.As the end of the book makes perfectly clear, the author hates the Church's teaching on revelation, morality, authority, sexuality---just about everything. It is in light of this ardent hate and resentment that the author risibly distorts the record on the Catholic Church on Judaism. Evidence is exaggerated and suppressed to suit the author's bitter pejudices. Evidence is even concocted, such as the absurd story of John XXIII criticizing Pius XII for his alleged \\"silence.\\" In fact, John XXIII had nothing but praise for Pius XII, who personally approved the future John XXIII's rescue work for Jews in Turkey during World War II.A scholarly embarrassment motivated by raw anti-Catholicism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"This book is an embarrassment. The author clearly hates the Catholic Church's teaching on everything under the sun. The final chapters, with his absurd fantasy of Vatican III, raises all the politically correct issues: contraception, celibacy, etc., etc., etc. This doesn't have a thing to do with the alleged subject of the book. The author then fabricates or distorts evidence to paint as black a picture as possible of the Church's history. This is not history. It's not even decent journalism. The Vatican's statement WE REMEMBER gives a much fairer and more eloquent presentation of this tormented topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of pathos and prejudice","review":"Carroll's book is quite sad. He rummages through Church history, methodically magnifying apparently anti-Semitic statements and then suppressing the many pro-Semitic ones. Once you get to Pius XI, you hear nothing about Mit Brennder Sorge, the pope's detailed denunciation of Nazi anti-Semitism. During WW II, the New York Times carried numerous articles detailing the interventions of Pius XII against anti-Semitic measures in Germany, Rumania, Hungary, Italy, and France. But, of course, Carroll ignores them.For a more objective view of the issue, see the new work by Richard Rychlach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the history?","review":"Constantine's Sword is a disappointing book. I was expecting a sprawling saga of the history of anti-semitism in the Catholic Church, but instead got the author's diary. There a too many personal anecdotal stories in the text. Everytime I was getting interested in what he was saying he told a story either about his Irish Uncle in the British military or his incestuous desires for his mother. Maybe its me but what does the Pieta and lust for your mother have to do with anti-semitism in the church? Plus, he quotes dubious scholars to present his information. John Dominic Crossan? Crossan discounts the resurrection and the person of Jesus in his writings. So what does he have to do with the hatred of the Jews in church history? I wish this were a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"What a tired genre! An ex-priest \\"courageously\\" takes on his former church and (surprise!) finds the church wanting.The tissue of biased citations, omission of counter-evidence, and tendentious interpretation does not give a serious presentation of the complex history of the relationship between Catholics and Jews.For a serious, scholarly study of the recent chapter in this history, read the fine work of Richard Rychlak and Pierre Blet."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing....","review":"I understand and agree that Carroll has concerns with how some members of the Catholic Church has handled Catholic-Jewish relations in past human history. However, it does seem that Carroll goes beyond that and has an ax to grind with the Catholic Church, an institution that he used to be more intimately involved with. The book uses the tragedies of the Jews over the centuries in order to make quite unrelated and entirely internal Christian point that the author thinks the church should be structured differently than it is-i.e. as a democracy-and that its Christology is too high. Whether one agrees with Carroll's theology, however, the point remains that he has absolutely no right to use Jewish suffering over the centuries to push it forward. There is a self-centered character to this book. I first recommend people to read more about the history of the two institutions (Catholicism and Judiasm), and their respective treatments throughout history, before buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre logic","review":"This odd book ends up proving the opposite of what it claims to prove. Despite the suppressed and distorted textual evidence, Carroll ends up proving that the popes opposed all use of violence against Jews and opposed forced conversions. The fact that some Catholics---against the clear teaching of their church---engaged into anti-Semitic violence only shows that this church like any other has its sinners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paging Pius XII","review":"To understand the purpose of the book, you should start with the last chapters. Carroll makes clear what his purpose is: the destruction of the Catholic Church's position on doctrine and ethics. We're beyond the tired debate on birth control and celibacy here. He throws out Christ as redeemer and throws out any idea of divine revelation in Judaism or Christianity.What's left is New Age anti-Catholicism: Cher with footnotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantine Sword","review":"The book is an excellent review of Christian - Jewish relationships in Europe covering two millennium. It's serious material and takes stamina to finish; has extensive references."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Having pioneered the anti-Catholic novel (Prince of Peace) and the anti-Catholic autobiography (An American Requiem), the excommunicated author now provides us with an anti-Catholic documentary.The \\"history\\" here is easy to dismiss. The author simply focuses on the apparently anti-Semitic statements of Catholics over the centuries and discards the many Catholic condemnations of anti-Semitism. The hatchet job on Pius XII and Pius XII, clear and early opponents of Nazi racism, is nothing short of libel.The author's constant interruption of the narrative by his own lachrymose musings on his troubles with the Church and the bizarre conclusion, where he demands that the Catholic Church abandon its most basic beliefs, reveals the bias fueling the entire sad enterprise.Is an anti-Catholic soap opera next?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This is not a serious work of history. The author, a novelist, clearly has a problem with the Catholic Church's teaching on issues of sexuality and authority. He is gripped by an inexplicable hatred of John Paul II, a courageous foe of anti-Semitism. The result is an anti-Catholic fantasy disguised as a history of anti-Semitism.Many reviewers have noted the outrageously unfair use of sources and the obvious suppression of evidence.This serious issue deserves far more than the cavalier, biased rantings of this novelist, who cannot separate history from his own bitter autobiography as an ex-priest.How sad that this work of prejudice could be taken as serious history by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncertain genre","review":"I actually enjoyed reading this book (Carroll's a fine writer), but I gave it a low grade because it's not what it's advertised to be. The entire book is the author's very subjective reflections on his moods, his beliefs, his New Age religious views. This is not a real history of the Church's teachings on the Jews. It is just a novelist musing over everything that comes into his mind.As stream-of-consciousness, it's great fun. But it's not a serious argument..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Jewish","review":"As professional historians (like Robert Wilken) have argued, this sad, angry book is not serious history. Many reviewers have rightly condemned the book for its obvious anti-Catholic bias. But I was surprised and disturbed by the anti-Jewish polemic engaged in by the author. If we take him seriously, we would have to get rid of the idea of God's chosen people, of redemption, of the inspired nature of the Torah. By the end of this overheated book, the author seems to be arguing that Jews, Christians, and Moslems can survive, as long as they give up any claim to exclusive truth. But there is no Judaism, Christianity, and Islam without such claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last.","review":"A long overdue \\"inside\\" look on this subject.

He may try to cover too much but I wonder if the mystery of Christian Anti Semitism could be handled fairly and adequately in a less sweeping approach. His critics' complaints (minor for the most part) can be counter balanced by his courage, writing skill, and personal honesty. He openned new vistas to this 81 year old. The book is long and at times tediously detailed but it is worth it. I recommend it to all who take religion seriously but not literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental journey","review":"I was appalled at this book. I thought it would document the history of Christian anti-Semitism, but most of it is just the author's protracted musings about his own life, his own little disappointments, his pious practices, his own beef with the Catholic Church on sex and authority. He offensively uses the suffering of Jews to bolster his own self-importance and his trendy brief against John Paul II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscholarly,uncatholic","review":"This unscholarly work, written by an angry ex-Catholic, has little to do with Judaism and Christianity. The \\"history\\" here is entirely truncated. Catholics who defended the Jews against persecution are ignored. Catholics who justified anti-Semitism are magnified as the norm. The history is much murkier here than ex-Father Carroll would have it. The greatest dishonesty here lies in the treatment of Pius XI and Pius XII. Pius XI's courageous encyclical against Nazism (in 1937) is ignored, although the pope ordered it to be read from every German pulpit and although it caused an intensified persecution of the Catholic Church by the Nazis (destruction of Catholic schools, show trials against clergy). The many efforts of Pius XII to save Jewish lives are dismissed. This anti-Catholic screed will win praise from the culture despisers of Catholicism. The lavish treatment of the book in the New York Times is all too predictable. But it has nothing to do with history or scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"In vain","review":"I do not recommend the book because it's not what it says it is: a history of the Church and the Jews.The book is really two books. The first is Carroll's interminable autobiography: why he hates his father, the church, etc. The second is his dream of a church that will replace the Catholic Church, which he now despises. His church's purpose seems to be the celebration of \\"the sanctity of democracy.\\" No moral rules, no hierarchy, no revelation, no redemption. Just Unitarianism Lite.The pseudo-history is concocted to suit his bitterness and his little theological dream. How could any reader take this bizarre history seriously? But clearly thousands havve. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"This alleged work of history rests on a series of distortions clearly fueled by anti-Catholic prejudice.A glaring example is the author's use of an alleged quote by John XXIII. According to the author, John XXIII said in response to criticism of Pius XII's alleged \\"silence\\" during World War II: \\"What can you say about the truth?\\"In fact, John XXIII never said such a thing and the author clearly knows it. In an earlier work Carroll cites this fictional quote as a fabrication. As Carrol knows (but nowhere tells the reader), John XXIII repeatedly said that his own actions in rescuing Jews (when he was Vatican ambassador to Turkey in WWII) was done with the express permission and encouragement. John XXIII strongly supported the canonization of John XXIII on such grounds.The book is full of such fabrications.How can anyone take this ... seriously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet","review":"This is yet another piece of fashionable anti-Catholicism disguised as a piece of history. The author claims to \\"love his Church deeply,\\" but how this love ended up in this ex-priest being excommunicated from his church is never explained.The technique of denigrating the church is simple. Catholicism is a huge religion with millions of adherents. Choose only those church documents that appear to have a trace of anti-Semitism and then claim that Catholics are (surprise!) anti-Semitic. Suppress all the documents that are pro-Semitic and your case is made. But this dishonest technique can prove anything: Catholics are anti-abortion and pro-abortion, libertine and Puritan, anti-slavery and pro-slavery, left, right, center, vegetarians or carnivores. Take your pick.This is a sad and self-hating piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real eye-opener","review":"I could only feel sadness as I read this book.The title and the blurbs claim that this is a book of history about the interface between Catholics and Jews. After several pages, however, it's clear that this is yet another autobiography of Mr. Carroll. Much of the book is his own disagreement with Church policy on just about everything: sexuality, abortion, authority, sacraments. In the closing chapters, he even wants to rewrite the New Testament to conform to his trendy Back Bay theology.His raw self-hatred can only sadden his reader. His use of the sufferings of Israel to fuel his anti-Catholicism can only offend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid","review":"What is this book?Much of it is Carroll's endless account of his fight with his father over the Vietnam War. He then leaps from this family quarrel to assert that the relationship of Judaism and Christianity is just like his own stormy relationship with his father. The endless book then cuts historical evidence down to suit this bizarre analogy.And then there's the end, which has nothing to do with Israel. It's his little plan for Vatican III, that will give us a dreary, trendy little church right out of the editorial pages of the National Catholic Reporter.How can anyone take this silliness seriously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical novelty","review":"Many reviewers underestimate the novelty of James Carroll's approach to history. This book, claiming to be a history, truly breaks new ground in historiography:1. Do not use primary sources. Use only secondary sources, preferably those written by anti-Catholic prejudices.2. When Church documents condemn anti-Semitism, such as many public and diplomatic messages of Pius XII, ignore them. Paying attention to them might make you and your reader think too much about the issue.3. Flatter your reader's anti-Catholic prejudices. Talk about birth control, celibacy, divorce, all those sexual issues upper-middle-class readers hate in Catholic teaching. Your reader will then be ready to accept anything you want to say on the supposed issue of your book.4. When in doubt, shift to autobiography. Talk about your father, your favorite bar, your little junkets through the Holy Land. Since you're so sad, the Church couldn't be that great.A breathtaking masterpiece of the new historiography!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry excuse","review":"I'm afraid the book is as bad as serious reviewers have argued for a few months.Although the book claims to be a history, it's not history at all. It is full of misquotations, made-up quotes, and the obvious supression of evidence that the author doesn't like. It is bitterly anti-Catholic and attacks just about everything the Catholic Church teaches. But it is also anti-Jewish in the most primitive way. He demands that Jews give up their belief in being the chosen people, but this would destroy the heart of Judaism. Sorry, I'm not surrendering.The book is also incredibly self-indulgent. He uses the massacre of Jews during the Crusades to tell us about his drinking habits. I'm sorry that he despises his father so much, but what in the world does this have to with anti-Semitism?Save your money and make a contribution to B'nai Brith and Catholic Charities."},{"rating":"1","title":"The subject isn't what I thought it would be.","review":"I was looking for history of the christian church not the catholic church, so there was nothing in the book that interested me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview of the subject","review":"This is a good overview of the subject, written in an easy to read style by a popular author who is not an academic historian or biblical scholar.

He clearly chooses only those Church statments that will prove his pre-established case against Catholicism. He shoves aside the many Church documents (well know to serious students of Jewish-Christian relations) which show just the opposite.Worse than the bogus scholarship is the constant effort to turn this book into an autobiography. Who cares about the author's drinking habits, family feuds, or sex life?

The book attacks just about every tenet of the Catholic faith and is full of endless whimpering about the alleged abuses of Carroll's Catholic father.Some of the reviewers simply bask in the same mindless bigotry.

The many statements of Pius XI and Pius XII against anti-Semitism are ignored. Others are so distorted out of context that they are turned into a counter-sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical","review":"This odd book tries to argue that the hierarchy of the Catholic Church promoted anti-Semitism, but it proves just the opposite.In its treatment of the patristic period, for example, it notes how the teachings of St. Augustine and St. Gregory the Great condemned violence against Jews. This teaching helped to reduce the popular anti-Semitism inherited from the pagan Roman Empire.In the medieval period, popes and councils repeatedly intervened to defend Jews against popular anti-Semitic \\"blood libels\\" still alive in rural populations.What the book proves is that the Catholic Church, with the popes in the lead, has systematically fought anti-Semitism and denounced those who attempted to kill and molest Jews. But the author uses his evidence to arrive at just the opposite conclusion.I wonder why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"Sorry, Jim, but the antidote to anti-Semitism is not anti-Catholicism, especially the smug, tony anti-Catholicism triumphant in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine Print","review":"To understand the agenda behind this book, you should begin by reading the last part, the author's fantasy of Vatican III. The author lays out his politically correct dream of the church: no hierarchy, pro-contraception, pro-abortion, no revelation, no Bible, women priests (but not much of a priesthood left). The author, an excommunicated priest, is obviously no longer a Catholic, although adoring reviewers insist that he is. All this has nothing to do with Judaism or history, of course---indeed, the entire book has nothing to do with history (sources are routinely made up or truncated)---but it does show the dark motives behind this piece of anti-Catholicism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely Anecdotal","review":"I was really diappointed by this book. It's not really a book of history. So much of it is Carroll's autobiography: his favorite drinking places, his fights with the Catholic church, how much he dislikes his father, old battles over the morality of the Vietnam War.I understand his own need to confront his own anti-Semitism. The book is full of many chilling criticisms of Judaism. But how these endless autobiographical rants add up to an historical argument I don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"In sheep's clothing","review":"Like the recent works of Gary Wills and John Cornwell, this book appears to be a critique of the Catholic Church's misuse of power toward the Jews. But this tendentious book is not really about that subject.It's just another self-hating jeremiad by an embittered Catholic who wants his church to be just like that nice liberal, all-inclusive church down the street: no moral laws, no dsiciplinary rules, no clams about salvation. Just sweet and light, as the Boston Globe editorial page defines sweet and light.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaundiced","review":"This work is not a plausible chronicle of the Catholic Church's position on Judaism. The writer distorts the Church's record by omitting many significant Church condemnations of anti-Semitism.A much more objective account of the history of Catholic attitudes toward the Jews is presented by the Jewish historian Heinrich Graetz in his History of the Jews.Graetz concludes his work: \\"It is remarkable that the bishops of Rome, the recognized champions of Christianity, treated the Jews with the utmost toleration and liberality. The occupants of the papal throne shielded the Jews and exhorted the clergy and princes against the use of force in convertin them to Christianity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the story","review":"I must agree with most reviewers of the book that this is a dishonest take on history.One example among others: Carroll cites Edith Stein's famous letter in 1933 asking the pope to condemn Nazi anti-Semitism. But he nowhere cites the encylical letter of Pius XII, Mit Brennender Sorge (1937), that condemns Nazi racism and that defends the supreme value of the Hebrew bible.The book is so full of tendentious anti-Catholic distortion of the history that the honesty of the author must be questioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Boring, rambling turgid prose. Just when you think he's going to get on with a point, on no, he wanders back to more self-reflection which really is only interesting to him. There may have been two separate books here that in his mind got mixed up as one. To me, it ended up being highly unreadable, and I am a *reader* in the good old-fashioned, chew through James Joyce sense of the word, and I read in 9 languages. The attempted mix of history and self introspection ends up it seems 99% self-absorption. I have the hardback, and at chapter 8, when I realized there were another 4 inches of the book ahead of me, I just couldn't face the thought of all those half paragraph long sentences that repeat thoughts and points made 3 pages earlier. If I lived a million years, life would still be too short to endure all that. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Anguished","review":"James Carroll's book is a soul-searing atttempt to figure out what went wrong with Catholicism such that it could provide 1600 years of Catholics with the incendiary teachings they would need to ravage the Jewish race again and again and again. Finally it is a call to Christians to return to Christ's message and to rip away the 1900 plus years of distortions and political manipulations which have taken the teachings of one of God's greatest teachers and turned them into the often hateful hodge-podge of conflicted scripture and unloving judgments which define and deceive so much of the present day Christian community. Ultimately, it's pretty simple: If it's not about love , if it doesn't lead to loving action, then it's not Christ's teaching no matter how loudly some red clad prelate preaches that it is. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faked Facts","review":"Other reviewers have pointed out the distortions used by the author. What is most disturbing, however, is the fabrication of evidence by the author.One example: The author claims that toward the end of his life John XXIII had a conversation with a priest who asked him: \\"How are we going to refute the charges against Pius XII's silence during World War II?\\" According to the tale, John XXIII answered: \\"How can we refute the truth?\\"In fact, such a conversation never occurred. And the author knows it. In an earlier book Carroll had cited this legend and immediately said that it was apocryphal. No biographer of John XXIII had ever heard such a phrase. In fact John XXII had told several journalists that his own rescue work for Jews in Turkey had been done at the express command of Pius XII. He had bitterly condemned those who were beginning to weave the legend of Pius' \\"silence\\" in the early '60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw anger","review":"This book is not an honest effort to document the history of the Catholic Church's attitudes toward Israel.As many reviewers have noted, the book simply exaggerates the apparently anti-Semitic pasages in works written by Catholic dignitaries and then suppresses the many pro-Semitic passages, often in the same work.The treatment of Pius XI is typical. Like most leaders in the 1930's (including many Jewish leaders of the period), he opposed Zionism. His critiques of Zionism are presented as signs of some ethnic prejudice. But this pope's many condemnations of anti-Semitism are ignored: the 1928 Holy Office condemnation of anti-Semitism; the 1937 Mit Brennender Sorge denunciation of Nazi racism; the 1938 speeches condemning anti-Semitic bias.Clearly the author's agenda has nothing to do with Judaism or tolerance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Structure of Deceit","review":"This self-indulgent book doesn't make its case. The author claims to write a history, but he does not use primary sources, relies strongly on secondary sources by anti-Catholic journalists, and systematically distorts Church statements to remove clear and extended condemnations of anti-Semitism.Reading this book, one would never know that Pius XI delivered a well-publicized enclyclical denouincing the Nazi regime in 1937, with three sections entirely devoted to the defense of the Old Testament and a criticism of anti-Semitism. One would also never know that in the same year, Eugenio Pacelli (future Pius XII) delivered an address at Lourdes denouncing the barbarism, especially the anti-Semitism, of the Third Reich.The entire purpose of this bogus \\"history\\" is the effort of an excommunicated, embittered priest to trash an institution in which he no longer believes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was a history book!!","review":"Mr Carroll used the first 25-30 pages to just talk about his life.I thought that the book was going to get better but it didnt.Mr Carroll keeps talking about his childhood, his teenage years and adulthood while mentioning the history of anti-semitisn once in a while.The book is certainly very dull and boring.It is also very hard to read because everytime Mr Carroll start to talk about history, he almost inmediatly deviates into his own insights and life. The book is certainly too long because Mr Carroll makes it long."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Facts","review":"I don't know what the religious status of the author has to do with the quality of his argument. But for what it's worth, James Carroll discusses his excommunication in his memoir, An American Requiem. There's no doubt about the facts here.As for the book, it's a wash. Carroll writes well, even if his prose is always too sentimental. But he's not an historian. This is a risible cartoon of Catholicism's teaching on Judaism. For those of us who have read his puerile, anti-Catholic columns in The Boston Globe, it's all sadly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantine's Sword","review":"Please look at George Neumayr's book review in the American Spectator [spectator.org.] He makes the point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure American fantasy","review":"The author says: Polish Catholics from the nearby towns of Oswiecim and Birkenau rallied to the nuns' defense. Fights broke out. \\"One More Horror at Auschwitz,\\" read a headline in a British paper. \\"They crucified our God,\\" a boy screamed during one demonstration. \\"They killed Jesus.\\"I lived in Poland for 20 years, was very involved in the Church life, and had never heard this expression \\"They crucified our God\\".

It's a free country, man. Get used to it.It's called advocacy scholarship. It goes like this: If justice is on your side, it's perfectly OK to play with the facts. A whole new generation of \\"scholars\\" has arisen using this methodology. Some of the more honest ones, like John Dominic Crossan, admit it. Some of the more dishonest ones, like John Boswell and Elaine Pagels--and James Carroll--don't. Why should they? They're plenty of [people] who'll buy their specious scholarship.Let's not play games.

It'd save us all a lot of time, energy, and grief wasted plowing through such nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semitic","review":"I was prepared for the anti-Catholicism of this book. But nothing prepared me for its snide anti-Semitism.The author criticizes Jews for believing that God has set them apart as a chosen people. He wants to abandon the entire idea of salvation.Having thrown out the New Testament, he then proceeds to trash the Old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic odor","review":"Written by an excommunicated priest, this book is not about the Church and the Jews. It is about the religious agenda of a bitter refugee from the sexual bacchanale of the sixties.Rather than opposing prejudice, it is awash in prejudice.It appeals to every anti-Catholic myth of the last decades. It even manages to be anti-Semitic. He claims that Jews should drop their claim to be God's chosen people.What's left?"},{"rating":"1","title":"file this under \\"fantasy\\"","review":"James Carroll's \\"scholarship\\" consists of quoting other works out of context to support some bizarre personal few of history, though not any history that ever existed, except in the world of Mr. Carroll's warped mind.The author is a man with a chip on his shoulder. Perhaps in his schooldays he had his wrist slapped with the rattan by some nun, and now the venting goes on...and on ...and on....and on...That is what this book is about. Invention for venting's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untruthful","review":"The book claims to be a history of the relationship between Catholics and Jews, but it doesn't meet the first criteria of serious historical work. It does not use primary sources. Rather, it uses secondary sources often drawn from anti-Catholic journalists. As a professional historian of the Middle Ages, I was appalled at how Carroll systematically ignores or explains away the many clear condemndations of anti-Semitism by popes, councils, and theologians. It is astonishing to read his criticism of Pius XI with no reference at all to his anti-Nazi and vigorously pro-Semitic encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge and numerous other solemn condemnations of anti-Semitism.This is not history. It is pure anti-Catholic fantasy for the lesiured classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me! Me! Me!","review":"The book deals with a serious topic, but the author is so pre-occupied with his own autobiography that he never gets around to serious historical analysis. Most of the book is the author's own cloying reflections on his last drink, on his recent prayer experience, on his latest conversation. The self-indulgence is insufferable.The entire end of the book is nothing but the author's fantasy of a Church reshaped in the image of his anti-Catholic bosses at The Boston Globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"nail on the head","review":"If you are a little skimpy on the historical Jesus, what his message was, and how the church de-emphasized it in favor of another message, read this book. This man has nailed it. There is a lot of early church history. This is a book for everyone, Christian or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONSTANTINE'S SWORD - A BRIEF REVIEW","review":"James Carroll's work is exceptional by any standard. I, as a Jew, have long sought a better understanding of the historical threads of anti-semitism which culminated (hopefully) in the Shoah. Carroll, in this detailed and highly readable text, has provided that insight. It is a must reading for Jew and Gentile alike, for though the emphasis is on the past, Carroll has with great intelligence and insight prescribed a means by which the future can be made different. I thank him for his effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"There is a serious problem of anti-Semitism in Christian history. But this book is so dishonest in its use of sources, so bitter in its polemic, and so focused on the author's bizarre fight with his father that is useless as an exploration of this issue.For a much more honest study of Catholic attitudes toward Judaism, read Edward Flannery's The Anguish of the Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped view of history?","review":"\\"Constantine's Sword\\" is a warped view of history written by a non-expert who passionately hates the Catholic Church and probably most authority figures and institutions.As Columbia University's Hofstedter (sp?) once said, \\"Anti-Catholicism is the fashionable anti-Semitism of our century.\\"Especially when written by an ex-priest with no other credentials than having been ordained.Ask any non-Catholic historian to comment on this naive and scurrilous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resentment","review":"The author's attack on the Catholic church is not serious.He seriously distorts the Church's record on anti-Semitism. Astonishingly he simply ignores well-known statements by Pius XI and Pius XII against anti-Semitism. One would never know from reading this book how the French, Dutch, Italian, British, and American bishops denounced the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.The real issue, of course, is not the Church and the Jews. It's the attempt of an angry ex-priest to denigrate his church by libel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Crime","review":"This work is not a serious study of the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism.The Church is held up to ridicule by the simple method of suppressing the Church's statements of condemnation of anti-Semitism and then quoting apparently anti-Semitic statements out of context. A professional historian can only wince at the vicious caricature of Pius XII, a man who heroically saved thousands of Jewish lives but who in this book emerges as a combination of Elmer Fudd and Adolf Eichman.This book is about the rage of an excommunicated priest who, despite his cloying claims to love the Church, has decided to don a white hood and burn his own anti-Catholic crosses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction of Correction","review":"For what it's worth, James Carroll is indeed excommunicated. In his earlier autobiographical works, he openly discusses his feelings toward his excommunciation. He was excommunicated when he married his wife without proper dispensation from his promise of clerical celibacy. You can disagree with this church policy, but Carroll has always acknowledged that his religiously invalid marriage involved the penalty of excommunication. We should all pray for this tragic man."},{"rating":"1","title":"catholic guilt reheated","review":"Most of this book is just about how christian antisemitism(ie: the Crusades)is more responsible for the deaths of jews than the Death camps of WWII. I think we knew that. And how the church failed to respond all along... ditto.God's \\"people\\" whether they were Jews, Christians Muslims or whatever have NEVER been able to live up to his calling in their own.. which is what they have tried. All failed equally, but the author is an ex-priest so he came to see his \\"Fathers\\" part as worse than those that went before.So what should we do; roll in the guilt of our fathers as he does in this book. There's very little history and no exposition of what's there. It's just there to support his moral theses.The rest of the book is a psychoanalysis of his growing up looking at his mother's ankles and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRABLE'S BEST","review":"THIS IS LEGGY BETTY GRABLES BEST MOVIE EVER THE NUMBERS ARE 50's BROADWAY INSPIRED JACK LEMMON IS GREAT BUT MARGE AND GOWER CHAMPION LESS SO GRABLE ALL THE WAY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply One of the Best!!!","review":"I was so happy to see this Christmas album on sale in cd format.

If not a huge fan listen to a few samples be your own judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Way","review":"Yes, it sounds like Pink Floyd and no, the rest of the boys in the band are nowhere near. What does that say about Gilmour's contributions to The Floyd? A lot, I'd say. Nice instrumentals, and the harmonica lends a perfectly swampy atmosphere to 'There's No Way Out Of Here'. But there was a way, and here it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Gilmour Guitar","review":"I was happy to re-discover this awesome disc of Gilmour's early solo work.It's packed full of tasty guitar solo's and David's classic vocals.I believe this disc has been overlooked by most Pink Floyd fans.I can't help but wonder why it is rarely played on classic-rock radio.Even Gilmour himself has abandoned most of these wonderful songs.I would love to hear the instrumental \\"Raise my Rent\\" on his next tour.This is a strong five-star disc for any Gilmour Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good job Dave","review":"I would like to recommend this disc to anyone who really enjoys David Gilmour's smooth voice. You will get plenty of it here although two of the tracks are instrumentals. He lacks the grit that Roger brought to the table but it is an enjoyable disc anyway. I believe that Mihalis, There's No Way Out Of Here and Short and Sweet are the best tracks but they are all pretty decent. No surprises here and no explosive vocals either. Just sweet music and smooth guitar work from Dave. I would rank it really high as far as Floyd solo works go and put it maybe third right behind Roger's Amused To Death and Radio Kaos. David's second solo disc doesn't really compare with this one in the least. It was titled About Face and sounds all too much like Momentary Lapse Of Reason. Very 80's sounding pop music with nothing special about it in the least other than his excellent voice. Enjoy the disc if you are purchasing it at this time and God Bless YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimour Does Very well","review":"Gilmours first solo effort is a great one. Though the lyrics are alright, the music [rocks]! The GILMOUR TRADMARK GUITAR is here of course.

Gilmour's an excellent guitarist and a fine singer, but he has none of the songwriting vision of his former bandmate, Roger Waters. It was Waters warped worldview that gave classic Pink Floyd its edge. Gilmour's undeniable talent may have added to Floyd's sound, but on his own he has nothing much to say. The songs on his debut album are mostly interchangeable. They are also pleasent enough, but dissipate before they can make an impression on your frontal lobe. That Gilmour could release an album of lumbering dinosuar rock in the midst of the punk explosion and not be ridiculed is some kind of testament. But its no reason to indulge him these many years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"David a talent???","review":"I'm unsure how many years people are willing to pay David Gilmour for replicating Roger Waters stuff.Gilmour is self-admittedly not a good guitarist,so why waste your money on Floyd replicas???I'm sorry, he did some good \\"mood\\" solos with Floyd, I'm just tired of hearing them over and over in a \\"New\\" song which sounds just like a Roger Waters song with bad poetry (lyrics)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Gilmour at his best","review":"One of my most favorite albums -- Gilmour's songs are evocative and moving and his guitar playing is simply incredible. I would definitely take this album to my desert island with me . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Good Song","review":"This is a huge disappointment. Every song goes absolutley nowhere. David sounds like he is just learning how to write songs (where is the melody??) and what is here is very empty and meandering. Some of the guitar playing is good but overall there is not one good song or melody here. Skip this and get his 2nd solo album About Face which is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"four rivets are one short for five star","review":"This is an addition to my classic clad set I bought from Amazon.

I'm taking from this book what I've always taken from my own observations and things have only become clearer thanks to the author. I will never marry. I will never have children (I've already taken the steps to insure this). Therefore I will never require adultery as a means of obtaining \\"newness\\" or \\"what's missing.\\" Tell the truth.

Professor Kipnis puts it all into context particularly referring to the rate of adultery and failed marriages. Even those in supposedly stable relationships have thoughts about straying elsewhere.One of her principle arguments is the need to 'work'at a successful marriage. In other words, you go to workand when you come home, you have to work more to be able to enjoy your life - why should one have to work at it!!??Splendid prose, but mainly for the sceptics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amusing Look at Relationships","review":"Laura Kipnis teaches at Northwestern where my best friend from childhood goes to school. She read the book for one of her classes and has recommended it to every smart sassy woman she knows.Kipnis has a way with words and humor and a slanted look at relationships that will make anyone laugh and ponder. With all the lovey-dovy stuff clogging television screens, its nice to hear someone telling readers that made-for-television movies are indeed made for television.There are a couple of passages that I found particularly amusing--for example, where Kipnis describes the things that people in relationships are prohibited from doing.All together, if you want a refreshing look on love (if someone is really giving you a hard time or you just broke up with someone) this book will put a bright smile on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is 1 too many.","review":"this book is fraught with straw men. kipnis sets up ludicrously stereotypical ideals and then proceeds to attack them with high falutin language, endless redundancies, and self congratulation. i'm all for alternative lifestyles, but this woman is a dim bulb and this book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhlease!!!!!!","review":"This is a perfect example of the excesses of academia, and as a recovering academic, I should know.Although this book is witty and intellectually seductive, it is, as many of these types of discourses are, divorced from the real life dynamics of life-time commitment and partnership. So despite the sophistication of the argument, it is ultimately rather simplistic and naive.Great book to discuss while you toss back a latte with others of the ivory tower crowd, but unlikely to illuminate those who live in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A counter-argument","review":"From 'The Screwtape letters' by C.S. Lewis:...humans who have not the gift of continence can be dettered from seeking marriage as a solution because they do not find themselves 'in love', and, thanks to us, the idea of marrying with any other motive seems to them low and cynical.

Swift's treatise on the Irish problem of over-population and famine entitled \\"A Modest Proposal\\" was also a polemic and advocated cannibalism as a solution. Ms. Kipnis is not interested in presenting an empirically based \\"balanced\\" point of view but an hyperbolically stated skewering of a supposed ideal. This is provocative (and is meant to be).

If you have not read Clarke before, do not buy the book or you will think that all his novels are like this. There is very little of sci-fi; most of the book delves in the past life of the characters, trying to demonstrate that all of them have some sort of childhood trauma. The Sci-fi part lacks punch, and there is nothing \\"scary\\" about the world menace. Do not waste your money; buy something else (Rendezvous with Rama and Songs of Distant Earth for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACC readers should join together and take down Lee!!","review":"I thought the book would have been wonderful except for the sex scenes! They didn't do anything for the book! Like Troy's stupid computer game, Gretta swimsuit, and that young man's problems with controlling his urges.

They don't produce good quality books!DON'T BUY A BOOK WITH GENTRY LEE'S NAME ON IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another fake \\"collaboration\\" between Clarke and idiot","review":"The first seven pages are marvelous. They postulate an imaginative alien biosphere threatened with various extinctions (an ice age and, subsequently, competition between species). Zoological spacefarers rescue peaceful lifeforms from this world, then proceed to Earth during our own antiquity. Beautifully written. Obvious Clarke.Then it is obvious Lee takes over, and the other reviews here seem to bear me out. Childish scribbling unrelated to the prologue or anything else (something about an undersexed newsreporter, an underwater telescope, and a lost Panther missile gone astray in a test off the Florida Keys). The ear for dialogue is puerile, and the story sense is totally uninvolving. I gave up after 39 pages.After the awful last installment in the Rama series, I should have known better. Now that Clarke has left us, can we be aswsured Lee's career is over? Hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Memorable Book","review":"It may have Arthur C. Clarke's name on the cover, but the actual content written by Clarke is minimal. Go marketing! Barely anything about the book stuck after reading it, and normally when I read a Clarke novel I retain vivid descriptions of character and dilemmas. Not much science fiction (very unlike Clarke, which I why I think he 'wrote' it 'name only' by providing the only first chapter and maybe a few paragraphs later), and most of the novel is a tedious bollywood trainwreck.I can't say enough stuck with me to even 'hate' the novel, as that would be a strong inspired emotion. Strong inspired emotions are not present in this mediocre book, which read like a hollywood script rejected a few hundred times for being too cliche. Aliens steal gold, outwit military forces, gratuitous sex scene, humans meander, more gratuitous sex scenes, trainwreck of plots, the end (lacks resolution).Save yourself the trouble and find a better use for your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Clarke's best works...","review":"Despite what many of the other reviewers said, I don't think Gentry Lee was the reason this book wasn't very good. He worked with Clarke on most of the Rama series, too, and those were some of the best books I've ever read. It seems to me that this book was a fluke. It was full of factual errors, which surprised me, since I've never found errors in any of Clarke's other works. This novel was basically a soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clark","review":"I think that Clark wanted to show us that he can write about not-tech stuff too. Not bad, when trying, but the plot is a little unconnected. I didn't like it.

I picked it up on a whim as I had never read Clarke but knew about his reputation. This was not a good first Clarke book to read. In fact, it's not a good book to read period.The plot was weak but the characters were by far the worst part of this whole endeavor. It made me wonder if the authors even knew how to write good characterization. It felt like they spent most of their time reminiscing about their pasts and quivering with emotion over it. No human beings speak or act like these people did.The sci-fi parts that didn't involve any of the characters were by far the best bits but they were few and far between. This felt more like a grocery store romance novel with science fiction elements shoehorned in."},{"rating":"1","title":"All character development and no story","review":"Eighty-five percent of this story is character development, and the characters are as paper thin as the science fiction plot. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It has been a number of years since I read any science fiction, so I decided to play it safe and pick up something by an author with a long and outstanding track record.

As the film has recently played on cable television here in a near perfect color corrected version, I cannot understand why Fox have not taken more care in their DVD transfer.

If you didn't see the soap opera on television, it will be difficult for you to understand, because everything happens so fast.And that's not the worst thing. They tried to replace the original score. I can't explain why!. It's so difficult to believe that Televisa can't pay for the rights of the music. You can't understand many of the dialogues because of that. It's like a noise.If you like this soap opera, just don't buy this item.

It's harsh, jumbled noise that makes no sense, is highly distracting and drowns out the dialogue. So bad that I had to watch a lot of scenes with the sound off. It would be better to have NO music than such horrible music. It detracts from the show a lot. Many telenovelas (when originally shown on TV) have very good music that help the plot along.

Great rockin versions of Yardbird's standards plus some nice new songs too including the Jim McCarty penned \\"Cryin Out For Love\\" which the boys still perform in concert.

Other reviews pointed out that the job would still be messy and that I would have to purchase a rubber coupling to make it work with my Toro blower. What I wasn't prepared for was how terribly unwieldy the assembled unit would be. The lowest gutters on my two story house are over the garage and 11' off the ground. I'm 6'1\\" and needed most of the tubes installed to comfortably hold the blower at waist level. While this did the job, the whole contraption wants to sway in all directions and there is no way that I would attempt using it without both feet on terra firma.Since all my other gutters would require a ladder and all extensions, it's unusable to me.

Had to fight the attachment to stay vertical once the blower was on. Worked well until it hit a pocket of wetter leaves and then it just blew wet leaves and water everywhere.

DO NOT BELIEVE IT. If the opening coming directly out of the blower is not circular, then it will not fit. My Toro electric has an ovoid opening, and none of the attachments or adapters fit. Again, it will ONLY work on a circular exit blower.What's worse, the seller has a 15% restock fee. This is a big loser for us. It cost us about $20 just to find out it won't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is another good read from the Momma Lou series. There was a little more suspense to this book than the others. I like how the author shows diversity with all of her characters.

When the drill arrived I measured the chuck at 1/2\\" and it is clearly stamped \\"1/2-20\\". A call to Makita verified that they do not make a chuck larger than a 1/2\\" chuck. They call it a 3/4\\" drill because \\"it could drill a hole that big\\". All my other hammer drills are American brands and they are all called 1/2\\" drills even though, with a reduced shank bit, they could drill holes larger than 1/2\\". My little 3/8\\" drill can handle a 6\\" hole saw, so should I call it a 6\\" drill? If this is not false advertising on Makita's part, it is certainly confusing and misleading.

This is pure pop music at its best. I partially agree with another reviewer who thought that it was a pretentious album because of all the orchestral arragements. I think that only 2 songs could be so labeled. But for an album to have songs like ELDORADO and Mr. Kingdom and many others, it is just impossible to give it a bad review. If you buy this album, I assure you you will not regret it. Some of the sounds are somewhat dated but, you will understand that the melodies and lirics are the work of masters and if you think about it, this is what matters the most. I would think that if a new, stripped down version of this album is made, it would definately become a bigger classic than it is now. This is the only reason why I dont give it a full 5 star rating. Then again, 4 stars is pretty good...dont you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey ELO fans!

There's magic twinkling all over the place. For once, the exuberant strings do not dull the music, but rather enrich it, while there are even some subtle experimental sounds added. Again, this album breathes musical magic all over and I've never met anyone who regretted buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great, great!","review":"The CD came as described.

Thought I'd REALLY like this CD; however, was so disappointed. It is all subjective, but for me her voice is just that little bit off when I hear these pieces. It just did not meet what I expected.

The orchestrations are great, but there were times when she just didn't quite hit the notes. And \\"Nothing Like a Dame\\" was just one big mistake in my book. If you're a total BP fan you'll probably enjoy it; if you're not, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan in San Francisco","review":"Miss Peters is best when heard in person, either in concert or a stage performance. That said, this album is the next best thing since she sings live, as the orchestra plays, giving each song a spark and a vibrancy that is absent in many recordings. I was sold on this album even before I heard it because the orchestrations were arranged and conducted by Jonathan Tunick, who I first became familiar with via one of my all-time favorite albums (Cleo [Laine] Sings Sondheim). There is depth and clarity and layers of sounds in every song, to which Miss Peters then adds herself. I agree with another reviewer who said that the up-tempo songs are best -- Miss Peters is GREAT with a quick lyric -- but every song on this CD is reinterpreted beautifully. I recommend it highly -- there's nothin' like a dame, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the artist and the Music suit each other so well","review":"When the artist and the music fit together as well as Bernadette Peters and the music of Rogers & Hammerstein go together, the result is going to be wonderful. Such is the case with Bernadette loves Rogers & Hammerstein.I will admit at the start that I am a Peters fan, and buy anything by her I can find. Sometimes fans get rewarded for that, and the new CD is such a reward.The CD features a good variety of R & H songs, tender songs such as Something Right, beautiful songs such You'll Never Walk Alone, and vigorous fun music such as There's Nothing Like a Dame. The great quality of Ms Peters\\" talent that shows in this CD is that she has the power for the power songs, but can sing the beautiful songs in the way they deserve as well. The more comic songs are just a riot. Anyone who loves show music or enjoys the work of Bernadette PEters will want this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I received my copy of this CD the day after watching an American Masters bio of Richard Rogers, and I was psyched. I love Bernadette Peters and I adore Rogers & Hammerstein - but I was sorely disappointed in this album. All the way through it I kept having the feeling they had to wake Ms. Peters up between cuts. Even songs like \\"It's a Grand Night for Singing\\" had about as much spark as a wet match. The arrangements just did not do justice to either Ms. Peters or Rogers and Hammerstein.I feel like a traitor, but I just cannot recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed in this CD","review":"Did not think Ms. Peters voice was up to par--she sounded tired and weak.

Where's the dialogue? Also, where's Winston??????? I can count on one hand the amount of times we got to read about actual interaction that was going on between them. Most of the book, he's AWOL and we're only reading about what Stella's thinking and feeling. Not quite my idea of a love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Terry...","review":"Waiting to Exhale, Mama, and Disappearing Acts were better.

Of course it is pure fantasy but what fun I had reading it. I loved Stella, I loved Jamaica (well I spent my childhood there so I would) and I loved the gentle plot that never really went anywhere but was enjoyable all the same. McMillan certainly knows how to write a good fun book. Read this when you go on holiday, it will have you giggling and smiling in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it was a fast read","review":"The only thing that saved this book in my opinion is that it was a quick read and I was able to finish it in time for my book club meeting.I thought the characters were vapid, the story unrealistic (I know it's loosely based on the author's life, but I still couldn't figure out how two people 21 years apart in age could fall in love after like 2 hours) and overall dull.

I really enjoyed all of your other books, especially Waiting to Exhale, but this book was horrible. What is the deal with the intertwinning thoughts? All of Stella's inner thoughts did not need to be written down. The book was confusing and it had no \\" UMPH\\" to it. And they are actually going to make a movie from this book. I hope that it's going to be an HBO special or a LIFETIME movie, because if it actually goes to the movie theater people are going to ask for their money back. The only good thing about this book is that Stella was a strong and somewhat independently well-to-do black women with a portfolio. The girl seemed to have bank and she could buy anything she wanted.Terry, I don't mean to diss you because your other books were great, but you could have kept this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow with excruciating dialogue","review":"A romance novel set in the Caribbean, _How Stella Got Her Groove Back_ lacks even minimal believability. For readers of fantasy, the book is okay, but if you've ever been to Jamaica, heard Jamaicans speak or desire more than shallow scenes in your fiction, look elsewhere, perhaps to Russell Banks (_The Book of Jamaica_)or to Patricia Powell for sustenance. The dialogue on the part of Stella's love interest sounds entirely concocted from Harlequin. Disappointing not even so much for what it is but what it may inspire in others: vapid thinking about a complex culture and copycat novelists hoping to cash in on the same ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring and shallow to even finish.","review":"Stella is completely focused on herself and only in the most superfical way. There is a rather tedious fascination throughout the book to name designer goods----sunglasses, t-shirts, perfume, etc. This book lacks any kind of interesting substance what-so-ever. The characters are incredibly shallow, and the story would make most teenagers roll their eyes. I could only pass this book along at a garage sale--and even then it wasn't easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got in a rut just trying to finish this oh-so tedious book","review":"Oh the self absorbed shallow preoccupation with one's self!This book was so boring--the first book my book club voted not necessary to finish.Shelia may have got back into her groove but it certainly wasn't through any kind of insightful or thoughtful reflection or soul searching. This book reads rather like a constant commerial for material goods---'no fear' shirts--'seal c.d's' and on and on and on. Perhaps if Shelia had stopping focusing on designer or brand name items she would have got her groove back much sooner. The characters lacked depth, the conversations were bland, and the story --well where was the story? Shelia needed to get a personality---not necessarily a young lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe the movie will be better","review":"Terri what happened? Disappearing Acts, Mama, and WTE were way better than this. After the first 3 chapters, i had to put it down. I just couldnt get into it. Mama was my all time McMillian favorite. Why not make that one into a movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, mon!","review":"Two African American teenaged students recommended this book. It was obvious the interest it would have for them, and I was amazed at how appealing it was to me (of course, I had just returned from vacation in Jamaica). As a middle-aged anglo woman, I smiled my way through Stella's reflections on life. Surprisingly, her stream of consciousness style was very refreshing. I liked Stella's philosophy of life, and her relationships with her sisters were classic. I enjoyed meeting Winston and admired Stella for the wonderful job she had done bringing up her son. This is a book with so many levels, that a woman should reread it at every passage in her life. It will never gather dust on my shelf. Why not a 10? I don't want Stella to lose everything she's gained in her new sense-of-self to Winston. Hang in there, Stella!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow.","review":"In one word: Shallow. The book was entirely superficial and the protagonist, Stella Payne, was no where near genuine. From page one, I could not relate to Stella. She is not like the average reader or the average AA single mother. Who exactly was McMillian's audience? Teenage girls? A fine fantasy novel without a message. I could say more, but why? I'm afraid to try reading any other McMillian novels...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD READ","review":"I was disappointed to see so many low ratings for this book. I for one enjoyed it very much. I must admit that in the beginning it started to lose my interest because of the run on sentences and lack of punctuation. However, I stuck with it and found an entertaining, funny, and enjoyable piece of work full of fantasy. The ending could have used a little more work but overall, I would recommend it for anyone, man or woman who is looking for a little excitement. And you don't have to be over 40 and single to enjoy it, I am married and just turned 30. Thanks Terry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry, please don't write another book.","review":"I can't take it anymore. I liked Waiting to Exhale so I've read other McMillan books, but no more. We don't care about your May-December romance. There is no substance here. It just makes me sick that something so bad can make someone so undeserving millions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was something on television.","review":"I would have put that book down a lot sooner if I had anything else to do that night. The characters were uninteresting; the story was flimsy at best, and the train-of-thought writing style gave me a headache. This book was not at all on level with her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect world","review":"Stella has a perfect body, a perfect son and a perfect house. She has a perfect job that she isn't really happy with but that is OK because she has made perfect investments and she is an talented artist so she doesn't need it. The only thing that she doesn't have is a perfect man so she goes on a perfect holiday and finds one. Is there anyone out there that can actually relate to anything that happens in this book? Reading this is like stumbling into the secret daydream fantasy of the author, you get the feeling that you shouldn't really be here and that these things would be best left to her own inner world. An uncomfortable book to read and one that I couldn't wait to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROBABLY THE WORST BOOK OF THE YEAR","review":"Hated the book!!! Terry McMillan doesn't or hasn't learned how to use punctuations in her writing of this book. It totally exhausted me just reading it. Never knew when to breathe. Books are supposed to be entertaining, interesting, en- lightening and enjoyable. None of the above can be said of this book. I couldn't wait to finish it and finally be able to put it down. If this is any indication about the author's writing, I will definitely never read any of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE !!!","review":"I found this book to be sooo boring. I bought it when it first came out in paperback and tried to read it. It was boring then. When the movie came out, and I saw the commericails (especially Whoopi), I tried again. What a waste of my time. The run-on sentences make the book very hard going, but the worst part was the people. I really did not care whether Stella ever got her groove back or not. She was shallow, and annoying. The other characters were flat, as was Stella. I love everything else Terry McMillan wrote, but this was terrible. I'm not even going to see the movie until it comes out on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"This book was an insult to Terri's readers. compared to her other works, this was trash. full of run on sentences and a shallow and predictible plot, it seems that McMillian was in this one for the $ more than for the story. just because something interesting happens in real life does not necessarily mean that it'll make an interesting story. this certainly didnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile","review":"I am a great respecter and lover of books, but this thing was so bad that I literally threw it into a garbage can when I was done reading it. While the lead character has the potential to be likeable and interesting, McMillan subverts Stella's intelligence by making her a sucker for a pretty young male face (et al), and the simplistic belief that \\"love will conquer all.\\" The story itself is so pathetic that I found it difficult to believe that it was written by a grown woman who is old enough to know better. Worse, it propagates the myth that a woman can't be truly happy, successful, creative or fulfilled without a man in her life. As such, STELLA would have worked a lot better as an animated movie where the heroine sings a lot and the love interest comes equipped with a horse and a castle. It's just that realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as mama","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I found Terry McMillan's last two books to be rather whiny and full of complaints. After reading \\"Mama\\" I was expecting a writer to emerge that would be on the level of other great African American female writers like Toni Morrison or Alice Walker. Instead of the \\"story teller\\" that I expected, Terry McMillan has evolved as a writer of shallow, vapid situations that depict black women as whiny, angry and dependent on the men they claim they don't need."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story of a vonger man and older woman.","review":"HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK by Terry McMillan is a very good novel. I liked the book because it's a simple story about two people that meet in Jamaica and end up falling in love.The problem is that one lives in San Francisco and is 42 years old and the other actually lives in Jamaica and is 21. It's also a good book because I know that this situation happeneds quite often and that many people can relate to it. It's a typical love story that has it's regular ups and downs that every real relationship has. If you saw the movie and liked it, then you should read the book because you'll like it even more. I'm sure that if the situation of age difference or living distance hasn't happend to you yet, it will in your life some time or another and this book could help you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! WANT THE MOVIE NOW!","review":"This book was great, I loved it. I start many books rarely finish one, but I read this book in a couple of days and I enjoyed it. It is written the way I write and talk in \\"run-on\\" sentences. When I heard there was a movie I was excited, though I don't think it could beat the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I have read all of McMillan's other books and assumed this one would be as interesting as her others. Boy was I wrong! This book has absolutely no plot whatsoever and I barely got past the first chapter. I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of paying $23 for the hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting escape from life","review":"\\"Stella\\" is a GREAT book. It is a prime route for escapism, as the main character follows her heart and takes chances that most of us only dream of doing. Yes, she is too perfect and you will spend a little time wondering why the author implies that this kind of experience can only happen to the beautiful woman with the perfect body, but beyond that, it is very easy to get swept away in the romance and you will have SO much trouble putting it down! It is a great read for a vacation or a day on the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Terry McMillan written *all* over it.","review":"THis book was not one of her greatest works, but it was not bad as others percieved it to be. Sure, she talks about sex and\\"getting some.\\" Sure, she talks in run-on sentences. That's what makes the book unique. Without this poetic license, it would not be Terry McMillan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Could Have Understood What I Just Read...","review":"If you like run on sentences, then this is the book for you. Because I couldn't get pass this, I didn't get pass chapter two. I'm sorry I bought the book. I have let several friends read it and they all thought is was another masterpiece of Terry, so I thought I would try again to read it. Needless to say, I still couldn't get pass the run on sentences. After hearing her read a passage from her book on the Oprah Winfrey show, I said I had to get this book and I also thought that maybe her reading style was just babbling, not her writing. It's the whole book. Terry, give me something that I can't put down, like Waiting to Exhale and Disappearing Acts this next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh come on, Terry.","review":"I know that Terry McMillian can do better than \\"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\\". The plot was simple and boring, as were the characters, and the story moved too slow. I can't possibly know how Hollywood is going to bring this book to the silver screen without boring the audience to death. I wonder why Mrs. McMillian doesn't write a screenplay for \\"Mama\\". That book was the best she has written, yet it is less mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"This book is extremely shallow. Terry seemingly didn't put much thought nor effort into making this work even close to comparable to her other works. Sometimes it's best to wait and allow your creativity time to rejuvenate itself. But when you're rushing to sling out another book just to please the masses, the result will show the fruits, or should I say lack of fruit, of your labor. There was nothing memorable, nothing thought-provoking, nothing exciting about this book. When I finished it, my first thought was \\"You've got to be kidding!\\" And, sadly enough, she wasn't kidding. I like books rich in detail, history, and emotions. This book touched on neither for me. Terry, I'm willing to wait long enough for you to get the next one right. There's no hurry. We'll be here, that is, unless you produce another one like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stella is poorly written and even more poorly spoken.","review":"In the audio version of How Stella Got Her Groove Back, the author took the time to perform the reading of the book herself. She shouldn't have bothered. She could have spent her time more constructively by putting more effort into the writing of the book. I couldn't listen to 15 minutes before turning off the tape. Ms. McMillan seems to stumble through words she, herself had written making it hard to focus on the story she is trying to tell. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and tried to read the written version. Unfortunately, the story was disappointing and the author appears to have rushed through the writing. Terry, next time spend the time on the writing and let the professionals do the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Terry Mcmillanish\\" novel","review":"I think that Terry Mcmillan needs to start thinking beyond sex and materialism and start thinking about real life issues. I find her to be one of the most overrated, shallow-minded African American authors of the decade. McMillan makes 'Stella' and 'Exhale's main characters seem like sex-starved, middle-aged, middle-class, nymphos. I have read all of your novels and frankly Terry, I know you can do better than this for six million dollars(your publisher should have pressed for more quality instead of quantity). I agree with the previous reader who said that anybody with as much time on their hands as Terry does could've written this novel. Success has spoiled ol'girl no doubt. As a matter of fact, Ms. Mcmillan herself admits that this particular novel was rushed bragging that it only took her a month and a half to write it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"That's the most polite word I came up with to describe this piece of junk.

My book club voted it 'best book NOT to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Terry McMillian book","review":"I've read other books by Terry McMillian and really enjoyed them. \\"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\\" was a disappointment. From page one I didn't like Stella. She seemed to be in love with herself. Also the constant run on sentences were annoying.The story was a predictable fairy tale.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Stella Got Her Groove Back","review":"I admit that I have only read the first two chapters. That was painful. I am not one to read rambling on of one's feelings on and on and on. I can see how the movie version might be better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"To me, each of Ms. McMillan's books get worse. I loved Mama and Disappearing Acts. Waiting to Exhale was o.k. This was like, \\"WHATEVER.\\" The movie was MUCH better than the book. I wish people would stop comparing everybody to Terry McMillan. There are so MANY talented writers out there, each with their own identities. This book was not BAD, just mediocre. There was not a lot to this plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racy and Fun to Read","review":"I have just finished this book and I loved it. Stella is real, courageous and has her life in control. I admire the honesty with which she deals with her feelings about Winston; she is very much like most of us are, battling with anxiety, fear of looking bad, of displeasing others.... I admire her for her courage to accept herself and her feelings, however unsocially correct they may seem.Terry's style though, is rather heavy going- the stream of consciousness style does make the book a bit tedious at times, unlike Waiting to Exhale. I found her unsavoury comments about African women unacceptable - the cultures that subjugate women through circumcision and poor education are a much deeper issue, Terry, and those poor women cannot fight them all alone. they need help, not ridicule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not read past the first 5 pages","review":"What is the world coming to? I actually spent $25 dollars on this very irritating and annoying book. Terry, what are you writing? I really hate dishing out the following comments but I have to. Your only other book I read was \\"waiting to exhale\\" and I wasn't too crazy about it. Then you come with this and I say to myself, this will be a lot nicer. Then I turn the first two pages and I couldn't believe my eyes and the way my brain received this. I skipped to the middle which was a wrong move because I yelled for some type of help. This is a sin. To actually sell people this. That's not fair. Please, choose a new subject to write about. Strong black women and psycho black men is really not what life is about. You're giving people the image that black women are frustrated. I'm a black woman and I believe I'm not man crazy/frustrated. Please, do your readers a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superhuman characters, stagnant plot, intrusive style.","review":"Stella, a divorced mother, is perfect. Not only is she financially successful, superbly educated (3 degrees) and artistically savvy, she possesses a self-awareness which seems downright impossible. Rivalled only by her smart, obedient and emotionally precocious 11-year-old son, Stella does not need a new groove: she needs a human side. Stella's trip to Jamaica and fling with a 21 year old is an interesting daydream, but the book should have ended with her return to the U.S. and not drawn out the saccharine phone calls and tormented emotions of her growing love for him. All 450 pages of Stella's mental thrashings are punctuated by a lack of puncation, namely commas and periods, and a chatty style that's all style and very little substance. A quick, effortless read, but not for the easily bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Lacking Film","review":"I have been a two-time reader of Terry and I found STELLA to be almost as interesting as WAITING TO EXHALE. While the language had to be worked around, the description of the \\"trips\\" that Stella goes on is fantastic. This is where the movie lacked. We are not able to see the imagery that McMillan presents in the novel. STELLA just needs to be given a chance. The tale is great and describes the wonder and fantasy that truly comes with Jamaica. You Go Girl!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader from DC","review":"Terry McMillan is an excellent writer, but she must have been tired when she wrote this. Disappearing Acts, Mama and Waiting to Exhale all had me in frizzy of mixed emotions filled with laughter, joy and pain. I was definitely relating to the characters when I read these books. But Stella and her groove back, pleeze. It started out good, but was too long and drawn out. It was sort of like reading a boring diary after the excitement of an affair wore off. It was so bad, I put it down after I was half way through and I never touched it again. I got the book as a birthday present and almost regretted asking for it. Terry girl, you have done better. I think you ought to stick to the men bashing. It's more you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we pick a new topic other than sex?","review":"This book was not good at all. I didn't like it.

In the end, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad effort - not worth picking up!!","review":"If you enjoy trying to decipher run-on sentences, then this book is for you. If you love the word \\"Tripp'n\\" , this book is for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for well developed characters, keep looking. If your looking for a realistic, fun story line, run to any other book. This book was sorry from cover to cover. Terry, you know you could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, pointless, cotton-candy for the \\"mind\\".","review":"This isn't writing. It's typing. Anybody who can find \\"meaning\\" in any of the lightweight twaddle churned out by Terry McMillan is as hopelessly superficial as she is. I have never been tempted to open a McMillan book after I've finished it. In fact, I've forgotten it by the next day. McMillan is good at what she does: producing pulp, mass-market pablum for the lowest common denominator"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Stella Bored Me To Death--a more fitting title","review":"This book was tedious and predictable. Does McMillan think run-on sentences are supposed to help the reader relate or get into the text? It accomplished the opposite for me. The huge problem in the book is whether or not Stella will have the gumption to ignore her sister's ill rancor toward Stella's relationship with the young boyfriend. Oooh, what searing drama! The book is completely annoying and as far as I'm concerned, a protagonist whose annual income exceeds $200,000 shouldn't worry too much about anything. What a waste of my time"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Stella Got her groove back","review":"For a writing style that is similar to the style I am writing this review in you will find a lovely story of a 42 year old woman who falls in lust with a 21 year old man whose best characteristic is that he kisses real nice and she has a son who tells her age is just a number so she goes ahead and continues the relationship if you like long run-on sentences without a comma or a period and can relate only to kids fresh out of highschool then this book is for you because thats the basic contents of the story really really I mean you will read long paragraphs and feel like you have to hold your breath just to read it and I got tired of the constant highschoolish jitters she got as she would wait by the phone for Winston to call and she'd have to be reassured each time that yes indeed he does care for her and there is nobody else I recommend this book highly if you want an easy read that you can read in a half an hour because it is easy to skip the long rambling parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING","review":"This books lacks passion, and an interesting character.

Although there was a big difference in the book from the movie , I enjoyed them both. keep the good work up, three thumbs up for you girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care about the character of Stella","review":"I'm a big fan of Terry McMillan's other books, particularly Mama and Disappearing Acts. I cared about the characters. But it was hard to care about Stella. First of all, I'm fat and it seemed like on every couple of pages, particularly during her trip to Jamaica, she had to make a derogatory comment about a fat person. The repetition annoyed me. Every time Winston didn't call her, she would have this long diatribe about how much Winston was a jerk. Then he'd call with some excuse and she'd fall back into his arms. It got to be very boring. And what was with the lack of commas at times? Yikes. The whole book seemed to be written in a rush. Definitely not Terry McMillan's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist writing by Terry","review":"Her writing is excellent except for her mind is so clouded with Racism. What a waste . No wonder the Movie was a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRY GET YOUR GROOVE BACK","review":"This is one of the worst books that I have read. MAMA and DISAPPEARING ACTS were excellent books.

I hated this book and I will never pick up one of her novels again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun summer book","review":"This book was a fun read... although parts of it were somewhat predictable and most of it seemed a bit implausible, I couldn't put it down. It was a nice little escape for poolside reading and was surprisingly thought provoking with respect to our societal views of women, particularly older women, and relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book showed how one woman can reclaim her life.","review":"How Stella got her Groove back is one of the many books that I have enjoyed over the summer. Many people seem to focus on the obvious, older woman, younger man, however this book is much deeper than that. Reclaiming your life is what I think Terry was trying to bring out, in my opinion she did an excellent job!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??? The worst written book!!","review":"I have read all of Terry's books, but for the life of me, I could not read this book. It is the worst written book I have ever tried to read! There are pages and pages in this book with NO punctuations PERIOD. Since I use my local library, I'm so glad that I did not pay for this book, I took it back in 2 days after I Tried to read it. I read Waiting to Exhale and HATED the movie! I only hope this movie is better than the book! Everyone is entitled to one mistake, and Terry, this is yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I READ THIS BOOK AND I DID NOT ENJOY IT. THE ONLY REASON WHY I FINISHED THE BOOK WAS BECAUSE I READ OTHER BOOKS BY TERRI, AND I WANTED TO GIVE HER A CHANCE TO REDEEM HERSELF.

HOwever, it turned out to be a pretty good lobve story. Terry Mcmillan is a wonderful writer and is well respected ast the school I attend. I really enjoyed all of her books from Momma to Waiting to exhale. Keep up the good work Ms. Mcmillan and keep your readers wondering what's next, because that is certainly what I am thinking right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debating whether to finish or not","review":"It's not even the run-on sentences that I mind, but the constant back and forth with being happy and sad, happy and mad, etc. By reading these reviews I have found out how the book ends. This is good. Now I don't have to finish it unless I dare go through one more long sentence about how she thinks she's too old and he's too young (BLAH-blah-blah). Just get on with the story already. I can't stand the tediousness of it all. The best character in this whole book is sweet little Quincy (the only character who seems to have his head on straight).

She and her best friend take an island vacation where she becomes romantically linked to Winston, who just happens to be more than 20 years her junior. While Stella has her own doubts, friends and family continue to give a variety of unsolicited opinions. Joblessness and the loss of her best friend also play into the story line. This book is filled with the realities of success, comedy, sadness, grief and confusion. HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK is a good read, but not too deep. It's one of the few books where the movie was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It felt as if I was in Stella's mind!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. You actually thought that you were inside Stella's mind, experiencing her thoughts, feelings, and emotions. The technique to not use puncuation (run-on sentences) has been around for a while. Most authors do not use it. I guess they think is confusing. But I like that type of writing. Another example of it is Light in August by William Faulkner. In conclusion, I hope that they make this book into a movie. If they do, Angela Basset has to be Stella, and Tyson has to be Winston!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done..interesting..erotic..realistic...and fun.","review":"A great story about a succesful AA woman who had conquered everything but love.She found it in a unique place with a very unique person.

I actually had to put the book down and shut my eyes after one of those paragraph/sentences to avoid getting a migraine. Then, we have a part with Stella reading \\"Waiting to Exhale\\", 'by that Terry McMillan', geez how tacky, making references to another of your books in a fictional story....What was the point of including it in there? To let readers know that *you* know they don't like it? That's the only purpose it would serve for me, other than be an 'I'm trying to impress you' plot device. Ok... basic plot... bored rich woman goes to Jamaica, sleeps with a couple of guys, doesn't get much deeper than that. Read it if it doesn't take much to impress you, but frankly, I should try to get my 4-year-old to get published if this is all it takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Stella","review":"This book is so tiresome, it will put the reader in a rut. Ms. McMillan is far more concerned with being a label snob and a preoccupation with materialism and brands, then she is with character development. The characters were BORING BORING BORING---even in their brand name clothes listening to Seal, etc. This book reads like a commercial. ----unfortunately it is much longer than a commercial!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"Stella seems to have it all: money, prestige, house, car, a son she adores...but no man to share her life with. So when her son goes off to spend time with his father, she uses this time to discover who she really is, and gets her \\"groove\\" back in the process. The book made me laugh out loud, and I could truly relate to the \\"will he call? I hope he doesn't\\" pendulum swing of her thoughts regarding Winston. She wants him so much, but doesn't want to want him, and doesn't want him to know how MUCH she wants him unless he wants her just as much....it's all too real. Her \\"stream of consciousness\\" writing style is not the typical writing you would expect in a book; however, it is fashioned after the way one might think things through in your own mind, without expressing them vocally. Stella discovered some very important things about herself in the end, and realized that she just needs to be herself in order to be happy. I can't wait for Terry McMillan's next book"},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy","review":"This book was very flat. I can appreciate an older woman snagging herself a younger man, but I thought that the story line was weak.

No thanks, I only got about a quarter way through the book, and the run-on sentences gave me a headache. I just cannot see an educated woman speaking this way.

When there is a direct threat to Sarah James reacts, but he didn't seem to worried about them being shot at the first time. All in all this is a great debut. It definately had the feeling of an older romance novel which suits me just fine! I would love to read a second installment with Lizzie, James' sister, and her story!

I finished the anthology last night and that's all I remember: misspelled words and grammatical errors on nearly every page.I see that the publishers are going to continue the series past XX, which I think is a mistake. It would have been better to let XIX stand in tribute to Marion Zimmer Bradley.

Even my husband and I can ride them with our girls in front of us (both the child and parent on the car) and it is a blast! My only complaint, if you will, is that when used the way they say to use them, by putting your feet up and moving the handlebar back and forth, they go very slowly at best. My girls ride them by pushing off with their feet on the ground, repeatedly, which is the only way to get any speed.

A conquered queen gives birth to triplets and has to send two away or be killed, but the old retainer takes the two boys, and leaves the girl. But the actual writing makes me think its aimed for 10 year old maturity level, with a genius vocabulary level.

Not only is there no mention of Fenton and Broome, the two men who actually translated 12 of the 24 books--not only are none of Broome's notes included, but there is no annotation whatever, no bibliography of recommended further reading, no criticism, not even a decent history of the translation or of Pope himself, aside from a single reductive paragraph by Theodore Alois Buckley (who edited the text and wrote the rather flowery introduction--in fact there isn't even a date for the introduction--it's Victorian but Wildside doesn't make that clear). Even the back cover is misleading, attributing a Samuel Johnson quote to the Odyssey, when it referred explicitly to the Iliad. Finally, there is no line-numbering, so this edition would be difficult to teach or reference in a paper. Not a scholarly edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free Good Translation-4 in a Half Stars","review":"I too like some of the reviewers was close to removing this free edition from my Kindle as I began to wonder when The Odyssey would begin. It starts at 8 % or location 413 on the third Kindle type size. The first 8% is a biography of Homer and a critique of Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's The Odyssey. I found the biography interesting and The Odyssey itself is a great Greek epic. A linked table of contents would have been nice and a page break between the foreword and the start of the actual work would have been appreciated. So I take off a star for that. With Kindle's bookmarking, highlighting, note adding feature, and search feature you can quickly find and go anywhere though from your Kindle menu so the point becomes moot. Then I add a half star back for it was free anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Android Kindle, useless","review":"This review addresses not Homer's work, but the packaging of this work and the delivery system. It was the first book I tried with the Android version of Kindle, and it is useless, to the extent that there is no table of contents, just 750-odd positions and a slider bar. There is an introduction that takes up just less than 10% of the total text, and there is no method to navigate to the beginning of the real text, let alone any method to navigate among chapters (or books, in this case).I have this same edition, 10% forward and all, from Gutenberg (i.e., free) with a third-party reader (Aldiko - also free), and it works just fine, or more to the point, it works as I expect: with some level of consideration and ease of use granted to the reader.

Mr. White informed me that the problems I encountered in attempting to produce a HD DVD are due to the 1920 x 1080i specification of my new JVC GZ-HD7U camcorder. He told me that they are working on a software update. As yet, I do not know if Adobe CS3 will be compatible with my camcorder's specification.

My advice is don't buy this if you want it for AVCHD. You will not like the output and since it's software you can't return it. Take a look at Sony Vegas instead. It costs about the same and you can download a trial version (30 days, fully functional)to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed with Pinnacle 11","review":"This was an upgrade from version 9 to 11.

The installation kept crashing, something was wrong and my laptop stopped accepting Windows updates the same day that this happened. I spoke to Pinnacle support (if you want to call it that) for 12 days in a row, was transferred around so many times; representatives promised to call back and they did not-I even had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to get them to call me. When they did call me they still could not fix the problem and refused to provide any kind of satisfactory resolution.Finally I returned the item for a refund but I still had to reformat my laptop to fix the problems caused by the damaged software.

I can render any format except DVD (which is why I bought the software). After multiple uninstalls and reinstalls Pinnacle's advise is to reinstall my operating system and try again.

Was on hold twice for more than 30 minutes each time. The people on the phone were very hard to understand and they knew nothing about the product, I mean absolutely nothing. I would have been better off asking my dog for help. Then I tried the live online chat help section on the website. The password they set up for me didn't work. Another 15 minute phone call to fix that, then I logged on to the chat line successfully. A guy started text-talking to me and after about 30 seconds, he paused and never came back.

I bought my second batch and followed directions as instructed, this time it adhered and I waited 24 hours before connecting the wire and trying it. Still didn't work.

The problems are extremely similar to each other (often changing resistors) and are very trite (many of the problems are the same bias point calculation over and over again). Moreover, the discussions of big ideas and \\"problem solving strategies\\" are lacking to say the best. They gloss over fundamental facts and approaches to problems. The book also uses outdated notation. In some instances, instead of using Beta for the current gain in a bipolar transistor, h_fe is used. Additionally, there are not any technologically current problems in this book. All in all, I think this book is a big waste of paper and regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly in need of an update","review":"Although there were some pretty useful chapters and problems, I mostly felt that this book is largely outdated. In particular, it barely covered CMOS devices and circuits, which, to me was a significant drawback. I agree with the other reviewer too that the nature of the problems were sometimes repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this.","review":"My old battery trinkler finally \\"died\\" after 30 years - it was the same make and model. I was very happy to find this, especially since I had great service with the old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't stay closed...","review":"I thought these see-through caps would be more useful than the standard BC flip caps, except when I got them, they were springing open on their own right out of the pack. I tried to fuss with them, and could sometimes get them to close, but didn't feel secure, and when I set the rifle down, the slightest bump popped them open again. I tried two sets for two different scopes, and all four did the same thing. The regular BC flip up caps... locked and tight. These... completely suck, so they are basically unusable. It would have actually been better if they didn't spring open at all, and you just simply flipped them up manually, but not staying closed is stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have found this product to be excellent. The price and product are right and I'll surely order again. Even my dermatologist wants to know from where I bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin","review":"I've seen this brand in hospitals so I thought it would be good for wound care. I needed the non-stick but the pad itself was very thin. I wouldn't order it again. I'd stay with a thicker pad. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Latex","review":"I bought these bandages for an aging relative who is allergic to latex. There is no warning on the box and no warning in the merchant's advertisement, however the individually wrapped bandages have a warning stating the the packaging contains latex. You don't know this until you open the box and take out one of the bandages. The merchant has suggested that I return them but if they are not defective, they will deduct the shipping charges and the Amazon fee from my refund. They are not defective, but due to the wrapping, everyone of the individually wrapped bandages are exposed to latex. I don't know if this is a significant risk, but we are not going to take the chance. My concern is more for the potential health hazard than for the money. Before ordering, we should have known that the bandages are wrapped in packages containing latex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shreds","review":"I purchased these for trach dressings for my son, they're not designed for that use and now I know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not wish this CD on my worst enemy","review":"\\"The Land Beyond the Mountains\\" drips with dread and spews wretchedness. No joy or light escape from this sonic black hole. I would not wish this CD on my worst enemy.The chief characteristics of this recording are its fetid, foul production highlighted by hideous, disturbing background noise (clearly intentional); downer, droning music; and gnarled, distorted sneers for vocals. The track called (I am in) hell sums up the listening experience precisely.Stay away from anyone who purports to like this depressing, dreadful montage. I may take a screwdriver to this CD to render it unplayable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful compilation, great sound!","review":"This 2 Cd compilation is very well made. It has some early rock an roll like and early country of this great performer and composer that was Marty Robbins.The remastering of it made it sound so fresh, just like the old turntable analog sound that I remember. It sounds as good as vinyl but without the needle sound.I recommend this to anyone who like Marty Robbins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected","review":"Marty Robbins has always been my favorite singer and I wasted a lot of years not owning this collection. It was great to hear several of these songs for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Marty review","review":"The is the perfect CD for a new or old Marty Robbins fan. It has everything that we loved about his music on 1 CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"....the 2 CD's are loaded with old, seldom-played, and to the average listener, unknown numbers! i am very disappointed and feel i wasted my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I am an OLD Glenn Yarborough fan who had actually forgotten about his mellow and wonderful voice. I hadn't listened to his songs since the days of LP's --- that should tell you how long it has been. I became a fan in college in the 60's --- went to many of his concerts --- any time he was in Colorado. This album was a wonderful experience for me. It brought back wonderful memories of listening to him sing. No one can sing a love song like Glenn Yarborough. This was a treat, as he redid some songs I had not heard him do --- and all with his own incredible style. If you like Glenn, you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Voice","review":"I was always a fan of the Limelighters. This solo album of Glenn Yarbrough is never tiresome. His Melodic voice is one you can listen toover and over again. This album is loaded with familiar standards forwhich he does great. I only wish the newer generations would discoverthis mans remarkable voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrangements all wrong","review":"I have been a big fan of Glenn's since the 60's and have every album he ever made. I always thought I could love hearing him sing the phone book; I was wrong. These are great songs but whoever did the musical arrangements really messed up. The tempo, the back up singers, the muscicians are NOT right for any of these songs. Glenn's voice is beautiful but I find it almost painful to listen to his beautiful voice singing great songs that are musically ALL wrong. What a waste of a great voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Remembered","review":"Love the voice, but the tempo of the songs was too quick for the type of songs on this album. As such, it didn't have the rich-ness or I remembered or expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was a disappointing CD. The mix of voice and backround music did not connect well. The voice was very much overpowering the music. Sounds like it was made in a low quality recording studio. There is only one of his signature songs on it. We had hopes that his style would elevate the other \\"favorite\\" songs to his technique but we found they didn't. Would rather buy complete remakes of his own songs than hear him try to remake others to his style. It just doesn't work with this one.R."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duke Finding His Stride!","review":"After \\"Reach For It\\" there was only one place to go-\\"Don't Let Go\\".It literally starts off with a bang as the loud,polyrhythmic explosion of \\"We Give Our Love\\" gets the part going.\\"Morning Sun\\" adds a Heatwave-like funky-soul pattern tothe proceedings and the P-Funk of \\"Dukey Stick\\" is,well just whatit seems.\\"Moving On\\" starts as a cute pop number and quickly delves into a muscular,sexual funk excersise.The tital cututilizies a strong latin flavor ubiquitous in Duke's work.AnEWF-ish instrumental and some pretty soul ballads fill this outwell but it's highlites make this a gripping album.If your a fanof George Duke as a funkmeister or simply want to hear a greatgenre album,stop reading and pick this up!It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book for serious physics students and teachers","review":"This is an excellent book for providing problem solving strategies and examples.This is a practical, no-frills sort of book that a serious physics student can really appreciate. The book doesn't always reflect the dry sense of humor that these Ga. Tech professors shared with their classes, but it does reflect their excellent background in physics knowledge and ability to communicate effectively with students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live at the Hungry I","review":"I have many of the songs on this CD in a LP and have been waiting to get a CD replacement since the LP is very old and noisy. I am very disappointed with the sound quality of this CD - my old LP sounds better if I can ignore the clicks and pops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance A+, Reissue F-","review":"I agree with another reviewer about the quality. Wasn't the LP also in stereo? Glenn is one of the best, and so is this performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Time Fan","review":"I have this LP and finally decided to get the CD - transferring from a too many times played LP was not practical. Anyway - if you love Glenn, this is a must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD, awesome Quality","review":"Since 1980 I had, from my mother belongings, this album on vinyl and It's good to see that the quality of the CD version could keep up with the original Vinyl. About this masterpiece is suffice to say that this album is one of the best I've listened on my whole life and I've listened it through my whole life until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ray Charles","review":"This will be the second time that I have purchased America The Beautiful without receiving it.

I am getting very pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANL fuseholder","review":"The Scosche EWFH ANL fuse holder is intended for larger fuses (presumably large currents). The plastic molding is very thin and consequently the overall construction is extremely flimsy making the fuse holder unsuitable for large currents. Due to the plastic molding being very thin the stud mounting is very weak and will be unreliable if not tightened very carefully. If any significant heat were to be generated due to large currents the molding would quickly distort or even melt.I would not recommend this fuse holder for high current applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing the 24k fuse arrived incomplete !","review":"I am very late because the fuse holder MISSING THE FUSE AND LOOK IN THE PHOTO OF THE FUSE HOLTER THE FUSE IS IN PLACE , PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP , BETTER NOW I WANT IT NOW !"},{"rating":"2","title":"fuse holder","review":"The holder is designed just right to give safety to the fuse protection and is sturdy enough and allows good visibility to the fuse conditions."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=m("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-70cde601"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/36.md","filePath":"library/36.md"}'),B={name:"library/36.md"},L=Object.assign(B,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
