However, the book has provided details of the making of James Dean and the obstacles he had to overcome to claim his glory.Overall, I do think this is a good book that doesn't over glorify his achievements and at the same time going into details of his personality and conflicts from his close friend point of view. It will be more than justified to hear it from William Bast of James Dean story since, he was practically there to witness his transformation into a mega-star.Though this book does explore on James Dean sexuality, it doesn't go into those raunchy details to make it derogatory.

There are homosexuals, and there are flamboyant gays, and Best is the latter. James Dean, who may or may not have been homosexual, was definitely not gay.

The problem is not that the material is ill-researched -- quite the contrary, it's as meticulously turned out as usual for Winter -- or uninteresting -- that's in the eye of the beholder. In all simplicity, it's that snippets and sound bites may be fine for a web site, but they don't make for a very good book.

I particularly liked the fact that this book was told from the viewpoint of a teenage female, because it showed me how I might have acted if the things in the book would have happened to me. I thought that this book was very emotional. Some parts of \\"The Survivor In Us All\\" I really felt like I was there, because of the rich writting.

Nothing moves on the entire disc, making everything feel so static and overly two-dimensional. This disc leaves many questions to be answered. For example, they show a painting of Madame Matisse and never once mentioned when the Matisses got married. They mention a series of dancing female nudes and then a picture of male musicians. They never say anything about the men being airbrushed or the obvious Japonisme influence on the piece.

If Uileann piping interests you at all, buy this CD, because it's the best. Only Davy Spillane has come close, but where Spillane uses Uileann pipes to explore different kinds of music, Keenan uses one kind of music (Irish) to explore the range of his instrument.Keenan's playing on this album has a powerfully emotional feel; there's nothing academic or technical about his sound. Uileann pipes are notoriously difficult to play, and it's a rare piper who masters the instrument so thoroughly that he can use it to express thought and feeling without effort. Keenan reached that level of mastery 30 years ago or more, when he and the Bothy Band rocked the world with a new kind of sound: traditional Irish music with the power and energy of rock'n'roll.

So, always hearing that Kona coffee is the best in the world, I really expected a great experience from this - however that wasn't the case.When I opened the bag, there was virtually no coffee aroma. I don't know if it's been sitting in a warehouse too long (expiration date on back was July 2011 - it's April 2011 as of this writing). The vacuum seal seemed okay - no tears in the packaging; so I'm at a loss to explain why the coffee seemed 'stale' . And after brewing my first pot, I gotta say it isn't a great cup of coffee. At best, it's a mediocre cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"average...KONA 100%?????","review":"If you think your going to get that awesome full flavor and aroma you bought in a coffee shop in Kona forget it.

For some reason that has since escaped me, I decided to try the Hawaii Roasters coffee. I was very much looking forward to it, especially after reading through the Amazon reviews. When I opened the HRs bag, I was not captivated by the aroma as I am with the Lion coffee. I found the coffee to be bland and tasteless. Not objectionable by any means, but not at all what I would describe as flavorful. Perhaps I got an old batch or something, but regardless, I'm going back to the Lion brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt and Stale, Not Medium Roast as Advertized","review":"These allegedly medium roast Kona beans are stale and burnt like Starbucks roasts (Starbucks roasts their coffee just to the burnt stage in order to hide the fact that their beans are rancid), not a medium roast at all.I strongly suspect that these beans are a few years old that were re-roasted, re-packaged, and sold on Amazon as fresh Kona beans.When I opened the package, it smelled more like a chimney or an ash tray than a coffee.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kona coffee","review":"I say Kona coffee is over promoted and overpriced. The taste is way short of a great coffee.I cannot bring a well-balance taste out of this coffee no matter how I brew it.

Big mistake. This is not strong, flavorful coffee, which is what I expect from 100% Kona. These beans taste like they've been sitting around in a warehouse for months, which is probably the reality. This is a waste of money, you are better off with Starbucks beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Got this coffee expecting good things as I had thoroughly enjoyed Kona blends before and wanted to \\"upgrade\\" to real Kona beans but was very disappointed in this particular product as it had almost no flavor. Just to be sure it wasn't just me I shared the beans with other coworkers who agreed it was short on taste/flavor and were surprised that it was \\"high dollar\\" Kona coffee beans. I started mixing it w/Gevalia and Starbucks to get some taste and that way it won't be a total loss. Maybe I got a bad batch or old coffee but I am not taking a chance on this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Just received this coffee as a gift - it's a great coffee, lovely flavor and something I'll buy again as soon as this runs out.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Value it Claims to be...","review":"I tried three bags of this product but have been surprised by how consistently dry the beans are in each shipment. It is the messiest bean I have ever ground. The quality of the coffee is not on par with less expensive beans purchased at the grocer. The taste is okay but it doesn't rise to the level that you should expect. Royal Kona at Wal-Mart, believe it or not, is a better product. I am really disappointed because I like the convenience of the Amazon subscription service. But, the product doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been to Hawaii several times and have had Kona coffee. This was a complete letdown. It is nowhere near what I experienced in Hawaii: the aroma, the taste, distinct flavor. This one tasted no better and perhaps a tad worse than what I purchase at Costco for a fraction of the price.

Now back on the mainland, I have been purchasing Kona blends. Having grown tired of these blends, I decided to try this coffee, based mostly on the reviews. It's not even close to classic Kona. The beans seemed dry, did not have much aroma, and it took about 50% more beans per cup to make it as strong as an average cup of coffee. There was definitely some Kona characteristics to the flavor, but barely as much as you would find in a good Kona blend. I can only guess that the bag of beans that I received had been in storage for a long time or simply not stored properly. Whatever the case, I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kona Coffee; you've got to be joking!","review":"I am a big sucker for coffee; especially Kona and I try to to taste every brand I get. Hawaii Roasters is absolutely the worst I have tasted so far (Just in case you are wondering my favorite is Koa Peaberry). This one doesn't have even the slightest characteristics of Kona Coffee. If you don't want to spend a small fortune on good coffee; just go with blended Kona. You will save some money over this brand yet still will get a better taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee but a what price","review":"I love this coffee I am just not sure it is worth the price.

The only complaint I had regarding this filter was that it didn't come in any plastic or manufacturers box, but rather just put into a shipping box when it was shipped. It wasn't used and it was obvious that it wasn't, but it still caused me to second guess for a moment which I don't care to do when I buy something new.

Less contrived than some of her later pictures, the script gives her the chance to really play a three-dimensional character. Her range of emotion is simply stunning, considering she was only six years old at the time. Although there is little of the singing and dancing Shirley was known for, this is nonetheless a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Shirley","review":"Shirley does a wonderful job in this film although there aren't really any flashy song and dance numbers-- you can see her acting talent shine through as she cries after discovering the jewels in her little teddy bear. One of Shirley's earlier films it is one of her better ones.But, sadly it was ruined by the horrible acting done by the melodramatic acting of her father and her mother in this movie. I felt rather sad for little Shirley for I felt like I was watching child abuse in every scene Shirley was with her father. Not only is her father a liar and a jewel thief but, he seems to have no connection or love for Shirley compared to her many other on screen dads (James Dunn). Really a lack of chemistry is what ruins this film.But, this film will want to make you cry so I give it only two stars- for when you see a Shirley film you really want a film with classic values and one that will make you want to sing and dance instead of persecute child abusers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid grooves - Jody at her best!","review":"Miss Jody Watley is back! This CD is probably the best one I've purchased in quite some time. These cuts have a deep, hypnotic groove that's perfect for listening or dancing. None of the cuts are overlong like a lot of dance-type CDs, and the one that is, \\"Saturday Night Experience\\" would be slighted without its eight-minute running time. \\"Whenever\\" is my favorite track on the whole CD, its funky as hell. \\"Love to Love\\" is great, and features the awesome Roy Ayers. \\"Saturday Night Experience\\" is a masterpiece - I'm not even a club kid, and I liked it.

However, please take my advice and buy this album as you won't be dissapointed.I've always been a fan of Jodys - loved the Affection and Intimacy albums, but this is a real jem. Tracks like Photographs,Clouds, Whenever, Midnight lounge and I Love to Love will either get you on your feet, or relax you gently. Even the cover version of Don't give up will surprise you as it seems Jodys vocals take a brisk walk over the melody, in the right direction.It's about time this lady got the attention she deserves and moves up the ranks, past other \\"divas\\" who are just commercially sussessful with only minimal talent. (If you've seen this lady live you will know what i mean)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from Jody!","review":"Last year, I went crazy when I saw Jody Watley's album in the stores that I got it! This still shows Jody at her finest! Very funky songs with shades of electronica throughout the album. And she actually pulls it off! It does have that moody, mellow feel on some songs. I love that title song with its reflective breaks before jumping back to its throbbing basslines and the All I Wanna Do is Just Dance chorus. Whenever and I Love To Love are also great. But Clouds has this very funky beat to it and is one of Jody's best songs. Some artists fade off after some 25 years of making songs--their quality slips a bit. Not Jody! More than two decades in the music game, she's still got it as an artist and she still looks good and sexy to this day! Her willingness to try new things is very well felt on this album, and she is superior all throughout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality and expression.","review":"Jody doesn't stay static.

I've tried many pomade styles including original pomade formulas from the 30's and have largely avoided the newer goopy mess. Yardley provides a decent hold and isn't some mess for \\"bed-head\\" modern styles. As mentioned, the scent is great but the selling point is how it smooths my hair into a refined appearance with a nice finish. With a fine-tooth comb my hair comes out looking well-groomed with a low gloss appearance visible only at a close distance, it's not the high gloss/shiny nonsense that makes most other pomades shimmer. This is in-between with a low-gloss making your hair appear well conditioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School * Timeless Quality Grooming","review":"I haven't used Yardley's Brilliantine for over 40-years.

But over all it is a good book and an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"I'm just going to be upfront and honest.He is mostly trying to promote nexxus products in this book.Nexxus products is not going to work for every women's hair.No 2 heads of hair are like what works for you won't necessarily mean it'll work for me or anyone esle.Anyways,Let's get back to the book!The information in this book I could go on the internet and get the same advice.I didn't like this book so I gave it away to the Goodwill.I won't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Mommy's Hair Helper","review":"This book by Shamboosie helped me to understand my hair and my children's hair better so that I could do a better job. My daughter's super-thick and kinky hair grew down to her butt after I began following his advice. One of the main things he suggests is Humectress conditioner by Nexxus, as a standard, or staple, product for black hair care. He also suggests that natural is best, especially in regards to avoiding applying too much heat to the hair -- this is the main thing that has helped me to do a better job with my daughter's hair than I've done with my own over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This is another good book on African American hair and the many styles that are being worn nowadays. The book is lacking in enough depth to be considered a reference book but definitely a great introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"for those looking for a novel, this would be a good choice but if you are looking at beginners's guide on managing african hair step by step, look somewhere else. this book talks about the author's experiences, advice and sometimes history. it did not impress me. i didnt see much step by step instructional guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the best","review":"I am a typical African woman living in Africa and found this book quite useful and gave me insights on how i can look after my hair i had fun reading it and know that I will be able to grow the long hair i have always seen on other heads. Who knew that Lye relaxers are the best aleays thought the No lye are the best. He has shown us the other side of the coin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading...","review":"Before purchasing this book, I had read several books, magazines, and articles on black hair care. Many of them were quite informative, however, none of them as insightful and informative as Beautiful Black Hair.This book is great because it identifies the hair problems, offers simple to understand explainations, gives step-by-step solutions, and offers product suggestions. I have had this book for almost 3 months and have followed the authors easy instructions. Like some of the other readers my hair has never been healther and grown so well. He recommends Nexxus and Dudley products, but only after trying many others. These products have worked great on my hair. Get it to read and learn for yourself, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For People with Chemically Relaxed Hair","review":"I was surfing the net for a hair care book that would help me with my hair problems. I read the reviews for Beautiful Black Hair and ordered it. My hair was dry, brittle, and thinning in spots. I read Shamboosie's book and was so impressed with the information that it provided, it was hard to put it down. I finished it in one day. I ran out and purchased the products he recommended that same night and he is absolutely correct, the right products make a world of difference. I followed the formula's he recommended and saw results after the second treatment. My hair looks and feels so much better. He knocks no-lye relaxers and that's okay because I don't use it anyway. However, I do know people with very beautiful healthy hair that does. As he points out, the key to a great head of hair is conditioner, conditioner, conditioner. Definitely one of the best hair care books on the market especially for women or men with flat cell (kinky) hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE","review":"Okay, I may be overstating it but this was one of the BEST books I've read about black hair care. I've read so many and this is the FIRST book that actually explains why we are losing our hair and what we can do to improve the health of our hair. I did the six-week plan, then I made my appointment with a beautician. What's the difference? Not only can I see a difference in the health of my own hair (no more little hairs in the sink when I comb it), I am also able to achieve almost the same result when I do my own hair. He explains how to wash, blow dry and even curl your hair. I like his simple- step by step guide to every aspect of hair care and styling. I used to admire women who could do their own hair, and I am amazed that I too am able to do my hair on those weeks I don't visit the salon. I gave this book to my sis who did the program with me as well-- and we are getting compliments on our hair wherever we go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep a notebook next to you when you watch this DVD!!!","review":"Powerful, fast moving, comprehensive, well researched, resourceful, well filmed, comfortable to the eye, I could go on and on describing this brilliant work by PBS. This feature is like a tour to various artists' studios and exhibitions without leaving your chair.

The work was boarderline awful. The only interesting artist was the glass artist, I thought his work was well done. Most of the other artists were on a par with elementary school children, young elemtary school children. One artist went to the dollar store to buy colored plastic containers to hammer onto her art. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I'm not sure what others who reviewed this DVD saw. Were we watching the same monologues? I'm very disappointed in this purchase. I was looking for innovation, creativity and technical skill among contemporary artists and perhaps some gems of wisdom they can share with the rest of us. I've taught art for thirty years, inspiring others to consider art as a career. If many of these people were my students, their \\"work\\" would have received poor critiques. Most of the artists in \\"Art: 21\\" have very distorted viewpoints and incomprehensible verbal and graphic communication skills. Many appear psychologically troubled. Few have the technical and observational skills one associates with great art. The exception is Josiah McElheny who demonstrates in clear terms a reverence for the past and a vision for the present and future. Do not waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design for toddlers","review":"Aside from the previously mentioned BPA problem and the problems with the spout not aligning properly, I don't know how a company that designs so many baby products cannot create one that is more practical for a toddler. My son drops his cup quite frequently and the valve pops out almost every time, leaving me to fish it out of whatever he's drinking. Moreover, if I don't notice the valve has fallen out, then I've got a trail of juice following my son to clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"My 10-month old son can't get a drink from this cup. Granted that maybe he needs to learn to suck on the spout instead of bite down on it, he does well with a bottle otherwise. Also, the spout does not end up centered between the handles when tightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to align spout with handles","review":"Tough to align the spout with handles. On ours, the spout was right on top of the handle. Impossible to drink from. Save your money and buy Avent or Playtex, which both have simpler designs where you CAN'T misalign the spout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains BPA","review":"The clear Gerber sippy cups (such as this one) contain BPA (the opaque \\"Sip and Smile\\" sippies are BPA free). BPA free brands include Born Free, Thermos and The First Years.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Like other reviewers said, the spout is over one handle when completely tightened, not in between handles like it should be. Gerber is a known manufacturer of baby products and I was disappointed to discover the flaw in the design of this cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed design","review":"When the lid is tightened, the spout is over one handle, not in between the handles. There is no way to adjust it so the child can actually hold the cup with two hands and drink. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valve piece falls out easily, allowing everything to free-flow out of spout","review":"When this cup is dropped or banged on the floor the valve piece falls into the cup, allowing the cup's contents to free-flow out. Very messy! The valve is just slightly too small and it doesn't take much to jar it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I use the RedBarn dog food rolls as training treats for my dogs and they just love it. It's handly to just cut up what you need for the day and then put the rest in a ziploc in the fridge. This lamb & rice flavor is great for one of my dogs who has a sensitive stomach, and he just loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Food Supplement","review":"I was too lazy to go to my local PetSmart so I decided to buy this product as an add-on to be crumbled on top of my dog's food. This product is intended to be dog food - not as a supplement on top. My 50-poumd dog would simply eat around this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Isn't Bad","review":"This is a wonderful book to use in the classroom. When teaching diversity or having group discussions or just helping students accept other students who may have behavioral issues due to personal problems, Mad Isn't Bad can be used in sections or units. I wouldn't recommend reading it all at once rather using it as a tool to teach about anger and how to deal with anger. It is surprising how children exposed to such discussions can help improve classroom dynamics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"Enough of the pop-psych! This book bores my kids. It also bores me. There's no plot, no story, nothing.So many children's books try to be self-help books that are geared for adults. Most kids don't need this and don't want this.I also disagree with the way the whole subject is handled in this book. One example, \\"it's okay to be mad at God.\\" I don't want to teach that to my kids. This is just another one of those books with a message, no plot, no in-depth characters, and so forth.I once read that books that do not stir a child's imagination are a waste of time. This book is a waste of time. My suggestion - try to avoid all the self-help/pop pscyh trends, and go for the REAL books, books with a good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this disc","review":"I love smooth jazz and while there are a couple of slick instrumental jazz tracks, the rest is junk to me.

It has such a good beat to it . I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alienation and awakenings","review":"This short but powerful novel by Giorgio Bassani is less well known than his most famous work, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis. However, it deals with similar themes of alienation and the awakening into adulthood. At one level, this is a story of an adolescent Jewish boy surviving in the Catholic world of Ferrara in the 1930s. Although academically successful at school, he is set, and indeed places himself, apart from his peers. At another level, it is a story of sexual awakenings and sexual uncertainty. Perhaps above all it is about friendship, the betrayal of trust and entry into the adult world. Beautifully drawn by Bassani, and crisply translated by Weaver, like Moravia's 'Two Adolescents', this is a world too rarely visited with empathy and sensitivity. Well worth reading. It will bring back memories. It will make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little-Known Gem","review":"Another brilliant and insightful book that makes you wonder: Why isn't it better known? The book is fascinating on so many levels, not least because of its insights into Jewish ways of thinking. While not in any way anti-Semitic (or, better, self-hating -- Bassani was Jewish), it reveals truths that may make some Jewish readers (like me) slightly uncomfortable.Most interesting for a 21st century American, however, is the education and mindset of mid-twentieth-century Italian teenagers of the upper middle class. Perhaps Bassani's portrayal is atypical, but they have a depth of knowledge and a sophistication about philosophy that can only make you despair: our own age seems so light and frivolous in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys are VERY romantic","review":"As a working class boy, I related to the life of Nick Romano in KNOCK ON ANY DOOR. Which is not to say that identifying with characters is ESSENTIAL to enjoying a novel. It is enough to empathise. Having said that, BEHIND THE DOOR captures the quality of intense feelings common to adolescent boys regardless of class - especially loyalty of friends and a powerful idealism tinged with a sense of justice. Boys know everything at 17 and few understand them, so they tend to believe, and fall in love quickly with adults, or peers of either sex. A beguiling novel rather than a rivetting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"please read this book","review":"Divine Days is as beautifully written as it is challenging. It is massive, complex, and wonderful. Leon Forrest is truly one of the great writers of the 20th century. History may look back and place Forrest in the Canon along with the likes of Ellison, Faulkner, and Morrison. On the other hand, the book may continue to be overlooked. Either way, do yourself a favor and read this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Math","review":"A very well written approach to illustrating the practical aspects of not just mathematics, but the various components of math, i.e. fractions, decimals, algebra and geometry.

Although I do not support this war, I do support our soldiers and Guardsmen who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. This movie shows an honest portrait, in bite size chapters, of the Guardsmen from the start of their deployment, through a year of anxious vigilance, violent battles, camaraderie and boredom, and the return home. It was moving and hard to take at times but all Americans should be watching movies like this. We owe it to the men and women who are fighting in our names, to be informed about what they are facing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This video has minimal footage of actual conflict. Most of the video is soldiers talking about situations such as the danger of I.E.D's. There is no real back and fighting except for a short story in the begining with mostly talking of what happened. I was expecting to be engrossed in a documentary about the war in Iraq but found myself waiting for any excitement to begin and it never did. I'm not taking away from what these National Gaurdsmen did over there as soldier's , their probably all really good soldiers , they just lack in film making is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Being a long standing fan of James Last and owning most of his Music DVDs.I found this DVD a very big disappointment! There is only 60 minutes of music on the disc which made up of the orchestra (unseen) playing 5 tracks (11Min) as background music to a documentry travelogue of James arriving back in Germany!! You then receive the next 8 tracks as the live Street concert with a duration of 36 mins, unbelievable!!?? The last track the \\"Sabre Dance\\" is played during the final credits orchestra not seen! The disc has a Bonus section?? which is made up of three numbers by the orchestra playing in a studio these three songs have a playing time of just over 9 minutes.Considering the cost of this DVD I personally believe it is a ripp off.The Warner Music Group of Germany should hold their heads in shame for releasing such a poor quality James Last dvd.Mal Scott Darwin Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Cute","review":"I love the stationary. It comes with cute stickers (including the snitch and Norbert and the Hogwarts insignia), a lightening bolt stamp, an address book, etc. It's all great except for one little thing, the paper does not fit in the envelope! I tried to send a letter and I had to trim the edges which was a waste of time. That's the only reason why it got 4 stars. My suggestion, is use the paper for notes or other things and use the envelopes for things that will actually fit inside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disappointing","review":"I wish that I'd read a few reviews before buying this item. Maybe I would have saved myself some grief and money.The packaging was good on this box and it caught my eye directly but the contents were not at all as described in the write up on the back.The stickers were thin and cheap. The paper also, was very thin and too short for any practicle letter writing. Most disappointing however, was the lightning bolt stamp. It was more a broken line than anything else. It's too small and faint to use and plainly speaking is quite a joke.I love Harry Potter and have bought a lot of excellent items, but this was definitely not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Way to Keep a Journal of What You've Read","review":"I've been keeping a reading journal since 1970 and have used a variety of readingjournals. This is one of my favorites. It is divided by the alphabet with a sectionfor each letter. You can arrange your entries alphabetically by book titles or byauthors' names. There is also an intricate drawing for each letter that takes upone whole page.At the end of the book there is a short section for books borrowed and miscellan-eous. There is also an envelope/pouch at the end of the book where you canstore clippings or articles. I wish this journal was still in print as I'd buy anotherone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Published in 1995 before he became the Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu begins this book with a most rational and considered perspective, but by mid-way the discussion degenerates into historically \\"enemy\\" bashing.

It wasn't the same size as the original part I was replacing (too small), but my mechanic made it fit using an extra large bolt.Then, after about a month, it started rusting. My mechanic assured me that was normal enough, even though the original part wasn't rusted when it broke (after 10 years of service).Today, less than a year later, the weld that holds the upper attachment to the muffler strap (visible in the product picture) just broke. So now I have to choose between waiting for my mechanic to find a reputable part, or fast-order this questionable one from Amazon and hope it lasts longer.I suggest you use this item as a last resort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality.","review":"Product arrived on time, but it was the wrong shape, triangle instead of oval. Had to work the metal into shape to make it usable, but even then, the bolt it came with was too short (or the metal strap was too short). Using a longer bolt, this product did eventually do the job. Wish I'd paid more for a part that worked right out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best aging issues books ever written!","review":"Gillick is one of the most competent experts on aging related issues.

Very disapointed with the fitment. The color is close, but the curvature is COMPLETELY wrong. I ended up attaching it to the upper A/C surround with two very small screws to force the piece to have the correct curve. Before i did that, it would not even snap in place. I thought scosche was a good brand....but not when it comes to aftermarket radio bezels aparently. Only plus side is it does look a *little* more factory than the rough black plastic we did have - thats the only reason i didnt return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The price of freedom","review":"Jamaica Kincaid has wonderfully portrayed the life of a young woman from the Caribbean who, in search of freedom, migrates to the U.S. Freedom comes with a price, though, and Lucy is paying it, as she fails to find the peace she hoped she would have gained."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most annoying books ever!","review":"This is one of the most annoying books I have ever read. I had to read it for class, otherwise I wouldn't finish it - that's how sick it made me. The title character has the worst attitude possible. Guess what: many people come from third-world countries and dysfunctional families, and most of them turn out ok. But Lucy can't bring herself to be happy (although, objectively speaking, her life during the year described is far from awful). Furthermore, she is mad at those who can be happy (\\"How do people come to be this way?\\") It seems, she thinks the world owes her something, and that justifies her being angry. It seems, she believes defiance to be a great virtue. If you are that kind of person, you will love that book. But - for your sake and mine - I hope you are not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to marry a millionaire","review":"Formula for getting a novel published when you have absolutely no ability: marry the son of a famous magazine editor.

It had no plot line or a conflict. It also talked way too much about Lucy having sex with random guys or looking at mens hands to decide if they had a large [male organ] or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aloof, distancing, dispassionate - and mesmerizing","review":"The cadence of the speech patterns of the Caribbean comes through in Kincaid's writing. There is a lilting quality to the way she puts words together that lets you know exactly how she wants the lines to be read. It's easy to add the Carib accent, as well.Lucy is a bright young girl come from The Islands to work as au pair for a wealthy couple with 4 daughters. As Lucy matures and rises from her past to carve out her own definition of herself in this strange new world, the marriage between the parents of the little girls unravels.At the core of this book by Kincaid (and from others of her's I've read thus far)is the ambiguous love/hate relationship she has with her powerful mother.Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opinion","review":"I read a translation and it was so good that I decided that I had to read the novel on it's original language. To me it is a really good book. I totally Recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not really good eithier...","review":"This was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. It was an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy soundtrack to the movie","review":"I bought this soundtrack CD right after I watched the movie on DVD.

They are very dull and kickback when you try to cut into raw chicken. Don't bother with these. They are a piece of junk. I don't use them at all. In fact, they cut some paper but even that is a stretch. If they were designed to cut only cooked rib meat, then that's all it will do. Use a knife instead.

It is a simpler more sanitary way to cut up thick meat and bone. Kitchen shears aren't great for cutting bone as they tend to squeeze it out the front of the scissor blades. These have curved blades and a nickle sized round notch near the pivot hold the bone while it's being cut.These are not made for cutting thin stuff like chicken skin and boneless breasts - use regular kitchen shears for the light stuff. These are heavy duty barbeque shears for cooks who prepare a lot of game that is cooked in whole or mostly whole form (Ribs, Chickens, Pigs, Lamb, etc).I never had these rust on me as they are always covered with grease until washed.As for meat cleavers they are a mess.

While those works are memorable on their own, none are so memorable as this collection of Zahn's early short stories. Having first read these stories when I was still in elementary school, they stuck with me until this past year, when I was compelled to seek them out in print once more. Upon rereading them, I found them to be every bit the moving and powerful tales that my far younger self remembered. From the title story \\"Cascade Point,\\" in which traveling faster-than-light allows one to see images of alternate realities, to post-apocalyptic Canada, Mr. Zahn's characters and stories do not disappoint, and as good science fiction should, prompt a bit of philosophical thought now and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good werewolf book","review":"Love the movie. And I enjoyed the book. They are very different. Karyn and her husband ending up moving to a town full of werewolves. It is not necessarily a Colony like in the movie.

It is a short read, but does end abruptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ride","review":"I've never read the trilogy before - nor watched the movie- so I'm new to the book/series.I found The Howling exciting. I devoured the first book in one sitting. The book is the speed of a rollercoaster; building up the moment, plateauing, and then picking up speed again.I had already guessed what was happening before it was revealed, which did slightly lose some appeal for me, but I'm jaded by having read hundreds of books -so it's hardly the author's fault. My guessing correctly, doesn't take away the fact that the werewolves around Drago were a fun pack to read about. It's definitely worth checking out, if you haven't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allright....","review":"This book was good but wasn't great. There weren't too many frightening scenes, really. When you get down to it, the beginning rape scene is more shocking than anything else. This book also has a few explicit depictions of sex whichh makes the reader wonder whether or not this is a porno that claims to be horror. If you like this type of stuff, than make a decision. If you're looking for horror prepared to be disappointed. The funny thing is that you want to read it all the way through no matter what. Not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a nice scanner!","review":"I bought this model of scanner new some years ago and have really liked it.

Somewhere between 70-90% of the DVDs that I have attempted to burn have turned into coasters. The worst is when you spend 3 hours filling a disc with stuff only for the unit to freeze up. At this point, the only way to get the AD-8091 to respond is to unplug the unit. After plugging it back in, the DVD+R disk is fried and not recognized by the unit, so the unit locks up again. Then you have to use another DVD+R disk. Then you may have a 50/50 chance of recording and burning a full disk without the system crashing on you.

It doesn't always record as scheduled; the machine sometimes doesn't turn itself on to do a scheduled recording. If you have weekly recordings for the same day, only the first one will be recorded. If you set the machine to record once a week at, say, 8pm it will turn itself on everyday at 8pm. If you try to play a blank DVD, the machine will freeze. The clock is faster by one minute each month. In its first year, the tuner stopped working. I got a new unit with the manufacturer's warranty. A year later it froze every time I tried to record. Needless to say, that's game over.

The only option was to unplug the unit then plug it back in.

One error: the box isn't tall enough to keep the packaging from scratching on the roof of the car. For that matter, discriminating collectors will be disappointed that the plastic see-through portion of the package seems unusually scratch-prone.At this price, I still call it a buy, but it takes a while to get over the scratches (or repair them) if you wind up with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very negative look at motherhood","review":"As a twenty-something considering motherhood, I thought this book would encourage and support. Instead it made me terrified to ever have a child! The testimonials from real life moms were terrible! They all sounded selfish and spoiled by complaining that a baby took up too much of their time. Every person has negative stories to share about an experience, but this author did not seem to dig too hard to show positives, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Prepares Mothers for the Worst","review":"Each chapter in this book begins with an \\"Ideal\\" and a corresponding \\"Fact.\\" They then go on to shed stark reality on the Ideal, dealing with issues like colick, marital problems, the contridictory social messages about career vs family, the threat of poor daycare, etc. They have worst-case scenario stories from women who have experienced the \\"fact\\" part of the equation.

Anyway in Henry's book he mentions that he sees his father Charles as the most consistent and rational personality which is exactly my impression too.I found this book to be slow and yet strangely very compelling. Many entries are just one or two lines. And yet I was interested and then intrigued and couldn't put it down. There is something very appealing about him, a consistency and common sense that is not so common actually.

It's a great looking little guitar, and the little amp (which I first laughed at) takes a 9V battery or a DC adapter which is not supplied. The amp has a belt clip so you can play and walk around and play at the same time. The reason I rated this so low is because it stopped working after the first 20 minutes.

Miss Abernathy takes the novice (or even the more advanced) submissive through each step of training--from figuring out what kind of slave you want to be, to the details of acting as an escort, butler, lady's maid, or sex slave. Throughout the book, she emphasizes that 24-7 slavehood is a vocation, not just a sexy hobby (although it can be that, too).Miss Abernathy will give you everything you need to become an outstanding erotic slave--except, of course, a willing dominant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic workbook is a helpful read","review":"I finally got my hands on a copy of this book.

He had some chinks in his armor which made him more interesting. I would like to have seen one tiny redeeming quality in the main warrior bad guy though. Even just a slight hesitation when he's about to do something really nasty-a hint of regret-would help me believe a little bit more in his character.

Although the bulk of the book is a good story, the ending (last chapter or two) are ridiculous - multiple plot reverses, character revelations out of the blue, lengthy explanations bringing in all kinds of new information, hackneyed dialog, and on and on. The finaly 30 pages contained a lot of the frenzy of the final scene of the play/movie \\"Clue\\" but it wasn't meant to be funny or satire, and definitely wasn't clever.I got the idea that Deaver wrote himself into a corner and also ran out of time to finish the book.I'll give it two stars for the mainly interesting plot and story, up to a point.Try other Deaver books.

Unfortunately, it's not as easy to recommend as much of the other stuff Ground Fault has released in this vein.Clocking in at only twenty-eight minutes and change, Portrait d'un Glacier is exceptionally minimal, even for a Ground Fault Series I release; every once in a while, something audible pops up, but for the most part you have to have your system all the way cranked. (So when something loud DOES pop up you're scared out of your seat). And what's here isn't terribly interesting; there is very little in the way of sonic drift.

My favorite song is A Matter of Honor, one of the best tough and raunchy rock songs I have heard in a long time. Hit to my Heart is also a powerhouse rocker, kind of a mix between The Pretenders and Veruca Salt. Frontline is a great cool psychedelic rock song with a great middle jam (over 10 minutes). Head in the Sand and Answer to Love are both great moody songs that sound especially good in headphones. All of the Good Ones are Taken is actually an Ian Hunter song (one of his best). Shameless Walls is an actual protest song.

I used the included sand paper to smooth the area around the hole, and then I covered it with a thin layer of rubber cement.

Gray still changes a bit too much for this purist's taste. (I don't understand why any playwrite wouldn't simply trust the author when adapting a book, especially a book as established as The Hobbit.) It IS the authorized adaptation, but then it was written at a time when Tolkien was worried about unauthorized copies of his work, so I can imagine him signing off on anything that came close, just to be sure his rights were being protected.

This product provided me no relief whatsoever. Although it had the traditional wedge shape and an adequate cover, the foam inside the cover was like sponge cake. It immediately sank under my weight and compressed completely. At least it rebounded nicely when I stood up.

Over the course of about 2 months, the cushion gets even flatter so that what little support it had in the first place (which was actually acceptable to me as I didn't need a lot of cushioning) is now almost non-existent.My 6\\", 185lb boyfriend tried it and he said he flattened down to nothing.I've since purchased the Tush Cush, which is more expensive, but is way firmer.

If you already have \\"Everytime We Touch\\", then save yourself some time and money. Listen to the song 14 times and you'll have the album. Every song sounds exactly the same; it's as if they mixed one beat and she made up a bunch of different lyrics to go with it. It actually hurt to listen each next song. The covers aren't even worth it. I couldn't agree more with a previous review stating that this is the last thing the dance genre needs. Most people complain they can't stand the genre because it all sounds alike. Well, this is the kind of crap that gives it a bad name.

I'm a big fan of electronica (dance,house,trance,etc.) and I must say, this album is a huge step backwards.

So the CD is mostly good with songs such as \\"Everytime we touch\\", \\"Bad Boy\\", \\"How do you do\\", \\"Miracle\\", and \\"Neverending Dream\\". But there are definatly some slow ones,\\"Another You\\", \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\", and the candle light remix, which I didn't particularly enjoy.

I don't need some whiney brat lecturing me on war or the Rain forest every other song 'Cough' Coldplay 'Cough'. That said, I still can't say that I recommend this particular album.Like most people (At least in North America) I bought this CD solely on the strength of the impossible not to like title track 'Every time we touch'. If you really like that song, good news! The rest of the album is basically 'Every time we touch' recycled but none nearly as good as the original. It also contains remakes of songs that probably shouldn't have been recorded the first time around... 'Truly, madly, deeply' & 'Kids in America'... The last one is particularly odd since Cascada is European (Sneaky, tricky little Cascada!)All in all it's a little like stale cotton candy...

Go out and buy it you'll love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"75 used CD's?..","review":"Wow, that must mean something. Good thing I downloaded this album. I'd like to start off with the hit \\"Everytime We Touch\\". It's gotten old, but I didn't like it that much anyway. The synthesizers after the choruses follow the melody line almost exactly. I think maybe there would be a better remix other than the Candlelight one (that, on the other hand..is quite pretty). The remakes, especially \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" should have been left alone. \\"How do you Do!\\" was quite catchy. And I did enjoy \\"Miracle.\\" Other songs were made for me to push the skip button on my CD player. This is NOT techno, it's more of a vocal trance/dance album. This album was okay at best, definitely not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun dance numbers and a few ballads in between","review":"I liked Cascada's first album! It's more than Everytime We Touch, as the album has such strong high energy dance numbers like Bad Boy, my favorite, Kids in America and others. She slows it down on a few ballads. I like her remake of Truly, Madly, Deeply more than the somewhat dull original by Savage Garden that adult contemporary stations and stores love to play. Sometimes, her singing on the ballads screams Kelly Clarkson's more tender vocal approach. But the dance numbers move so fast that you really have to keep up--crunching, beat heavy,rhythmic 3-minute numbers of Euro dance music that they recorded in France! This is good escapism music to get you up and dancing, very uniquely and creatively done! Cascada adds her own touches to the songs to keep them from becoming repetitive, such as some sexy talk and come-ons a la Madonna. She's that good a singer too over the aggressive numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same Sound the Whole Time!","review":"Ok first off, when you listen to \\"Everytime We Touch\\" you're done because the rest of the cd is EXACTLY the same.

It's very annoying to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The vocals sound like they've been fiddled with to the extremes, and they probably have to. Her singing voice sounds like it comes out of a bad radio, and the music is so electronic and thrashy that it sounds like junk.With the the exception of \\"Kids in America\\" and the slow version of \\"Everytime we Touch\\" the tunes of all the songs are the excact same, which makes the \\"music\\" extremely annoying.Maybe she does have a good singing voice, but I'll never know, since she certainly doesn't use it. \\"Bad Boy\\" is an especially atrocious song.Just looking at the cover infuriates me, since she wears to much on her eyes, and not enough on her body. Not only is her music bad, she's a bad influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst song recorded in the last 15 years","review":"\\"Everytime we touch\\" while a cover song from 1992, comes across to me as a spoof of early 90's techno it's so bad.

I recieved it within days and immediately downloaded it to my computer and my MP3 player. Now it's the most listened to tracks on both! The upbeat sounds are perfect for working out or cleaning house. I live in a mountain community near a lake. When I'm listening to Cascada, I can walk the 3 mile lap around the lake in nothing flat.

William decided to sail with the crew, and the trip was on!Throughout the book, William and the other sailors on the 290 are sailing about the sea, and taking over different countries ships. During the time out at sea, William discovers that since he had left home many years ago, his father had been working as a slave trader in Port-au-Prince. He deceived the men there into thinking he had spoken with his father's partner and stowed away 250 slaves on his ship. He then left them in the Canary Islands so that they could live a happy life without being given orders.

Along with the other list of pluses and pros, these are *very* filling. The con happens to be the taste - very little banana flavor at all. Mostly a sort of bland, vague flavor that I would have to label as \\"fiber\\" since it did not taste all that much like anything.Baker's Breakfast Cookies tend to get high marks and I would definitely try a different flavor if these weren't so expensive, but unfortunately this flavor (or lack of it) has me a little reluctant to invest another morning or dollar in this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent and well written book on Rural Poverty","review":"I found the book to be very informative and uself.

Chappell's narration veers from straightforward fiction to fantasy, telling of the gusto and humor with which Joe Robert meets life. I found myself laughing out loud and slapping my knee at some of the passages, while being touched deeply by the novel's underlying theme of belonging to a family, a place, and a tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical, funny book to read aloud with someone you love.","review":"Easily the best novel I've read in five years, I've read I Am One of You Forever over and over and over again.

I never understood why they couldnt make the turn to more popularity. At the time they had what it took maybe they just didnt have enough pop sensibilities to write a hit.

Thanks for gut wrenching ballads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwaway Mid-80s Mainstream Metal","review":"Despite having two top shredders and a great vocalist in their ranks and being championed by the Metal God himself (Dio), this band had actually very little going for it. You won't get more than pretty generic mid 80's mainstream metal rockers and schmaltzy ballads in this collection: the kind of music tons of bands were doing at the time, but with better songs and much more charm. A tell-tale sign of Rough Cutt's ultimate lack of appeal and how dated their music sounds is the fact that the best song here is a Janis Joplin cover. If you're a serious 80s metal collector, this CD might be a good deal, otherwise, pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough Cutt and Rough Cutt Wants You","review":"Incredible find. An A+ for those who want to have a nostalgic taste of what metal should sound like in an original sense. The production is top notch and the musicianship is superb.

The track Black Widow rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, not recommended especially the beginner","review":"This was the first reference book I purchased when I began collecting depression glass. Although there are color photos, few patterns are represented. The patterns of manufacturers are line listed at the end of the depression glass section but quite a few of the patterns are not represented in the detail (the most important) section of the book. Representation of the patterns detailed are in a very poor quality black and white, making it difficult to match a piece of glassware with the pattern. Although Kovel seems to be a well respected authority in a number of collectible arenas, I saw no sign of expertise in this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone especially beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocas imágenes del Maestro","review":"Esta producción es muy buena desde el punto de vista testimonial, pero se torna en ocasiones monótona, pues es sobreabundante en este aspecto; sin embargo, en ella escasean las imágenes del gran director de la Berliner Philharmoniker.

Annoying!","review":"I love hosting dinner parties serving foods from around the world. I search far and wide for decorations, entertainment, and music to go with my meals that are native to the cultures. This could be such a neat series. It could have a couple recipes inside and a picture of people in native costume. Instead is such a waste of money and very disappointing, with none of those things. What's more, every single song on every single CD uses the same 4/4 beats and just repeats those notes over and over and over and over again throughout the song until you are subconsiously angonizing for the song to be over already. Then mercifully, before you go insane, the next song comes on (or you press the skip button and move it on) and while it is different from the one before it, has the same repetitive thing going on until you are bloody ready to smash the CD player with a baseball bat and call it good. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More fiction than fact","review":"The author has some opinions and does not conseal it. Although author makes a few valid points, overall the information is inaccurate, very dated, mostly based on stereotypes. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book has a negative stance towards Western men/Japanese women relationships and idolizes Japanese men/Western women relationships. Considering that most marriages between Japanese men/Western women end in divorce, this is certainly not based on fact. The reality is that Japanese men/Western women marriages have over double the divorce rate of Western men/Japanese women marriages. The author should have done more research in writting this book rather than basing on her personal opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant and Helpful","review":"As someone who has dating experience from when I was living in Japan, I think this book is wonderful. It was very relevant and the author's conclusions were logical and well-balanced. There is a whole lot more that could be said about the issue but I think this book represents the views that are nearly impossible to come by without hard-earned experience and are definitely under-represented but very important. The reality of the situation, its sort of a story of what really happens \\"after the honeymoon\\" in such relationships, in my opinion. It gives great scope to positive, negative and mixed experiences from international couples of varying cultural acclimation. A great read.

If you have no experience in this area, skip this book. It is not for beginners and although comprehensive, its brevity will leave some people frustrated and wanting more detail. If you already have an understanding of zones and tones and what is essential in good photography, then you will love this book. It's perfect for those of us who started in film and want to play with the digital opportunities.

Second, despite showing ball detent power bits in the illustration, none of the extensions/adapters/wrenches actually engage the detent (usable but very wiggly).

Several component parts had actually spilled out of the case and were loose in the external packaging.

I have been looking for more about the Montgomary's to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and insulting","review":"Well, I can only think that I finished the entire book because I kept expecting it would somehow get better. It didn't. This really isn't a romance novel, it's a caricature of a romance novel. The basic premise could have been interesting, but the characters are so thinly drawn, I found it difficult to form any attachment to any of them until the end of the book when a few details got fleshed out. And as a plus size woman, I was insulted that the plump but pretty heroine was put under a spell that enabled her to eat whatever she wanted and still lose weight. What was the point of that? The hero had already fallen in love with her with the extra pounds. In fact, after she lost weight, he told her he missed the rest of her, so why make her skinny? Just so the other women in the book would be jealous? Don't waste your money buying this book. There are plenty of better romance novels to spend your time with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One book that will never leave my collection","review":"The first romance that I ever read was Mountian Laurel by Jude and since then I have read almost all of her books. Wishes is a book that I have read at least a dozen times and I love it even more each time I read it. Jude ventures into uncharted waters with a heroine who is less that perfect(physicaly) and shows us that beauty is eye of the beholder."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best!!!!","review":"I have read this book over and over and over again, I can't get enough of it. Jude you have outdone yourself this time. Please don't ever quit!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!! One of my absolute favorites!","review":"Wishes was one of my first books I ever read by Jude, and since then I have read her entire collection. This was the book that got me hooked. Jude discriptiveness when she writes is a classic. None compare! This book is my favorite because of the great Montgomery's and the charming Nellie! Read this and you will be asking for more of Jude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cinderella Story","review":"I have read the majority of Jude's books and this one is by far one of my favorites. It make you feel good inside when the ugly duckling triumphs by the end. This is one you reread when you are feeling low."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best!","review":"I have read and re-read this book so often that its falling apart and I still enjoy it everytime!! What sets Jude Deveraux apart form other romance autors is that she can bring the story to life for the reader and that, is the work of a truly gifted person."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!!!","review":"I love this book. Coz' you should never look a book from its cover, right?? Beauty on the outside doesn't promise anything... I think people should read the story....Great job, Jude!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work by Ms. Deveraux!!!!!","review":"This was the first book that I read by Jude Deveraux. Because I loved this book so much I began to buy other works by her despite my strong dislike for romance novels. Over the years she has become one of my favorite novelists. I love the outlandish themes in her books like Forever, The Summerhouse and The Mulberry Tree! Her writing style is great! The characters in Wishes were honest, tender and most of all loveable. This book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful tale in the Montgomery saga.","review":"Nellie Grayson was her family's slave, so belittled that she turned to food for comfort. Jace Montgomery, finally recovering from his wife's death in childbirth, has come to town to visit cousin Kane Taggert and his wife, Houston. Jace is immediately taken by Nellie, seeing a beautiful woman, not a fat, frumpy old maid. He must fight Nellie's loyalty to her family and their machinations to keep Nellie at their beck and call. Complicating the matter is a deceased woman's gift of three wishes to Nellie in an attempt to win her way into heaven.Although the \\"fairy godmother\\" seemed out of place in the beginning, her importance to the story soon makes sense. A visit with the Montgomerys and their extended family is always a pleasure, but to have a plus-size heroine who is admired by the hero is wonderful. Having her lose weight seemed silly and wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kitchen- between heaven and hell","review":"I loved this book above all of Jude\\"s books because her wonderful sense of humor is most evident in these pages. I laughed out loud! It would seem that when a woman is neither very bad or very good she dies and goes to the kitchen, which all women know is between heaven and hell. Funny. The story itself is a Cinderella type theme, the \\"fairy god-mother\\" is a rather jaded, crafty, old society girl, which is a delightful twist and by trying to help truley good girl (the Cinderella), she learns alot herself. Read this, and then read Jude's other works, all but two of which, I adore! Hurry Jude! We need more like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The TYPICAL ROMANCE","review":"yes its true this book is much , infact very much like a fairy tale, but that doesnt means its not real infact i think its very near to being real !for once the hero doesnt fall in love with the heroines body first ! i admit at times like when Berni said that \\"hope Nelli loses weight \\" & no matter how much she eats she loses , that was a bit unreal , but all in all the message which i think was that no matter one's body size its the heart which really counts was clearly dilevered.I think Jace & Nelli made quiet a cute couple"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one of her best","review":"I loved this book for the sheer fact tat the heroine was not a tiny thing that turned heads whereever she went she turned hearts . Nelie was a wonderful character she was always thinking of other people. I liked the fact that Jace was not one of those men who think size six is size perfect he had something that all the other men I've read about didn't have he wasn't about looks. I liked his name a lot Jocelyn It is better than Jace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Diversion","review":"I read this book several years ago and regret selling my copy. I am very pleased to have found it here and plan to keep it in my collection this time. I was very surprised by the negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting heroine","review":"I actually bought this book and wished I had not. I found the heroine to be disgusting. I made it through two chapters and she had already shoved nine pieces of chocolate candy into her mouth at once. That image totally turned me off. I get tired of all of the perfect, size 1 heroines, but this was going too far the other way. I have not read anymore and doubt that I will. Not all overweight women eat like that and starting a stereotype of them this way is disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-digested Oatmeal","review":"This is just a dumb book. It's jammed with the stereotypes that you expect in novels written by lesser authors, makes the relationship between the two main characters into nothing but a soap opera, and the characters are all so predictable in their actions and responses that I just finished the book to see if my prediction for the ending came true (it did). There's no depth to the relationships, no magic in the romance aspects, no character development, and the whole angle of the \\"fairy godmother\\" makes the story read like a cheesy made-for-children morality tale in a church library. Hopefully few people will read this book first to try out Jude Devereaux's writing or her popularity will drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"For silver jewelry","review":"I bought this to store with all my sterling jewelry - so far, it seems to be working as I have not had to clean any of the jewelry yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Love These Strips","review":"These strips really work to keep tarnish away.

Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Strips For A Longer Shine!","review":"I've been using these strips for about a month now for my silver jewelry and they really do the trick! I haven't had to polish the pieces before I wear them. I've stored them in zip-lock bags with a strip inside and it seems to work well.

Oh well.

Maybe that's not the right word; it left me feeling unfulfilled.I can appreciate the effort put into it, I really can, but the end product just didn't do much for me.I'll admit, there's more artistic merit to it than to something like Entrails of a Virgin or Evil Dead Trap, but that's not saying much.And, really, is violence that loud? I'm sure the sounds of mutilation were amplified to make people feel uneasy, but I simply thought the whole idea was, for lack of a better word, goofy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grill brush!","review":"Bought this for use cleaning our Weber grill. My husband is a serious griller and loves to barbecue as well.

Time will tell how well it stands up but so far it is doing a \\"grate\\" job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"As a young man, I read this book at the library in the mid-90s when it first came out. Ice-T's music wasn't my thing at the time, so I didn't have a fan's perspective. But he made a major impression on me with The Ice Opinion. Here was an adult who wasn't full of it, who called it like he saw it, and had some important insights into major flaws in our society's policy and values.Today, it's every bit as powerful. Ice makes a lot of plain sense when he talks about romantic relationships, crime, racism, the prison system, religion, and more. This book is more than just an entertainer's opinion, despite the self-effacing title. Our high schools should make the Ice Opinion and the Autobiography of Malcolm X mandatory reading prior to getting a diploma, because they both put the American 20th Century into proper perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice-T is Amazing","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that Ice-T is now an author.

Poor craftsmanship and lots of wood putty. The excellent photographs only prove the point. The caption under the photo for tight finger joints should read \\"fill gaps with more putty.\\" The poor orientation of wood grain, the cheap plywood, the missing measurements, it all was sad to see. The photos of the staining and finishing show very sloppy work. Even the upholstery work is a shame. I agree with the earlier review that suggests this book is for 7th-8th grade wood shop. If you have any woodworking skills and take pride in your craftsmanship, don't waste your money on this book like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOOK SHOULD BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN","review":"This book is a total waste of time and money. the title says \\"coffins\\" but it only offers one coffin to build (badly). For an alleged technical manual there are many, many things in the book that are just WRONG. The author invites you to rip a piece of plywood that is longer than the standard plywood length. The craftsmanship is horrendous with proudly displayed mitered joints that don't meet. I have the feeling that the guy who gave this book 5 stars is either related to the author or I can picture him trying to turn on his table saw through his straight jacket.

It's worked pretty good. The dust bin was easy to remove and clean, as were all the filters.I was a little annoyed the belts were more difficult to find than most other vacuums out there. I was finally able to find them at Sears.What I really did not like about this product was when it caught on fire, last night.After the smoke cleared, and it was cool enough to touch, I took the cannister off. There is an electrical plug between the cannister and the carpet beater. This was melted and blackened. I'm not sure if it was a design flaw or a bad part. I'm sure the problem wasn't because of over-use of the plug.

I don't know if the company is unaware or simply doesn't care. This vacuum was great for about 2 years and I used it a lot. I didn't have any problems with it losing suction from dirty filters as some people mentioned, but it did short out as many folks have mentioned. I kept noticing a hot smell the last couple of times I used it, and finally started seeing smoke. As other reviewers mentioned, on the bottom of the canister where the canister plugs into the upright handled, the rubber/plastic material around the prongs was completely melted and the metal had turned black.This would have been a great vacuum, but the fact that the company hasn't done anything about this problem and how dangerous it could be would prevent me from every buying another Bissell or recommending them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"I have barely had this vacuum for a year and, when it was new it worked fine, not great, fine. We received this as a house-warming gift from our parents when we moved into our new home. I don't think they banked on it almost burning the house down.As this vacuum gets dirty it doesn't work at all, you have to keep replacing HEPA filters, and washing the other ones for it to work. Now one might say what's wrong with cleaning the filters as it gets dirty? Well, I don't know about you, but I don't feel like cleaning filters every time I vacuum my 1500 sq. ft. home. That's not convenient for a vacuum that touts itself as a bag-less low maintenance appliance. This thing is a piece of crap, stay away from it.

I used it on area rugs in my apartment and I was amazed how much hair and dirt it sucked out of those rugs.

I was attracted to the lift off part of this vacuum due to the many stairs i have.THis machine is very heavy and clumsy - the tools that come with this cleaner as not great the brush for the stairs broke after 3 months and the crevic tool is marginal.The worst thing about this machine is that you have to constantly clean and wash the filters or it does not suck. I spend more time cleaning the dirt cup than i wish to. If you dont dirt gets suck in the uppper chamber of the vac.DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE. I spent over $230 for it and it was money poorly spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!!","review":"I don't know where to start except that if 0 stars were an option instead of one I wouldn't even have given it that. This vaccuum is tedious, and one reviewer was correct in saying that you have to clean everything (very time consuming pain!) or it won't suck. Now six months later it won't suck despite cleaning. Everything I read in the poor reviews is true of this vaccuum. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"The reviews were helpful to me prior to purchasing...so I'll return the favor. First the vacuum was of mid-weight...not as heavy as some others...which made for ease in transporting. Assembly consists only of attaching the handle with two screws...easy. It's quieter than my previous vacuum (Eureka.) The detachable canister is great for working in smaller or congested areas...and can be hand-carried in those areas when vacuuming if desired. It comes with a bare floor attachment although the vacuum can be used for bare floors without the attachment. The plastic dirt cup easily detaches and reattaches. The suction is very good whether using attachments or the main unit. It's a quality product and reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"bissell lift-off vacuum","review":"Got this vacuum a few days ago and had to try it out as soon as I got it. I currently own an Eureka boss and had just vacuumed with it the day prior......you wouldn't believe what the bissell picked up and how much fuller it made my carpet look....I couldn't believe how much more dirt and dust it picked up over the eureka. Another nice thing, the bissell is a bagless system and it was so nice to not have to worry if I had extra bags on hand. The dirt container comes out easily and seems to be less messy (dusty) than on my eureka (when I tried to remove it's bag to throw away). Only one down fall, the part of the bissell that lift's out to make it portable for stairs and such, is kind-of heavy and there is nowhere on the vacuum to store the attachment for the stairs....but the on board attachments are easy and accessible to use. Over-all a great vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST VACUUM EVER!!!","review":"I have a black lab that sheds piles of fur year round.

Now that I have a baby crawling around on them I am super grateful I have such a nice vacuum.I don't find cleaning the filters to be annoying since it works so well after I do it. I feel that the filters do more good than harm, so the little bit of work to clean the out every once in awhile (about once a month for me) doesn't really bother me.And I LOVE how quickly I can just pick up the inner unit and carry it into another room to use the hose.My mother is going to be buying one soon after seeing how well mine works. I would recommend it to everybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, BUT.....","review":"The Bissell Lift Off does a very good job on carpet and bare floor,has very good suction and the canister is a nice addition, it picks up a very impressive amount of dirt and is farly easy to manuver, HOWEVER its not that clean to empty, the filters must be cleaned often, its reletivley noisy, weighs 22 Pounds, the canister is very prone to tiping over, and the main HEPA filter is not that cheap to replace ($10.00-$13.00). Overall I whould recomend it if you can live with its list of cons. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Dusty Difficult To Clean Didn't Last Very Long","review":"I wish I had purchased something else.

After about a year it lost some of it's suction and just didn't pick up like it used to. I checked all the filters and everything was clean etc. Well then about a month ago it started to over heat while I was in the middle of using it and would just shut down. I live in a small apartment and don't have that much to vaccuum btw so it's not like I was vaccuming for very long when this would happen. Finally the other day it just wouldn't even turn on anymore. After reading the other reviews it sounds like I should be glad it over heated and shut down instead of catching fire though. What a piece of junk!

I have enough that I have to do than clean a vaccum cleaner.I have read reviews where they state it works wonderfully with stairs. I find this NOT to be the case in my house. I can't stand it.

It truly is a HORRIBLE product in design and function. It is a total gimmick. I think someone is writting false reviews to pump up the ratings for this product! There is no person that could possibly rate this thing high... If I can return it, I will!For starters, it may seem really neat that you can detach the canister -DON'T be fooled, it is a PAIN to detach. You have to lift it out of the cradle, and then wrestle with detaching the hose from the connector, and then put on a very cheaply made attachment. The attachments are soooo cheaply made, and do not function like they should. There is VERY little suction from the attachments. They are useless.Buy something else! or, you WILL regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful product","review":"This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. The suction is very poor, the upholstory attachment is too rough for fine furniture, the hose attachments are too short, it does not come with a carpet attachment -must purchase seperately and then it does not store on the vacuum.The pros... lightweight and the canister is easy to empty.I've only used it 2 times and am very unhappy with it's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, great for pet hair","review":"We bought this vacuum when we moved into our new house. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats, and it works great picking up the animal hair. The lift-off is great b/c we can get the stairs, corners, and everywhere the excess hair hides w/o a seperate machine. The only complaint I have is that my husband never empties the dirt canister! :) A friend of mine tried it at my house and ended up buying one of her own. If you want something under $200 that will perform, I recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does wonders!!!!","review":"I just purchase my Bissell not to long ago and can not believe how wonderful it actually works. I have two cats and a dog and thought that my dirt devil was doing the job at getting the hair and other particals out of the carpet and furniture, boy was I suprised at what it missed. I love the fact that I can take it up the stairs with out having to take the whole vacuum up with me and worry about it falling back down the stairs. Plus it is a lot quitter than most vacuums. If I could I would give it ten stars. The only thing is that Amazon does not offer the cheapest price on it,I got mine for $172.00 verses paying $179.99 . Go to Walmart and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOSH THE HAIR","review":"I just got my new vacuum and could not wait to try it out. Our regular vacuum broke about a month ago, but we have a roomba and use it almost daily. We have two cats and the carpets were still looking great, that is until I used the Bisell 3750. Much to my suprise I filled the container not once but TWICE!!! The carpets are amazingly clean. Our house is brand new and my husband and our two cats have only been there a year. I am so excited about the deep cleaning and lift off ablility (we have a two story with stairs) that my husband said he gets to vacuum next time :) That alone was worth every penny we spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny.","review":"There are so many options for vacuum on the market, and it's so hard to find the one that really suits your needs. Am I glad to find this Bissell for my household!! I'd been using Eureka for over ten years, and it finally died on me after replaing three belts over the years. Even though the engine of Eureka was still good, I just thought I really wanted to get a new one this time. After checking so many different models, I finally set my eyes on this Bissell Liftoff. After using it couple times, I am satisfied with its performance. It's much quieter and smoother. Especially the LiftOff part is the greatest feature above all. I get to carry it around to clean the corners and some hard-to-reach spots. It does a wonderful job!! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard!!","review":"I had the same problem as another Bissell owner. I noticed a burning smell and saw smoke while using the vacuum. After investigating, I noticed that one of the prongs had completely burned off the bottom of the canister and the connection on the base had burned as well. I immediately reported it to Bissell and they are sending a \\"remanufactured\\" replacement. The unit is 2 1/2 years old and out of warranty. While I am happy to get the machine replaced, I think they should have a recall on this model as it is certainly a safety hazard.Not only that, it is very hard to maintain and the filters constantly have to be cleaned. I finally just went out and bought extras, so I can continue to use the unit while I wait 2 days for the washed filters to dry. I would think twice before purchasing this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 5 months...","review":"The brush motor burned out after only 5 mos. of minimal usage (single guy in a 1 bd. room apt.) Up to that point it worked very well.I'm glad I only paid $125 for this on sale.

While the liftoff is a nice feature, the shortcomings far outweigh it. It's clumsy and awkward to use, especially when moving from floor to carpet and over thresholds (or any uneven surface). The cord is often in the way, and the suction.. well, it \\"sucks\\", but not the way it should! I can't believe how little it picks up - my 6 yr old Hoover does a far better job! The power brush feature is terrible on hardwoods/tile, which would be fine since there's a shutoff, but since the suction is so terrible, you end up just running over the same pieces of dirt. I regret spending money of this waste of a vacuum - I will undoubtedly buy a Windtunnel next time (which will likely be soon, as I cannot spend the ridiculous time it takes to clean just one room with this \\"electronic hokie\\". Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum with one drawback - weight","review":"The vacuum is very powerful as stated. Picks up the little dust from drilling through sheetrock as well as cat hair. It is a little heavier than I like, however having the ability to remove the lift off part to go up and down stairs makes up for it. It was easy to assemble and easy to change to different heights of surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"High claims for a hefty price","review":"I bought this vacuum thinking that with all its high-tech functions and bag-less system it would be far easier and more efficient than the cheaper vacuum cleaners I have used in the past. The truth is that after a couple months it has lost suction and I notice little pieces of dust that I have to go over again. The portable center makes it easier to use and when you use the hose with tools it is far more efficient but I did not purchase the upright model so that I would be down on the floor getting the edges of the room with the hose. It is hard to clean and I plan on returning mine for something a little less cumbersome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the whole house","review":"This vacuum makes it easy to do the stairs, hardwoods and carpet! I love having one machine that can go all over the house and clean it so well!! It's amazing how much this picks up (makes me wonder how long some of the dirt has been in there!!) I would highly reccomend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent vacuum. I used to have Dirt Devil but I don't really like it because of the clean-up issue. This one does the job very well. I've used it for almost 2 years now and you can actually clean the parts easily. I don't understand about the comments made by the other reviewer. I don't really need to use screwdriver to clean the top part of this vacuum. All you need to do is just twist it and it will pop out.Normally, I would clean the parts twice a year, and after that the vacuum cleaner works well after it's been clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum","review":"I purchased the Bissel 3750 after reading many good reviews on Amazon, and I have not been disappointed with the vacuum. The only downfall I can see is that it is pretty heavy - I knew this going in but figured with a one-story house it wouldn't be a big concern. It's not, but I definitely work up more of a sweat than with my old vacuum. I personally like having the filters, but I have already learned that it's a good idea to clean the top filter everytime you empty the canister - not a problem, just something to remember. I like having the \\"lift-off\\" function and find myself using it a lot more than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed","review":"After my old vacuum stopped working, we decided our next vacuum purchase would be better than our old special, since we have 2500sq ft, under air to vacuum. After buying the Lift-Off and getting it home, WOW!! It was like we had never vacuumed our carpets, ever!! It is easy to use, has great suction and the lift-off feature is great for our cars. I was thinking of the Dyson, however, my wife & I are very, very pleased we purchased the lift-off. It really does an excellent job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product Design","review":"I've had this vacuum for 4 months and will be looking for a new one soon. We had a tank Elextrolux for 10 years (handed down to us with probably another 10 years of use) and never had a problem with it. With the Elextrolux all you had to do was change the bag, I didn't even know where the filters were. With this Bissell you have to clean the filters constantly, there are 3, and the bagless container is continually making a huge mess. The suction is next to nothing if the filters aren't constantly looked after. Also, when the suction is compromised it frequently clogs in the hose which is hard to clear. I'm all for product innovation and ease of use, but there is nothing innovative about the core function of this vacuum. I would recommend going on eBay and looking for a vintage electrolux - there is nothing more reliable and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"So terrible...","review":"I too have had this vacuum for about a year and at first, it worked well. Now it starts a high-piched whistling after 2 minutes, the brush almost never rolls and it doesn't pick up any of the dog hair from the carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I bought this vacuum exactly 1 yr. and 6 mo. ago.......the motor has gone bad and costs almost as much as the machine to replace. Of course, the warranty is only good for one year!I called Bissell.....Not helpful. This vacuum sucks and not in a good way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't purchase this vacuum!","review":"I've had this vacuum for over a year now and I absolutely hate it! At first it worked great, great suction and it does have some really neat features. However, as other people have mentioned, the filters are horrible! I don't have dogs or cats either and I live in a small house, and I am ALWAYS cleaning the filters. And the problem is that they loose suction with no warning, often I have just vacuumed the carpet, then moved on to the wood floors before I notice how poor the suction is. Taking the filter out is an extremely messy and gross job! I don't enjoy getting the dirt that was once on my floor all over my hands and sink. After washing the filters, and the surrounding parts with soap and water, they take forever to dry! Many times I have been preparing for a get together, only to be panicking because my vacuum stopped working.This is the worst vacuum I've ever had, save your money and purchase something better!Erica in Eastern Washington"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bang for the Buck","review":"First I have to say that this Vacuum was bought with a Coupon and we also recieved a free Hepa Filter, + a Power Nozzle and a small portable thru rebates with Bissell and Amazon. There was no better price on the net or in the stores and the shipping was free. *****The Power and durability of the Model is Fantastic. We originally had the eariler Lift Off from a few years back and that was good but, this is far superior. If you never had a two in one Vacuum like this then you must buy one. When you convert to a canister you can do the Stairs, Furniture and Drapes which would not be possible with a regular Upright. *****If there is one drawback its that you have to empty the waste container and clean the filter areas often, but because this is our first bagless, I don't know if that is typical for this type of Machine. ****Otherwise I can't see why people spend $250.00 and up when this is the way to go! *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much maintenance every time I vacuum!","review":"I am wondering if the people who gave this product 5 stars still believe this is the best vacuum. We bought this vacuum in May and it did fine for about a month. Now it constantly is getting clogged. You have to take the whole vacuum apart to clean the hose, filters etc! The detachable part of the vacuum is great but when there is NO SUCTION it doesn't really matter if it detaches or not. I think when you write a review you should wait about a month after you purchase the product and then decide if you like it. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Homes with Stairs","review":"I recently purchased this vacuum after a little research on my own. After hearing a lot of good things about this vacuum I decided to put it to the test. I had just moved into my 2-story apartment and I was amazed at how great this product worked. It is easy to use. You don't even have to lose 10 pounds pushing this vacuum because it kind of moves forward on its own. I especially love the detachable part of the vacuum. I use it on the stairs all the time. The fact that it's bagless saves me a lot of money. Just remember to keep cleaning those filters. Keeping those clean helps the vacuum keep good suction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is a wonderful vacuum. I have never seen anything like it. It sucks up everything. Pet hair, human hair, dirt, bugs, anything in its path. This vacuum has a clear hose and a clear viewing area for the floor brush so you can see were the clog is if you get any. The floor brush can either be turned on or off. This is nice for uncarpeted floors. There are also 7 adjustable floor hights. The attachments stay in there place and don't come off while your vacuuming. I hated that with my old vacuum. This vacuum has nice big wheels on the back for easy handling. Not to mention the lift off canister is wonderful.

First couple of times I used the foam roller, it was painfully intense! However, after using it for a few times, my muscles - particularly lower back and hamstrings - have an improved range of motion and overall feel more flexible. The intensity and discomfort declines as you add sessions with the roller. The foam roller itself appears to be of good quality. My advice to those who have never used a foam roller, is that if it seems too intense at first, give it several tries before making a final decision to incorporate it into your physical conditioning routines. It is painful at first, but does loosen up muscles that have tightened up."},{"rating":"2","title":"6\\" X 36\\" Foam Roller Review","review":"This product had been recommended to me by a friend in Sports Medicine.I had used a similar \\"roller\\" at Physical Therapy, but for a different reason.

The problem with that is that when it is on the full force of a high current is applied to the battery and if the battery is almost charged the battery voltage quickly rises to the cut-off voltage (14.2v). When current is cut off the battery voltage quickly falls to the turn on voltage (13.1v), and the unit turns the current on again. This can happen several times a minute when the current is high and the battery is almost charged. Also, in operating this way, the battery never gets fully charged, which requires a small constant current.I strongly recommend that anyone considering this unit spend another $10 and buy the vastly superior HQRP 10Amp controller or something similar which controls the amount of current, rather than just switching current on or off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sun force 7 amp charge controller","review":"It worked fine for 2 weeks, then it just died.

I am in the process of trying for a refund - the bulb didn't even turn on in the projector. The projector was functioning perfectly when the last bulb finished its predicted life. The seller was extremely anxious that I remove my negative comments and repeatedly requested their removal.

I was recommended to read this book from the experienced Sailors in the military.com forums. Not only did it answer some of the smaller detailed questions that you may not find on the Navy websites, it gave me an understanding of what the recruits of Division 005 went through, psychologically and physically.I'm shipping off to RTC in about 5 months and I'm glad I picked up a copy of this book (as well as the Bluejacket's Manual - even though we'll be getting our own copies at boot camp).

I found this book fun to read and informative. One of the other reviews criticized the book for not going deep enough with any of the recruits. While the author may have moved quickly from one to the other, I didn't mind at all. I didn't pick up the book to hear too much about any one kid's personal experience.I wanted an overall view of the experience from many different angles. And this book delivered just that. Reading about the officers' perspectives was worth the purchase alone. Even though this is far from comprehensive, I feel better prepared.And my mom's going to love reading this.

This book, like all the books in the Trotter-Mathematica series is a excellent example of how not to write a good technical book.

Autobiographies have their place, but should be labeled as such.This particular book might be used along with other resources, to obtain the results it hopes to lead to: organizational skills, defining life purpose, etc., but is not adequate in and of itself at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"underestimated series","review":"This series is great !For a mid-90ies series the effects are fine and the characters are nicely drawn (buddy-movie style).I had positive memories from the first time I sawe it on TV and after I watched the series again more than 10 years later the positive memories proved right.To bad the German synchro is not yet out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Show, Want more of the Movies....","review":"I was and am, a huge fan of Alien Nation. I was so pleased when Kennith Johnson started putting these films out after the series was cancelled by Fox. (May there person who did that rot in hell.) All five films kept the flavor of the series. Eric Peirpoint was once again the fine newcomer cop paired with an out of his element human cop played by Gary Graham. Both of these men kept the flavor of Alien Nation, and still made it seem like a buddy movie. (A la Leathel Weapon) Hopefully, some day there might be another one, I hope, if not; I would love to see Graham and Peirpoint work together again. Perhaps with out Peirpoint spending 6 hours in a makeup chair to look like a Newcomer. Good show, great movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 5th movie.","review":"Don\`t Buy this.

Those prove low budget is no excuse to produce crap.This whole bile-producing disappointment suffers from the Pathetic Fallacy. You don't show that something is gritty by making a viewer sit through frames full of bad sound, ugly acting, and grainy scenes. Think of the filmSin City.

They may look nice and fit very well but I couldn't hang on to a hot grill grate for much more than a second without the heat penetrating through. My trusty Kingsford gloves would only start to get warm after at least ten seconds or so...plenty of time to rearrange or clean a hot grate. I never had any issues with the \\"bulk\\" of the Kingsford gloves. I was able to grab any grill accessories I needed and the fingers bent easily.

Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal, that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts, on the other hand, need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove, despite being well made and attractive, is no good for holding hot items. At best, it protects hand and arm while grilling, if you're using tongs, lets say, over a very hot fire.

Yes, chess is about making threats and stop them, and this book teaches how to do that in a very instructive way. If we ever want to become strong chess players, it is of essential nature learning to see our opponent's threats and meet them appropriately.What you will find in this book is a very clear explanation about threats and how we can deal with them, and then a lot of excercises to train your mind and eye to find the threats on the chess board.

I could make it usable by having something ready with which to cover the screen when I hit <next page>, but even then there's no way to know exactly how far up or down the answer will be because the amount of introductory text varies from problem to problem.

I was surprised at how much religiousity is in this CD. The background music consists of Christian hymns and Leslie does a bit of sermonizing and God praising throughout the workout. If you are a devout Christian believer, this CD is for you.

Unfortunately, Feeding The Green Monster, differs from none of them in it's style, depth, perspective, or insight. It provides little more than a kid-at-a-candy-store hyped up feel-good movie of the week view of what is arguably one of the more interesting landmarks in sports. Also, Mr Neyer's fake humility regarding what he does and does not know about the park and the city is laughable, and no doubt embarrassing to many Boston sports fans. And nobody in Boston above the age of 5 calls the left field wall at Fenway the 'Green Monster'. Perhaps that is the target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A season long memoir worth reading...","review":"Neyer is an insightful fan. That's the point of the book. It's about Fan experience, human experience, in the seats of Fenway. His criticism of teams as thinking about the fans last is apt and apropos.I've never had any love for the Sox (I'm a senior circuit guy), but I nevertheless became involved in the pennant race, and the season described.What I came away with most, was the desire to go to a game with Rob, and just shoot baseball.

This books serves as a resource not just for game design, but in many other fields as well. I have used this book while studying anything that relates to interactivity, education and learning, and sociology.

The definition of meaningful play, the case studies and the troubleshooting tips are very useful. Unfortunately, the book tries to be both a design manual and a textbook.

Easily forgettable.","review":"Managed to finally get through this wordy behemoth. Now that I have, I'm not sure that it was worth the battle. The historic/cultural analysis is quite one sided, leaving the most controversial topics entirely untouched. The text reads like a \\"retro-gamers guide to the universe\\", and fails to offer any meaningful examination of game design topics.

The only negative comment I would say is that buyers need to be aware that there are two volumes to complete the two week training. It was not clear that I was purchasing volume one only.

Just make sure that if you purchase the DVD, that it includes more than the one week sample as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as the Power of 10 workout","review":"The 12 second sequence workout, is not a new idea. There is a book out by Adam Zickerman and Bill Schley that is called the Power of 10. This is the same concept as the 12 second sequence. They even recommend the 2 times a week workout and then you can go down to 1 time a week. Again, it is exactly the same elements. Slow, controlled movements. You do 10 seconds into the exercise and 10 seconds down. So if you are doing an arm curl, you slowly, controlled, move the arm up for 10 counts and then repeat down for a very slow, controlled 10. Again, this book was published in 2003, so sorry Jorge, this is not a new concept. Funny thing, too, they also recommend eating 6 times a day and not going over 4 hours between eating - sound familiar, as well?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening and inspirational book for anyone.","review":"After 35 years of teaching children with all kinds of abilities, I found this book truly emphasized the theory of working through strengths. Success can only be evaluated by the individual and his relationship to the world. It is easy for a professional or any person for that matter, to find one's faults. The skill of the professional is to discover one's strengths. This takes patience and a sincere determination to work with an individual and help him identify his potential. These strengths can be very simple however simplicity can lead to success. Jill Lauren has clearly illustrated this concept in her book and has made it an inspiration for both children, adults and most importantly educators. It is a pleasure to know that a person like Jill Lauren knows her strengths and she is obviously succeeding in her field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great - Don't buy it - Dangerous Design Flaw","review":"This candle holder looks great.BUT whoever designed it paid no attention to the fact that there are some candles which are almost directly over other candles.

It honestly is just a cheap device, turned out cheaply, to cash in on the solar craze now going on. I'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy. This unit does not. Yes, it reads fine on my multimeter, when I check it, but the battery on my RV is not staying charged. I have gone through two charge controllers, so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit, here. I am in a city with almost 90% very sunny days. This panel gets full, blazing sun, just about daily, for seven hours. You get what you pay for, and you don't get much, apparently, at the price this unit goes for.

My suggestion if someone is trying to accomplish what I'm trying is to get on the internet and find a company that sells a good American or Japanese panel that produces around 80 watts.

The author knows police procedure from \\"reading all about it\\" instead of experience and it shows. I'm not sure about the plot, I'm too angry that I paid money for this to read it closely enough to know what it's actually about. The author found a small publisher, possibly a vanity publisher, to get this drivel on the market. Another bit of info, the author is touting the \\"award\\" for which he's been nominated. It's from a website where one pays $50 bucks per entry to have the work \\"promoted\\" as an award nominee/winner. I'm still nauseous.

They are always aware that there is someone out there with a truly vested interest in what became of them. This beautifully written addictively readable autobiography of a search made me realize that some form of open adoption is the healthiest adoption for the child and both sets of parents, even if they do not fully accept this at the beginning. Consciously ignoring one of life's basic assumptions, that of knowing the people who led to one's very creation, should never be attained without the full knowledge and consent of ALL parties, and most especially the one who is the focus of the new family."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Phenolic Varnish!","review":"I ordered this varnish specifically because the product description said it was a PHENOLIC varnish.

I noticed that there were no RCA inputs on the sub unit, but with less clutter just used the F.A.S.T. 9999 T connectors (6 six connections, L+, L-, R+, R-, Switched + power, Remote amp power). I haven't finished installing yet as it's a heatwave outside, so wires are not tucked away, not sure how long the wiring harness is but it seems to be sufficient to reach from my head unit to the cargo area in my small station wagon. Note ground wire is located near the subwoofer branching off the harness. I ran it for a few minutes and I am impressed how it fills out my lows, stock speakers in a Mercury Tracers are not all that and this is why I purchsed this unit. I am not inexperienced in subwoofers, for years before I was running 2x 12\\" subs in a bandpass box, that setup would have been too much for me in this car.

The bass is great and I have it turned up only half way and adjust the rest at the stock head unit. I would definitely recommend it and I would buy another one.

Everything complemented each other. No over powering bass or ear bleeding highs. I should have just bought a cheap mono block and a 8\\" woofer and made my own box. Someone said that bazooka writes there own reviews on amazon and I think they are right. Don't buy any bazooka products, unless you want cheap product that just does not deliver...

The book is mainly made up of quotes from Nigella's columns and other references with very little narrative. There's no real focus or direction, and most of the information is completely useless. Another frustrating element is the photo section. Why in the world do readers need to see three photos of Nigel Lawson and his second wife and children? The book hardly touches on them, and I would have rather seen some more photos of Nigella.Definitely skip this book. Maybe someday something worthwhile will be written about this extraordinary woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of words, but little substance","review":"This book is just. . .hollow. It's clear that the writer either couldn't or didn't get any interview time with Nigella herself.

The fingers are now to the point where it is hard to bend them and the gloves are almost impossible to put on and off.I need to buy another pair of gloves; I won't buy these again. This was my first pair of smoking gloves; I'm not sure if they all have these challenges or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great while smoking a chicken","review":"These gloves worked great for lifting out and handling smoked chicken. They really are insulated well and I didn't feel a thing when I pulled out the can when doing a beer can chicken. They do get a bit slippery and it was a little challenging to get them off quickly one time, but not an issue really. Not sure how else I would pick up and handle some of the meat I put on the lower racks of my smoker. Great product and a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight Book","review":"Miss the days when Suge's mere pressence would put the Ether on Busters. there are alot of Sponge Bob,Corny Pickle Leaf Turkeys out here who could use a good reminder of Suge Knight.

I only just read Jane Eyre last month, and I fell in love with it. So I set out to watch as many adaptations as I could. The Masterpiece Theatre was the second one I watched, and have seen another since, and I am afraid I really should have waited. Not that the other versions were not wonderful tellings of this amazing story, or that I will not continue on my quest, but you know what they say about saving the best for last!And indeed, if anyone else is thinking about watching the many versions of Jane Eyre, I offer that exact advice.

But, my friend and I finally sat down last night and watched it. Except for a few differences, it was absolutely wonderful! The photography was breathtaking and the acting superb! We sat in silence as we watched the credits roll. This is a movie that is definitely worthy of one's money and time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely loved it","review":"Stephens and Wilson bring a depth to the characters that I have not seen in any other versions. Rochester is brooding and bitter without being too harsh and Wilson balances emotion and restraint perfectly. They draw you into the characters like the book does. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It won me over very quickly...","review":"I am a big fan of the Timothy Dalton BBC version of Jane Eyre because it is so faithful to the book. The Masterpiece Theatre version won me over on the first viewing. While it is not as faithful to the book as the BBC 1982 version, it is still beautifully done. Toby Stephens did a magnificent job as Rochester, despite the fact that he is really a handsome red-headed man. Ruth Wilson embodied Jane Eyre very well. The performances made up for the liberties taken with the story. A very well done updated version to this classic timeless novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW WOW","review":"This Jane Eyre is very close to the novel! The only problem is that Mr. Rochester in the film is too good looking!!

Even so, the story is so good that soon you take no notice of the poor video. Though there are several versions of this story, each one has it's good points and those that some tend to pick apart.

It was just beautiful ! :) What woman wouldn't want a Mr. Rochester of her own. *sigh* <3 For anyone who enjoys period dramas, this is a must see!I like to watch movies with subtitles on, especially if it's an English movie in case I can't understand a word or two because of pronunciation... and this DVD, like BBC's Pride and Prejudice, does not have subtitles, grrr. Wish they'd fix that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Truly a great movie that you can enjoy over and over again. Acting is beautiful, scenery is just what it sounds like in the book. The only thing I would have like to see is the ending with a little more aniticipation. The sequence of finally finding Mr. Rochester and bringing him a glass of water should have been done with as much tension and anticipation as the rest of the movie. I think had it been 1-2 more segments long like Pride and Prejudice, it would have made all the difference. However, overall I adored this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Charlotte Bronte say?","review":"I had such high hopes for this version of Jane Eyre. But when Jane arose out of the mist and frightened the man's horse, he took the name of the Lord my God in vain. I am very much saddened and disappointed that I could watch the movie no further. As a Christian I cannot support a movie that drags His name in the dirt as an expletive. I believe Charlotte Bronte would have strongly objected to her story being used to demean Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect!","review":"I watched this a few years ago when it came out on PBS. It was magical and I was transfixed. I loved Ruth Wilson's portrayal of Jane Eyre, without sentimentality or self pity. Jane is simply a wonderful character. And her chemistry with Rochester was fun to watch. I kept thinking about the movie so I finally bought it and I've watched it twice since purchasing it. I highly recommend this version. It just flies by and you'll want to watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, I love it!","review":"This is the first version of Jane Eyre I've seen and I've loved it ever since. No other versions even compare to it! Masterpiece Theatre has romance, drama, suspense, everything you could want. I love the actors, you can feel the passion between them. I'd give 100 stars if I could! Definetly you should buy it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"A great film.

Lots of dark, gloomy scenes and good chemistry between the main characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation","review":"This is probably the best Jane Eyre version I've seen. The version with William Hurt seemed dull and lifeless and the version with Timothy Dalton was way too melodramatic. This one seems to be the best quality, both with regards to acting and cinematography. Ruth Wilson is a perfect Jane and Toby Stephens plays an excellent Rochester, though perhaps a little too handsome to be exact. Stays faithful to the book, I believe, though it has been some years since I read it last. Excellent adaptation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic romance in the most sensual version.","review":"The best version of Charlotte Brönte's novel.

This production has proven itself to be my new personal favorite. I would imagine it can be quite difficult to breathe new life into an already successful franchise, but the actors proved to be more than up to the task. The beauty of any Masterpiece Theatre production is their gift of time, so that we as viewers are able to go the full distance with the characters. To everyone involved - job well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"An amazing adaption! The actors are fabulous -- Ruth Wilson channels Jane directly. She actually blushes when scenes require it, sobs realistically, and shows precisely what she is feeling and thinking. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times in the last month and am astonished by it each time. The last half of the movie does depart from the book, but it is faster paced and I liked it even better than the book. (Blasphemy, I'm sure, but let me assure you that I like the book!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tailor made for the Women's Entertainment Network","review":"The brooding landscape is the real star of this new adaptation of Jane Eyre. Both lead actors are too conventionally pretty to be convincing, rendering their comments about plainness/ugliness patently absurd. Wilson has some good moments as the stolid, composed Jane in the face of endless hardship; and Stephens makes a persuasive case in the declaration of love scene. But the updated dialogue, Jane's teasing retorts to Rochester, and especially the makeout scene -- on a bed, no less, and between a religiously devout pre-Victorian virgin and the man who just betrayed her -- ring completely false. The hinted-at sexual aspects of the novel are overplayed here. To top it off, Bertha, the lunatic wife, who in the book was feral and unkempt, here appears beautifully groomed and MTV ready. How far Masterpiece Theatre has fallen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Version of Jane Eyre in Movie Form","review":"The BBC and Masterpiece Theater did a great job with this movie!

In the story of Jane Eyre, one my favorite scenes is the \\"burning bed.\\" This movie just ruined it. I was so excited when it was time for this scene in the movie, then I just wanted to scream. Mr. Rochester's snippy but funny remarks during this scene were completely left out. (\\"Is there a flood?\\" \\"Is there a plot to drown me?\\" ) I can't even imagine that changing this scene was approved.I gave it two stars because I did like the look of the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great...","review":"And referring to \\"great,\\" I'm talking about the 1981 version starring Timothy Dalton. That version was the definative 'Jane Eyre.' This version, from Masterpiece Theatre, is good. It adds vision and style to the story, and the scenery is lovely, it just misses something... I suppose growing up with the 1981 version, I'm a little biased, but I'll admit that the Masterpiece Theatre version is good.For the great version, see the 1981 version. For the good version, see this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I love this movie and this version of it. Ruth Wilson is perfect for this role.

Although Ciaran Hinds and Timothy Dalton act the part famously, the new Rochester left me understanding why Jane Eyre would love him. The playfulness, friendship, and developing romance drew me into a realization of how their relationship could progess to a state where they could 'hear' each other across distances. I did miss some of the depth of Jane's life at Lowood School, but the intensity of the romance between Jane and Rochester overthrew any other disappointments. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!","review":"This was an absolutely wonderful movie that I've shared wih others every chance I get!

For some reason they are distributing the DVD with all of the Special Features later in May. The US DVD reportedly only has cast filmographies and a biography of Charlotte Bronte. The UK version includes all of those above and deleted scenes, audio commentaries, interviews with cast & crew, and a photo gallery.If all the extras aren't important to you by all means go ahead and order this beautifully done adaption of Jane Eyre.

All the reviews I read were very positive and therefore I was taken by surprise by a scene in the flashback after the aborted wedding. There is a scene depicting sexual intercourse between Mr. Rochester's first wife and another man. It is not a big scene but totally unnecessary and not true to a Charlotte Bronte novel. This will not be included in my library as I only have classics...movies that can be viewed for years to come and be enjoyed by all ages. I regret that this movie is unrated....what good is a rating system if it does not rate a movie that has a depiction of sexual intercourse.

This take on the classic was dull. lifeless and flat. Something I never thought I would ever see. The book was really not just about a timeless romance but ahead of it's time in describing a woman's self-growth. Here, Jane is anything but the \\"heroine\\" I'd come to know in the book. She was lacking in the fire and emotional strength that you got from the book. A most disappointing adaption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet ANOTHER Jane Eyre adaptation *sigh* --- what about \\"Villette\\"?!?!","review":"My love of the novel and the 1983 BBC film adaptation starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, ruined all chances of me enjoying this latest Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Eyre. It started off well with the gloomy mystery I was expecting, and then it became an overly melodramatic succession of one sappy scene after another. Ruth Wilson pulled off the character of Jane fairly well, but Toby Stephens I felt was miscast - too much smiling and smirking - he played Rochester like a caricature and ended up seeming comical instead of smolderingly sexy. The multitude of kissing scenes didn't help to turn up the heat at all. This version is definitely for the younger perkier crowd of romantics. For me, it lacks depth and I don't feel the weight of the story - I'm not left wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short & low budget","review":"This adaptation has 2 problems; it is too short. The first part with Jane's childhood and her aunt can have a whole chapter. The second at Lowood school needs another whole chapter. Important literary characthers like Mr. Brocklehurst & Miss.Temple are barely seen or left out.This novel has a lot of psicological evolution with Jane and Mr.Rochester that simply needs more screen time.Second problem is a modest or low budget;cinematography is too dark and poor.

I think Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson are well matched, and they created just the right amount of tension. I have watched this many times and never tire of it.

Noise is about what you would expect, but there is a very faint whine on top of the fan noise. It's nothing intrusive, but it is there if you listen for it and can stand out over the other fan noise even in a louder case.

Yes.After she opened her gift up and we couldn't get her ipod to charge, we found a sticker on the outside of the box that was added after it was manufactured stating that it doesn't charge certain ipods. A lot of good that does when you can't examine the box online. Now we are stuck with this as the seller's policy is to not accept refunds-hmm I should have read the fine details. I bought it because it says Ipods could be charged - what they don't tell you is that it doesn't work for all ipods! Apparently you can buy an adapter.... for more $$.....

If you're going to choose among all the books that criticize computers and the Internet, this is, I promise, your best bet. Calm, rational, articulate, engaging, it manages to be *thoughtful* rather than ranting or over-emotional, which is a common problem that drowns and ultimately destroys the rhetoric of many of Talbott's peers. Talbott's final conclusion, woven beautifully from his collection of sensitive and thought-provoking essays, has everything to do with human beings as well as computers and the Internet: we should remain awake and aware of the subtle consequences of computer and communication technology. Talbott manages--through easy-going qualification and a rational, neutral attitude--to place himself in the role of a guide rather than a preacher.

Also, I have the large size, and my son (who's average size) fit in it until he was almost four.

It was too slow and lacked the grittiness that I like in action/adventure/ western genres.Cotton is familiar with the ways and customs of the historic cattle drives but the interactions of the supporting characters was shallow without the benefit of the rough and tumble action associated with other westerns.Cole was too much the perfect gunfighter/fighter that is so often found in the romantic nonsense of the western.

I was embarrassed and disappointed too... Don't buy this set- it is totally crap and not worth the money at all!

In addition, there are two different sizes of K'nex in the tub, which are not compatible with one another. My son said, \\"Daddy, I like the big K'nex better....\\"Anyway, this product is an exceptional ripoff!

While Dyson agrees that people should be individually responsible, society and our government needs to be responsible too. The failure doesn't rest entirely with the poor as Cosby argues.

I agree with much of what he was saying, but the flaw for me was his inability to present both sides of the argument. He did an excellent job of explaining why Cosby was \\"out of line\\". Whereas I lean towards Dyson in his arguments, I do share some of Cosby's concerns. I was hoping this book would provide a sense of clarity, but it didn't.I was also a little annoyed by what I felt were strong personal attacks towards Cosby.

It's \\"globalization\\"s fault. It's the fault of every multinational company that won't give your kid a job.Sorry, but I've met far too many young people who have crawled out of the crapper through their family's support to give any credence to this book's arguments.

Facts are many inners city people are not parenting. This includes Blacks. For example, look at south central Los Angeles. You will find many parents not parenting. The parents never teach responsibility or accountability for their actions. Rather, they continually blame schools, the police, etc. This book is full of more blame.

Here is where we are going to disagree - my students are not allowed to use this as an excuse. I was raised by a single parent, below the poverty line - but I was always told that education was my ticket. Parenting, no matter what your race, has got to encourage kids as to what they can accomplish not discourage them with what they cannot accomplish.Those that would like to read two really fantastic books on the racial divide between whites and blacks, please check out \\"Losing the Race: Self-sabotage in Black America\\" and \\"Winning the Race: Beyond the crisis in Black America\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I'm a white guy, but am interested in understanding black perspectives on problems within the black community. To a large extent, the portion of the book I read didn't address Mr. Cosby's comments but instead attacked Mr. Cosby as a person. Professor Dyson's ad hominem arguments are what turned me off.I was expecting an interesting, well supported discussion of 1. whether the statements Mr. Cosby made are true (backed by evidence) and 2. how best to address these concerns. Instead, I got diatribes about what Mr. Cosby's comedy style should have been (more \\"Black\\" with less universal appeal), and Mr. Cosby's educational and moral failings.Professor Dyson should be capable of addressing the issues raised by Mr. Cosby without ad hominem attacks.

Face it Dyson...COSBY IS RIGHT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosby is Both Right and Wrong","review":"Yes, it is good for Cosby to take a self-critical analysis of the contemporary African-American situation. In light of the prevalent social structure, it is up to individuals to pull themselves out of the various situations each individual happens to find himself/herself in the US. What Dyson and other progressive writers are arguing is while the struggle for a socio-economic betterment in the US depends on each person's initiative, it is cognizant to realise the real institutional barriers that prevent minorities and peoples of the low socio-economic ladder from achieving their full potential. That if many of these impediments are resolved, then the potential of many will be realized.

Cosby was/is right"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Bill Cosby Right?","review":"My answer to this is yes and no. I was split on my views when I read pieces from his speech, and it remains both after reading this book by Dr. Dyson. Dyson does a great job of doing his research, and then speaking about the issues surrounding the black poor. There were times when I thought he became exhaustive in his approach on certain issues Cosby critiqued; at the same time, I felt there were extremely important factors Cosby left out when he addressed the poor in his speeches. Those factors Dr. Dyson made sure he covered in the book. Cosby is right saying that we must stop making excuses for our standing in this country. On the other hand, Dyson is correct in saying there are structural and institutional factors which cannot be ignored that are keeping the poor where they are. Hopefully, this book can help encourage some solutions to this problem instead of continuing to fingerpoint and making no progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's got it all!","review":"I think this guitarist has it all going for him.

The book has an entirely unique perspective on leadership. She looks at all leaders and how they measure up as leaders. Even if society views them as a bad leader she takes that and builds on some of their strengths as a leader, their weaknesses and not necessarily their intent. The actual process of leading is the focus. She also looks at the followers and their role in leadership. This I think is also unique to leadership. It is important to analyze the followers and how they can affect the leader. In looking at the dark side of leadership we are able to become better leaders and/or followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad leadership, worse content","review":"This book promises much but delivers little. Barbara Kellerman describes seven random 'categories' of leadership plucked from who knows where (she doesn't say), demonstrating a total inability to exercise conceptual rigour as well as a fondness for her own imaginings. The book is repetitious, full of waffle and padding, and relentlessly superficial. And it is biased.The glibness of her political analyses and the personally vindictive nature of her criticism of various public figures based on a concoction of little more than rumour and gossip is dismaying. She has added nothing to the sum of human knowledge - except an awareness of her own prejudices.If you really want to know more about leadership - this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, a biased and trite view of interesting topic","review":"I've read the book and just heard the author on NPR. While I agree with another reviewer that the view of Clinton is particularly biased, I was willing to overlook the bias if some interesting and rigorous research emerged. Unfortunately, the author's qualitative study reflects more her own ad hoc categories and less a realistic assessment of the leadership behaviors and styles of the subjects.This is a classic example of bad business, management, and leadership writing not grounded in rigorous empirical research. For better views of rigorous leadership research, start with books by Ed Locke, Pfeffer, and Sutton.- A Student of Organizational Behavior"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems Biased","review":"Bill Clinton stopped the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans by magnificent leadership when George H Bush had done nothing about it. Clinton worked tiredlessly for peace in Ireland and the Middle East, yet she chooses Bill Clinton as a bad leader.

I am glad that I did. The story is exciting and the book shows the folly of seeking salvation through works such crusades or trusting in relics.

I should have been warned when I saw the two whole pages at the beginning listing \\"Fictional Characters\\" and \\"Historical Characters.\\" About a dozen people are listed in each category, and we're not supposed to get confused? The two main characters are interesting enough, but the history is integrated into the book laboriously and in piece-together fashion, and does nothing to enhance the story. While I found Tancred Redwan and Helena both quite promising as multi-dimensional characters, I simply could not get past the history that bogged down the story. If an author cannot use \\"facts within fiction\\" better than this, he/she should please not try! I also disliked Linda Chaikin's writing style immensely--but that is only a personal opinion and probably not a valid criticism. Don't bother with this book, even if you like historical fiction!

The BDSM community is portrayed here as just a background (a little like Cabot Cove, Maine, right?) to a murder mystery. It's refreshing to see this kind of background in a novel, where it's not all just about it being different, but rather about it being acceptable and not even remarked upon. And Warren's humor, too, is refreshing: it's an element far too often missing from books dealing with sex.Unfortunately, the mystery part is somewhat less than mysterious. It's too easy to guess the identity of the murderer. Warren has great potential: if he could enter into the noir world with the same dexterity with which he manages the BDSM milieu, he'll do well.

I had previously bought the 1st Edition of this book. I had high expectations for the expanded 2nd Edition, however, the publisher really messed up and used such a light shade of blue ink, which highlights the key critical sections in each chapter, that is makes it impossible to read even in the best light conditions.I thought this was a bad batch and ordered another copy, but again, the same problem with a second delivery.

It's advanced, so beginners might find Pandolfini's Endgame Course a good introduction. My only gripe, shared by others it appears, is the quality of the printing. The blue sections, which illustrate the essentials, vary from clear to faint. This is obviously deficient quality and needs fixing for the next print run.

She had a brawl in front of school the same week. Adults looking out of their windows...just looking not helping. The young girls gets teased and into a fight in the first week. Wow! Then, she has to the audacity to judge the one person that attempts to be her friend, Edith - the ragamuffin that has holes in her stockings. Judgement was her downfall; but she learned to work with Edith. They became best friends. The lesson is don't judge people you don't know. As she learns about Edith, she learns about herself. A book that I believe every girl should read before they finish Junior High. I read it a little late - age 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book for teenagers!","review":"If you don't believe that a person can be changed, you should read \\"The Friends.\\" In \\"The Friends\\" a West Indian girl named Phyllisia got made fun of and beat up in school but a poor girl with untidy stockings stood up in front of the class and told them to stop. That was my favorate part. Unlike many other people Phyllisia still didn't like Edith. Even after all she did for her, Phyllisia just didn't like her appearance. That continued for a long time until one day Phyllisia started realizing it just isn't appearance that matters, but what is inside. I would recommend this book for young adults because I love how the author takes you through all the stages of life like love, hate, sorrow, happiness, and many more.

The most obvious is the poor editing - there are a number of obvious typos and grammatical errors. But the worst part about this book is the many times the author tries to pass off legends, rumors, and complete inaccuracies for historical fact.

I can remember loooooong digit numbers, dates, appointments, new words (this was the most important thing for me all the time...to learn faster foreign language and now I can remember about 300 hundred words daily without too much effort).This is not possible to explain all advantages you can get from your genius memory.You just have to start and test it by yourself.Bad memory costs you money...Good memory... is easy to achieve:)I am sure this book will change your life for better.This is your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Memory Book","review":"Some of the tips in this book are not really tips--they're just a part of common sense that lost commonality (like many things).

You need to be creative and, most importantly, you need to have fun while reading it. Don't treat it like an organic chemistry textbook, or any other textbook for that matter.

But after awhile, it becomes boring. There's no skin shown, no soft-core sex, no violence and no suspense.

Think of every clichéd, done-over, unoriginal, inept and craftless version of goth-metal you'd think was a joke when you heard it, combine them and you have The Supernatural Omnibus from soup to nuts. What makes it even worse is that the band's leader, Christopher Morris, thinks that this music is some sort of beacon of hope for the musically disillusioned... however, Nicodemus and Christopher Morris are probably THE BEST example of 'musicians' who are contributing to the problem rather than helping to solve it. This album pollutes the underground and taints the name of metal. Way to go, Nicodemus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interresting","review":"Like I'm 51 and not much into gothic/death metal. I recently met Christopher and because of that I bought the CD. These guys can play music! The female vocalist is very nice and the ballad, \\"Harlot\\" is very good. Chris does a nice job on the keyboards. My only complaint is the 'demon' voice that pops up in every song. I do think they could do an interresting cover of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" though. I mentioned this to him and he said, \\"Wow! We have a list and that is one of the songs on it.\\" So, maybe the next album will feature that famous Beatle tune. So, give this one a try.

I had high expectations going into this album and he does not disappoint at all. My highlights are Ak-shon(Killer Mike rides this beat well), A.D.I.D.A.S.(more lyricism and one of the album's dopest beats), All 4 U(this track features a dope vocal sample and the beat is probably the best on the album), Dragon(poignant track about a deceased friend), Rap Is Dead(this track addresses the current state of hip-hop) and RE:Ak-shon(I keep this track on repeat; Killer Mike, Bun-B and T.I. all rip this song to shreds)Overall, Killer Mike has dropped one of the best debut albums that I have heard in a while with Monster.

He always has something new to say about the opera he is directing, but never forcing himself at the expense of the composer and librettist. Musically, this is a very good performance, especially by Miah Persson as Susanna, Gerald Finley as The Count and Erwin Schrott, as Figaro.

I think it holds up to Glyndebourne 1 (women great/men not so good) or Glyndebourne 2 (Fleming/Finlay). I don't care much for Schrott's delivery of Figaro's act four aria, however. Toni Bernhard likes the Gardiner, but to me, only Terfel shines.If the one from the Met ever makes an appearance, Terfel, Fleming & Bartoli will make that one the live performance to get. If You don't have to have a live performance, then get the DG Unitel. Prey, Te Kanawa & Freni put this one at the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern Contessa beautifully staged","review":"This is a beautiful production, staged by David McVicar. This stage direction is a plus. Under this direction, Le nozze di Figaro is more a comedy and less a tragedy than the Claus Guth/Harncourt's production from Salzbourg.

AJ Styles may be exciting to watch but he's basically just a spot-fest ala Jeff Hardy and will probably be technically crippled like Hardy if he doesn't alter his style. Two best reasons to watch TNA are Chris Daniels and Samoa Joe. They are the best wrestlers in the company but even they can't help TNA against WWE. Sorry fellas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, Mr. Daywalker.....","review":"Seems like someone is really praying to his TNA gods that they might actually be considered a threat to WWE. Hate to dissapoint you, but it seems the primetime special already did that.

What a laugh, you people really need to ditch the spotfest by AJ Styles and watchBooker T/Benoit/Angle/Guerrero/Mysterio/ wrestle and watch the Triple H/Ric Flair fued.I'd die a happy man watching ANY Angle/HBK match this year, that's how much TNA looks like a deer in the headlights when it comes to REAL WRESTLING......Sure WWE may have gone to the E in WWE instead of the second W, but Vince does deliver when the time is right and anyone who thinks he does not, please, stop worshiping your AJ cut out posters and take a real look around.F*ck TNA, Long Live WWE......[Truth hurts guys, I'm sorry]"},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL!!!!","review":"This DVD was great!

I mean he is not even 6 feet tall and pulls off one incredible move after another. Watch him do a front flip and tell me the guy is not \\"The Phenomenal One.\\"I would give this dvd 5 stars, but it is a little dated, it gets 4 stars because it shows alot of Aj and that makes it worth the time alone.

I don't know how many people claim that he's the most talented, but they are a lot, and they are all wrong. He's a spot fest wrestler with no sense of in ring psychology. If you want the best wrestling dvd get Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story. It has a great documentary about the best wrestler ever, and has tons of great matches. AJ isn't pheonomenal, he's subpar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"I will be the first to admit that I have been a WWE fan since i can remember and never cared for WCW and until recently didnt really enjoy ECW, but because of AJ Styles and the first match i ever saw of him, I now enjoy TNA more than WWE. This DVD showcases the most talented wrestler I have seen in recent years in ability, even surpassing a young shawn michaels as a previous person said, and based on the matches on this DVD, and recent encounters with Samoa Joe, i see him rising to the top. Something which in my mind i believe would have already happened if he was in the WWE, simply because not many people know about TNA, but i guarantee those who do, and some who dont, will not be disappointed by this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and deserved","review":"This DVD is really good, shows the beginning and the best matches AJ has been into, I really hope he continues going up and over the other wrestlers, he deserves it.

This isn't the best AJ Styles matches as alot of the matches had outside interference & had AJ as a heel tryin' to get people to boo him instead of him doing what has made him standout today. Basically if you want the best of AJ Styles in \\"current\\" TNA...check out the X division DVD. There are some good matches on here but overall, this AJ Styles DVD just didn't interest me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The positive reviews were clearly by the promoters","review":"Like the Crazy Frog or anything based one a one-joke innovation, this is great for about 5 seconds.

There is no rock left unturned, so to speak, and each clear and concise photograph is a perfect rendition of each step. There is nothing that leaves the reader confused! The projects are beautiful and range from beginner to advanced, thus appealing to all current and future wire jewelry artists. The other important thing worth noting is Sharilyn's impecable workmanship. I see many photos of wire art jewelry and the workmanship is not always the best. Sharilyn is a top wire jewelry designer and instructor and it shows! I would recommend this book to everyone interested in making wire art jewelry and learning the correct techniques needed to create a professional look. If you love her book as much as I do, check out her website for classes she may be teaching in your area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rate this as a 6!","review":"The illustrations in this book are so good one hardly needs the text, and I think jewelry/metal workers need good basic instruction in wire work.

A great job and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow instructions, beautiful examples.","review":"I am a beginning beader and to date, this is my very favorite how to guide. The examples are well photographed and the text is easy to follow. The tips listed throughout are helpful and informative.

This book goes into more detail than all the others I have read about wire and bead jewelry. It is obvious she puts a lot of care and effort into her craft and shows you how to do the same. Even something as simple as making a spiral is refined in way to make a tighter nicer looking spiral (in my opinion). I refer to this book often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!!!!!!!

Good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Disturbing","review":"As an ex-soldier I must admit that I had little time for Scott Taylor and his endless self promotion (usually at the expense of the military's reputation). However I finally got around to reading this book.....And I have changed my mind (or perhaps I should start reading more books by Brian Nolan). While those of us in uniform could follow a lot of the scandals and see from our own perspective the corruption in the Forces, Tarnished Brass takes the reader through all the background and reveals the true rot at the top. What we only suspected, Taylor & Nolan reveal in a very disturbing amount of detail. I don't believe that much has changed since this book was first published in 1996....And perhaps that explains why morale is so low, and so many soldiers (myself included) simply walked away.An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a rant","review":"It is difficult to respect the opinion of a man like Scott Taylor who in his entire military career rose no higher than the rank of Private.

It was so neat, two people living alone in a cabin in the woods away from people and their expectations. Meannie (yes that's her name.) faked her death in order to leave home and live her own life and to be able to use her gift. The fact that they both have gifts (Meannie has a gift with growing things, I won't tell you what Wisp's gift is) is really interesting. The size of the book surprised me- I didn't expect it to be so small or so short. It was expensive for such a small book, but it was worth every penny I paid for it. It was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exchange of Gift","review":"This is a clever and lovely story ostensibly written for children, but personally I think it's as lovely for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum kinda book","review":"Meanne runs away from her impending arranged marriage. She goes to her childhood cottage that has been long since forgotten and starts her new life there. Wisp comes into her life like a breeze. Together they make a team and strive for new beginnings.This book was rather boring. Meanne is very hurried character, as she we don't get to see inside her, just what is on her mind NOW. There was too many foreshadowing that actually lets us know what is going to happen. There is no surprise and there is no climax of the story.Its pretty mellow, a very short read of 94 pages. I honestly kept myself reading, but found myself skimming the pages. I really don't recommend this book, the only McCaffrey story so far that I didn't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great","review":"This is one of McCaffrey's shorter stories for juveniles. It is about a princess who runs away to avoid an arranged marriage with a much older man. The princess uses her knowledge of flora and fauna in order to escape and survive - but her knowledge is all gleaned from books, so it is more difficult than she believes. However, she perseveres, and she is joined by a waif of a boy who has been beaten and starved. They form a friendship that enables them to survive in the woods on their own - but without either knowing the other's past. I took this to be a story about trust, faith, and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need not agree with me, buuuuut...","review":"About the only thing I liked about the book was that it was visually pleasing. Huh, what a thing to say! It's about the size of a CD case, irregular for a book, and it has the most beautiful cover artwork... but about the book! The story wasn't up to snuff, and I'd say the same thing about any other book of the same caliber, I don't care who wrote it. The plot wasn't particularly exciting, and the romance (could it be called that?), well, it fizzled. The characters weren't very endearing (the main girl character, Meanne, seemed like such a wilted flower. I kept wishing she'd just grow some SPINE!) and although there was magic involved, it wasn't enough to keep me interested for long. I think I'll just stick with reading the Pern books; they're longer and I actually liked the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had only known ...","review":"Very good book for kids - and quite pleasant for adults but If I had understood it was a kids book I might not have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Produces a piddly amount of fog and you have to stand by it all night hitting the button","review":"This fog machine is sad, sad, sad. It produces a sad, small, teeny amount of fog. We thought that perhaps the room was just too large so we tested it out by aiming it into the pantry. It *might* have worked ok if it had a continuous use setting, but the way it works, you need to hold the button down while it pushes out a teeny bit of fog for about 30 seconds. Then it stops emitting while it heats back up, which takes about 1 minute, during which time the fog that you already sent out there totally disappears - then you get to hold the button down again for 30 seconds worth of piddle fog.

Joseph Smith said that the BOM was the most correct book on earth and that it was given to him directly from God. However three editions and 3912+ changes later is a lousy batting average for the most correct book on earth that was given directly from God.Not to mention extensive plagerism of the KJV Bible which didn't even exist when the BOM was supposedly origionally penned in between 600 B.C. and A.D. 421. From this and other problems one could conclude that the BOM is the most incorrect book ever written and is not given from God because God is Truth and no error is of the truth. As far as compatability with the Bible there isn't any. The BOM teaches that one must earn salvation but the Bible teaches that salvation is a free gift recieved through faith in Jesus Christ.

Some conclusions are muddled or, in my view, considered \\"stretches.\\"One of my personal pet peeves is that this book is horribly edited. It is riddled with misspelled words and other grammatical nightmares. It was horribly distracting. It seemed like they almost rushed this book to print to coincide with the article in Fast Company magazine.Even though it's only 159 pages, halfway through this book, I just couldn't wait to be done with it.

Uh, me. If you're impressed with platitudes, by all means read this book. It's amazing how obvious some of the recommendations are. If the authors had spent more time explaining how to know when to change strategies, rather than focusing on hindsight, this book could have been powerful. It's a shame, really. George Stalk and Rob Lachenauer have published much deeper research in HBR and other strategy journals. They wrote this book in extremely high level terms that yield almost zero insight. This book was extremely weak, basically, it just lacked substance. I definitely don't recommend this book unless you are looking for a VERY fluffy high level concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Hardball is a refreshing, unapologetic return to what drives success - strategy.

Although I love Ernie's swing (his tempo is so smooth) this book is just too general. The only reason this book didn't get one star is because the photo's aren't too bad.

The \\"Getting Started\\" pamphlet that came with the software is so incomplete as to be useless. It's a shame, because I really need to use it, and have not gotten very far in the two weeks I've had it.The only remedy is to buy a book from a third party. That there are so many to choose from is an indication that the authors saw a market opportunity in Adobe's oversight.

With all of its power and options comes a steep learning curve. The documentation is adequate for a knowledgeable user, but sparse and of limited help to the new user.

I scanned an 8.5x11 black and white photo at 1200 dots per inch. The Organizer part of the program would not display it (\\"Image too large\\"). It will display in the Editor portion of the program.

But I couldn't find much to do to enhance an actual photograph the way PSP and higher versions of photoshop have done. The red eye reducer only works on the clearest photos, otherwise it creates a huge dark mark over the picture in which I have to erase.

The reading is very slow and tedious but at least the author differentiates each of the many characters in this book. In addition to the principal four people making up the 2 couples, we have kids, nannys, neighbors, bosses, secretaries and friends. That's a lot of characters. A failing marriage dissolves and a good marriage also dissolves - the ending is not very conclusive but probably realistic as the British guy, Oliver, ends up marrying the American girl Christy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"Truthfully, I haven't finished reading this book.

There is a nice mix between the American culture and the English culture. I went to read the reviews on this book to see what other readers had to say.

I had some minor repairs over the years but nothting major. When they finally rotted off my feet I bought a new pair manufactured by Columbia. The soles split in two years.

It got down to -50degC where we were and although I didn't get frostbite, I had to get off the horse and walk to keep the blood flowing.

James guttman comes across as someone who once tried to work for the WWE, but got rejected for whatever reason, and now holds a personal grudge. At times you get the feeling that he is reaching to find flaws in the WWE product.

I was looking for a non-DMX way to have simple controls over some pretty simple lighting (Chauvet lighting). I figured the lack of detailed instructions or troubleshooting guuide was due to the fact that it was such a fool-proof product that Chauvet didn't anticipate the need for troubleshooting. Well it did nothing that it had advertised. It was basically an $85 power strip. My real complaint is with the customer service. After several emails back and forth I came to the conclusion that either the tech, knew little to nothing about this product or wasn't interested in solving my problem. He might as well have asked, \\"is it plugged into power?\\" that was the level of \\"trouble shooting\\" I was getting from Chauvet.

The first day I wore it, when I got home, I immediately showered to get the scent off me because it was slightly nauseating. And I'm sure I've smelled at least 3 other brands that had nearly the EXACT SAME SCENT! It's really nothing to rave about.

Being an avid gardener and having watched Barbara and her husband on TV, I always enjoyed the lovely colored photos and gardening tips from these two top-notch gardeners. Sadly, I must agree with the other reviewers that the 2002 version of this calendar is just awful. Cheaply printed on newsprint-type pulp paper, it contains absolutely no pictures of any kind. The tips are poor also. I would not recommend this calendar to anyone and I also plan to return mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is misleading!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers' about this totally awful letdown of a calendar. Unfortunately, I bought this on-line too far ahead of time (as I liked the 2001 version so well and wanted to make sure I got a copy), and didn't realize that it was in black and white with no photos. I think that the cover is misleading - it should have a black and white picture instead of the color photo to give a good representation."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for the reviews","review":"Similar to the previous posts, I have purchased this calendar on a regular basis for my Mom for Christmas.

The pack barely fit my 17\\" laptop, and then only when the provided insert was not in place. (There is still plenty of padding without the insert.) The zippers are the small, cheap kind that don't zip well and look like they will break under any load or just over time.

Atwood left to many details unfinished and to many questions unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provoking but heavy-handed","review":"\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is a frightening story to be sure, and is certainly a worthy accomplishment, but I found it lacking in a certain... spontanaeity? No, that's not the right word, but it seemed to me that the entire story was a little too well planned, a little too self-conscious. Overly analytical. The author obviously had planned all the topics she wanted to discuss in the novel, and at every turn she pumps the reader with more sophisticated imagery and allusions. A good novel, but lacking subtlety. There, that's the right word, subtlety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"The whole novel revolves around Offred, a supressed woman in an uncaring world, throughout the novel, Atwood masterfully merges biblical usage with dire imagery to create a totally unsettling novel which causes the reader to question their own beliefs. It highlights the ease and danger in which words and sentances can be mis interprete. The main thrust of the novel is it's realism, if things in our history had gone differently we would be living the life which Offred leads, love it or hate it, the novel displays many of the dangers which we face and should be read by everyone. Just one more point, don't watch the film before you read the book, as the ending is completaly different, and considerably worse, Atwood shies away from the atypical happy ending, that is what the book is about, there is no happy ending in that society."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking novel of our possible destiny.","review":"Atwood's novel is a must for anyone seriously engaging in the field of literary study.

The first time I saw his original photographs I was inspired to work at achieving that level of expertise thru the darkroom etc. Now the times have changed, and digital photography is upon us. All too easy to make a properly exposed images and have someone/machine make the \\"perfect\\" prints. Ah, yes, the golden days of photography have passed and Ansel's images in publications are to be treasured for reference?, or maybe inspiration?

As a professional photographer, and a great admirer of Adams, the quality represented here was going to make the difference.The book itself is beautiful. Simple and elegant. Beautifully bound, and a pleasure to hold.I was very happy with the quality of most of the reproductions. There were a few that didn't quite make it, but having never seen the original prints of these images, maybe they were accurately reproduced, and the original wasn't up to my expectation.One of my favorite features in the book are the opposing leaves that have the same print made from two different times in Adams career. It gives you the chance to see how interpretation and mood can affect the print that is made. Both outstanding, but both very different as well.I would make this purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice collection","review":"I purchased the catalog after seeing the centennial exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

The removable pieces are all little half-arch shaped pieces, and the majority of the animal is not removable. The only part that removes are the back legs, so to speak, of the animals, and the cabs on the vehicles.They are still functional and maybe they could inspire some creativity by pairing the wrong legs with wrong animals, but it definitely wasn't what I was looking for.

I reviewed it prior to the school using it with my 8-year son. It is suitable for children whose parents are atheists. It teaches the child that he and his parents are no more valuable than a leaf on a tree, or the dirt the leaf becomes. It is totally unsuitable for children whose parents believe that people were created by a God, such as the Islamic, Judaic, or Christian religions. The book does not teach the child that he is a special creation of God and that God created the Universe for his enjoyment. It does not teach the child that after leading a good life, God will take him to live with his parents and God forever. Instead, it teaches self concepts which are very depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty helpful","review":"I really like the book. it's really helpful in not only refreshing my memory of the english grammar I have learned in the past, but also good in helping me learn the sentence structure of Russian. The only thing is that I wish it went into more depth very brief on each topic! Still, overall a great but Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Louise Hay be my grandmother please?!!!!!!!!","review":"If you liked THE SECRET, you will love this movie. I think it is way better than The Secret b/c it doesn't have that materialistic undertone that some have criticized The Secret for. It's such a beautiful movie and it truly makes you feel like you can accomplish and overcome anything! Louise Hay is wonderful. It's all about lovng yourself first. Then everything else falls into place. Very professionally done. Excellent! Can't say enough about it. I want to buy one for everyone I know. I love her book by the same title too. I use Amazon quite a lot but this is the first review I have ever felt compelled to write. That says something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to think about","review":"I will send this movie to family and friends. It definitely made me think. We can all use some positive energy in our lives. I haven't watched all of the special features. I did like the positive affirmations.I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very motivational","review":"The movie is a visual aid for the book. The enthusiasm and comments from the various people in the movie bring the whole thing to life. It makes you want to play it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent examination of her work","review":"This is a great addition to the other works of Louise Hay - I did not have any background on her history which makes what she does so much more fascinating to me. How she has come to the place she is at is as inspirational as her message.My one complaint - the woman they have doing the reading for the incidental character they introduce at the beginning is AWFUL. When the film began, I thought I was going deaf---she is difficult to understand, mumbly and has a bit of a weird lisp. REALY annoying, but you can luckily fast forward past her parts without missing any of the message"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must for Anyone Who Feels \\"Lost\\"","review":"My husband had died sudddenly a year ago, and I was having trouble dealing with anything and everything. My self-esteem was low, energy was low, hopes were low. This video gave me hope, inspiration, and so many suggestions on how to get my life back on track. I'd read a couple of Louise's books, but hearing her story was more powerful. I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"I first heard about this when Louise Hay was on Oprah in 2008. I was finally able to get the movie from Netflix in Jan. 2009 and was blown away. I was so excited after the first time I watched it that I couldnt sleep that night. There is so much wisdom, so much insight in this movie and even more in the additional interviews included on the 2nd DVD. I watched both over and over, taking notes and making affirmations from them. I ordered my own copy of the DVD and the book by the same title. The book is a work of art and makes a fabulous companion to this DVD. Louise Hay is absolutely brilliant and following her philosophy has opened my mind, energy, heart and soul to the magic of life again. I do my affirmations every morning and it has already changed my life so much for the better. I am so much happier and have so much more compassion for myself and others. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended. WATCH IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed, Life Changing","review":"This is a video everyone should see. It shows you how we need to change the way we look at life and to live in the present. We really are in charge of our destiny. I watched it several times with different people. Every time I watched it, I saw something I missed before. It is uplifting and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"EVERYONE needs to view this video.

I especially like the complete interviews. They are quick visits with someone who can lift my spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie is amazing and I'm so glad I bought it. I didn't really know what to expect, and found it to be a beautiful melding of multiple great teachers' wisdom in a very easy to understand form. I felt uplifted just by watching and appreciated all of the information. I also watched it with some friends who weren't familiar with the various teachers or Louise Hay, and they were inspired by it too. It's a movie that anyone would benefit from and I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure schlock!","review":"Pure, unadulterated schlock!

Try HIM...He really works!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"This is the best movie I have seen in ages. After viewing a borrowed copy, I immediately purchased my own, knowing I would watch it again and again, and share it with friends and family. The storyline follows a woman as she starts to recognize her self-defeating attitudes and beliefs and becomes more and more receptive to seeing things in a new way. Interviews with many luminaries in the field of metaphysics and self- help illustrate the concept of choosing a more positive way of life. The music and visuals are wonderful. Buy the extended version and enjoy in-depth interviews as well as interactive affirmations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louise Hay and Company","review":"I have always been a great fan of Louise Hay. Her easy, simplistic way of speaking and relating to all walks of life makes her message easy to understand. Louise Hay believes in what she is teaching and her teaching is believable.I enjoyed the visual concepts on this DVD. The ideas, and philosophy are straightforward. There is nothing self-aggrandizing about Louise Hay or the others who teach.I loved watching this DVD as it seemed as though I was sitting in the room with many wonderful teachers and the opportunity for learning and growth was phenomenal.I have recommended this DVD to many as I would to this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book Skip the movie!~","review":"Read the book Skip the movie!~ Was not worth my time or the money no biggie just so so. the book is 10 times better and has the dis-ease list of ailments and prayers.

I would definitely recommend it. I liked it better then sitting down to read a book because I never seem to have quiet time to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its beautiful","review":"What can i say? Its beautiful!!! All my favorite motivational speakers in one DVD. Very inspiring, like everything Louise Hay creates. I love this DVD. And i think anyone who loves Louise's work will love it too.Thank you, Louise!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"I purchased this DVD from my church bookstore. You Can Heal Your Life turned out to be so much more than I expected. Louise Hay is a brilliant, loving and caring metaphysical teacher. This DVD is so spiritually uplifting that I watched it over and over within the first month after purchasing it. The other teachers in this DVD are also very helpful in explaining just how powerful we really are. The Law of Attraction is working at all times in our lives and this DVD explains it very well and very movingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, life changing...","review":"I rented this DVD at the library after having devoured Hay's book, You Can Heal Your Life. The DVD is so beautifully produced and a great companion to the book that I decided to buy the DVD so I could loan it out to friends. I love the introduction to other motivational speakers through interviews. I am now also a great fan of Christiane Northrup and Cheryl Richardson who contribute wonderful stories to the DVD. A great bonus is the 2nd DVD with more extensive interviews, which I watch over and over again for inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch This DVD and Watch the Healing Begin","review":"This film is a good tool to start the healing in your own life. Louise Hay is the pioneer of the \\"heal your life\\" movement. In this CD, you not only hear from Louise directly, but from so many of modern day practioners (Cheryl Richardson, Doreen Virtue, Gregg Braden, Wayne Dyer, Caroline Myss, and many others). If you are ready to heal yourself -- and that means looking inward, folks -- this is a very good tool. You still have to do the work yourself, but Louise (and friends) show you how to take those first steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Heal Your Life","review":"This movie is a very good way to explain the Law of Attraction. I would have given this movie 5 stars except for the fact that I had difficulty understanding the thoughts that were expressed by the woman who was experiencing difficulty in her life. I found myself turning up the volume when she came on the screen and still had difficulty making out what she was supposed to be thinking. Other than that, I was very impressed with Louise Hay and the other speakers in this program. I was familiar with some of them, such as Dr. Wayne Dyer, Cheryl Richardson and Esther and Jerry Hickes. However, I had not yet read anything by Louise Hay. The fact that the book that this movie is based on has been around for so many years is a testament to it's power. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to become more clear on how we create our own lives by our thoughts. When you really get the concepts, it all makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Epsom salt at good price","review":"I have been informed by my co-work that Epsom salt can be used to relax the muscles.

This is by far more technical. The 3d is mind bending. Great entertainment for whole family. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another sorry hollywood remake","review":"For those unfamiliar with Greek mythology, this latest version may be entertaining, especially to young kids, but the story line is far removed from the real story of Perseus. I would rather watch the old version (1981) even with less animation and less gruesome fights to this; at least, the old version is more educational and a bit more faithful to the mythology."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a good laugh and nothing else...","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I was not even a third of the way through it before I started to question whether the director/writers wanted us to take this movie seriously or whether this was a tongue-in-cheek spoof; however, when I realized the director/writers were serious, I was appalled. The characters were flat, the dialogue would insult a child in kindergarten, and the story was non-existent. The only reason I gave this a one star was because as soon as my mom and realized how bad it was, I started to make up alternative dialogue for the scenes, and we laughed our way through the whole movie. Unless you do that (which is highly entertaining but not what the creators were going for I'm sure), don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"Truly awful.

Spend your time otherwise: knit a sweater or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a funny movie!","review":"I thought that \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was so unintentionally funny. The fact that Sam Worthington's character had a shape up and also the fact that the storyline was so predictable that five minutes into it I knew exactly what was going to happened.

It had a few cute references to the original. The graphics are pretty impressive and the cast is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, but I did not watch the original nor do I care. When I go watch a movie I don't care if it doesn't follow mythology or even the remake because I just want to watch a good movie, and clash of the titans was a good movie. The acting was good, the script was good, and the special effects were good. I don't understand why so many people hate on the film because it doesn't follow greek mythology, its still fiction either way. I would understand if it was history but it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"3 d doesn't work and the movie is garbage.

Its hard to believe that some day that could really happen to some of us.But the ending was dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good CGI bad film","review":"I love Greek Mythology. One encounters so much, when reading Shakespeare or Marlowe. This movie however, has no interest in the mythological story as written (or verbally handed down through the ages). Not that the story actually happened, but astonishing how much distain this film displays for the source material.Horrible this. I much prefer the 1981 Ray Harryhausen version."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the original, Stay away from this garbage!!","review":"Story really stinks compared with the original. They tried to rush this movie and used way to much cgi. If you are thinking of buying this DON'T save your money and wait for it to come out on network tv. But I would guess if you are not a fan of the original or have never watched it then you will probably like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"Staying true to most of the new action/adventure films today, this one is heavy on computer generated effects and lacking in character and plot development. It lacks the charm and adventurous spirit of the original. The characters are so devoid of warmth and emotion that the story leaves you not giving a damn whether the whole world gets destroyed or not. Oh yeah, and what's with the recent movies like 300 and this one? They, in a rather not-so-subtle manner, bash eastern philosophy and influence by putting it in an unfavorable light. This movie makes the annoying weasle guy physically appear like an Indian Ascetic. Why not make him look like a Greek if you're doing a movie that takes place in Ancient Greece you racist pricks? If you haven't bought this movie, do yourself a favor and SAVE YOUR MONEY! Stick to the original. Two thumbs down and a brown log out my ass on this one. Clash of the Titans remake, I DEFECATE ON YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; skip this movie","review":"I was pumped up and excited to watch Clash of the Titans after watching what seemed to be an epic trailer. I thought Sam Worthington can make any movie spectacular. I was dead wrong.The script and dialogue put me to sleep. Not even Sam Worthington nor Liam Neeson (He did fine as Zeus) could save the movie. The directions and pace of the movie was a lullaby. Me and a few friends actually fell asleep half way through the movie.The monsters and giants were well done. But, they had no character and died off far too easily. There was no challenge. No obstacle. It felt like a walk in the park.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I recently purchased a 3d tv/home entertainment system combo and have been impressed by the movies I've seen so far. I received Clash of the Titans as a Christmas gift and was looking forward to seeing a 3d remake of a classic film. Even with all the modern technology that this movie utilizes, I'm sad to say that it still doesn't come close to matching the quality and viewing experience of the original. Like some of the other reviewers have said, the plot of this new film is inacurate and feeble. And as to the \\"3d ness\\" of the film, it's unimpressive. My wife and I had a couple over to show off our new system and I found myself apologizing to them after the movie was over. So, in conclusion, I would recommend passing on this fim and opting on buying the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story - Bad 3D","review":"I don't know why some 3D dvd's have such good 3D full emersion effects (like Resident Evil) and some stink, but unfortunately Clash stinks.

They really had a chance to have a good 3D film here, but blew it.My advice - don't waste the cash!Cheue"},{"rating":"1","title":"No special features","review":"Hi I love movies with special effects but I have to buy the Blu Ray to see them. I enjoy the \\"Making of \\" as much as the movie and I am so disappoined that there is only an added scene I believe. To make a movie about all special effects and not include how they did them is a disgrace. Sorry just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basicly A ONE NITE STAND TYPE OF FILM","review":"This is one of those movies where you watch it one time and you never want to see it again. The best part of the movie was when they fought the giant creature that came out the ocean. One cool part I like is when the gods were watching over the world,the special effects were not bad either. Overall I think these type of new age films with the special computer effects are movies you just watch one time and thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy movie","review":"Clash of The Titans follows in the footsteps of the original movie. This movie does have excellent special effects. The gargoyles, giant crabs, sand wizards, Pegasus, Medusa, and mystical Gods are astounding to look at. The action adventure scenes are very reminiscent of those in The Mummy and Gladiator. The acting is good throughout the movie. The costumes are amazing. There really isn't a downfall to this movie: there are enough action adventure sequences, high drama, sub-plots, and sorcery to keep anyone entertained and intrigued. Those who enjoyed Legend, Stardust, and Harry Potter will really enjoy Clash of the Titans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad 3d movie","review":"I purchased this move because I love 3d veiwing. The 3d in this move is almost noexistant.The movie itself was OK but the 3d portion is beyond weak. I bought this movie thinking the 3d effectswould be great seeing the different monsters it had in it but you had to stain to see any 3d effects.None worth even mentioning. If you want to see this movie just buy the bluray version and save your self money and aggravation of trying to fine and good 3d in it.

We actually took it out and put in Wrath of the Titans, and man, what a difference. When something is really supposed to be in 3D, you can tell. Clash, I'm afraid has dissappointed me greatly. Depth and quality of 3D is very important. The 3D in this is flat and distorted. 3D features that are supposed to fly out at you become distorted and digitally grainy. What a shame because it had such awesome potential. If you want a great 3D movie, get Wrath of the Titans. That will make you say, Whoa. Anyone who writes that this version isn't too bad obviously has not indulged in marvelous 3D films on a 65\\" flat screen in the comfort of their own home or something, because they are dead wrong. I feel let down by the 3D. Awesome movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I didn't really care for this movie at all.

The original film captured the classical relationship between mortals and the Gods as exists through out Greek Mythology. The new film replaces that with pure modern anti-God hatred. Zeus is no longer concerned with justice tempered by a love for his own family. Now he's just a parasite on mankind. As a Christian and a classical scholar I was deeply offended by this treatment of the Greek deities especially as it was clear to me the director had turned this story into a piece of atheist propaganda. Accordingly this is the first film I walked out on in thirty years. If you love God, Greek Mythology, or the first film, avoid this film like the plague. One star is too high a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money. The drone of 737 engines was soothing.","review":"I want my six bucks back from the airlines. But, I felt bad about demanding it. After all, I did get to watch a re-run of Holmes on Holmes. Far better than this sad attempt at remaking a classic from our generation.Clash of the Titans (2010) Looks like a cut/paste job of special effects. Super-slow-mo hero jumping over angry beast? Seriously...is that the best you can do? I half-expected Lee Majors and that nunh-nunh-nunh-nunh sound from the Six Million Dollar Man. The scenes were short and disjointed. Big names like Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes should have requested their names be removed.

They looked like scenes cut out of cardboard then put one behind another to create virtual depth. It's terrible. It was actually shot in 2D then \\"magically\\" transferred to 3D to cash in on the 3D fever.The second disappointment was the characters were shallow. The ones in the original 1980 script moved me with their depth and human feelings. Of course the special effects of the '80 movie were laughable.The fighting special effects of this film were a mixed bag. In one hand, it's very impressive. For example, the giant scorpions looked scary, and real. On the other it's disturbingly disappointing because the fighting were filmed so quickly and jerkily I could hardly saw what were happening.In short, it's a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.

I judge them on an individual basis. However the Clash of the Titans remake is awful. The story departs majorly from the myth of Perseus. However not in an entertaining way as the original does. The character of IO is ridiculous. The idea of Perseus hating the Gods falls flat. The riding of the giant scorpions like horses, the use of Hades as the villian - I could go on. The plot is drivel and the acting uninspired. The original was much more epic and mysterious. I have loved Greek Mythology since the fourth grade. I also have a literature degree with an emphasis in Greek Mythology, so I really pay attention to the quality of \\"Sword and Sandal\\" films! I wish that Hollywood would stick as closely as posssible to the actual Greek Myths. They are already fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"What a huge disappointment. The special effects and the first movie (with Harry Hamlin) attracted me to this movie. But the bad script and the bad acting really surprised me.

I had already seen the 2D version and thought it was an okay movie... not the best, but entertaining. After watching other movies on the same level, I realized that 3D makes some movies more enjoyable. Not this one. For the first half of the movie the 3D didn't even seem to be working. There was a couple times when I thought about placing the 2D disc in and finishing the movie that way because the 3D version wasn't worth wearing the glasses for 2 hours. So far, this is the worst 3D movie that I've seen. It didn't help that I had just watched Immortals right before it which was much better in 3D. I really didn't like that film in 2D and though 3D didn't make the story better, it was a visually stunning work of art that I couldn't turn off. Anyways, stay away from this one. Luckily I bought mine on sale and it included the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad.","review":"It wasn't a surprise this movie was bad, it was surprising just how bad it could be.

How does a sword stick into a marble column? How does a knife sever a 2 foot thick stalactite? They turned a hero into a grumpy juice-head, they threw in a gratuitous \\"strong female character,\\" and the so called story is the minimum amount of dialog to string together over the top, silly fight scenes.Supporting actors did a good job acting their parts, but when your part is written like crap, directed like crap, and edited to be a steamy pile of crap it doesn't help that they have strong supporting actors (many of which have about three lines).Don't watch this movie. All it will do is upset and disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another remake, but good 3D effects","review":"The story of old, renewed. Even the 'ol metal owl has a cameo. The 3D is pretty darn good, compared to many other movies - and quite a bit of it. Not just a few minutes throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I needed more","review":"This Movie should have been so much better!!! It seemed to me that whoever paid to make this movie ran out of money and rushed what should have been a 3hrs movie into one that was over just as fast as it started.. The lead actor wasnt that great and did the movie a terrible injustice.. I was so looking forward to this movie only to be let down every step of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning visuals","review":"We enjoyed this film tremendously. In fact, I appreciated the improbability of the action, but it still is great fun. We are watching mythical gods here and their foibles and caprices. What had us totally immersed was the beauty of the visuals. Truly stunning sets and marvelous computer-generated images, in a way they made me think of an up-to-date of the dream-like engravings by Gustave Dore - also truly fantastic. You see a world just created and still in evolution, where the elements are still in the upheavals of development: vast, yet untamed forces in a giant but yet untamed universe.(Perhaps the only misstep is the army-like haircut of Perseus. Gods are never portrayed without abundant hair in Greek statuary.)A miles-ahead improvement on the original Clash of the Titans, where you could feel the clumsy sets and hilarious \\"gods.\\"We could not get our eyes of the screen until the end of the films. A full five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Liam","review":"Not even Liam Neeson can save this dismal tale set in Ancient Greece in the time of the gods. To fair, it's not Neeson's fault that he has such horrible storytellers - an even worse director and special effects that are so painfully obvious, you feel like you are watching a computer game rather than a major motion picture. I have all the respect in the world for the leading actors of the cast but this is just such a monumental waste of time. You can't care about the main characters much less the villains, the sense of danger is laughable and the single redeeming feature of this entire film is 'release the Kraken!!!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK movie, sucky blu ray setup","review":"The movie itself was fairly entertaining. It wouldn't win any awards granted, but I purchased it primarily for the special effects to test out my new blu ray player.I'm primarily rating this movie so low out of aggravation with the blu ray disc setup. First off, I had to sit through the previews without being able to skip ahead to the title menu. Not a big deal on the first time around, but I shouldn't have to sit through them every time I load up the disc. If I ever decide to watch it again, my first thought will probably be \\"Do I want to sit through all those previews again?\\" It is possible to fast forward through these one by one, but again that is a pain.The other complaint I have is the lack of chapters in the menu. That means skipping ahead is nowhere near as easy as it should be. Lots of fast fowarding through previous scenes. It brought me back to the days of VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it in 3d","review":"This movie is great but don't buy the 3d version, I couldn't tell any differance than the regular blu-ray.

Unfortunetly Sam Worthington's abilities as an actor are non existant.How this guy keeps getting work is beyond me? The only convincing act he does is of a man with no talent.

I guess if you've never seen the original with Harry Hamilin, et al, you would think this movie was pretty good. The Kracken was uglier, the princess was not even pretty, and there were times when my sons and I could actually detect the background as computer generated, called blue screening or something. Anyway, considering that this is 2010, we expected something much better. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many previews","review":"I know a movie shouldn't be rated for anything other than the story itself, but the blu-ray disc forces you to watch close to 10 minutes of advertisements before the movie starts.

This new version has crappy acting, a crappy story, and worst of all, the props and costumes look like they were just rolled off the assembly line of a movie studio out to make a quick buck. For the new generation of movie-goers that have yet to experience this film as it once was, this new movie version might provide some short form of entertainment but will soon be forgotten as soon as it is watched. If you want the real experience (minus the cheap CG effects that add nothing to the story or quality) get the original Clash of the Titans and see it as it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Crash\\" of the Titans.","review":"This movie very much disappointed. My wife and I went to see this excited of what we were about to see. Unfortunately we seen it in 3D. What a headache it gave me. I couldn't wait for it to be over and go home.Story line was lame.

I am so happy I didn't pay $12 for the 3D version. I waited to see it at the dollar theater on .75 cent night :)The 2010 version has no flow and very poor character development. What a disappointment! But hey, what should we expect from Hollywood and it's new obsession for crappy remakes of great films. What's next Star Wars?The original 1981 version even with the old school claymation special effects blows this silly remake away!In a perfect world we would get a 30th anniversary DVD/Blu-Ray edition of the original with updated special effects on side A and original version on side B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just relax, this movie is great","review":"I do not contend to be a movie critic but I thoroughly enjoyed this remake of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" while keeping in mind that I have not seen the original which may distort my view from other reviewers. But I have been a long time fan of myths/fantasy/swordsmanship and I have seen many sword flicks in my day and I was very entertained by this movie.Yes there are inconsistencies, but if you pick apart every production piece by piece you can't enjoy it for what it is, after all this is entertainment. If you want a Greek Mythology reference for a university/college paper this is probably not for you, but if you are looking for a visually stunning, entertaining movie and are prepared to enjoy I recommend this for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash of the Titans is a good action flick","review":"title says it all, it didnt have the best script ever or the hottest females, but the girl was cute and the action was good. got it cheap on blu ray and enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the classical clash of the Titans ,so when i heard of a remake i said !wow! this should be good.

The special effects were great, the cast was fantastic, and the acting was great. However, after the first 30 or so minutes, the movie sort of felt like the type of video game where you run around a little, encounter a boss fight, run around a little more, and encounter another boss fight...which is too bad. With this cast, and the special effects folks they had working on this, the film had some great potential.Now, that said, I can't say that I didn't like the film. I saw it at the theater, and then rented it. I liked it both times. Not enough to buy it, or see it again for a long time; but it wasn't time wasted.4/5 stars...solid action flick...fun, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Special Effects!

This film was entirely humorless and took itself far to seriously.I guess that's a couple of hours I'll never get back. : ("},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy cow","review":"This was bad. I was fully expecting this to be one of my favorite movies of the year. They did almost nothing right. I mean, all they really had to do was take the original 1980 script, excise Bubo and change some of the language then re-shoot the thing with better special effects. But instead, they changed things around and came out with a bad script, virtually no character development, and the one thing they did brilliantly - updating the special effects and monsters - they shot in such a haphazard and jerky fashion that you never got a chance to really see it. The first sign that 2010 was going to be a really bad year for movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"It's very horrible when watching a movie and as an audience not feel any connection or even care about the characters and this is what happened to me with this movie. I just found myself truly not caring if Perseus made it alive to the end and even when his friends were being killed it was really like when is the Kraken showing so this movie can be over. The original oneClash of the Titans (Keepcase)has nothing on this one with special effects but the characters come alive and you care about their troubles and tribulations. This new version felt like it was just made to have the mythological creatures come alive in a new grand fashion with special effects thrown around but regrettably the storyline as well as the characters were lost. I recommend the first version with its second rate special effects which to tell the truth are really not that bad considering that it was made in 1981 you will get your moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really is an injustice to the original","review":"By comparison, this movie really and truly stinks. If they had to remake it, they could've stuck to the original story line. Ursula Andress, Harry Hamlin, Burgess Meredith, and Sir Lawrence Olivier had been done a terrible injustice with this movie.

COTT is a fun movie and it does have some fine battle scenes. All other characters are basically expendable with the exception of Ralph Finnes who does a super job as Hades. This is a weak movie as far as plot goes. The plot, what there is of it, is hard to follow and the characters are mysteries and not well defined.Having said that the scene with Medusa is very enjoyable and is a great battle scene. But sadly, this version pales in comparison to the original with Harry Hamlin. Camp will always beat out bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an improvement","review":"The only saving grace for this movie (and the only reason I didn't give it one star) is the special effects.

This movie was so bad I couldn't even finish watching it and I really enjoyed the original. The writers of this piece of garbage felt the need to completely change major elements of the story, the origin of characters and even which god is angered by comparing Cassiopea's beauty to that of Aphrodite. Yet another remake of a 70's-80's film that pales in comparison to the original. Even though the Harryhausen effects of the original were dated they worked better than the CGI in the update.

I thought Sam Worthington was cardboard, that the plot didn't make that much sense and that it just never got that interesting. At the end of the day, Perseus has to quest all over to find a way to defeat the Kraken because the gods have given the humans an ultimatum, but it's just a weapon of Hades, who he didn't defeat. Even worse, I was pretty sure throughout the movie that Zeus was a bad guy, but at the end I think the filmmakers want us to think he's good. It doesn't work.

No style in them at all.Such as the stygian witches scene.They get their answers some weak dialogue and that's it.I liked in the original how the witch raises her first and screams \\"A Titan against a Titan!\\"It had emotion and gust.The acting in this movie was weak and drab.Movies like this rely too much on special effects.Medusa looked too cartoony and did not have the creep factor like the original.The kraken looked too generic and had no unique qualities to it. Also looked cartoony.Sam Worthington reprises his role as the tough guy who grunts lines and that's it.Like the movie, no style, no innovation, no emotion.In sum, this movie was basically an overdone CGI blah-fest.The design and effect for Hades was the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one.Hades was the only character where the CGI worked and looked effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A CLASSIC TALE REMAKE DONE WELL\\"","review":"I liked the original 1981 version.This one is also great entertainment.A superb cast once again headlines the retelling of a classic story.I love these kind of movies.I hope to see more like it in the near future.Sam Worthington was great in \\"AVATAR\\",and made an excellent Perseus.Liam Neeson is one of my many favorite actors,and was awesome in the role of Zeus.CGI effects made the creatures even more scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Remake of the History of Movie Remake","review":"Remake is bad, the fact everyone knows.But this one is bad beyond belief.How can someone create a motion picture of this low quality working with brilliant actors such as Liam Neeson and Sam Worthington?I sincerely hope this trash will not damage reputations and future career of these gentlemen; especially a young and promising talentlike Mr. Worthington.It is sad and horrifying to completely waste two hours of precious time of everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash of the Titans","review":"Basically the same as the earlier one, but with better special effects and more flare.

Otherwise, stay far away from this uninspired, dull, soulless remake. Apart from the obvious flaws you notice immediately into the film, the most disappointing is that this movie takes away all the charm the original Clash of the Titans had. A perfect example is Bubo, the mechanical owl who helps Perseus in the first film. He served as a R2D2 type character providing comic relief as well as being a guide for the hero. In this movie, Perseus notices Bubo on a pile of junk and picks him up and asks \\"What is this?\\". In response, he is told to \\"leave THAT behind\\".

I had hopes of adding it to my sword and sandal fantasy collection. I couldn't take it. It started with Liam Neesom's costume. Nothing original about the vision of Mt. Olympus. I lasted through the giant crab scene which I felt was a ripped from the film \\"Mysterious Island\\". I was waiting for Captain Nemo to emerge from the sea. I could not stomach the acting and particularly Sam Worthington's portrayal Perseus. I kept waiting for him to say \\"Hey dude.\\" Instead there was this cynical little cameo from the original film where Perseus picks up a mechanical owl and asks \\"What is this?\\" Cute. No magic.

I have always been a fan of the original, and thought that even though there were some major changes made in the remake, the general story line was the same. It's also true that there was no real character development and the dialogue was not the most engaging, but I don't think you would necessarily be looking for that out of this movie to begin with. I expected great action scenes and special effects, and that's what I got. The new creatures (especially the Kraken) looked great, and all fight scenes turned out to be exciting.

They regularly feature recipes using Israeli Couscous. I found it once at a local health food store, but it turned out that they had purchased it my mistake. I have driven 45 miles to the next biggest town to find it - even at specialty stores - and it is still pretty rare in these parts.

They often lead to sloppy code that lead to very generic-looking applications. But sometimes they are helpful to do quick & dirty jobs fast. The big problem with this package is a lack of documentation. The 67 page Users' Guide is so insufficient that it only explains how to use on two of the many components the package offers. Even then it does not explain the use of these components well enough for me to use them. If CodeGear expects this product to be useful they need to write an in-depth tutorial and not expect other people to try to figure out the software and write tutorials for CodeGear as has been done for Delphi and JBuilder. The product has been on the market for a short while now and nobody has written a tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice washcloth","review":"I got this for a washcloth, so it would stay on my hand, while I try to wash my busy little guy in the tub.

One station that was only 11 miles away was beyond my amplified digital rabbit ears to pull in. I mounted this in the attic, facing a wall (not shingles). After routing it though the old cable TV cables and it pulled in everything the other antenna would not. Now I get all the locals, with no problem. Mounted it with the Winegard DS-3000 J Pipe Mount, also bought here on Amazon.

This item was rated for all the zones I needed and I thought I would be able to pick up a minimum of five or six digital stations. I ended up with two analog and two digital. What I failed to factor in was the signal strength stations were using to transmit their signals. Even though this antenna was appropriate for zones and distances to transmission towers, it seems like it is not adequate based on signal strength. If I had better signal strength, I may have been able to give it a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy from Home & Beyond","review":"I bought a channel master 4221.

DO NOT BUY anything form Home & Beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"just an 'OK' antenna","review":"I read about this antenna on a couple sites, which recommended it as a great antenna for UHF frequencies, and not particularly directional. Unfortunately, not so for me- seems quite sensitive to direction for some channels, and doesn't have the range (even with a power amp) I'd hoped for. also - be careful who sends it to you- the one I received was pretty beat up by the time it arrived; several element were bent quite a bit out of shape, since the cardboard box it was packed in wasn't up to the task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat overrated.","review":"I bought this on hype and the sad notion that I would mount this outside. I got it from Polstein's (stay away) and was deterred from mounting it, once I got a load of all the \\"you can die\\" sticker warnings. I set it up indoors without a pre amp and got diddly except, KPIX. I know it probably rocks once its in an attic sweet spot or happily on the roof, but I don't see it happening on a widescale in the future with people looking for hdtv from an ota.

I recommend finding the indoor antenna that rocks for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Channel Master 4221 Antenna","review":"I wasn't able to get this antenna to function very well but I think there was just too many buildings blocking the signal. My mother's house is surrounded by several high-rises and I just couldn't get the antenna high enough. I made sure it was aimed in the correct direction for best reception by using the coordinates given for her address, but still it just picked up only a very few stations. I plan to try it out at my house eventually where there are no buildings to block the signals.Also handle it with thick work gloves on. It has raw wires on all sides sticking out and they will scratch the heck out of you. I received several cuts, and one deep one since I forgot my gloves.

The antenna was incompletely assembled and the reflector was mangled to the extent that it does not form a decent reflective surface. The reflector had also been attached to the rest of the antenna backwards. The reflector also was constructed of cheap wire mesh that does not appear to be anodized or coated to be weather-resitant. It looks like it would rust if used outdoors. It does not look anything like the photos shown here on Amazon.The antenna arrived in the manufacturer's packaging, which was in pristine condition, so it appears the damage and quality issues occurred at the factory, and the item was sent out anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good attic antenna","review":"I installed this antenna in my attic and was able to receive all digital channels from 2-66 (around 40, I think) in the SF Bay area.

Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Channel Master 4221HD - It Works!","review":"Very impressed with the ability of this antenna to bring in local OTA signals. Previous $10 rabbit ears placed in attic received 30 (iffy) channels and required A LOT of fine tuning. Channel Master 4221HD - 60 channels in less than 5 minutes of installation and STRONG signals from all but 2 and those were good to very good. All this and all I did was hook up the coaxial cable and prop it up against a joist in the attic directed at my local signals. Seriously, it was that easy.

The plot elements are plagarized and don't really hang together well. The climax and denouement don't provide any satisfying drama or surprise. The book would work for poor middle school readers or good ones in the early grades, but I wouldn't recommend it for smart tweens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great, gimmics mad it irritating to read","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did. The author's use of gimmics such as alternate spelling, e.g. \\"Magyk\\", having lots of words in bold font and random capitalization were incredibly irritating and distracted from the story. A author would would have been better served by concentrating on good writing rather than clever tricks.The first part of the book was loaded with cliche similes that should have been avoided - where's the originality?The story itself was cute but the ending was too predictable and parts of the book were clear Harry Potter rip offs. Too many characters were introduced and so many sub plots were thrown in that few were developed enough and it made the book confusing to follow at times.I would skip this book and find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't get into it.","review":"I really wanted to get into this book, but I just couldn't! The drawings were really nice and I liked the ideas, but the first few chapters just dragged on. I don't know why so many people are comparing this to Harry Potter at all. This book holds none of the great writing or magic that HP has. HP drew me into his world from the first page. In this novel, there is a whole chapter dedicated to the characters falling down a chute, with the author switching from view point to view point every other paragraph. Ugh! I understand that this may have been written for children or young adults, but so were a lot of other books that I loved (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Narnia, Eragon, etc.).

I have been a reader of fantasy and adventure books all my life - I was listening to The Hobbit on audio tape at three years old. As a grown up Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter fan I remember the sadness I felt at the end of those series, however I discovered these books and am enchanted all over again. I have read the first 4 books in the series so far and Angie Sage is an intelligent, dramatic and hilarious writer. She has an acute love for her characters and an eye for the obscure. Contrary to what another review said, I feel her books are incredibly original in ever important sense of the word.In short I loved it and your kids will love it if they are readers who enjoy chapter adventure books."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"This book is full of magic and action.

This is an excellent book for older \\"kids\\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not quite up to par with HP but nearly there and the descriptions at the end are amazing.

I really enjoyed this book but it is very simplistic and predictable.Sage develops a very interesting world with characters that you want to know more about. What I assume are supposed to be surprises, however, are quite transparent and I doubt even the youngest readers would be caught off guard when they are revealed.I still highly recommend this book and I am looking forward to the next in the series.

I think an advanced 8 year old reader would also find this very interesting and anyone who is a fan of fantasy might find it a delightful quick perusal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an un-original knock-off of Harry Potter","review":"Not worth your while.

Granted, it's auditorium is children, whose young minds may not require as much detail, but even the children deserve more than just plot bullet-points. Unfortunately, this author gives her readers just that, bullet points.The author's attempt at writing magical fantasy fiction fails. Angie Sage does have a good imagination, even if a bit trite, but unfortunately she lacks the capacity to bring her stories to life.A pity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"This book has everything anyone could want.

I was much more interested in Septimus than I was in the other characters. I am usually a big fan of writers who can paint with their words, as can this author. Unfortunately for me, because so much of the painting was about other characters, I became a little annoyed with what appeared to be non-essential ramblings. The ending of Magyk suggested that future books in the series would feature Septimus more, so I jumped right into the second book (which I soon thereafter put down without finishing because of the boredom that it inflicted)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magyk","review":"it is very exciting eveybody shouyld read this book.it has a lot of intresting charecterslike say for example the boggart he defends aunt Zelda's cottage when he didn't have to , but did anyway.Or Nicko how he too defended princess Jenna his sister.All in all the book is very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"shortcake","review":"Great book!!

This book was EXCRUCIATINGLY bad! I am not even going to bother writing a long review. I just want to warn any adults hoping to fill there time with something while waiting for the newest Harry Potter book or even the sequel to Eragon by Christopher Paolini. This book was very childish and the plot is beyond predictable. I knew who Septimus Heap was the second I met his TRUE identity. I could see smaller children enjoying this book, but it's a little too bland for adult readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Fantasy Voice","review":"This book is perfect for young adults looking for a fresh voice in fantasy. While there are some name cross-ups from the Harry Potter series, Magyk is definitely a unique work.I have to crack up at naming the sentry of the Young Army; Boy 412 and the stranger who saves his life the ExtraOrdinary wizard.Like Bilbo Baggins himself, Boy 412 comes upon a ring that only he can wear only to come to the realization that the ring gives him Magykal powers.Great pacing, and a fun read for all ages. I also highly recommend looking into the following if this one floats your boat:The Uncommon Adventures Of Tucker O'DoyleNight Of The Stalkers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unknown surroundings and too much talk.","review":"In Septimus Heap Book 1 there is too little detail about the background environment, where this fantasy takes place. Instead this book is bloated with dialog. The reader is left trying to picture the magical world that surrounds these wizardly characters. Read the Lord of the Rings instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obvious, but good.","review":"Okay, maybe I just notice more than other people, but I think its rather obvious that (SPOILER WARNING) Septimus Heap is boy 412. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book, but it could have been even better if the suprise at the end was REALLY a suprise. I was rather shocked when in the beginning Septimus dies, I mean, who kills off the main character in the first chapter? When I read about boy 412 I almost immediately suspected him, even when apprentice's past is hinted at, I still had a lurking suspision that only grew as I read. As I said, Septimus's iddentity is hinted too much, but it still is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Septimus Heap, Book One: Magyk by Angie Sage","review":"I hated this book it was so detailed and parts of it made absolutely no sense.

Many contemporary writers seem to take crib notes from Stanek's works, but rarely give due where they should. Start with The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books and go on to the Service of Dragons books.

I guess there is still a bit of the child in me, because this is the fourth or fifth children's/teens' book I've gotten from the free promotional Kindle list that I have enjoyed immensely.I like the plot twists - there are a few surprises.

I just could not get into her \\"jaded character\\" writing style, having outgrown it myself. I didn't see the point of the story (if there was one). I couldn't make connections (if there were any to be made). It was very free-flow, almost stream of consciousness and not interesting in the least.

The steel is very poor quality.These chisels are not what you want if you expect to use them for quality woodworking. For the same money, you can get a much better set of Lee Valley or Hirsch chisels. I would avoid these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I generally like Grizzly stuff but these chisels are not worth the money.

With the design, as it is, the pusher has to be at least 4 inches into the tube before it will activate the machine. I'm sure this was done to justify the price and inconvenience of having to purchase BOTH the lid and the pusher (as well as to keep stupid people from putting their arms down the tube) However, with the activation button being so deep in the tube, you have to cut everything as small as you would have had to cut it originally to get it into the regular tube. A complete engineering failure and expensive, unhelpful accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disabled without the pusher","review":"The pusher activates the food processor (in the handle portion of the wide mouth feed lid shown on this page), but it not included.

Why are we having to replace them in the first place. Let me tell ya why. It is a weak design. I can't believe KitchenAid, a company that builds appliances like tanks, would put so many, easily breakable, moving plastic parts into a handle just to prevent an accident. Sometimes the problem with engineers is they over think things. This is a classic example of complex solution to a simple problem. Simple problems usually have simple solutions, this plastic heap is it. But hey, you got the appliance, whatta ya gunna do, use it as a paper weight or buy another one. KitchenAid needs to decide whether they are in the parts business or the appliance business otherwise they start to look like Pontiac or other American car makers a decade or two ago. We know where that quality standard got them. Kitchenaid, make appliances that don't require replacement parts or I will start purchasing another brand.

In fact, it reads like a biography - an intriguing look into the lives of famous mathematicians with plenty of math ideas to keep your mind going - all that can be understood with a minimal education in high school math. If there is anything to complain about the book, it is that sometimes it focuses too much on the lives of the mathematicians and not enough on their work (this is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars).

Whether the basis for this reason and logic is 'firm' or not is the question that modern day mathematicians are trying to answer.

When the lid is on the pot, there is a gap on both sides that allows steam to escape. Every recipe that we make requires much more liquid than it calls for since most of it evaporates. Even recipes from the Rival cook book require more liquid. Along with the escaping liquid is escaping flavor. Recipes that we have loved for years are much less appetizing than they were with our old pot.Vegetables are not cooked properly. We cut our vegetables to a reasonable size as we did with our old pot, but even after 10 hours on low, they are not properly cooked.In short, this pot produces half-cooked, dried out food.

After reading the reviews here, I'm very worried about whether Casio will honor its warranty, even though this is exactly the sort of situation warranties are made for. Even before it broke, the pictures taken with the Casio were mediocre and it often blurred itself on auto mode. Even if they fix the problem or ship me a new one, I may sell it for a better model.

They want $126.95 to repair and no mention of my question of honoring the warranty. From reading other reviews it looks as if Casio never honors the warranty. Now I have to pay them to ship it back to me still broken. I am going to pay it because otherwise they will we sell it for $125.00. Yes that is what they are doing. The repair estimate comes with an offer to buy a refurbished model for $125.00.

VERY aggravating. Their customer service line was very bureaucratic and not very helpful or sympathetic either.

Even with their warranty in hand that stated everything (excluding the battery and power cord I believe) is covered, Casio insisted we pay nearly $200. In addition, we have been waiting 2 months to get the camera back (we still don't have it). We're so very frustrated. I would pursue them legally if I could justify the expense and effort.

Buy this CD. It works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Correct Spelling","review":"Probably one of Tori's most famous women-in-peril movies, you'll love this film from begining to end.

To all of you people who are being negative about it -poof be gone-."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen Rox","review":"I know many people did not like Carmen, but as far as I'm concerned she lived up to her potential. Carmen did not have to voice to win, but given the right training she could have. American Idol is looking for individuals with unique voices, which is something Carmen possesses and that is why she had NO PROBLEM finding multiple companies who wanted to sign her. Good luck to Carmen in the future, she is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"I wasn't a fan of carmen while she was on American Idol,but when my friend bought the cd I thought that I'd give it a try. Let me tell you, it is NOT worth the money. The songs are all the same; Fluff. Garbage. Pathetic. After listening to the cd, I came to the same conclusion about carmen that I had during American Idol; she has no singing talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than blonde fluff","review":"After hearing all four songs, I'm sorry I wasted the twelve or so minutes. All the songs sound pretty much the same - violins, fiddles, and guitars galore while Carmen tries desperately speak-sing the words, usually so quickly that it's nearly impossible to understand what she's saying. As far as the quality of her voice, I'd say she's about on the level of (as Simon put it a few years ago) a kid singing to her parents. Pageant-worthy? Barely. County fair-worthy? Only if she's the opening act singing when people are still trying to find their seats. Recording contract-worthy? In her dreams - which unfortunately appear to have come true. The grating yodeling seems to have thankfully been somewhat diminished, but her voice is still extremely weak and somewhat monotone with no hint of a range whatsoever. What does it take to be the next Jessica Andrews, Lila McCann, or LeAnn Rimes? A fabulous amount of talent - something Carmen does not have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carmen is...Improved!","review":"Carmen would've been a laughing stock if she would've asked for a record deal when season 2 had ended, her voice wasn't up to par. She has very much improved since then, but not very good. Her songs sound just like every other pop singer, pleasing, yet forgettable. There is nothing unique or difinative about her voice and i don't think there ever will be until she realizes what inside her she wants to show in her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"No idea how Carmen ever made it to the top 12, because she has the voice of a goat. This CD has terrible vocals, and not every person on AI should be making CDs. Stop while you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $ or the time","review":"I don't know how Carmen Rasmusen made it to the final group on American Idol, let alone how she managed to get a CD out. Although Carmen can sing, her talent is simply not up to par. She can carry a tune, but it's carried in a warbly bucket. If you enjoy singers that like to mimic the shaky, throaty noises created by most goats, then, by all means, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I had the misfortune of hearing part of this album today. She was a terrible singer on AI, and shouldn't have made it as far as she did; she *certainly* didn't deserve an album of her own. Well, an EP, since I don't think four songs count as an \\"album.\\" Her singing is improved by the studio recording (better than she was live), but the songs I heard lacked any originality; she's just a pop girl in a sea of pop girls. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm only sorry it has only 4 songs on it!!","review":"This is one fine young lady who does not put on airs, is not in it for publicity or any other agenda unlike other AI contestants who shall remain nameless. Carmen Rasmussen's debut CD is a testament to her integrity, her soul and her kindness. She is refreshing and wholesome! The only reason I don't give this CD 5 stars is because it only has 4 songs on it...all of which are fabulous. Its hard for me to pick out a favorite but if I have to it would be \\"The One\\".

I only hope she releases a complete CD soon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"I'm a man of few words.....\\"The Photograph\\" on the outside is just as beautiful as the music inside.

She was just terrible and I don't think it had anything to do with her development or anything else, she just didn't cut it. It's for this reason she shouldn't have been given this chance even though she has an audience considering her overlong stay on the TV show. She just doesn't deserve this based on what she accomplished no matter how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"chaos princess","review":"ENOUGH ALREADY.. if she can get a recording contract to sing four songs so can I,actually so can you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goat girl","review":"WHY on earth did this girl release an album?

At least this album didn't sell. (As if it would) Her fifteen minutes were over before they started."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell???","review":"Does this girl actually think that she can release an album? I mean, she did pretty good on idol, but come on! How can she get a record deal when there are so many other great american idol contestents that we haven't heard from yet? And after two years of waiting, it is a four-track album? GOD! What a waste! I really did like carmen on the show though, and I do think that if she took her time and recorded a nice 13-track album, then maybe I would buy it. But I would never get this CRAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only have heard one track, but so far so good!","review":"It's not really entirely fair of me to be reviewing this album since I have only heard one track (\\"Photograph\\"), but I wanted to promote Carmen a little bit. In the second season of American Idol she was known as the most \\"commercial\\" of the group due to her obvious beauty and charm, but what I liked best was the very unique quality to her voice. \\"Photograph\\" is a really feel-good song with both a pop and country vibe to it. I love Carmen's smoky voice and think she has a lot of character. Definitely worth a listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I'm sure Amazon isn't intentionally misleading buyers, but they are.This does NOT include the post and rubber mount, which makes it entirely useless for older VWs.The quality of the trim I received was decent enough, but it was poorly packaged and it was cracked by another item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a must have","review":"It is a handy tool for reviewing, but you don't have to buy it.

The ironing board I had previously was about 25 years old, so ANY ironing board was an upgrade! However, this ironing board is not as awesome as I was excepting. It is rather hard to get the legs of the board down. And they tend to fall down once you store the ironing board. The board was also a bit short...and I'm only 5'6\\"! Also, the cover the of board was scorched after its first use and the cover was so hot that I burned my hand twice. Steam is constantly coming up from the ironing board.

I bought, I listened and I LOVE! However for those of you who are new to ambient you have to keep in mind that ambient is background music: you either focus all of your attention into the production letting the music take you on a trip into your own imagination or you put it on to have something playing. Ambient isn't just something you can mosh to, get jiggy w/ or play @ your pool party. I love where Brian Williams takes you with all of these chilling tones. In retrospect of all of his other work I have heard (The Monstrous Soul & Purifying Fire) this is the only album you'll need to get the best expirence of Williams' work. All other albums seem to be very very similar to this one, yet Heresy has a little umph to it to make it more unique than the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and mysterious...","review":"If you like dark ambient minimalism, this is for you. Sounding like it was recorded in Hell itself, Lustmord has created an eerie, affecting piece. All of the tracks flow into one another as though they are one, giving an experince of a single, foreboding journey into complete darkness. The sounds of tortured animals and humans are scattered here and there, lending to the overall sense of doom and dread, yet you cannot help but be drawn deeper and deeper into this hellish work.

It seems no matter the weight, the cart always goes the direction you push it and all of the wheels cooperate. Also, the wheels are large enough to go over door thresholds with no problem.

The psychological landscape described was sadly familiar and consequently reassuring. As a caregiver it was particularly transforming: I loved the section about the value of defense mechanisms (as well as their downside).

In the beginning, they worked ok - not what I would expect for the money. One of the radios now has not worked for the last year or so. We use them mainly for hunting and can't depend on them at all. I have a pair of Uniden 12 mile radios that work constantly regardless of temperature, weather, terrain etc. The unidens are crystal clear up to at least 3 miles (the furthest test), the Cobras work sometimes at distances slightly over 1/2 mile. The radio that does not work will not transmit or receive without cutting in and out. I've talked to Cobra and they suggest that the age and use may have shorted out the PTT button. Seeing as how they have less then 20 hours on them, I don't feel the quality is very good. I would avoid these at all costs and go with a cheaper model (Uniden or Oregon Scientific - The $14 pair of O.S. have been used in the same conditions for over 10 years and I've never had a problem with them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow The Link......And Save","review":"I may be missing something, but I own a pair of Cobra PR-4200s also made by Cobra. Other than the fact that the faceplate on the 4100s is blue, they appear to be exactly the same radio. Same range, appearance, weather option, features, everything. They are except for the color exact duplicates. The only big exception is the vast difference in price. The 4200s are $25 brand new, while you can't even get a pair of these refurbished for that price. The new price for them was listed at $70 as of this writing. If you are at all considering these radios I strongly advise you to follow the link enclosed and check out the 4200s. I left a very favorable review for them for both performance and price.

I check it out regularly from my video store. This is not only a great video for serious drumming students as it is about a great drummer, Mamady Keita, but it is also a good watch for all those who love a good story. The video follows Keita on his first trip home to Guinea in many years. He hasn't seen his family since he was about 12 or younger. There is the side theme about how political events affect a life. There is love of drumming and performing. And there is the very moving reunion with his family which would touch anyone's heart. Lots of music and dance and the inspiration of someone who feels that what he loves to do is what God had planned for him all along. His destiny and his love are one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on distributers, wake up, we're not stupid!","review":"So much for me ever having this one!

I love cheese, but found myself putting cheese on everything as a meat substitute. I switched to toasted almonds, but this got boring too. Being not too enthusiastic about tofu, and recently going to a vegetarian restaurant which tried to re-create meat dishes with minimal success, this is a much better to approach to yummy vegetarian food...I don't miss the meat or cheese. Also, it's easy to substitute things. I often use almonds instead of pine nuts, or leave out a spice or two I don't have...makes little difference. Overall, a great book perfect for the bored vegetarian, and through making these dishes I've actually learned a lot about flavor profiles and combinations. All hail to the olive oil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition to the kitchen library","review":"Though we aren't vegans, we do enjoy vegetarian/vegan cuisine and have almost worn our copy of this cookbook out.

I repeat, NOT a vegan. That said, this cookbook is fantastic! I bought it a couple weeks ago, but only got around to trying some of the recipes today, and I am impressed with how easy it was for me to make dishes I've never made before, and without pictures to double check that I'm doing things right.I managed to make the eggplant and pesto roll ups, and wild mushroom spread with croutons, AND one of the stuffed mushroom recipes in about an hour and a half, prep and cook time included. I like that there are plenty of recipes that share ingredients in this cookbook, it made it easier to use up the produce and herbs I purchased all at once.If you are someone who is looking for creative new veggie dishes to incorporate into your diet, or new ways to cook the veggies you already love, or a vegetarian wanting more dairy and egg free foods, or a vegan who loves easy, healthy dishes, get this cookbook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 years later, still my favorite cookbook","review":"I've been vegetarian for 19 years and vegan-ish for 13 of those years. I've got my share of veggie and vegan cookbooks, and this is the one I go to first. The great feat of the book is that it makes simple, ordinary ingredients taste wonderful together. Every recipe I've made has been a pleasant surprise at the end. I like food spicy, and I always tend to question the spice measurements of most recipes, but Donna Klein's recipes seem to always get it just right. I also like that the recipes are free of soy products and meat substitutes.Another reviewer complained that the recipes were old hat, but I wonder if that reviewer actually tried them out or just read them. Have faith that these recipes will surprise you with their great flavor, even when extremely simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for vegans and non-vegans alike","review":"I have used this book twice so far to create menus for dinner guests (non-vegetarian) and have had much success. There are so many options to put together a dinner for unadventurous guests (tomato sauce, pesto, brushetta and salad recipes, for example) as well as many options for a more creative, unique dinner. The range of recipes includes recipes that you can cook on a work night, as well as more elaborate recipes. Everything that I have tried is delicious. This will be one of my most used cookbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS AND EASY","review":"I have tried a number of the recipes in this book now and each one is extremely flavorful, easy to prepare, and very fresh in taste.

I hate lima beans, peas, am not fond of rice, and detest vegetable stock. So you can imagine my shock when I ended up cooking a paella recipe using these ingredients from this book for some friends. (It was actually their book, but I now have my own copy.)This paella is outstanding. Simple to make, tasty, and filling. Something that I didn't think was possible with vegan food.I've also made a couple of other items from the book, such as the lemon rice, and have received nothing but rave reviews from everyone.I consider a recipe book to be worth the cost if I can get even just ONE recipe from it that I'll make again. I've already found three, and I've just begun.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Vegan Offering","review":"Vegan recipes should be all about health and freshness--but this doesn't mean that vegan food can't taste incredible as well. Far from it. Donna Klein proves as much with this wonderful cookbook, which is full of interesting recipes AND beautiful photographs. It'd be a great book even if you were just going to use it as a coffee table curio. However, you should definitely check out the underground cookbook phenomenon Cooking com Bigode if you're into this sort of vegan food...go to somethingconstructive.net/jamanta and see what sorts of vegan recipes you WON'T find in Klein's wonderful, but mainstream, Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy!","review":"This book has an excellent collection of recipes even if you're not vegan.

Cut it to the length you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"This IS NOT VELCRO-- TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT","review":"This IS NOT VELCRO. I really wanted the Velcro quality, which this falls short. The edge has little pieces that constantly fall off. The hook side of it is very loose, no where as tight as Velcro. The loop side seems less dense as well. The end result is that it will hold, but it takes a much larger piece, and it sheds black fragments constantly. I would not buy it again. It was not worth the few cents saved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better solution than cable ties","review":"I sewed on two strips of the Velcro to my backpack style camera bag so I can easily carry my tripod. It worked great for that and I have a ton left over to use for cable ties or anything else.

I use this to keep audio/visual cables tidy and to organize spare rope and cords in the garage.

It is basically the worst, most hateful things that Muslims have written compiled into a book and presented to the West as Islam. Judging from his introduction, it is clear that the editor (Parfrey) has a vendetta against Islam and he is trying to scare the West about Islam. An analogy would be if somebody gathers up all the hateful Neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic literature in America and presents it to the East as \\"America\\". The author fails to mention that the views espoused in Extreme Islam are supported by a very small percentage of Muslims and there is a great movement in many Middle Eastern countries (especially Iran) against \\"fundamentalism\\". Secondly, Parfery takes absolutely legitimate writings about the Palestinian resistance and tries to present them as \\"extreme\\", thus trying to lump in the hateful writings of Khomeini with the moderate Arabs who want peace in Palestine. Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"bigoted propaganda","review":"Nothing but bigoted propaganda. For example, it ignores the fact that the US sponsored and supported islamic extremism and provided it with ammunition against moderate islamists in order to fit its imperialist agenda of military control of strategic locations in the middle east and south africa. It also ignores US atrocities in iraq and palestine that fuel such extremism and radicalizes islamists.

The VHS tape appears to have better quality. I am keeping the DVD version however since it's more convenient.

A few years later it was reprinted with the same errors.Instead of buying this book go out and get a copy of Hong Kong Babylon. At least the writers went out and did their homework and put some time and effort into it. A.C.C. is flat out aweful. I would avoid it like the plague. Even the pictures are mislabeled.

For one, there are a lot of factual errors. Titles, release years, stars, and plots are often mixed up and inaccurate. The author also seems to have a \\"more exploitative & trashy, the better\\" attitude--so maybe if your idea of an excellent film is the kind that would be perfect on \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\", you would like this book. Lots of great films are omitted, and his personal bias against some stars (like Chow Sing Chi) totally color his reviews. Don't get this one unless you're a completist for volumes on HK cinema and already have much better books like \\"Hollywood East\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional work to depict a different perspective","review":"I would like to congragulate the Author for his exceptionally courageous work on giving the entire world a different perspective.

Once the set cooled, the TV would be operational for another 30 minutes and repeat the process. I could not get thru to RCA technical support on the phone. I went back to Walmart where I bought the set and they gave me the local repair shop. A technician came out and had to order a part. It has been on back order for 8 months and RCA has no idea when it will be available. Now the unit will not turn on.

I can see why overseas people might appreciate this more than Australians. Toni's character was like a female Steve Erwin(is that his name?). Anyway, there really really is not storyline and the 'event' is too abrupt and quite pointless really. As for the love in this movie...what love? The Japanese buisness man clearly did not love his wife and the relationship he had with Toni Collette was one of those experiments that Japanese people do with blue eyed, blond haired westerners. It's pure curiosity because Japanese people hardly bread out of their own culture unless they move coutry permanently (I'm one of those 'few'). He never actually loved her and nore would he even consider leaving his wife for her. All the movie shows in a generalised Japanese man versus a very generalised Australain woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute, pure, pointless DRIVEL..... Simply embarrassing.","review":"I will keep this short and sweet: in my opinion, a movie should contain some sort of plot, some character development, and a believable storyline which allows the viewer to empathize with the characters. Japanese Story contains NONE of the above. It has taken the Australian film industry back 50 years. What a shame. Simply laughable. A joke. A waste. Painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the hype about?!","review":"I popped in this movie, made a hot cup of chocolate (call me cliche) and plopped on the couch to watch this \\"intense flick.\\" Expecting a new twist on romantic adventure, I was unpleasantly surprised. I sat, anticipating the moment this film would become exciting, in-depth, romantic, ANYTHING. Soon the 100 dreadful minutes were over and all I wanted was bed. It left me with nothing but the desire to never sleep with a married man, incase he might die and then I'll have to explain it to his wife? This movie was not beautiful. It was not creative. The acting was effortless. The story was underdeveloped. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want a prequel to a good nap. I have, however, never visited Australia and was thrilled with the photography. But for that, I would have given it half a star. The only option was one. I rounded up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film evokes mixed feelings","review":"Set against the vast, unrelenting Australian outback, this film explores an intercultural relationship. The brash Australian geologist versus the cultured Japanese businessman. They spar with each other as they set out on a road trip. Disaster and overcoming hardship draws them together.The resulting romantic scene seemed strangely detached to me. As they continue on their trek, the relationship warms up, but still seems offbeat.Again disaster strikes and the last part of the film focuses on the Australian and her interaction with the Japanese wife. The raw feelings portrayed by the Australian actress are painful to watch.I felt quite mixed up by the early \\"odd couple\\" humor, the mismatched romance in the center and the tragic ending. The scenery, of course, was outstanding all the way through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in Translation and Walkabout rolled into one","review":"It is very well photographed, well acted movie. Some criticsraised issue with a slow pace of the second half of the movie.I tend to believe that it was a deliberate choice of directorto slow time to the point when it was creating claustrophobic(chronophobic?) almost painful atmosphere.

If you liked Lost in Translationor Walkabout you will like Japanese Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drab boring film","review":"In this film that wants to pretend to greatness through its use of an excellent soundtrack, decent outfits and brilliant cinematography the story however goes to the dogs. It is stereotypical \\"I want to make a foreing film that people will think is poignant\\" therefore it has a 'foreigner' and a 'european' who must fall in love without emotions in order to be 'multi-cultural'. Unfortunatly it is just not a good film, it has no logic to it and the plot is drab. If it had in fact had no dialouge then it might have worked better and if no one had pretended it was a 'love story' instead the viewer is forced to wit through endless sadness and useless illogical love scenes that are neither realistic or helpful.Basicaly a bad film that is couched in stereotype, like 'American Beauty' to make us 'think' when there is nothing to think about. Kudos to the music score and camera work.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Watch This Movie?","review":"Japanese Story is clearly the best drama movie I've ever seen.

After he and Collette have a low-voltage romance, he dies. The movie then stops dead and turns into something else, very uninteresting. A very slow two hours that doesn't really tell us much. Collette's acting is the centerpiece. If you like her, then you'll want to watch. Just don't expect to be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cinematography, otherwise forgettable","review":"I like a lot of independent films but this one was a disappointment. The plot is jumpy and illogical in places. The romance develops abruptly and is not credible. The most powerful scenes are dragged out to the point that they become silly.Overall, not much happens in this movie and you will be just counting the minutes until it ends. The cinematography and the beautiful pictures of the Australian outback offer some redeeming value for your time, but don't expect an interesting (or believable) plot, good acting, suspense, drama, or anything else from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"This comic has quite a touching storyline, Daredevil coming to terms with the loss of Karen Page by recalling their first times together, in a sense, recapitulating some of the early few issues of Daredevil's origins including encounters with his early nemeses the fixer, Elektro and The Owl. The build-up of their growing feelings toward each other is quite good except for the ending which is too abrupt.I don't actually like this sort of drawing style.

The product title is extremely misleading since I assumed that I was getting Pfaltzgraff stonewear dishes. Instead what I received was Zak design's plastic version of Pfalztgraff's Napoli collection. I am very disappointed that this vendor is allowed to advertise their product as Pfaltzgraff. Perhaps it's my fault for not knowing what melamine in the small print means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally worth it","review":"Dont agree with the negative reviews. Inspite of being melamine, the colors are bright and overall its a pretty set. We use it when the children have play-dates and for daily use too.

Without question. If black men were really this flat and stupid we'd have died off entirely by now. I wish Mr. Jasper (who seems like a truly kind man)would learn what a cliche is, what bad dialogue is, what a stereotype is and, in the future, avoid them. I'm not even old, I'm twenty, and this book should have been speaking to me but I'm old enough to know that I'm better than this, my boys are better than this and the main character, Thai, deserved better than this. We are black men, not cardboard cutouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"an impressive first novel","review":"Kenji Jasper is obviously a talented writer, and this novel is an easy, though not entirely satisfying, read. As indicated in some in previous reviewers' comments, there is a superficiality of his treatment of some of the thematic issues, starting with murder. The end result is sort of the novelistic equivalent of a made for TV movie. That said, Hollywood managed to take \\"The Beach,\\" a similarly underachieving psychological novel and turn it into a major motion picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio, so perhaps the question ought to be \\"who will play Thai in the movie?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Story","review":"Dark, by Kenji Jasper, was a typical \\"in the hood\\" story full of gunshot wounds, loose women, drugs and young black male bravado.A struggle to read because Jasper often comes right out of left field with phrases that have the depth of a glass of water. If thats not enough let the one-demensional characters like Snow Flake and Cuckoo, who never really bring anything to the already weak story, try to entertain you. I will spare you and not quote any specifics here but trust me.I found myself thinking of why the publisher even pick this one up which brings me to the focus of this review. Don't bother buying this book unless you like typical pesudo thug stories with little to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The thin line between good and evil.","review":"DARK is the story about young Thai Williams and the price he will pay within himself when a reckless act of violence changes everything he knows about the world and his place in it. Sometimes preachy, it still brings a sense of purpose of what we perceive to be the norm in today's society, especially with young african-american males, and what we might do to change it, starting with learning for ourselves the consequences of our actions. The murder Thai commits will send him outside the neighborhood he knows to unfamilar territory in North Carolina, where an eclectic group of strangers will show him that in each man lies good and bad, and how you live will determine your destiny. Change comes when you are ready or not, and for young Thai, his point of change will determine how he will handle not only his run from the law, but what could be the rest of his life. A very introspective piece to be read when you are in that state of deep mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD STORY LINE","review":"I thought that this book was a very good read in that I could relate to what Jasper was talking about. His usage of slang and reaLness made me attached to the novel in some way or another. The one downfall of this novel was the ending. Jasper left his audience in a state of wanting to know more about what happens to Thai when he goes back to D.C. But overall, I must say as a first time author he did a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side of Street Life","review":"Jasper's writing is a true gem, within itself. Combine that with a story worth telling and you have a very enjoyable novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY","review":"This book was something that I am sure that many black males have faced in todays society. The story involes a 19 year old named Thai Williams who lives in the 'hood' part of Washington D.C. He caught his girlfriend cheating on him with another man, so he decides to handle his buisness. But, things don't turn out the way that he wanted them to, in fact he does something that he ends up seriously regretting.The book was a easy read but it kept me very interested. Dark touches on the violence and pressure that black males face in the inner city and how hard it is to escape these problems. Even though Thai knows that being away from D.C and his friends will actually help him mature and get on with his life, he has a very hard time deciding if he will move away from there when given the perfect chance.Hopefully there is a sequel:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copyright protection????

The album is okay, nothing exceptional though. And for those who wonder what the two exclusive songs look like: they are not great, especially the TIGA mix which is very repetitive.The point of my review is the copyright protection. I paid the full price to buy the CDs and I cannot even make myself a copy: I wanted to put one of the songs on a compilation and the song keeps slipping. Furthermore, the CD may have hidden a spyware on my computer - this is usually a program that produces the slipping. Sorry, I am not OK with that and will no longer buy Parlophone CDs as well as PSB releases. More largely, I wonder if it is even worth keeping buying CDs.

Pretty comfortable, nice to have choice of 'ear gels'. Incoming sound is good. But, the microphone is pretty terrible. I've tried using this one on and off for about a week and a half. I've gotten comments that I sounded like I was calling from inside a \\"tin can\\", and when I've tested it by leaving a voicemail on my home phone, both with the headest, and just using the phone microphone, it's like night and day: with headest, I can barely (if even) understand what I'm saying...with the phone microphone, it's clear and understandable.

I bought the Jabra EarWave Boom b/c my last hands-free boom broke. The main problem is as follows:The earpiece is plastic and sits in your ear--It comes with two different size plastic attachments and one should be better than the other for you. Some may find the attachment inside the ear uncomfortable, but I think it's fine if it were to actually stay in your ear. You cannot move your head from side to side without the earpiece coming out--this is a problem if you are trying to drive. If the earpiece comes out of your ear, you will not be able to hear the person on the other line--at all. If you turn up your phone to compensate you can hear a little better. That is until the earpiece falls back into place, and then you get blasted by it being too loud. I have found the plantronics boom to be much better, and would recommend that before the Jabra.This is not a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that good.","review":"I purchased this because my other battery died.

This is a series of sexual encounters losely hung on a framework of a boy band's rise to stardom. The author takes us from the formation of the band through their budding popularity, setting up many dramatic situations along the way, then proceeds to gloss them over or ignore them altogether. One boy is filled with jealousy one moment, then suddenly is the chief proponent of open relationships. Another is frantic about an \\"unsafe\\" encounter and then has totally forgotten about it a few pages later.

I don't mind good steamy scenes, but the sex scenes read like porn. I felt like the story was just there to string the sex scenes together. If you want a good story about a boy band, read \\"Do You Know That I Love You\\" by Mark Roeder. It's much sexier, even though it doesn't have much sex in it.

This unit is considerably faster with more features and does not need it own drivers on the PC like the SC101 did. The NAS can be configured to use USB drivers however, any drive used with this device must be formatted in the NAS proprietary format. This means that you can not put the drive in a PC and read the contents. This seems to be a standard with most of these kind of devices.

What I didn't quite realize is just how slow it would be... folks, it is very slow... in my case, painfully slow. I'm sending this one back and will wait for the Windows Home Server devices to start shipping this Christmas season. My config, for the record, was two 500GB Seagate SATA drives, configured to be seen as one logical drive.

The browser-based interface simplifies administration and navigation, so I didn't have to do a lot of hand-holding while the office staff learned how to use it. While it's not as fast an flexible as a more advanced device, it does everything I need for much less money than other products on the market.My only substantive gripe is that the built-in admin tool only seems to work reliably in Internet Explorer and both at home and at the warehouse, we use Firefox as our default browser. Other than that, I'm happy with the purchase and I'd recommend it for anyone needing inexpensive and simple to use network-based storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chews through HDDs","review":"Worked great for about 18 months, then began burning up my hard drives.

It took hours to load my picture and music files to the NAS unit, and actually working through the files was painful.I retruned this unit and purchased a different one. I suggest that if you are looking for a low-cost network storage unit that performs well, you look at the Iomega or Western Digital products. Niether has the disk configuration features of the Linksys NAS200, but both have the performance that you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NAS product in the price range.","review":"This is the best NAS product I fund on the market in the $100-200 range.Great security design. Really similar with MS Windows sharing design. It supports everything at the user/share level, but not at the directory level. - I believe Linksys intended to do this. If you go to their higher-level NAS product, they support lot of more security functions. It supports long passwords with special characters.This device supports Chinese characters.The only issue I fund is the throughput. The highest I got is 25-28mbps for very large files. For regular size files, I only got 2-4mbps.The backup software user interface looks good but I did not test the functions - I don't use the function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, hard to setup","review":"Now that it is working I love it, but getting it running was not fun.

My brother-in-law has two of these and likes them. I was nervous about getting it because of some of the negative reviews I had read.I went with one 500GB HDD which is plenty for my home network. My needs are relatively simple, I just needed a way to back up my data. But this system also allows for creating user accounts with their own private folder. We also now have a shared folder the family can use without the main PC having to be on.I found the set up to be very simple and straight forward.

I am going to try Western Digital's MyBookLiveDuo.I still like routers and switches from Cisco but I would not go to a Cisco NAS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay visible on the network","review":"The specs of this device are great and I didn't have too many problems with the transfer speeds, although they are very slow, I was willing to live with that.What I couldn't live with, however, was how the device refused to stay visible on the network (either via network share, via Xbox 360 over UPnP, etc). Unfortunately, it looks like Cisco has decided to abandon this device by not releasing any firmware updates for a couple years now (seems to be common practice for Cisco whenever a new device comes out), but the problem is a real pain and this device has become nothing more than an expensive paperweight. The work around is to manually reboot this device every week or so (about how often the unreachable problem occurs).Quite a shame, since I usually equate Cisco with high quality, it looks like this one has soured my perception of the company now. I will be extra careful in the future when buying Cisco products."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW SLOW SLOW, you've been warned!","review":"I am in the IT field. I have always been a fan of Cisco and am Cisco certified. This product does not deserve the paint the name is stenciled on with. It is beyond slow. Trying to transfer even small files is agonizingly slow. As of late it is too slow to even use to back up quicken files to on the fly and Quicken errors out. I have to WD 2TB hard drives in it, one loaded down with .iso images the other loaded with files. I need to delete the .iso images but at the data transfer rate I don't have an entire weekend to devote to it. I'll be spending the cash on a new device very soon and will not even consider giving this one to a friend or family member, because I'd never hear the end of the phone calls to support it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"What a shame! This is a great product idea that lacks the needed speed to actually be useful. After a lot of time setting up and transferring files, I am returning this unit. I had the unit set up for RAID-1 (mirror) with two of the recommended 500 Gig Segates. The transfer rates are so slow that it is literally unusable. Also, although the external temperature was not obviously hot, the inside disks were smokin'. I expect more from linksys/cisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended - very slow device","review":"This device doesn't perform at all.

By the very nature of the device it is going to be used to store massive amounts of data and the fact that the speed never crests a few megabits/sec I am not quite sure how they expect people to do that. It is a very straightforward and easy to use product and presumably if you just want to share smaller files like pictures and music then it could very well be for you, but anything other than a megabyte at a time and you will find yourself like me: frustrated at how great the other parts of it are, and how useless the rest is because of the speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"net storage ,but slow","review":"the nas200 at first seemed like a really good idea ,it's set up was easy ,and methodical. but my first sense of its slow speed should have prompted me to return it. it cannot play video without glitching. for a 1.5 TB array ,it took 4 days to fill the drive from my pc ! i recomend this device for audio or pictures only. it's too slow for video. it's net speed is listed as 10/100 ,but i doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay AWAY AWAY AWAY from the NAS200","review":"Stay AWAY from this item! It has a number of heat dissipation issues (just read the Linksys forum postings) in its design. Within 2 days of getting this, and trying to copy several hundred gigabytes worth of data to the unit, it not only cooked itself (won't even boot anymore) - but it also cooked both of the brand new Seagate 500GB SATA drives I installed on it! I'm returning this NAS200 unit as fast as I can, but now I am left hoping Seagate will replace the drives under warranty.If you have a few gigabytes worth of data to back up (maybe like 10 or less) it might be ok. Do NOT buy it if you want a serious home network backup for large quantities of data, where you will be doing long, sustained read or write operations..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a better solution","review":"This is good for some basic storage, but it falls short on performance of any kind. I get better file transfer from computer to computer than to this hard drive storage. Latency is also a major factor with this solution. When copying large amounts of data for backups, this system will often hang and stop copying.Linksys Network Storage System with 2 Bays (NAS200)I am thinking of replacing this item due to these issues and will be evaluating other systems.

Top speed is theoretical 10 mbs, yeah I know the manufacture says it is a 10/100 ethernet port, but the fact is with all of these manufactures the chip inside is only 10, and that a theorectical 10, so plan on half that speed. Just for comparison 10 mbs is slower that USB1.0 ! The reason why is that if these home user NAS devices were anywhere fast, there cheap price tag would under cut the professional storage arrays for the small buisness owner. WD releassed a MyBook world ed., a NAS with RAID and bragged about it having a gigbyte ethernet jack! But the truth was revield that depite having a gigabyte ethernet connectivity, top speed was limited to 10 mbs (keep in mind that number just as 100 or 1000 is theoretical, it is more meanfull to use those numbers in relation to the amount of traffic on the network). Just FYI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit failed after 2 years","review":"My NAS200 stopped working after two years, it would not power up. Cisco/Linksys would not provide any support - you cannot talk to them or get on-line support without paying after the warranty is up.

It's really slow and causes ones network to slow down.

Might as well just get USB enclosures, as most of them are far less noisy.I found this thing had little insulation, placing the drives next to each other, I found their noise was intolerable, especially since it did nothing to hide the high-pitched SATA whine.I have gotten other drive enclosures from Western Digital(SATA-only) that are very quiet and faster than this is on the network.The streaming media server is a joke and trying to mount a network drive and watch a TV show or movie stored there causes errors, even Itunes mounted onto that drive kept crashing due to drive timeouts.It works as a backup, but as a actual attached storage it doesn't move fast enough to work with files in any real way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but better availble on the market","review":"I purchased this product for the media serving capabilities hoping to have this available to my SONOS and PS3.

I thought it would be safe for backing up data... unfortunately it uses a different file system than FAT or NTFS... it's not possible to take out one of the hard drives and put it in another computer or enclosure and read the data.Customer support is the worst I've seen.I still use my NAS200 because I wouldn't feel right selling it to a friend, but I won't trust it with important data.

I hope that this will help you make an informed desicion to buy this book or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!!","review":"I have had so much fun using the techniques in this book, and I haven't even gotten 1/3 of the way through. I wasn't sure I would like it as well as Donna Kato's book on surface techniques, but I have actually found it easier to work with. Perhaps it is a question of aesthetics - I really like the author's color schemes and design sense.

Once I took a public relations course, and our textbook was Clausewitz's treaty on war. If you want to avoid mistakes, to design a sound and practical strategy for whatever your business, then read Geoffrey Parker. In this book, Philip II is judged through the lenses of planning, and most importantly, of results and achievements. Why did Philip failed in his great enterprise? To make decisions is not only a matter of information -Philip was well informed of affairs- but of judgement, passion, and careful coordination with those who execute decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHORT REVIEW ON \\"THE GRAND STRATEGY OF PHILIP II\\"","review":"THE GRAND STRATEGY OF PHILIP II BY GEOFFREY PARKER SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ANYONE IN STRATEGIC POLICY MAKING POSITIONS OR FOR THAT MATTER ANYONE WHO JUST WANTS TO READ GREAT HISTORY.

EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ERA THE AUTHOR GUIDES THE READER THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX TIMES IN EUROPEAN HISTORY. THIS BOOK AND GEOFFREY PARKER'S ANALYTICAL WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL STAND AS THE MOST INFORMATIVE AND STIMULATING WORK FOR MANY YEARS TO COME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well produced but NOT original/innovative...","review":"This is monotonous chicago house. Elements of jazz, soul, blues, and loud vocals (TOO MUCH!) in a well-produced house album, but somehow the overall feel of the entire CD is plain and boring. Not a bit of creativity here. Not terribly bad, just stuff that you won't listen to if you have another CD around.There's much better HOUSE music out there, the crazy loud vocals ruined this one for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I have a crummy old oxford english dictionary i got at a garage sale 15 years ago for a buck, and it beats this one 10 to one.

She is set to inherit all her father's riches and after a glittering performance she is set to marry the Duke Richard Fitzgerald. Anna, of course, is not content. She finds herself having doubts about her feeling for Richard, if she even has any. While her mother plans furiously for her wedding Anna can do nothing but read poems and wait for an arranged marriage. The Duke Richard is set to inherit everything upon his father's death. However when the Lord Fitzgerald is on his deathbed he reveals to Richard that years ago he had had a marriage that produced the true heir to the fortune Ewan McLaughlin, who had been raised in his mother's homeland, Scotland. When Ewan arrives Richard is bitter about his new found half-brother. Anna finds herself falling in love with Ewan but is disturbed for she feels Richard is plotting against Ewan. This was a charming new book set in England!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, SOMEONE, save me the agony","review":"OK, I read this book out of sheer desperation for something to read when on choir tour in New Orleans this past summer. My friend had bought it for $2 when she was on a road trip. In my opinion, she was ripped off.this is an absolutely crappy book with a plot that's only been used four hundred billion times before. And honestly, some of the scenes portrayed made me feel very airsick. Like the cringe-worthy, sappy love scenes. I mean, eeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwww.And the writing is absolutely horrific. \\"A blush that was a mixture of honey and roses rose to her porcelin cheeks\\". I mean, come on, people. Please.Please. Do not buy this book.

And is Annas and Ewen true love going to end or last a life time?????This was a great book!

Yes, the plot is a cute (albeit generic) romance between a likable girl and an attractive guy, the problem being all sorts of family issues. Unfortunatly, the book was poorly written; the writing was flat, doing no justice to the protagonists who were so avid about poetry. The book's historical quality was struck down by the police's respect of our heroine: in Regency times, women did not have that sort of power. By the end of the book, I found myself reaching for Austen and Heyer, the cover being the best part of the Avon book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it!","review":"Yeah he does mimick Kirk Franklin on this cd but Kirk also does some switching up in his music styles. This album is straight contemporary gospel. The beats are tight and every song on the album would be great to use for christian airplay not just gospel. Gary Mayes is kind of like a blend of Kirk Franklin and Brent Jones who both by the way crossed over and get airplay on major christian stations. You may have to listen to it a couple of times though to actually figure out what he's saying in some of the songs. But the beats will grab your attention right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Zone","review":"It is obvious that they do not do well in a warm climate.

It worked great for about 10 practices until the zipper to the main ball compartment broke twice.

However, most just aren't so ... inspirational. This was released at the perfect moment, when retro was really hot. However, the book is short of ideas that are actually interesting - or attractive. The worst thing for a designer to have is a book that bombs so big that you can easily pick it up in a second-hand store. That's where you'll find this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for amateurs","review":"The projects in this book are not for amateurs, so I was disappointed. The idea of modern projects instead of the glut of cutesy cottage and traditional projects that fill most books and magazines today is great. But these projects require that you have a lot of tools and know something about using them. By the time I get all the tools and ruin a lot of materials in learning what to do with them, I may as well just buy ready-made furniture. I was hoping for more simple projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise, so little delivered.","review":"When I first read reviews of this book, I thought that it had considerable promise - as a grad student, I was looking forward to being able to build some nice things for my apartment. The book simply does not deliver.The author does not seem to share the color sensibility present in many mid-century modern designs - in fact, I don't see much color sensibility at all.The projects, for the most part, are not the most exciting bits of mid-century design, and for the labor that they entail, they do not seem terribly worthwhile. For the most part, one would be better off buying one of these pieces of furniture at the local junk store and spending a few dollars fixing it up.I haven't yet seen a better book, but I really cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This is a really great book with tons of fun ideas.

The bottom of the pestle and the grinding area of the mortar are unglazed so that you can grind spices without them slipping around. It works perfectly for grinding/mixing a small amount of spices.What I love best of all though is the attractive colorful design. There's even a garlic & berry design on the bottom of the mortar where you see the name of the company that made it -- how cute is that?

Much contemporary criticism, especially if it contains a political component, is so highly obfuscated that even other academics disdain to read it, except perhaps as a soporific for insomniacs. If you don't believe that, ask any university press how their sales are these days.Blessedly, \\"Dismantling Glory\\" is an excellent book-length essay on war poetry that treats the poetry as well as the subject. As with the graceful writing of Walter Benjamin, it is every bit as intellectually vigorous as high theory without the pretentious language. War poetry has always held a strange place in the various canons, in spite of the fact that much of great literature concerns war; from Homer to the present.

But the question also lies with the recording of the piece which is a bit too held back, therefore losing some details this piece demands.

I recently saw (several times) the American Ballet Theatre's production of \\"Close to Chuck\\". The music for the ballet includes Études 2, 9 & 10 from \\"Études for Piano, Vol.1\\" and two pieces composed and dedicated to Chuck Close. The latter two pieces are included on the CD \\"Portraits - Bruce Levingston Piano\\". The ballet was haunting and beautifully danced by ABT. But what made it so exceptional - so memorable - for me, was the music. How the music and the choreography entwined was magic. As soon as I got home I hopped on to Amazon and ordered the two CD's. I think I have played them everyday since they were received. OK, I am obsessive. I love the music of Philip Glass. Glass plays beautifully. All ten études (studies) are entrancing. thoughtful and compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish!","review":"I heard the Etudes live twice played by Dennis Russell Davies and was very excited by them.

Imagine my chagrin when I bought the record to hear this inept, amatuer performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes - very, VERY shabby.","review":"Mr. Glass is simply not much of a composer. He is trite, pretentious and very dull. How people can kid themselves into thinking his music is \\"deep\\" or \\"profound\\" is laughable.

It was very handy. Good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oi","review":"This book is a disappointment. While the comments by the publisher on the back suggest that material not covered by other commentators is drawn on, a read of the book simply reveals that the author is drawing on the same works everyone else does. Ultimately, the author's arguments that Babylonian or Egyptian sources are as important to TOlkien's Middle Earth are just plain silly and wishful thinking.The book itself is well described by the author as populist, it is written not to study Tolkien so much as to answer the questions of Internet fandom. While this might appear to be a useful enterprise, generally Internet fandom doesn't usually buy books and study. They check out websites, and this is where most of this book came from in the first place: web site articles that have not passed the muster of a peer review or criticism of other Tolkien fans or Tolkien scholars. It would have benefited greatly from either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Addition to My Tolkien Library!","review":"Michael Martinez does it again! His first book, \\"Visualizing Middle Earth\\", brought many aspects of Tolkien's Middle Earth alive for me but \\"Understanding Middle Earth\\" goes even further. Michael's friendly conversational style of writing was easy for me to understand and assimilate. His witty and clever essays answered many complicated questions that I, as a Tolkien fan, had agonized over. Michael\`s writing reflects his vast knowledge of not only Tolkien's published works but also his notes and unfinished stories later published by Christopher Tolkien in the History of Middle Earth series. I found Michael's writing to be neither dry nor boring. If anything, this author has made studying Tolkien even more fun!

HORRIBLY acted, and poorly filmed. Sendak's sets are poorly lit, and are either far too good for the production or far too bad for it. The children's chorus has been added to the opening of Act I and the closing of Act II ... and is completely unnecessary and obnoxiously distracting (as are the two pantomime-like costumed cats added throughout). The only somewhat interesting - however unexplained - element that this production adds is an odd link between Gertrud (the Mother) and the Witch. I don't care for this production ... or the translation for that matter (though its sung in its original German with subtitles). Don't bother with this production.

One was for the phone and the other for the backup battery and neither holds a charge now after only about 2 months.

If there is only one bad cell in the pack, the pack will not last long (from my RC car racing days) and at these bargin basement prices, I'm sure they done bother to match cells up.While OEM batteries are expensive (currently $25 direct from Uniden), there are probably better after market batteries available.

With Blemish, he has changed gears yet again - this is a minimalist album - a concept album - many parts are his voice and a guitar or keyboard - there are not frills - no overproduction - no beatsOnly artists with pure talent, balls and trust in their fanbase would produce this kind of album. It took me a few listens to 'get it'. Too be honest, I was expecting something along the lines of 'Dead Bees' and I was a little surprised - shocked actually.This won't attract new fans from what I gather, it will turn off some Sylvian fans unfortunately.

Clearly David explores the audio landscape like a painter approaches a canvas. However, this album marks a huge departure from all of his previous work in that it is so stark and devoid of rhythm, with only minimally implied harmonies. If what you love about David Sylvian is the lyric and his voice, intimate, up-front and center, then you may love this.

Karan Andrea's songs tell moving, thought-provoking stories and are packed with energy and emotion. You can tell, without even reading the liner notes, that she draws from a wide array of musical stylings - blues, gospel, rock - and blends them remarkably well.

This lacked some of the action that marks the earlier Falco novels which is why it only merited four stars, but it's still great fun. It's not entirely fare to compare Davis with Saylor - his writing is very different and while it is sophisticated it lacks the irony and humor of Davis' work. Read her when you want to smile and let's hope poor Falco gets a break in one of her future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Dodgy relative deals.Back from Germania, Falco again has to deal with trouble that is literally much closer to home, or at least closer to family.

Definitely a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful mix of history and mystery","review":"I've been a fan of Lindsey Davis for some time. I am an amateur historian who is especially interested in ancient Rome, so I've read dozens of books on the subject. I am amazed at the wealth of detail contained in this book (and in all of Davis' Falco mysteries, all of which I've read). Such minute attention to detail not only provides an absorbing background to Davis' stories, but also testifies to her admirable efforts at presenting a plausible snapshot of ancient Rome, its geography, its history, and its populace. Davis' novels are both literature and history. This would not be exceptional were it not for the fact that Davis is a hell of a story-teller. Her tantalizing mysteries are spiced with the day-to-day details of life in ancient Rome, and the result is a fascinating read. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy this one so much","review":"I found the story hard to get into and the various plot masinations to be a struggle.

Beautiful photography and a great selection of animals. We're pretty much focused on the animals at our local zoo right now (tiger, elephant, etc.), but this will be a nice learning tool for quite some time. The cards are a nice glossy stock material but I agree that if you plan to leave your baby with them unattended, a quick laminating job would be your best bet to keep them in tip top shape. Another perk is the information listed on the back of each card. Sometimes I get tired of hearing myself talk and run out of topics to discuss in my one-sided conversations.

The chips are small, and are consumed quickly, requiring feeding approximately every ten minutes. I consumed the entire box in three hours, and resorted to hickory chunks--my favorite wood--for the final hour.Overall, these chips, while providing the desired sweet smoke, are, by comparison with local sources, pricey, and insufficient for the serious smoker. I pay $6.00 for three pounds of hickory chunks at the local Walmart, and get 3-4 four hour smokes from one purchase.

John Douglas, the FBI profiling agent recently called in by the Jon Benet Ramsey family, writes a fascinating account of the psychology of killers and rapists.

It seems like they could have used an extra 3 months to update the rosters (so my seahawks can get Julian Petersen!) and also to make the coach's interactions a little more realistic.Plus, I couldn't stand that every time I simmed a few days I had to stare at Bill Cowher's ugly mug until it was done.

Just saying the name brings to mind a personality as vibrant and singular as any seen in the world of baseball. This short, effective book presents a glimpse into the truly marvelous wit and wisdom of the pitcher who seemed terminally young, throwing baseballs with purpose and precision into his 60s. A pitcher who once struck out 24 batters in one game. A player many claim was the ultimate master of the pitched ball. A competitor with constant chatter and quips. A man who was relegated to second-class citizenship because he was African-American, yet with whom all the white teams of the 1930s wanted to play against in the barn-storming games because he was such a draw. Take a peak at this book and you'll glean a new insight into the man who became a legend. The authors have captured the essence of Satchel via quotes about and by Paige, lots of photographs, stats, stories, and memorabilia all wrapped in a wildly successful graphic design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Bought this as a gift and the recipient was very happy to get it.

Laurie ex-husband came off as an arrogant spoiled brat as well but, contrary to Mr. Wasserman's claims, Russell Dann did not cause Laurie's mental problems. She had those for years.

The accessory diamonds do sparkle and in the 4-5 months I've worn this ring, I've not lost any of the little diamond chips. They appear to be fixed well on the band.

I will just say that Hip-Hop is not dead. His name is Nasir Jones and he's alive and well. This is his second classic in a row and his 3rd overall to me(Illmatic...God's Son was close). If you don't like HHID then you need to sit down with a stiff drink and relax the next time you rock it. You'll get it then. Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This album is a classic. It tops Street's Disciple, which I thought was an excellent album. The beats are mostly smooth and melancholy, much like the beats on the last album. Every one of the songs has a message and despite him signing with Def Jam, its less commercial than Street's Disciple was, there are literally zero club bangers or songs for the ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas never fails.","review":"It's amazing how Nas continues to generate a unique album. It seems he goes against the everyday thing (Well of course, Hip Hop is dead) and pulls it off pretty well. I'm sure alot of people won't like this album because It's \\"No Illmatic\\" but it certainly has quite a few gems, and no song is real bad in particular that I can recall. If your a fan of Nas you can't go wrong, but if you weren't a fan of Nas before, this won't change here. While this isn't a perfect album compared to the rest of the work Nas has put out in the past, It's pretty much 99% better then half the crap being release today. Hip Hop is truly dead.My favorite'sHold Down The BlockWho Killed ItCarry On TraditionHustlersNot Going BackThe rest are good but those are my standouts. It's all about content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again","review":"Once again, Nas proves why he is one of the greatest hip hop artists of all time. He took a bold direction and made a strong stand. He has never been afraid to take a new direction or make strong declarations. He is one of the few TRUE artists out. He loves hip hop and is true to hip hop. He is not caught up in just \\"money\\" and \\"ho's\\" and cars and clothes etc... He still represents the true essence of hip hop which is self expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas is back with a banger!","review":"I thought Nas wish finished after I listened to \\"Street's Disciple\\". However, this album has successfully restored my faith in Nas's lyrical capabilities and choice in producers to handle his albums.I'm not gonna waste too much time reviewing the album, since there have been so many other more in depth and informative reviews written on this great album.Just know it's some of Nas's best work and he's not afraid to speak his mind on this mostly garbage state that Hip-Hop is currently in.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew....He's Back and better then ever,,,,","review":"After that ugh not so great album, Street Disiple, queensbridge's own MC Nas comes out with a great album its diverse like his old tunes mixed with the maturity of a artist whose been out since 1994...worth owning definatly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip-Hop's Revival","review":"Nowadays Hip-Hop is the most ridiculous genre out there. Most of the songs in the radio are senseless and have the lamest lyrics I have heard. Thankfully rappers like Nas come in to rescue Hip-Hop from the terrible trend it has being going though. This CD has real lyrics not just some trashy lyrics with a nice beat. For true Hip-Hop fans this CD is a definate must."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best alsum in the kast 5 years","review":"This is by far one of the best albums that i have heard in the last 5 years....it is a classic from beginning to end... it was kinda wack that he used the thief's theme beat for hip-hop is dead but i can get passed that.... by far the best album this year... in the world of chiken noodle soup and chai8n hang low one album does cut it and speak to generations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomonal!!!","review":"Nas has a gift not even the ones who have been around as long as him possess. He has a way of writing that puts everyone in his place, ad makes you understand the real mechanics of hip hop and the heart the music has. He's smart, witty and a more talented emcee than almost anyone putting out albums out now. The pure experimental nature of the album, not to mention the great beats make it head and shoulders above anything out on the market now. It's too bad that younger people are listening to \\"hip-hop\\" from the likes of Ying Yang Twins and Young Dro instead of the REAL stuff. Maybe you have to be an adult? Who knows, but NAS is the best around. Jay-Z better take notes, b/c Kingdom Come is more like a poor imitation of rap compared to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"Nas is most def. a top MC in the rap game today but this release seemed rush and if your a fan of his previous work such as Illmatic (a classic) your not going to be impressed that much by this album. The lack of good beats on this album really shows just like most of Nas's other work in the past, he uses the same beat from a previous cd on this cd as well. Still there are some good tracks on this such as Blunt Ashes, worth a listen I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music, nice balance.","review":"I bought this and More Fish at the same time. More fish is so explosive that I did not listen to this the first time in the right state of mind. I decided to let it sit for a few days and came back to it.This is a good album. My favorite cut is Carry on Tradition, NAS takes on the responsibility of carrying the legacy of poets and hip hoppers in the past,present,and passing it on to the the future. Hold down the block is one of my other tracks,it has that smooth laid back sound with a bass line that is mellow like Barry White himself. Kudos to the East-West coast collabo with him, Game, and Dre. Game showed me alot, I see he is growing up. Overall, play this when you are chilling at the tip with a glass of Remy( or whatever your flav) and take it all in. The lyrics and music never out do each other, the balance is equivalent to Grown Man Hip Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hip hop album of the year","review":"This is the best hip hop album released this year. Runner-up is Lupe Fiasco's equally intelligent 'Food and Liquor' and Cunninlyngist's unique masterpiece 'A piece of strange'.

Get it now!Top songs: Carry on Tradition, Blunt Ashes, Let There Be Light, Black Republicans, Hip Hop Is Dead"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"who is nas to say hip-hop is dead? illmatic is one the best albums of all time, i admit that. even years later stillmatic was pretty good too. but what gives nas the credibility to say that hip hop is dead? its not like he is ACTUALLY god's son. He might not like to new hip hop but a lot of people do.on top of all that, i like nas. this album isn't that bad either. but he shouldn't start bashing all the new artists. especially the south. i think he's just jealous cuz he's not on top anymore. it's a shame but his swagger has gone down over the years. don't hate the new guys nas, you'll have your place in rap music, there's enough room for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nas' worst yet","review":"I am a huge nas fan, illmatic, it was written, I am, stillmatic, lost tapes ... all classic. This album was beyond dissapointing, it was 90% filler tracks. The fact that so many people gave it 5 stars proves hip hop really is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Disrespect, just a friends views","review":"By far one of the best rappers of all time, his earlier work can not be overlooked, but if hip-hop is dead it is because Nas destroyed whatever was left with this album. I think it is a good time for him to stop so he can secure his place in rap music, which is top ten in my opinion. Another album like this and he can really hurt his standing in rap. I just don't think Nas has anything meaningful to rap about anymore...one of the things that makes Jay Z so unique is that people have grown and taken step forward with him so his fan base understands, admire, and are at par with every album he introduces to us. Nas is somewhat stuck in time while some of his fans have moved forward. What he had to say was more interesting and relevent 10 years ago...still one of the greatest, but I wish he does not make another album as we can both benefit...Nas does not a fool of himself and I save 15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"If hip hop wasn't dead before, it is now","review":"The only track worth listening is \\"Hip-hop is dead\\" which is a recycled beat off of the last album and produced by number one hip hop sell-out Will I Am. For all that NAS is trying to do, he's as guilty of killing hip hop as anyone. The rest of the album sounds like he jacked beats from his old boy AZ. Sorry NAS, love you boy, but maybe you shouldn't have doubled up the last album and made two classics instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Stop Already","review":"This is by far Nas's Worst albmu. The production is bootay and he needs to stop. Nas had 2 really good albums, (Illmatic,It was written) He had another one which was decent but as far as this album goes I wouldnt bump it if you paid me. It sounds like he picked all of his beats in one session at the studio and made this album in a few hours. The name of the album just tops it off as well \\"Hip Hop is Dead\\" If you are going to name an album that it should be like the second coming to hip hop. Instead it's just wake beats with boring rhymes. Hip Hop is not dead but as far as Nas goes I think he might have just killed it.

Using this text in a scholarly fashion is nigh impossible when the author never cites his sources. I never heard of the name Lumiel in connection to Lucifer and there's no information to support the link.That said, the book does have tremendous amounts of information. I don't always agree with everything the author says (such as linking the Horned God to Lucifer) but it does have nice obscure facts, such as the Venusian name of Earendil and comments on Dame Venus (would have enjoyed more of that).

Don later says to her, \\"I'm told you have a list?\\" She replies, \\"No sir. It's just these shoes.\\" A discussion about hedgehogs prompted by Frank's almost running over a dead one on the highway leads to his assertion that in American some people keep them as pets.

I know there're good reviews all over for it, but for me, it didn't make the cut. It feels like it was made at the transition between dinky Caesar city-sim games and the first of the Civilization series. Maybe I'm not too tolerant of oldies I simply hadn't grown up with, but this game seems overwhelmingly awful. Battle controls are difficult and restrictive, graphics are moderately-pleasing but unnecessary extravagant in the tactical map and very sub-par in the info boxes.The game offers no tutorial, crashes often, has extremely few playable factions, uninteresting play options and awkward turns.

Rocks!","review":"Mid-2000 RTS game, ROME Gold Edition is RTS game at prime.I'm looking forward to many more RTS upcoming games.Big Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every Penny!!!","review":"Its a wonderful game for an excellent price. Be prepared to spend hours and hours on this game; if your a fan of strategy games like Civ Rev and Risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!","review":"I love the game for the fact that it allows me to use my brain and challenges me in tactical situations. A battle can come out many ways and it does not matter if you have Superior numbers you can still lose. With the battle map options you ca tailor everything so if used right you can defeat a superior force with tactics and options available to you. The game challenged me. Can't wait for Rome Total War 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I enjoy both games.They are fun strategy gamesThis is one of the best total war games out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gamer Fun","review":"Bought this game for my 14 year old. Loves it. Good gaming fun. Buy it, and your teen will never come out of his room! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"i would like to rate it a 5 but...","review":"it looks like it comes with barbarian invasion but it instead came with Alexander, which i had already bought, didnt like that one bit and had to purchase barbarian invasion seperate"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Scale Strategy","review":"This game is perfectly in depth, for any history loving, action oriented micro-manager.Plus, the battle sequences are INTENSE, full brain power required!Not for the squeamish click & and finish player.Much depth, and intriguing game-play. This is designed, to take exquisitedesign mindset.To truly succeed, every move and decision matters.PERFECT for any student of classical understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this was terrible the game would not work with a compatible computer and they sent it used even though the receipt said new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battles Are a Thing of Beauty","review":"The battlemaps in this game are truly a thing of beauty, from the interesting scenery, to the pageantry of the colorful massed formations, to the riveting, brutal action of the hand-to-hand engagements when viewed from close up. I confess to mostly having played Barbarian Invasion, as I find that period of history most interesting. The campaign play has a lot of compromises to allow for playability, but I enjoy especially keeping track of my 'family', and its additions and tragedies along the way. It would be nice if there were more detail to go with this feature, and a way to keep track of individual character's accomplishments (and failures) that is easily accessible, but overall, my complaints are far outweighed by the enjoyment this game has provided.If I could make one more suggestion, it would be immensely fun if players could be members of the same faction, allowing for some interesting intrigue in seeking favor and the throne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civilization meets real time tactical combat","review":"The AI isn't entirely challenging, but that is really true of all games. Until programmers can come up with truely great AI I will just have to keep giving games 4/5 and 9/10. This game is more a 9/10 than a 4/5 btw.If anyone knows about an old game called Archon, this game is to Civilization what Archon was to Chess, it takes the basic Civilization game (capturing cities, expanding empire, building armies and upgrading cities) and adds a real-time combat element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotland's Shame?","review":"An excellent read to understanding the secular devide in Scotland which is generally never discussed due to politeness. This compilation of essays edited by T.M. Devine is insightful, and sensitive to the geopolitical and religious heritage of all the peoples of Scotland."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little old and dated","review":"I found the thesaurus a little old and dated as far as terms went. It seemed more like it was written back in early 40s and 50s; even the pictures were dated. I found a few terms that I felt could be used for today's contemporary writing; but overall no one talks like that any more (IMO). I was a little disappointed considering the good reviews this book had received. I wish there had been some sort of date on it for when it was last published or edited. It could use a serious update if you're a writer of contemporary pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bald Headed Hermit and the Artichoke: An Erotic Thesaurus","review":"Very very crude. Useless to me. I was thinking erotic romance not porn. Was good for a few laughs though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berlioz - In fine sound indeed!","review":"Unfamiliar with this composer, I picked this CD up in a second-hand CD shop in London this afternoon. I will definitely be listening to more Berlioz! I can't offer any comparison to other renditions, but this is enchanting music for sure.I mainly feel compelled to review the recording to offset the absurd review stating that the recording is 'horrible.' Nothing could be further from the truth! Offering such a review, with nothing cited in the way of specifics is really reviewer malpractice! Sadly, at this date 75% of readers have found that opinion 'helpful' -- a tragedy!The recording sounds great. Pianissimo moments are caught beautifully while sections of greater sonic density maintain clarity. There is really nothing to complain of.I only reserve a star because I cannot claim that this is a definitive recording of the work -- my own ignorance of Berlioz there. The additional star may well be deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beuatiful Music, Horrible Sound-Quality","review":"This music by Berlioz is simply beautiful and, so far as I could tell, the musicians' performance of it was fine. But this CD has a big problem: utterly HORRIBLE sound-quality. I actually feel cheated to have paid good money for such a poor-sounding disc.Moreover, the other \\"LSO Live\\" disc I own, a Brahms recording, sounds even worse than this one does! I think I'll never be tempted to try another one from this label."},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE FOR LITTLE ONES","review":"Today, March 12, 2005 we checked out this book from our public library. My 3 yr old was looking at it in the car when my older child said \\"Mom, is that book really appropriate for her?\\" I looked back and my 3 yr old was staring with her eyes wide at a picture of an ax in the head of a dragon and blood dripping. Very inappropriate. 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"At That Price...","review":"Even though I think that it might be interesting to read some of Patton's poetry, at that price, I believe I'll wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless and inefficient","review":"The wipes are warmed only for about 2 seconds after pulling it out. As soon as you begin wiping, they're just as cold as they would have been without the warmer. Also, the cord is inconvenient if you need to change the baby in another room because you can't just take the box of wipes with you (also inconvenient if you don't have a plug located by your diaper changing station). The plug is super bulky and gets extremely warm, which made me a little nervous. After a few weeks of using the product, the lid stopped closing all the way. So when I would pull a wipe out, the whole lid would bob up. Also, this resulted in the top several wipes getting dried out (and the middle wipes, when i pulled from there, were not even warm). I wish I could have gotten a refund on this product, but when I took it back to target I found that they had discontinued selling the product and wouldn't re-stock it. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 years and going strong!","review":"I got this wipes warmer for my first son, who is 4 1/2. My 2nd son was born before my first was potty-trained. So we have used this wipes warmer every day for 4 1/2 years. I love it. It still works just like new, is easy to add wipes, I've even been able to add them with one hand mid-diaper change. Even if you don't necessarily need the \\"Warm\\" feature, it would be great to just hold your wipes. Providing a sturdy place for them where you can grab one and the container doesn't lift up, making it hard to pull one out. I would buy another in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but doesn't cut it","review":"Well I should have listened when I was warned that wipe warmers are a waste of money. The problem isn't that they don't work, it's that they don't work for long enough - literally seconds after removing a warmed wipe from the warmer, it's cold again. My 4 week old daughter hasn't responded any differently to the warmed wipe than she does to one at room temperature. She hates her diaper changed and most of the time cries until it's over. Maybe if the temperature was at a higher setting in the warmer, they wouldn't get cold so quickly ...but then again I would never want to risk burning a baby either. Bottom line: wipe warmers are money in the bank for companies who play on parents who feel guilty doing anything that makes their baby cry. I fell for it - maybe writing an honest review might save you from falling for it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Plug","review":"The plug at the wall got very hot...I googled it and found that this is a very common problem with this product. I emailed the manufacturer. They instructed me to mail the product back and they would replace the item under the warranty. I had to pay shipping and it took 2 weeks to receive the replacement. When the replacement product arrived I plugged it in...within 24 hours the plug was super hot again. I emailed the manufacturer again and did not hear back (it has now been a week waiting for reply). Save yourself the trouble and by a different brand. My baby did like the warm wipes and I had less trouble getting him to sleep with middle of the night changes for the few days I was able to use the warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I like the way it's made, but disappointed that the wipes are about room temperature. A warmer needs to get the wipes almost hot in order to have a nicely warmed wipe by the time it reaches the baby's bottom. I'm sure the manufacturers can fix this issue...If there are smart, they will read these reviews!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],O={key:0},H={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",W,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-433b1776"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/1.md","filePath":"sponsor/1.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/1.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
