I am a big Incubus fan and was tricked into buying this album. It doesn't at all sound like the Incubus most people recognize. Their skills are admittedly great for a bunch of sixteen-year-olds, but that doesn't mean the music is acceptable by any standards. I can barely listen through two songs in a row. The songs are choppy, thrown together with a maximum of notes and beats, but no rhythm or structure whatsoever. PLEASE spend your money on something more worthwhile. This is trash. Brandon Boyd even admits that it is terrible inside the CD cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing compared with their new stuff","review":"When I heard that Incubus had released a CD of their old music, i ran to the store imediately to buy it. I thought that it might not be as profesional as their newer works but still, it was Incubus so it couldn't be bad. When i put it in my cd player i thought that i had buyed the wrong CD! The style is completely different from their new rock alternative music. It is more reggae and slower then their new stuff. So if you like stellar, pardon me, and make yourself, this is deffinetely not the CD to buy. It has some good songs but overall it isn't worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is weak","review":"This album is weak and hard to listen too. when you listen too it sounds like everything is all over the place and this album would be last on my list for recomendations.

He calles this \\"getting your number up\\" and it is the only theme in this very shallow, psycho techno babble heavy book. Under the pretense of being a \\"coach\\", the author explains why it is important to go to new places, to meet new people, and date anyone for the experience. Wrought with over analysis and jargon jibberish, the book explains the blantantly obvious to the truly clueless and hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"an almost \\"purr-fect\\" cat encyclopedia","review":"After buying many encyclopedia cat books (6 in all) and continually being disappointed in the lack of detailed information on many subjects, such as the differences in personalities among the various breeds, I have finally found, what I believe, is the definitive book on cat breeds. Ms. Helgren has taken her time to explain the dissimilarities among each breed and has done so in an extremely interesting and concise profile form. She has used easy to read charts for showing the various levels of behavior and general care concerns for each type. There's even a chapter on how to choose the best cat for YOUR personality. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is either beginning a search or just wants to find out more about these wonderful feline companions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I agree wholeheartly with the reader from California. If you are considering purchasing a cat, you will find this book to be helpful. I also enjoyed the chapter about the history of cat organizations. The author remains neutral about all the various groups, but it appears as if some of them would like to scratch the others eyes out! Talk about being \\"catty\\"! I had no idea where were so many cat associations. This book has it all - great pictures, detailed ratings of each breed's characteristics, and well written personality trait descriptions.

Just loved the the new characters as well as seeing old one's as well, all those muscle bound men & Wynn is no small petite shrinking violet. I wonder if Lori's new book \\"Just a hint Clint\\" due out soon is about the Clint in this story, I hope so. There is one very funny part where Mich, Zach & Josh are oggling Wynn through the the kitchen window & Danni shouts to Wynn that they're peeping tomming her. It had me in stitches especially when they dropped down behind the kitchen sink & then had to stand up & face her. This series just gets better with every new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!

It was a book that applied science to reality, and did it interestingly.Faster is several hundred pages of complaints. He decries the speed of society on one page, and complains about how slow it is in others. He doesn't actually explain or educate like his other books. He just rants and whines, and expects the reader to enjoy it.It isn't worth it. Treasure that book you loved, and skip this one you won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Newspaper Article Blown Into a Book","review":"This would have been fun to read at dinner or on a train - but too superficial to spend several evenings with the book. The book on the history of time by Landes, whom Gleick quotes, was much more serious, uniting technology and history. This one is too fast to be deep. The thing that pleased me about this book was that Gleick was being productive. Local papers reported that he suffered a terrible personal tragedy last year - it's great that he could work despite it. Well, thank you amazon for your generous return policy - this book is going back to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Waster","review":"I did read it all, cover to cover in about 3 hours, so it kept my attention, but when I was done, I realized I had just wasted three hours. There are lots of mildly interesting facts of no consequence whatsoever. There is no thesis - a big disappointment. I was looking for some kind of analysis or value judgment about whether the significant opportunities available by living faster are worth the sacrifice of thoughtfulness. Also, his phenomenology is weak. We don't press the \\"door closed\\" button because we can't stand to wait 5 more seconds, we do it because we resent being held against our will by the machine, and by the implied economic machine that provided it. We punch out of impotent frustration more than impatience. Gleick doesn't dig deeply into anything - a demonstration of the price you pay for going faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly disappointing","review":"After having read Gleick's \\"Genius\\" and \\"Chaos\\", I expected much much more. This is a superficial, nearly pointless discussion of the cheapness and frantic pace of our lives...We all already know that! I guess the author just needed a few more bucks in his bank account. I have a background in physics and the study of time both on a physical and a social level, and a thorough education on societies, calendars, timekeeping and timepieces. None of these topics was very well discussed here. As a matter of fact, not much of anything was discussed very well here.. Superficial and pointless. I have the distinct impression that the title was taken from what the publisher must have kept telling the author during the book's writing. Don't buy this book. If you must, borrow it from a library, and spend as little \\"time\\" on it as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Anecdotes","review":"However, I can't help but to feel that Gleick is in a state of extreme sarcasm or anger when he's writing this book. Taking potshots at the technology around him and making fun of advances that has made our lives a little bit better.Gleick has a knack of turning everyday occurances into scientific observations. He's like Dilbert doing science rather than office politics.Although I enjoyed Genius and Chaos, I can't say that his current writing hold its own. It's just too banal if you're working as an engineer or a scientist yourself.Since there's no such thing as 2.5 stars, i'll have to give him 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word....SKIP!","review":"I'm fairly sorry that I read this book. It's very little on science and a lot on philosophical ramblings. I wish he kept to a series of single points rather than throwing bucket loads of info at the reader and jumping around from sentence to sentence. I'm quite sure I won't remember much from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast, Run Away from this book","review":"Catchy title, catchy subject. But the author does nothing other than identify and complain about a wide variety of time issues in life...very anecdotal. At the same time he is complaining, he chose to write in an MTV short snippet style that epitomizes the problem.The author complains that there are too many choices of mustard, so we even lose time trying to select the \\"right\\" one.In an earlier era, I think the author would complain about the automobile...does it really save time he would ask? Before you know it you have to stop and fill up with gas not to mention tune-ups and tire changes.At no time does he sit back and spend some time to reflect on the issue. He offers no new insights. Run do not walk AWAY from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book describes how we want things done faster, and how things have gotten faster, but there are no real insights, or depth, or theories underlying this obvious assertion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better As A Magazine Article","review":"I just finished reading this book last night and wanted to write this review while I could still remember what I read. Mr. Gleick throws so much information at you and most of it is so obvious that this is not the kind of book that will stay with you. There is some attempt at analysis but not that much. This book would have been better as a magazine article because Mr. Gleick could have made his point in a much shorter format. Other than giving us a lot of examples of how technology has accelerated our lives he just doesn't have all that much to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Never coalesces to a message and point.","review":"Sadly disappointing from the same author of the wonderful book -Chaos-. Why did Gleick release this abortion? What was he thinking? This book is nothing more than snippets of today's developed world nanosecond cadence. Unless you're not part of this society (or living in a Montana hut), it's not news. This book has absolutely no flow and reads as if it was just cut-and-paste together in a haphazard fashion re: examples w/o any intent to author's -MESSAGE-. Yeah, things are moving much faster. And will continue to be even more this way. ...So? We know this. What's the point? Good insight if you don't live in this impatient developed world (meaning especially the United States). Else, an embarrassment to, at other times, fantastic author Gleick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown, and an endless list of things we already know...","review":"Faster: tends to wander aimlessly without providing any new insights into our lives or the human condition. The author claims that shorter commercials and movies must include action and explosions to hold us, that our attention spans are decreasing... Faster: doesn't help this situation by not providing an interesting read like Chaos. Maybe I would have finished it had he included a few explosions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Any book is an instant classic to Amazon if it's publisher can pay sufficent graft to their reviewers, Gleick is probably in the pay of multinational's, his science is ill founded, he has no understanding of thermodynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we compress time further? Gleick investigates!","review":"A good book, well worth the read. I bought it because I trusted Gleick to do the subject justice, and he does. We look at how Western society is getting more obsessed with time, and the subject matter is broken into manageable chunks, written in Gleick's everyday style. Everything from how scientist are recording minute periods of time (splitting the 'time atom'?) to the psychology behind elevator design and their recognition of human time related behaviour. Pretty much confined to the technologically advanced part of the planet, but this does not detract from the observations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing enlightening, but a fun read!","review":"Gleick's \\"Faster\\" is not an \\"improve your life\\" book, nor is it an in-depth study of things that make our lives seem faster today. In my eyes, that the book is neither of these is its biggest strength.\\"Faster\\" does not develop a clear thesis, but presents the reader with a variety of situations, devices, and actions that he claims speed up and stress our lives. He leaves it up to the reader to develop their own point of view on the subject (pointing in a certain direction, however).The funnest part of this book was relating the statistics he uses to family and friends (they are TRULY memorable statistics) and absorbing them myself.Overall, nothing spectacular, but well worth the read... if you have the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read - good for commuting","review":"I was a bit disappointed not to see FASTER organized into discrete chapters. I guess this is indicative of the topic of the book--everyone is in a hurry. Don't expect any deep insights into quantum physics or science here. I read it on the train commuting to work. The short chapters have kernals of information that you can use when you want to impress someone at your next social event. I wouldn't buy the book, check it out of the library. Its faster that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"staggering, original, thought-provoking","review":"Really amazing book. Looks easy and obvious and you laugh out loud sometimes but I feel it's really deeper than his classic book, Chaos. More subtle, more powerful. It stays with you. No cheap answers here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book and brings things into focus","review":"James Gleick covers a wide area of our daily lives, and how things have changed regarding the value of time. Apparently time has never been so short than in our days. Interesting perspective, and a book that brings things into focus with subjects discussed from marriage to work and everything in between, as we continue to waste time. Great and wonderful writing make it an enjoyable read. Another book that has helped me to manage my time, especially on the chapters of Making Time for Yourself, and the Marriage & Sex chapter, as well the topic of a Perfect Life discussed, and a book that I highly recommend is Dietmar Scherf's \\"I Love Me: Avoiding & Overcoming Depression\\"--also sold at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although there are interesting little tidbits, it seems like the book doesn't have much of an argument nor does it tell us anything new apart from the usual \\"people get too caught up in the speed of the information age\\"-type thing. A lot of the things he mentions are almost too obvious. The book's message seems to be simply \\"Maybe you should slow down\\". But there are no solutions offered, nor did I need to read an entire book to get this message. Buy Chaos instead if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro into a largely unstudied area.","review":"I liked the book, but ironically enough I found it a little slow. One of the problems was that Gleick seemed to have a particular bend, but struggled not to show it. Use of terms like \\"hurry sickness\\" belie the centrist view carried through the book. Many of the issues being covered are not historical, the ideas about cyberspace and the effect it will have on our society are largely speculative. With the important ramifications for society it would seem only natural to pick a solid stance but the author retains a dispassionate tone. The book was informative and a good introduction to a largely unstudied area: time \\"saving\\" devices and the changes that they make on our culture. The many interesting tidbits, insights, and humorous asides garnered a 4 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This book is full of pseudo-science and over-dramatic catchphrases. Appropriate for a \\"best-seller\\" type novel but not for a serious discussion of humanistic philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for mothers","review":"This book is fantastic. It is easy to read. I loved the format. It is filled with great ideas that made me stop and think about my relationship with my daughter. I applied a few of the messages that the author suggested in her book and I was shocked at the positive response I received. I would suggest it to any mother. It is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully put together.","review":"The book is a wonderful collection of thoughts and ideas as they relate to mothers and teen-age daughters. The Book flows well for the reader. A very good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice","review":"This book is great. There are many sections in the book that are very specific. All of the sections are helpful. One for example is about analyzing love vs. need. The author asks that whenever you (a mother) feels pain, fear, or anger towards your daughter, ask youself why and is it because your needs are not being met. If so, the love you feel for her may turn into disappointment or negative emotions. There are many, many topics like this one. What I like most is that she always follows up with a message message that helps me word what I'm trying to communicate to my daughter. This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good. Get their others first.","review":"The worst goldfinger album in my opinion. Maybe it's because i just don't like ska so much, but that doesn't change the fact that i dont even like the more punk songs on here. Superman is the only song here i would rate in goldfinger's 20 best songs. Any other goldfinger album is good, just steer away from this until you become a fan of the other ones first."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not time to hang up just yet!","review":"This Goldfinger album is one of my favorites! I don't think it is quite as good as the first one but it does have that original Goldfinger style. I am still waitng out the arival of their new album.

Congrats on a great album, Goldfinger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than their debut...","review":"This album had to grow on me A LOT. I think it's better than their debut, but it still isn't up to par to Home Grown or Kemuri, in my opinion. A nice combination of Punk and Ska, especially in \\"Superman.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"what can i day","review":"Goldfinger is just a feel good band, they sound a lot like less than jake and reel big fish, but they are soo good, superman is a great song on the cd. go now and buy this gem"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Goldfinger Great","review":"This is an overall good cd. This one is more laid back and more mellow than their first album. The reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because of that hidden track. Comon, who wants to listen to nothing for 30 minutes, then about 5 seconds of a live track. But while there is music on the cd, its great. Out of their 3 albums this one has more ska. I would have to say that the best song is Cris Claton. That song is filled with energy and is catchy. Along with the rest of the album, there are great songs, then songs that arent that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang - Ups is pure genius","review":"This CD is amazing and the mix of punk/ska is perfectly balanced. Superman and Chris Cayton are in a world of their own. The rest of the songs are merely brilliant, infact they are better than brilliant. I really would not rate any song on this CD less than great."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I have a CD collection of over 200 cd's, and this could be the best I own. Superman is amazing, Chris Caton is amazing, 20c Goodbye is amazing, they all are! If you like Less than Jake, Real Big Fish, or the Hippoes, you will love this! I can't wait 'till Stomping Ground comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Upbeat Ska from an Underappreciated Band","review":"Hang Ups is a more \\"pop\\" follow-up to Goldfinger's self-titled debut and it should have received wide radio airplay. There are a number of very catchy ska tunes on the album, including the first cut \\"Superman\\" as well as \\"20 cent goodbye\\". Of all the disks I bought in 1997 (and I bought alot), this one received the heavist rotation. Great for playing on a summer day, driving on the freeway with the windows down. This band is extremely talented and, I think, one of the best ska-core bands out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real step down from their first","review":"The first self titled Goldfinger album rocked, but this one just plain sucked. They changed around their style too much and moved away from punk and towards ska. Not to say ska is bad, but Goldfinger can't do it right. They should have stuck with punk. There's a couple good songs (\\"Superman,\\" \\"SMP\\") but most are just horribly put together ska songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless....","review":"Goldfinger is one of the most innovative bands ever. They combine 4 different music styles perfectly to create a killer cd. The lyrics are awesome and John can really jam on that guitar. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldfinger Rules!!!","review":"I was going to buy their self-titled album cuz I liked \\"Here In Your Bedroom.\\" But I got this one instead. It was awesome!!! I was hooked on it! I couldn't stop listening for more than a week! Buy this CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!!","review":"I've had this CD ever since it came out and i still pop it in my cd almost every day. I love every single song on it, from Superman to If only. I love the diversity on this cd, it has punk, ska, regae... anything you could ever want. Oh yeah, the lyrics on \\"if only\\" rock as well as the tune so i don't know what the guy who said its trash is talking about... All in all this is probably one of, if not THE best cd in my collection. If you are a close minded punk @$$ kid who only listens to punk or ska don't buy this cd.

I thought I could get a decent mouse under $20 ($16.95 at Best Buy) but that doesn't seem to be the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dodgy tracking.","review":"This mouse is extremely hard to get used to. There seems to be a threshold involved where if you move your mouse beyond a certain speed it suddenly is much more responsive - increasing the speed of your mouse does not smoothly increase the speed of your cursor. The speed of your cursor will suddenly become much faster. It's annoying as all get-out, and as a gamer, this mouse is next to worthless to me.One star is for functioning properly, the other is for the well-implemented forward/back browser buttons on the mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome mouse!","review":"I absolutely love this mouse. My dad got it for me today at Best Buy. It looks really sleek, and it works great, too. Sure it has the scroll wheel thigie in the middle, but it even has two buttons on the side of it that move forward and backward in your internet browser. This is the replacement to moving your mouse to the back or forward button.Another thing I like about this mouse it that it has a USB/PS/2 port. My brand new computer that I just got about two weeks ago doesn't have a PS/2 port, so I popped in the USB port. I thought that was really handy.The cursor moved a little fast when I first plugged it in, but I got used to it. Anyways, I highly recommend this awesome mouse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....","review":"This book claims 'games' which it does not have. It has one side which is the normals, which only goes into massage, having fun with food, etc. The other side is heavily into bondage, chains, whips, punishment. This book gave us nothing new and interesting to try that we would want to try. Overall we were very disapointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment!","review":"I hate to be blunt, but quite frankly, most of the \\"games\\" in this book will probably have occured to just about anyone with much experience with their partner. And if you and your partner are a new couple, just starting out, it's unlikely you've got the kind of trust built yet to sit down and go through the book together. I suppose one or two new ideas might get generated, but most of this stuff is fairly basic. Surprise your lover, take a bath together, gently tie him/her up, drink champagne, etc. etc. Also, if you're looking for anything explicit in the text, look further. It is quite tame. The photos are soft core and not terribly inspiring either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accounts of water milfoil growth don't get much better than this","review":"For all of you who are distracted from your daily routine as the thoughts and questions of the distribution, growth, and phosphorus relationships of water milfoil are running through your heads, look no further.

But the only way to understand what I am trying to say is to hear his first two productions: \\"another look\\" and \\"paradise station\\".My intents of explanation about what I feel about the Torcuato's music are not enough.

The writing has an amazing range, too -- it's at once full of insight and self-loathing. It's like watching a brilliant person dance with their insecurities. Im actually really looking forward to his next book, and I can rarely say that about writers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story Burnt at Both Ends","review":"Nick Fowler has captured the ever changing montage of his generation in the constant quoting of song and slogans to explain a love that, once it had shone for its fifteen pop culture minutes, inevitably fades. And it is in the afterglow of that love, when we meet the naked man at the heart of Fowler's \\"A Thing (Or Two) About Curtis and Camilla\\" that perhaps we catch a glimpse of who we really are. This is a novel that begs the question - if we live only for the hot flash of now how can we find the eternal - be it love or ourselves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is a Song!","review":"When I started reading, I thought, \\"Wow, what is this all about, where's the sheet music, who did the arrangement of the melody that jumps off the page?\\" I must say that for me, someone who is almost 60 years old, the story, thanks to Nick Fowler, is so memorable because of my own experiences soooo many years ago.Nick Fowler grabs the essence of young love and takes the reader through all of its ups and downs, joys and sorrows, and, yes, one of the ultimate conclusions. The character Curtis battles more with himself than with any external forces. The story was a combination of a Woody Allen movie and a Shakespearian tragedy!Read this book...it is a pure joy! I'm waiting for Nick Fowler's next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda...","review":"This is an odd, and ultimately disappointing book. Fowler writes in three parts and each part gets worse. The first part, about falling in love, is good. He captures the longing of love quite well. The second part, after losing Camilla, quickly becomes a bad comic nightmare. The last part, seems out of left field even this Oprah-soaked age (I'm being vague here because I don't want to ruin the ending). Is this part satire? I have no idea. The book had it it's moments (great pop culture references at times). But, in the end, it seems a little (pun intended) creepy and odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and annoying","review":"I disliked this book intensely, though I do think Fowler has some talent. I found his prose overwritten, pretentious and annoying, and I too saw the footnotes as an unnecessary and unfunny gimmick. While I agree with another poster that the first section of the book captured the throes of young love well, the second part -- which deals with Curtis' emotional breakdown-- was completely ludicrous and not nearly as funny as he thought it was. I struggled mightily through the last section and had I not been stuck on a plane for 9 hours I never would have finished it. In addition, I found the climax completely out of left field, a shift in tone that made little sense and even somehow (made me mad).Had Fowler not tried so hard to show us how clever he is and kept his story grounded in reality, I think he would have had something special. But he tried way too hard and missed the mark.Nick Hornby? Not in Fowler's wildest dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fun Read","review":"This book disappointed me. Based on the cover description, I thought it would be a light, fun read. It turned out to be anything but, and I had a difficult time finishing it. Although the writing is good, the story is really more pathetic than funny, and it has a few unsettling elements. The character of Curtis is not sympathetic; he comes across as insecure, undependable and untruthful. Rather than rooting for him and Camilla, I was hoping for her to dump him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the deep end","review":"The story is okay and the characters real if not entirely likeable; luckily it's an easy read. However, it's striving to be a deeper and more thought provoking novel than it has the ability to be and that is where the trouble lies. I'm not certain if the author is playing with the reader or if he really takes himself so seriously. The footnotes were a nice \\"suprise\\" when they voiced a \\"note from Curtis\\", but patronizing when not. This is a nice draft novel that an excellent editor could have made great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Old Fogeys!","review":"This novel was such fun to read! It's a story for those who remember the passion and the foolishness of young love, the power of both the giddy joys and the knifing sorrows. Fowler has got it all--and in lively language full of surprising riffs I kept underliing to read aloud. The East Village is Everywheresville when Curtis and Camilla meet in headlong and heartfelt collision. This is such an exuberant story that it jumps right off the page. Get it, enjoy it, give it to a friend or lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, you're a hipster, we get it......","review":"Mediocre purple prose peppered with exasperatingly pretentious bits of hipster esoterica.Part one was at times insightfull. Fowler almost convinces us that he has some deeper wisdom regarding life and love, but then quickly disproves himself as parts two and three go from bad to worse. The atypically bizarre climax is completely out of sync with the storyline. It will leave you scratching your head, to say the least. This book was beyond disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Collection!","review":"Great collection, with Greatest Hits 1 2 and 3, plus the Live & Rare (which has some great tracks).

Volume 1 focuses on how to give pleasure to women and volume 2 is supposed to be how to give pleasure to men.We think Volume 1 provides good and detailed step-by-step info for beginners to find the G-spot. However, volume 2 is a waste and it only lasted for 10 minutes. Volume 2 could be summarized in 2 words: \\"suck\\" and \\"swallow\\". It really doesn't need to be a tape on it's own. We are very disappointed at volume 2. I was expecting it to give a little bit more information on the basic techniques and steps as volume 1 does (where do you start, how to proceed, the intensity, the movement etc. etc.).If the video is marketed as a tape on \\"the basics of how to please a woman\\", I'd give it a 4. But since it is supposed to provide techniques for both partners, the tape only delivers half of the value, I can only give it half the marks - 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pictures are the stars in this book","review":"Changing Picture Bible Stories - A Children's Book ReviewThe heavy duty hardcover book Changing Picture Bible Stories (Candle Books, May 2004) gives a quick recounting of five well known Old Testament stories.

You get three guesses as to which Madonna song this is.... The album is a mixture of light, melancholic synthpop and subdued guitar solos. I am not a fan of electric guitars, but the music should be listenable even to electro-purists. Well, except for maybe the fourth track, Desire Lasts Forever. The guitars do build into that mosquito sound I so dislike....The music is a mixture of treated male vox, clear male vox, and soaring choral female vox. Track five, Grey is Grey, features the soothing vocals of Peter Heppner from Wolfsheim.The only new song on this album is Frozen. The rest of the tracks are treatments of older Girls Under Glass songs, possibly being re-released in hopes to garner new North American fans. I think the ploy worked; I'd never really listened to them before, but I'll soon be playing them on my radio show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Girls Under Glass is a mix of industrial rock, metal, electronic and techno. Now you're probably thinking \\"Why would someone want to sound like that?\\" But honestly, it's freshest sound I've heard in a long time. It's incredibly catchy and not difficult at all to listen to.Other bands that I like who are similar to Girls Under Glass include Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, The Fair Sex, Lords of Acid, and Orgy. So if you're a fan of any of those bands, you'll probably enjoy Girls Under Glass.The least you can do is give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Captain's Bride","review":"Elsa Anders is eagerly awaiting the prospect of a life in the states, as she prepares to marry the man she loves, and move from the only home she had ever known.

Leighton's alto flute gives such a rich lush sound to these tunes, particularly the pop renditions I Want to Make it With You, Love Light in Flight, and Special Lady.

If you grew up with Tower of Power and Earth Wind and Fire, you will love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gives a misguided view of Purgatory","review":"This book is scary. And according to current Church teaching, it's accuracy is debatable. Not that the events stated definitely did not occur, but they are not interpreted properly. Any of you familiar with EWTN's Fr. Groeschell know that he strongly dislikes this book. A more accurate description of Purgatory can be obtained from Catherine of Genoa. She relates a vision of Jesus standing at a doorway beckoning us to enter Heaven. However, if we are not ready, not perfectly cleansed, to stand before the throne of God, we do not approach. We will know when \\"we are perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.\\" Only then do we unite fully with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in the Bible...","review":"Heaven and hell are mentioned throughout the bible but purgatory is not even mentioned ONCE. Besides tradition which is not inspired where do they get the sources for this?? Jesus TAKES AWAY the sins of the world, so why would you still have to pay for something that He already paid for?

God Bless.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growth in Holiness","review":"Must read for all Christians. Fr. Shouppe dispells the notion, within The Dogma of Purgatory, that a Merciful God cannot have a purgatory or hell.

It is very difficult to put down, once you get into the meat of it. I've never ever had Purgatory explained to me so well and so concise. If you don't believe in Purgatory...think again. If you think Purgatory is simply a stopping off or resting place prior to Heaven...get ready for a BIG TIME reality check. On the good side, if you've made it to Purgatory, at least you are on your way to Heaven. The whole idea, though, is to work here in this life to get straight to Heaven. It's a whole lot simpler and eternally less painful to purge oneself of sin in this life...and not wait until the next.

I read this to my 5 year old sister and she loved it! Not only is it a great story but there is the added fun of trying to find the \\"hidden snowmen\\" on every page. Not many people know this but this is a sort of \\"continiunce\\" of Dean's earlier adult horror book \\"Mr. Murder\\". Santa's Twin features the family from that book. The storyline of Twin came from a story that was told to the kids in Mr. Murder. Overall, great Christmas book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is such a great book!","review":"While this book may not be for everyone, it is very funny.

In trying to be quirky, irreverent fun, it succeeds only in being unfunny and very unpleasant. It is also poorly structured, long-winded, and technically inept. I was actually rather shocked at just how bad this book is, coming as it does from such a successful writer. Not everyone can write children's books, although these days it seems just about everyone is trying.I would have given it two stars on the strength of the illustrations and the mildly entertaining hidden snowmen game contained in those illustrations, but I had to offset all these ridiculously high ratings as best I could.And believe me, I'm not the one who just doesn't get it here. If you think this book displays the slightest cleverness or sense of humor, you're wrong, and I can prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Grotesque!","review":"This book is certainly not for young children with its nasty graphics and language... putting slime and guts into Christmas presents is not what I want to teach my child.

It will be an annual Christmas Eve tradition. I read it to my two nieces - 8 & 11 - and they enjoyed almost as much as i did. I especially loved the line - \\"they could do it. They were sisters\\" since I love to stress the importance of this relationship to these sisters. The humor he uses throughout makes it a joy to read again and again. the illustrations are gorgeous - and we had fun searching for the artist's signature within the artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty new twist on Christmas","review":"I love this book! I first saw it several years ago when my neighbor (the artist, Phil Parks) was illustrating it, and I fell in love with it.

The illustrations are beautifully expressive and it would be fun for children to find the hidden surprise on each page. However, the story itself is long and has violent or mean-spirited overtones that I find incompatible with the spirit of Christmas. I chose not to read this book to my first grade class as I had hoped, but instead gave the book to an adult friend who is a fan of Mr. Koontz' other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"fish feeders","review":"My fish will not eat off of these feeders.

I was already a hardcore vegetarian from my Animals & Society class. Although I was fairly aware of the topics covered in \\"Earthlings,\\" actually seeing it first hand, in action is a completely different thing. After seeing it (the whole 7min that I could stand to watch; the sounds alone were enough) I was forever changed. Even after a year & a half, the images still haunt my memory frequently.

Granted, the album is mixed well it's ashame she wasn't able to do more with the content as she wrote all but one of the songs and plays all guitars and bass on the disc. Dineen's mid-level vocal range is not as expressed as well as it could be despite her best Suzanne Vega impression on opening cut \\"Fleer.\\" \\"Ant Farm\\" is fun while \\"Devour\\" sounds as if it was penned by Bjork.

A fun romp through establised territory for the first 2/3, after which the plot degenerates into an amazingly unabashed comic strip script (think 'Scooby Doo'and the Mystery Van!).I really cannot imagine that this work is intended for mature readers. Respectfully, perhaps this would be an entertaining story for adolescents? I believe this point should be stressed not so much because of lack of depth to the book, but more as a fair cue to readers such as myself who are lead to this book via Amazon readers' links. This is only fair as the cost of the text is so greatly disproportionate to the content for mature readers familiar with historical fiction; however, I realize the cost is related to the fact that the author is 'self-published' through Random House's Xlibris.com site which is a concept I thoroughly support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I am hugely interested in the Teutoborg Forest debacle.

The story of Calvinia, the disgraced senator's daughter; the profile of the main character, Glauxus; and the episode of the bear-hunt are all beautifully rendered. The author knows how to develop suspence in his narrative and writes well (one minor mistake in the few Latin words used in the book: the Cenurion would refer to his adoptive daughter as \\"filia mea\\" not as \\"filia meus\\"); had the story taken place in a different context I would have given it a three or four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercifully short","review":"I read almost all historical fiction that I can get my hands on about the Roman Empire. I was excited by the topic of this one, the Varian Disaster of 9 A.D. However, this novel is poorly written and, at times, even ridiculous. The author's biggest problem is putting 20th century ideas in the minds of 1st century characters, such as environmentalism. He even has one of them forshadow television. (Someday you may be able to watch the gladiatorial games from home while you sit and eat!) At one point, some of the main characters are at an inn somewhere north of Rome. One of their friends is WALKING from Germany to Rome and just happens to be strolling by this inn when his friends are attacked. I could go on and on.

I didn't even get 6 months out of it before the letter \\"t\\" stopped working. I took the keyboard apart, thinking it might be a dust/dirt/moisture problem and the inside of the keyboard was pristine - as clean as could be.

Has so many pluses over standard keyboards: Slim profile, slim keys, perfect angle. My favorite part about it is that it does away with the awkward/bulky wrist rest that are part of so many keyboards. Combined with the slim profile your wrists can rest where they're supposed to-on the desk. Doesn't hurt that the keys have a perfect resistance/response ratio that is very easy and smmmooooth.

Then it stops working. I pop the key out and find that the post is broken. I expect over the course of the next year I will end up replacing the rest of the keyboards.

The keys have a very satisfying click but there is little resistance and you never feel like it is fighting you. The keys are perfectly laid out in a standard format, but some keys are abnormally sized to accommodate the curve. I have used natural keyboards for a long time due to wrist pain and Microsoft has continually made the most comfortable units. The curve is just right to allow for fast typing while not sacrificing ergonomics.I've purchased two units for less than $20 on sale, and you just can't find a better keyboard for even twice that price. At first I thought it could use a few more secondary controls, but I have reprogrammed the ones on the keyboard to suit my needs and no longer feel that would be necessary.This is a great keyboard well worth the money.

Low travel keys (like a laptop), just curved enough to be comfy but not so much that it's awkward to go back & forth. Durable. Flat enough to slide into a keyboard drawer, and even travel with as it slides into a bag fairly easily. It's not huge, but not small enough for the plane.It's got some smart buttons - I always use the calculator button, as well as the volume and mute buttons.I bought my first one a few years ago (several?) and have bought one every few years since, to go with a newly-acquired laptop (I use a few at a time). The new ones have a slightly \\"grittier\\" finish than the older ones, but not awful.I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE do NOT buy!","review":"I wish I had read the one star reviews before purchasing. I am a grad student, and I have to type frequently, so I am extremely disappointed that this product fails. In fact, I am unimpressed with MOST Microsoft products. Many of my keys have stopped working. Namely, one of the keys I needed to type my password for windows 7, so I could not get into my computer, until finally, after trying everything else, Providence told me to SLAM the keyboard down. I should not have to slam my keyboard to get it to work. This product is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to Have","review":"Fantastic to use, I'm using it to write this review. Great, Light-weight. (however the lack of weight also gives it a feel that it isn't too durable /(possibly) cheaply made. But as long as you're not dumping water on this, or abusing it, it appears to be fine.The curves fit the angle of your hands better in ways I didn't even notice, though some keys are larger than others to compensate for this. My hands are going to need time to get fully accustomed to it, but it's a great one to have, especially for such a fantastic price.I completely recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys Stopped Working","review":"The keys stopped working -- I thought I was going nuts.

So obviously I decided to replace it. I've never had an ergonomic keyboard before, but it was the cheapest multimedia keyboard I could find. It works great! It took me less than five minutes to get used to the difference in the keys, and it is actually a whole lot more comfortable to use. And absolutely all of the multimedia buttons work! I know from past experience that that isn't always the case. I love having the little calculator button! I've never seen a keyboard with that before. Plus the forward and back buttons work both with the internet and with music programs. It's very quiet, and does actually take up less space than my old keyboard. Overall I would highly recommend this product, it's definitely the best you are going to get for the price range!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All the negative things you read about this keyboard are true","review":"I had owned one of these keyboards a few years ago and the keys started going bad.

Not long after I started using it, about 2-3 weeks later, this keyboard started acting up, keys 4,6 wouldn't work. Now, after 2 months keys 5 and O don't work. So sad!! I love this keyboard with its handy calculator and volume buttons, very very comfortable for touch typing, but unreliable quality. If Logitech has a similar product I would buy it in a heartbeat.UPDATE:After two months of using this keyboard, more keys stopped working. I finally gave up and got myselfLogitech K350 2.4Ghz Wireless Keyboard. I'm happy with my Logitech keyboard so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feel, good price, short lifetime.","review":"Obviously keyboard choice is personal just like choice of shoes. However, just like shoes, there are some universal qualities that one demands. I love the feel of this keyboard. The keys click just right. They all take the same amount of pressure, and its just the right size for my hands. Its slightly ergonomic, but not enough to make it inflexible. It has a few quick buttons, just enough to be handy (audio, and most importantly, calculator!). Works equally well on windows and linux. To top it all off, its has a fair price.The downside: my first one only lasted me a year and a half. The enter key seemed to demand days off. Restarts, shaking, nothing besides waiting till the next day would get it working again. It was very strange. I feel that a keyboard should last more than a year and a half.After all was said and done, I liked the feel so much that I bought another. However, if in a year and a half this one breaks, I'm getting a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this keyboard couple of months ago and it worked nicely for 2 months but soon after, it stopped working.

I had the \\"h\\" and the \\"s\\" keys stuck. In fact, the \\"h\\" key was stuck twice and caused me some grief with a password ;) However, I slam on the keys a couple of times and they went back to normal. It is cheap and fairly durable and I still use it at work. If there were no sticky keys then I would have considered this a \\"perfect\\" keyboard for the price. Although, I am ready to go back to the full-on ergo MS keyboard. I've been using ergo keyboards for more than 15 years and it is hard to go back to a regular keyboard (granted this keyboard is semi-ergo). It is still a fairly quiet keyboard and I can easily type at an average rate of over 60wpm w/o errors (over 100 with errors!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I hate this curved design","review":"I am not a touch typist, and I think I really hate this curved design. None of the keys is exactly where I expect it to be, and the sizes of the keys are uneven. The N key is twice as wide as the adjacent M key, for example.I'm glad I did not spend a lot on this.

I have four powered USB ports on my computer, and they're all taken! I shuffled things around, unplugged a couple of things, and managed to find a temporary home for it...but it's going to cost me far more than the $15 I paid for the keyboard, as I'm going to have to go buy a powered USB hub because of this purchase.At the very least, a USB to PS/2 converter would have been seriously appreciated.However, if you do have a free powered USB port, this is a really nice, basic keyboard.

STAY AWAY","review":"As stated in other 1 star ratings before, various keys have stopped working on my microsoft keyboard and it's well under a year since I brought it. The keys that stopped working are - the letters n, m, b, the number zero on the number pad, the comma and semicolon, cap locks, and all arrow keys. This is very frustrating because I didn't know what was going on at first since I've never had a problem with a keyboard. Not able to purchase a new one right away, I struggled with composing even a simple reply to an email. I resorted to opening up previously written documents with these letters, etc. in them and copy pasting them into whatever I was working on. As you can imagine, this gets tired REAL quick. Bottom line, there's obviously some kind of weird defect in this keyboard.

I just tend to substitute words like adore for loe and really for ery, purple for iolet, etc. The main pain is cut and paste. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+ ...that alone knocks it down to 2 stars.

Not sure if it was residual static or what but having a tough time adjusting to the curved keyboard, I tried typing on my laptop keyboard. Found out certain keys were not registering. Turns out, whatever the keyboard did, it cooked (or maybe fried) my bios. When I reboot the computer, it beeps like crazy on the bios screen (not even booted into Vista). I searched on the web and found that it is shoddy workmanship. It is about 10 hours since I first plugged in that horrible keyboard... my laptop no longer beeps like crazy on boot-up, so my \\"stuck key\\" problem may have resolved - crossing my fingers...Needless to say, this keyboard is going back to Walmart.See other posts:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, effective, comfortable, cheap","review":"I feel like this is a nicely modern keyboard. It lacks or consolidates antiquated legacy keys while providing several handy (and easily customizable) function keys for easy access to frequently used programs and folders and controlling media.

Also, a few keys have just totally gone dead and you have to bang them down to make it work again.

The powers are pretty fun but thats all there is.I dont think they depict his strength very well in the hand to hand combat either. He must throw cars at enemies to most of the times to kill them.I am a Superman fan so Its worth the 7 bucks i spent. I wouldnt buy it if i wasnt a hardcore fan.

The instructions were also a little difficult for her to follow entirely on her own, but after the first time or two, she learned to follow them easily. She built the dump truck for the second time last week, and it has stayed together since then with some minor modifications. She's using it to tote her Barbie clothes!The graphic instructions are a great teaching tool, and so is the ability to make something that actually works. This set rates high on my \\"educational value\\" scale, and I highly recommend it. I think she will enjoy it even more as she gets a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We bought this for our 4 year old son who likes trucks, and likes to build. What could be better than a toy that lets you build trucks? The pieces are extremely difficult to put together. I'm a carpenter with a fair amount of hand strength, and I couldn't take some of the pieces apart. The sad part is that you can't build the item in the instructions unless you push the pieces together all the way. If you don't push them together all the way, they won't line up with the next part, so there's really no away around the fact that you have to really jam them together. In short, my son can't play with them. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I would not buy this book even if it was for free.

The Panasonic came close, but then I bought this phone - it has served me quite well for four years now - and works as well today as the day I bought it. The phone is well thought out and performs well. Sound quality is excellent (I use a headphone almost exclusively, but when I use the handset, it works well too). If I have one gripe, it's this: If you are using the phone and a call comes in on the other line, the phone emits a loud click/pop into the ear-piece with every ring, and the caller's voice drops out for about a second. The phone itself thoughtfully mutes it's ringer, but instead you get this pop in your ear. Otherwise, I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this phone","review":"It won't let you hang up! The buttons do not function as buttons in the conventional sense: the phone is entirely software based, and the OS -- whatever it is -- frequently \\"hangs.\\" So you'll do something like push a button or hang up the receiver, but nothing will happen until the software permits it, since the buttons only send software instructions and do nothing mechanically. It is incredibly frustrating to use this phone.Beware of slamming the receiver down and calling someone a \\"nitwit:\\" the phone hasn't hung up yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Head holder","review":"It was nothing like the picture.

It is really really thin-- only 63 pages long. Most magazines are thicker. When I opened the box, I thought it was empty. The book was so thin I didn't notice it was under the invoice ! Fair enough;one might argue that you can say a lot in 63 pages. But wait a minute! That's not all. Clearly half of the pages have huge blank spaces...for you to fill the blanks with your exercises, you see.It is,after all, a workbook. Then there are completely empty pages in between chapters that are counted within the 63 pages. But what makes this so unforgiveable is that most the pages that are full have huge margins to the sides, top, and bottom. Some people might find the content good, but you can get a lot more for your money elsewhere in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work of art","review":"Another great alblum from Luis.

But how does a qualified advisor become trusted? Authors David H. Maister, Charles H. Green and Robert M. Galford provide methods you can use to reach the inner circle. They break trust into its component parts and reassemble those pieces into a viable, practical model, complete with suggested conversations. That may sound a little robotic, but with practice, an advisor can make the transition from outside technician to habitué of the inner sanctum. This readable book includes a useful appendix and a list of quick references. We recommend it to consultants and professional service providers.

This though, breaks beyond these mere genres, mixing electro with new wave, some bits of rock, and even a little pop... yes you read that right, pop. But don't be alarmed, this just means you'll be up late at night with these amazing melodies crashing around in your skull. I CAN NOT wait until the new album comes out after hearing this teaser.

I love to read excerpts before going to bed. I also love to read a few verses before I sit down to meditate to set the tone for my meditation.

My skin actually got less red after discontinuing the \\"redness relief\\" product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves bad texture, doesnt help with redness","review":"I bought this with the night cream and moisturiser, those are both good and I will keep using them. They dont help the redness but they make the skin feel nice.This day cream is very thick and seems to instantly dry the skin very quickly. It also seems to add a strange texture or lumpyness to the surface of the skin. Its hard to describe but it makes the skin look very rough and it looks like you have something wrong or some badly applied makeup. It does help the redness a little because it is very green, but instead of red you get this strange texture which looks worse.I would say stay clear of this, it doesnt work and is a waste of money. It also took over a month to be delivered and I had to repeatedly chase the supplier and they simply ignored me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work that well","review":"I decided to purchase this product for the number of good reviews it has but I was very disappointed after having tried it. This lotion is very dry and didn't cover up nor do any good to the slightly red area around my nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eucerin Lotion","review":"I gave this 2 stars only because it will cover up the redness; however, it will not cure it. I put it on my face and because it is such a heavier consistency it will cover up the red because it is green.I looked in the mirror and it made one side of my face look pale because of the consistency of this product. I like the Dermarest much better, it actually helps the redness itself and gives a nice glow to your skin in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfectin Lotion","review":"Very helpful. Covers Redness completely.I do not want to write an article about this. So let me go please....."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse then having red skin","review":"this stuff is garbage, it has a weird consistancy which is just the opposite of that, it spreads on your skin clumpily. If you have red skin that is peeling forget about using this, it will collect on the edges of whats peeling and leave a silver-ish green mess that looks terrible. Make sure you don't put more then a tiny dab on too, otherwise you'll look like the hulk (unless thats the look you're going for). worst product ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT product if you are a caucasian with no tan","review":"This product just goes on too white/green. It never fully blends in with your skin, and I'm a VERY light-skinned Mexican comparible to East Asians. Coverage will be just okay if I put it on a small area of my face, but since this has an SPF of 15, it's meant for your whole face.Maybe its the way I've been blending this into my skin, but I can never really make this blend in enough without having my face look a bit \\"off.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lotion for relieving redness","review":"I have used this product for several years to reduce redness and it works fairly well.

I haven't found another product that works as well for me as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might reduce the redness, but left me unnaturally pale","review":"I have rosacea and therefore had to try this product. I was pretty disappointed because it left my skin looking ghostly which required me to put on make-up afterwards. There are plenty of tinted mineral spf creams and even mineral make-up with sunscreen that I prefer to use because I only have to put on one product that covers the red with a more natural color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not cover the redness","review":"I read numerous reviews on this product, very skeptical ~ your know, almost too good to be true. But it got great reviews, lots of people said it helped their redness. So I took a chance. TO GOOD TO BE TRUE! I got bitten again!! I put it on one side of my face and compared it to the other side and absolutely no difference. I smeared it all over my face and it did not even reduce the redness slightly. So very dissappointed. My local Walgreens actually discontinued the product due to low/no sales, I should have figured out why, if it worked they would have sold it. So, buy at your own risk but my advise, just stick with foundation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cakes on and is generally unpleasant","review":"It may work for some people, but I sure didn't like it. If you don't blend it just the way you want in a short amount of time, it cakes, which is really frustrating. It's really just masking the redness. When I put my makeup on over it, it looked fine to start, but throughout the day it would start to cake and look strange. After a couple weeks, the redness never got better and I gave up.I never want to look more pale than I have to just to mask the redness. Don't cheap out and try a bunch of brands like this.. like I did. In the long run you'll be spending just as much money, if not more, than if you would have just bought a nicer line of product.After this I went straight to Ulta and tried Mario Badescu's anti-redness package. I'd recommend that a thousand times before anything else. If I could, I would marry the anti-redness calma mask.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotion","review":"Arrived on time, in perfect condition.

After using it for a few weeks, there was no difference in my skin tone, texture, or anything. I took before and after pictures. No difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, relief","review":"My rosacea has worsened as I age. Now in my late 40's my face is dry too. I take a little of my other facial lotion and mix a little of this with it in my palm, then apply to my rosy cheeks and nose. I finally look like I used to! Because I only have a problem on my cheeks and nose, this product will last a long time, especially when I mix it this way. It is too thick to spread easily on my dry skin, and makes me look like a ghost if I use it straight. Mixing it works just right for me. I have used all of the redness relief products and this one has really helped me feel better about showing my face. It works well under makeup and has not made me break out. Since I have been using these Eucerin products I have had a significant reduction in the horrible burning sensation that I used to have in my nose and cheeks. I love this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work for me","review":"I purchased this because I have broken capallaries in my cheeks from sun damage. Most people say they don't notice it, but it's something that bothers me. I hadn't realized how strongly tinted green this was. You're pretty much smearing mint green all over your face. It doesn't sink it for me, just smooches around making my face patchy green. I used only a small dab and it really wasn't for me. As just a regular lotion without the tint I'd probably like it, but I just couldn't get past the weird green. I just live with my slightly red cheeks, and consider it built in blush for now. I think using a tinted moisturizer is easier to use then this stuff. I continue to look for a good moisturizer with spf(preferably 30 and over)."},{"rating":"1","title":"my bad","review":"I was very disappointed when i listened to this cd. This version, dated 1987 was cut in Australia.

I knew before I purchased this it was going to be B-grade but I didn't realize the movie would come with poor quality. As many of you might know, this is an early movie of Loren Avedon's and majority of his action scenes in his movies are packed with explosive...excellent kicking skills and fight scenes.

Her strength's as a singer are particularly evident in the many love song from the forties where the sultry yearning behind the lyrics and lush orchestration are a perfect medium for Stafford's lustrous tone and superb breath control. There is nothing forced or melodramatic in her approach to a song; she has none of the affectations common to many singers of the day and delivers a solid beautifully crafted performance on each piece. Frank Sinatra was one of her biggest fans and its not hard to hear why. My favourites? Autumn In New York; Walkin' My Baby; Haunted Heart; Georgia; Say Something Sweet to Your Sweetheart. There are some forgettable songs here that do no justice to Stafford's talent or the history of the popular song, but these are the exception. A great intro to an underated singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong date.","review":"You would think that the History Channel could check the information given in their productions.

They bring to life many of officers and men who fought in the campaigns and you will find yourself getting wrapped up in their suffering and dying. Although they focus mainly on certain aspects of each battle and not the full scope of the conflict, the stories are good and well worth watching.

Gabriel does very little to distinguish between culture and Islam. One wonders if he can make the distinction himself. These stories, while they may attempt to be genuine, reek of an \\"outsider's\\" view of Islam as mystic, fanatical, or simply outdated. While these notions might serve as the base of more meaningful stories, it is clear that Gabriel is only scratching the surface.The picture Gabriel paints with these stories only serves to portray Muslims as people not worthy of making peace with, or even considering as humans equal to their glorious American counterparts. By hiding his own prejudices within his seemingly culturally illuminating stories, Gabriel, perhaps unconciously, gives new life to the spirit of colonialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denis Wick Adjustable Cup Mute","review":"Very good.

No one ever achieves understanding -- of themselves or of the others in their lives -- and no one experiences any passion. Joy, anger, desire, all are shallow and fleeting.The only thing these otherwise colorless characters feel deeply is their fear. None of the denizens of this Baltimore boardinghouse ever learn to overcome their reticence and express themselves.Even Jeremy, the artist who lacks the tools to navigate his way through life, works in a vacuum, unaware of his surroundings, his thoughts and his own feeings.Although this book has touches of humor, and is well-written, it is ultimately unsatisfying. Tyler has done much, much better work -- try the 'Accidental Tourist' instead and see how funny and moving she can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually really like Anne Tyler but...","review":"...I cannot get through this book.

Some of the tracks are making headway on the secular scene like Thousand Foot Krutch's \\"Move\\" that was used on ESPN. Overall a tight effort. If you are already into Christian rock/hard-rock/hip-hop/metal, this is a must-add to your collection.

Even when the songs she picks are inherently good or interesting (Waters of March, Dream in Rio, Shelter FTS), her overly laid-back treatments pale by comparison with the originals and even with other singers' covers.Compare this CD with Andy Bey's last two CD's--in which a similarly rich-voiced, subtle jazz singer makes a pop-oriented career move--and you will see what Wilson needs to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer","review":"I have an odd shapped door (repurposed attic space) and the organizer still fit well.

I listen to this all year round.....5 *****'s"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying for Robert Downey Jr.'s rendition of 'River'","review":"Fans of other Ally McBeal compilations with Vonda Shepard will not be disappointed by this CD. The best track on the entire CD has to be Robert Downey Jr.'s soulful \\"River.\\" Other standouts include Vonda Shepard's \\"Please Come Home for Xmas,\\" and the all- too-short song belted out by Lisa Nicole Carson \\"Santa Claus Got Stuck in My Chimney.\\" Album is upbeat and cheery, good party music. Do it again next year you guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Downey's A Stand Out On Fun Xmas CD","review":"What a fun Christmas CD! Like many people I've come back to the series this season after last year's more than disappointing outing. And like many people the reason I've watched was Robert Downey, Jr. After hearing his two tracks on this CD I can't wait to see the episodes! His version of \\"River\\" is great, his voice rich and throaty. Jane Krakowski is up to her Broadway standards with her fun versions of, \\"Run, Rudolph Run\\", and \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.\\"Diehard fans of the show will want the CD just for Vonda Shepard's soulful takes on the traditional holiday classics. My two bummers with the CD and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I (and I'm probably in the minority here) felt the Macy Gray track was so out of place.It sounds like Louis Armstrong, does Xmas. The second reason is at thirty seven minutes, the disc is way too short. There should be at least twenty more minutes of holiday cheer. Well, maybe I just didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas album to date!","review":"I hate Christmas albums. I very nearly never bought this. But in the end I gave in to fandom (and my wallet) and I'm glad I did. The CD is a new take on traditionally cheesey songs, with most of the Vonda Shephard stuff done as smooth jazz, Macy Gray's voice fitting perfectly with Winter Wonderland, and Robert Downey Jnr surprises everyone by his ability to sing. The contributions by the female cast members are also nice little additions, although I have to complain about Lisa Nicole Carson's all too brief offering. And where's Richard Fish singing 'I love you even more today (than yesterday)'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALLY MCBEAL CHRISTMAS ALBUM","review":"I heard a song on the radio during the Christmas Holidays and fell in love with it. It was done by a female singer and I was trying to describe it to my daughter. I told her it was about a river. She immediately knew the song done by Robert Downey Jr. on a Christmas Ally McBeal CD. I borrowed hers until I found \\"my own\\" and ordered it from Amazon. It's an amazing Christmas CD. Especially Robert Downey JR's version of \\"The River\\" ! I ordered it and before I knew it, it was here! Just as described on amazon.com I even missed ((yeah!!)) going to the crowded mall during the Christmas rush. Thank Goodness for Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Michael Bolton?","review":"Sorry, but it was past time for someone to utter the discouraging word. Sometimes, immitation indeed is the sincerest form of flattery. Other times, it should just not be done.Unlike others, I found precious little soul in Vonda Shepard's \\"Baby Please Come Home\\". It compelled my to pull out Phil Spector's Christmas Album for a dose of the real deal (give a listen to Darlene Love to see what I mean). I had the same response to most of the rather derivative work found here (much like the musical interludes on the show, for that matter).Calista Flockhart's tepid effort to sing \\"Santa Baby\\" is about as close to Eartha Kitt aurally as she would be physically. Like Barry Manilow singing Frank Sinatra, or the aforementioned Michael Bolton singing Percy Sledge, some things just ought to be left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"I thought this would be a great CD. On the show, Vonda Shepard covers many familiar tunes, always doing so very well. I own her album of songs from the show. Having heard the included songs of this Christmas CD on the show, I thought this CD would also be a fun and enjoyable one to own. While I really can't fault the performers at all, the recording quality of this CD is mediocre at best. There is a horrendous echo in many of the songs - apparently with the purpose of making it sound as if recorded live at the firm's watering hole. Unfortunately, it just doesn't have that result. In several songs, the lead singer - whether Vonda or another cast member -- will drop into the background and be indistinguishable. The problems just go on from there. It is unfortunate that the CD's quality is so poor, for otherwise, it would be a fun and enjoyable holiday disc to add to one's collection. Definitely sample before getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"a merry compilation!","review":"the cast is great. the best tracks belong to jane krakowski though. this lady should be cutting albums of her own. vonda rocks! dont wait for christmas to pop it in the cd changer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Yourself A Vonda Little Christmas","review":"Some great holiday music culled from multiple seasons of Fox's Ally McBeal. The terrific part is, it will remind fans of Ally of the moments past, but it also stands quite nicely as a work on its own.Many of the highlights are traditional standards such as LET IT SNOW and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS. Much of the music is performed by legal bar superstar Vonda Shepard. There are contributions from a number of her Ally castmates including Calista(Ally), Jane(Elaine), and Robert(Larry).A great variety of music, too. Jane K really has a lot of fun with RUN, RUN RUDOLPH and I SAW MOMMY KISSING SANTA CLAUS. Calista vamps it up with SANTA BABY. Meanwhile, Vonda really puts it all out there on the Carpenter's WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE.Whether or not you've followed the show, this is a fun holiday CD to add to your seasonal selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Downey, Jr. -","review":"Simply put, Robert Downey Jr.'s remake of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" is THE reason to buy this CD.

Neither one of us can figure out how to work it. We are not big games players, don't own a Nintendo, game cube, etc. We enjoy reading, but there isn't an instruction booklet to read. There's an encyclopedia type part which talks about physics, but we all ready own an encyclopedia. Then there is a game where we wander around but can't figure out how to make anything happen, we just wander around the same paths over and over.

Not worth returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great deal as long as you know what you're getting","review":"I bought this for my son's seventh birthday and he and his two older brothers (11 and 16) really enjoy it. Its a very simple microscope without slides or very high magnification ability, but you can see the basic things a child would want to see, such as the cells on an onion skin, the fibers in the apholstry and salt and sugar. It can also be placed in a pocket to be carried around the neighborhood and is relatively sturdy. We've had a fancier microscope that were purchased years ago for one of the older boys, but it broke easily. We've had this one a few months now and it seems to be just the thing for a curious kid who wants to know a little more about things but isn't a scientist just yet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carson Micro Max Lighted Microscope","review":"Waste of money and not worth the hassle of returning!

Bought it just for fun and it didn't disappoint. The picture is quite crisp, as long as you're not far sighted. I haven't tried to look at cells yet, but I'm sure you can (if you have some slides, and a light that shines from bottom up).The only small complaint I have with this is that light that comes with this is rather old and may fluctuate in brightness from time to time. Its shaped like an LED somewhat, but you can tell that it's incandescent.

Not only was it horrendously boring (first part) with endless descriptions of nothing of interest, I found the story implausible, overinflated and just plain disgusting. The reader is very manipulated into feeling terrified for Celia the only truly tender character. Why would seemingly intelligent people that were doing everything in the world for their child think it was okay, or at least accept, for that child to wear diapers at age 6? The incident with the cast and Kevin \\"covering\\" for his mother was ridiculous. I don't believe for a minute a child that age would be mature enough not to scream to his father and to everyone else exactly what happened. Awful book. I felt assaulted when I finished it and had to skip through some parts. Just toooo boring and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver","review":"The story itself was interesting. This could have been a great book, if someone else wrote it. I admit that it's possible the author is a beautiful writer and I'm just not smart enough to get it. All the big words and complex sentences sounded to me like he was trying too hard to sound intelligent. It was very difficult to read and I'm not an uneducated person. I also didn't like how the story is told through letters that Kevin's mother is writing to her husband. I can't recommend this book to anyone. I much preferred \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" by Jodi Picoult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"This book was amazing. I will say that it was really hard to get into, but I think that was intentional by the author. He did a wonderful job capturing the mother's personality through her words and writing style. This book was realistic and captivating! At about 74% of the way through it really picks up, and you won't be able to put it down! Overall I would recommend this book. It was worth all the time getting into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing novel","review":"This is a harrowing look at teenage violence in America. Although fictional, Shriver bases her account on the spate of killings in American high schools.The protagonist of the novel, Eva, is happy with Franklin but on impulse she decides she wants to marry him. Their union produces Kevin, a troubling boy from the time he is born. Eva has misgivings about having a child in the first place, and whether Kevin is naturally just a nasty child or whether her reservations rub off on him and make him so is up for debate. At any rate, Kevin's behavior and attitude only get worse and, perhaps copying teenage murderers before him, tragedy at his high school ensues.The ending is inevitably sad, but stay with it--this is a well-done, thoughtful attempt at trying to explain teenage violence in America, and one family's tragic experience with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down ...","review":"A beautifully crafted, well-honed novel using a current topic. Think you've read it before? - well you haven't. This is an amazing novel using the nurture/nature argument for evil. Eve's letters are poignant, painful, honest, and loving. Her look into her family's life is sharp and focused; even when she's questioning. I couldn't put it down and asked a friend to read it so we could talk about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"This book is not for everyone. This author was recomended to me because I love Anita Shreve. Well, Shriver is nothing like Anita Shreve. I felt the prose was terse, long and difficult to read. The book is way too long. And at the end you really don't find any answers. Shriver is no doubt a very intelligent woman. She has a great English vocabulary which is thrown in readers' face in every sentence. Always \\"ambiguous\\" never \\"not sure\\". This book didn't make me feel anything ecxept horror. No sypmathy, no compassion. And the way it ends-I have no closure or undertanding of teenage angst either. It's like finding out about autrocious crime and wishing you never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one to like","review":"It takes me a while, sometimes, to realize why a book bugs me. I'll already be twenty or thirty pages in, and then it hits me: I don't like the characters.In WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, the narrator is insightful and tries to be honest. But I found her so unlikable and alien and, well, largely despicable. Even among the cast behind Eva--her family--there wasn't a single character I could relate to.I also objected to the construction of the book. It runs the risk of being a stilted form, the novel-in-letters, and it always irks me when you get a line like, \\"You must remember, dear, we first met Joe Stevens when....\\" with the author then supplying required information the letter recipient was surely already privy to. This novel was rife with awkward exposition.But I kept reading. And that has to count for something. The subject matter is compelling enough that even without likable characters, and even with passages that made me cringe, I stayed with it until the fairly predictable end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpleasant, scary, compelling and completely readable","review":"This is a must read book but read it at your own perill as it has no happy ending.

I can't believe that the parents didn't do anything to help this kind out he was so sick. It was not so fictional. Sick people get their ideas from videos and murder games. Appalling.

When the author wrote about Kevin it was great! It seems like she got distracted while writing and has quite a few parts that do not help the plot. The writing style is confusing because it is a letter from Kevin's mother to Kevin's father...but then seems to slip into narrative with dialogue. So overall the parts where it's actually about Kevin I LOVED, I could not care less about the back story involving her being a tour book writer. I would suggest reading this book, but a lot can be skimmed over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"I had to keep reminding myself this was fiction. It seemed so disturbingly real!

Kevin did things throughout the book that I doubted a child/teen is capable of accomplishing at those ages. Just too sophisticated and with too much planning involved.

The author uses \\"big\\" words, but that does not make for great writing. She's no Jodi Picoult (who I don't like either, but at least the 2 books I read of hers were gripping.) Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic read","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.A very well written,engrossing story that makes you think long after you have put the book down.I recommend it for any book club-you will talk about it for hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't read the book but the film is asoundingly horrendous","review":"Absolutely no stars for this mind-numbing, miserable excuse for a film. I've never prayed for a movie to end until this one. Now I have no desire whatsoever to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book club read","review":"Will make for great discussion at book club. Very heavy themes. Has suggested book club questions at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"This is a book that will stay with you for a while. I like the way the story is told, and that the author really wants the reader to decide the hows and whys of the events in the story. It brings up the age old question of which is stronger - nature or nuture, and even after reading it, I'm not certain which prevails in Kevin's case. I would recommend this book - just be prepared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and Intense","review":"At first I was put off by this book's story-written-as-letters narrative, but it didn't take to get caught up in the story itself, with a feeling of such building dread that I found myself reading it far into the night, unable to put it down. Heartbreaking and frightening at the same time, I don't know if I have the guts to watch the movie! I might have to wait until I can rent it, so I can watch it while peeking out from under the covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books...","review":"We Need To Talk About Kevin is a beautifully written story. Shriver takes a controversial subject and approaches it with brave, honesty. Some might say the characters are hard to like, but I found them to be incredibly real. If you have any interest in the nature vs. nurture debate, this is an excellent story to check out. Shriver presents this topic to the reader without really giving up definite answers and instead allows the reader to make their own interpretation. I love the tension that Shriver slowly builds throughout the book and I was truly blown away with the ending. We Need To Talk About Kevin is a dark and disturbing tale, that won't be for everyone. For me, it has become one of my all time favorite books and I find myself thinking of it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult son....but clueless parents","review":"It is a rare event for me not to finish a book--particularly when I'm facing into a long day of plane travel. Though Shriver's writing is incandescent, and the tragedy potentially gripping, I listen to the narrator describe herself running through one STOP SIGN after another, apparently caring so little for her own well-being or that of her daughter that she uses her brain only to create excuses. Ultimately I simply didn't want to hear another word from her. I wanted to be written into the book as the next-door neighbor that called Child Protective Services and got ALL of them some help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"With Tilda Swinton in the movie version of this title, I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. I finished it yesterday. I hated it. I give it one star just because someone bothered to write it but it's not worth reading. The characters bear no resemblance to anyone I know or have ever known, the story is much more about the mother than the son, and she's enormously self-indulgent and spoiled. The child is portrayed as demonic - do really demonic children exist??? - and the father is portrayed as incredibly clueless. Both my daughter and my niece tried to read it and quit after less than 60 pages. But by far the most telling thing about my reading this book this month is that my niece reminded me I'd tried to read it years ago and couldn't make it through. I had totally forgotten this fact. I must have blocked it out.I love a psychological study as much as the next person but this wasn't one. It was unpleasant, boring, irritating. I can't believe I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Need to Talk about Kevin","review":"I started reading this book, and was finding it very hard to get into. I came to the reviews to see if I was off the mark, and evidently I am. I will go back to reading, hopefully as it progresses, I will become accustommed to the format, and be able to finish and give a correct review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egocentric Musings of a Miserable Woman","review":"Shriver's writing is beautiful. She can poignantly describe a mundane encounter and infuse meaning into what are otherwise simple situations. The question of what brings a child to assasinate his fellow students and teachers is one worth exploring. But the narrator of this story is his mother, an egocentric woman who muses for 470 pages about wanting and not wanting a child, having a difficult child, hating her child, hating her husband, both loving and hating her job. It's tedious. I stopped reading after 150 pages and skipped ahead to see where the book goes, but it was just a continuation of the same depressing diatribe. The characters don't change, grow, or provide insight into life. It's a shame that such talented writing was wasted on the composition of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I was pretty excited to crack open this book. However, the only reason I got to the 50 page mark was because I was in the emergency room getting rabies shots and I was bored. It is simply inconceivable that a cultured, self-absorbed woman of the world as portrayed here would write insanely long, rambling, poetic letters to an estranged redneck husband who thrives on hotdogs, six packs, pick up trucks and dirty talk, and probably can't even read well enough to understand what in the hell she's saying. Really, that's what you get in the first 50 pages. There is no way in hell these two characters would have fallen in love and attempted a marriage, much less raise children together. I cannot waste my time on a book that is simply unbelievable and pretentious from page one. If I ever have to get rabies shots again, I'll just stare at the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HATED it","review":"This was awful. It was pretentious, self-important, self-righteous, trite, and pathetically indifferent. And that was just the writing style. The entire book is written as letters from the killer's mother to her husband. The format is awkward and nowhere near believable. The author seems to be trying for cathartic self-analysis. What comes across is self-absorption that's both painful to endure and boring to read. The main character isn't just \\"difficult\\"; she's inherently unlikeable. I actually hated her by the end of the first chapter. Trust me, you CAN find something better to do for an afternoon than suffer through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Thought provoking, disturbing. Think I should, but think I can't, read it a second time. The determination of the mother to understand keeps you in the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was desperate to read something for a loooong train trip, so I borrowed this from my mother. Well, I had no other book on the train and nothing else to do so pretty much read the whole thing. I say pretty much because I stopped with about 30 pages to go. I got to the end and I just felt disgusted with the writer and with myself for reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wordy, unbelievable","review":"What can I say? This book was wordy, unbelieveably so. Because of the wordiness and the sheer pretentiousness of the words, I found it incredible hard to believe or relate to Eva. I oscillated between feeling flat out disgust at the things that this mother said and thought about her own son, to understanding some of her thought process and feeling frustration with the husband of the story. While I'm glad that I did decide to go ahead and finish the book (simply because the ending through me), I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book at all. I think that this story would have been told so much better if the Eva, the main narrator through these letters, was more personable, lovable, grief stricken, something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"We chose to read this book in my book club so I tried to read it. I was disgusted with the whole story line. The Connecticut shootings Happened around this time and I had to stop reading because I was so discussed. I do not want to sympathize with a sadistic murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"WInge Winge Winge","review":"Couldn't finish this book. The leading lady is completely unlikeable. The prose is annoy and self indulgent and as much as I understand her attitude, I got sick of reading about how much she hates everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected.","review":"Good shape. As expected. Good job, I'm just gonna write words because it has a minimum word requirement. Potato. Vogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coudn't finish it","review":"I've heard the movie is pretty good and thought provoking. The book however was very difficult to get through and I ended up giving up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific.","review":"This book was disturbing on every level. Really horrifying and no redemption. I finished it and texted my book club to say 'do not read!\\"At times it felt like a \\"how to\\" book for really sick teenagers. How to ruin your parents, sister and community. Horribly disturbed story and no satisfying resolution. It was a chronicle of ruined lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother and Son","review":"An amazingly gripping novel. You think you know the ending but you don't. It examines the mother-son relationship when it goes wrong and forces the reader to confront his/her own conceptions of love. It's hard to get into but after about 60 pages I couldn't put it down. I gave it to my son (age 40) and he was equally impressed with its power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable","review":"Ms. Shriver has written a story so compelling with three-dimensional characters that breathe from the page in all their vibrancy. Starting the book, the reader may feel that since the ending is known, there isn't anything to learn, but that is just a superficial approach as this book examines a horrorific event from many angles, revealing facts and insights so skillfully, that each page resonates with meaning. It is impossible to put down, impossible to forget, and most importantly, impossible to skim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging book","review":"Interesting and engaging book, based on a possible path for the formation of a teenage killer. You need to look beyond the \\"teenage killer\\" and think about what creates all those empty, aimless teenagers who don't actually murder a bunch of fellow students. Very thought provoking! I'm surprised by the people who thought the ending (or even the very-ending, last para) was/were unexpected - you can see things coming from early on, and it raises the suspense about exactly what and how."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding novel","review":"One of the most provocative and insightful books I've ever read. Perhaps you have to be an independent woman to appreciate the introspective nature of this book but I found it gripping, compelling and even profound. Shriver really captures the nature of the ambivalence of family vs. career, life in suffocating suburbia vs. free-spirited city, the cloying nature of people who believe that spouse + children = pure joy. The style was jarring at first (a series of letters written but no response received) but it worked well and let me live in Eva's head. I did not find her \\"whiny\\" or otherwise repulsive; rather, I thought the character was incredibly realistic and compelling. Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in exploring human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why dabble with fiction when you can read the truth?","review":"I sincerely do not understand what makes this an acclaimed novel. Perhaps it is the psychological case study of Eva (psycho boy's mom). To the point, why do we need a fictionalized account of a school shooting when the thing itself stares us in the eye? I suppose other women may find this offensive. Perhaps I am dismissing Eva's struggle to find out what it means to be a mother. Perhaps not. If you want a real grasp on the reality of lives lost, a community fractured, and the young people behind it all, read Columbine. It is not painful to read and it will not bring you joy, but it does attempt to bring understanding to the school shootings that have rocked America. Dave Cullen painstakingly researched the matter over the span of 10 years. It is a must read. I felt morbid when I bought it, but quickly came to understand how purposeful it is. Give it a try if you are sincerely interested in the matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This was a great book. Interesting topic and exploration of family dynamics. At times, a little wordy, but I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure to listen to the sample before buying!","review":"I wasn't sure whether it was the voice of the actress reading this book, or the writing itself. But now I think it's a deadly combination of the two that makes this audio book intolerable to me.The writing is smug and pretentious - never using a small word when a large one is available. Like a college English professor writing for an audience of other college English professors. **shudder**The actress comes off as smarmy and fussy. OK, maybe this is how we are supposed to see the narrator. But if so, the author's choice just isn't working for me. I might have enjoyed listening to this, and been drawn into the mystery and psychological unpacking, with a more neutral, or more normal, tone. As it is, I just can't make myself listen to this. One Audible credit down the tubes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Perspective","review":"The Newtown shooting prompted me to read this book. It's a fascinating tale of raising a school shooter from the perspective of his mother who was an ambivalent parent to begin with and then had this odd child who would not bond with her. The writing caught me up in the story right away and gave me a lot to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I found the format of letters to tell the story an unusual single perspective. The story itself is very bizarre. Even for a mystery reader this was difficult to finish. Initially, I kept asking myself where this story was going then when it went somewhere it was too disturbing to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I thought this was very good. She gave Eva a very strong narrative voice, I liked her, felt sorry for her as well. I read Nineteen Minutes also, it was a fail in my opinion, so I may be rating this higher due to the comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Book - Better than I thought!","review":"This book looked like a serious downer. I had jokingly called the \\"feel-bad book of the year\\". But after the first 100 pages or so, I was really interested in what was going to hapen. And the end was a suprise although I might have seen it coming if I have thought about it. After I finished it - it really made me think about the characters. I pondered what it might be like to have a son like Kevin. He is not what he seems. Niether is she."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal parts of horror and sadness here, but an important book to read.","review":"This book was all-consuming and took everything out of me. I was exhausted after reading it and as others have said, it leveled me. As I turned the last page, right before bed mind you, I wept. This was a work of fiction, but I wept for all of the families that have ever lost a kid to school violence and that includes the parents of the kids responsible for it! Eva had her issues but what a horrible position for a parent to be in. How can you love your child when he just committed such a horrible crime? Is it even possible?The story was brilliantly executed. It left me deflated and very sad, yet it's such an important book to read. Shriver has a way of pulling you in, and then pushing you away. As I was reading the book, I alternated between being angry and being sad. These characters will stay with you long after you finish the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sickening but thought provoking","review":"This is a very interesting book, which at times makes you sick to your stomach. I found myself frequently thinking about parenting skills, how I have dealt with my own children, importance of communication between the parents and understanding each other. I wondered throughout the book if it would have been possible to prevent this calamitous sequence of events, with earlier intervention and better communication and understanding between Eva and Franklin. I have also spent some time thinking about forgiveness, what it means and what degree of forgiveness I would be capable of myself.This book definitely stays with you after you have finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Lionel Shriver's book The Post-Birthday World for its imaginative use of split timelines, its character development, and its exploration of ambivalence, indecision, and consequences. This book, although exploring some of the same ground, does not have so much to hold a reader's attention. While the prose is well-written, the characters are all seen through the warped lens of the (possibly) delusional narrator, and that narrator drones on and on, repeating laments about past decisions and current ambiguities that become quite old quite fast. It is true that the author might be making just such a point, that this self-centered and over-the-edge mother is as much to blame for the tragedy as her bad-seed offspring; but the major points of this books, and its entire plotline, could fit into less than 100 pages...it is just too repetitive and unrelenting, especially for such a bleak topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Overly long (who edited it?), pretenious (Eva's language/voice was more akin to that of a university english professor than that of a writer of budget travel guides), contrived, unrealistic and under-developed plot all led to me being very disappointed with this book which I am surprised won the Orange Prize for Fiction.The detailed descriptions of similar massacres were pointless and in my view sensationalist. The whole premise of the book was that Kevin was born evil and yet at no point in time did the book delve into an exploration or explanation of Kevin's psychiatric profile - which might have added more value and insight into the issue of school massacres.Eve was unlikeable and her cynicism and superior rants were hard to take. I struggled through to the end which was weak indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This was a very disturbing read. It is definitely NOT a happy holiday read. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marmite - love it or hate it","review":"What is a potentially an incredibly interesting subject was done an injustice by Shriver's writing style. I found it to be self involved, pretentious and frankly hard work. The result of this is that it left me feeling completely disengaged with the characters.The first half of the book is like swimming through treacle but the second half goes on to redeem itself slightly as the plot picks up the pace.I persevered with this book as a friend highly recommended it, so as is clear from the division in the reviews placed here I would read a sample before committing to buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"born bad?","review":"What I found lacking in this book was Eva and Franklin's role as parents. Kevin was obviously different, an unengaging, not responsive, emotionally distrubed child yet neither parent seemed to feel therapy was an option or should be something they should check into? I think Kevin was born bad and therapy would be useless but it still, especially today, been a logical step for a parent to take with a child who is not quite right and it is not as if money was an issue for this family. But Eva's biggest failure is in being Celia's parent. She knew Kevin was guilty of harming her in such a terrible fashion yet what does she do to protect Celia in the future? She stays and puts her child in further danger. For that crime, and it is a crime, she should bear the guilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book came damaged","review":"I bought this book brand new, to my dismay when I received the book, there was no protection around the book, mainly there was no plastic protection wrapped around the book to keep the pages from getting bent in shipping. The package was sent in a padded yellow envelope that was obviously just thrown around and the first 1/3 of the book was bent because there was no protection for the book.The book is great but I will never buy from this seller again because they obviously don't know how to ship a \\"PAPERBACK\\" book.I am an Amazon Prime member and would have hopes that my paid membership would be able to keep sellers from doing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest letter ever","review":"The title intrigued me I read the back of the book and the plot intrigued me more.On the third chapter and this women doesn't stop writing to her husband. I'm lost, I had to put it down and started reading another book.I hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time I will never get back...","review":"I read approximately the first third of the book. Today I watched the first 30 minutes of the subsequent movie release. This is time I will never get back, I should have learnt my lesson from the book and not wasted my time on the movie. I totally think this author was cashing in on the 'high school massacre' theme that authors seem to be running with lately.If you want to read this topic, read 'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodie Picoult, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disturbing book/not worth the reading time","review":"Our book Club just finished this book and the overall concensus was that it was a negative book about motherhood, family, kids and the United States. We felt that there may be people like Eva, Kevin, Franklin but it is unrealistic that they might be in the same family. It is our guess that the author never has had children. We tried to find a likeable character or one that could be admired and we came up with zero. Many people in our book club didn't finish the book, as they felt they could spend the time reading a more inspiring and interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Pill","review":"As a graduate of Saint Leo College's Criminology program, I am attracted to crime writing like a magnet. Some crime writers have a God given gift for getting inside the criminal's head. Some of my favorites are Ann Rule, Jack Olson, James Pruitt, and especially Don Pendleton. Lionel Shriver is one of the least creative crime writers to ever enter the craft.She created a collection of fictional letters that chronicle a mother's life throughout her motherhood. The fact that her son happens to be a convicted mass murderer comes out as incidental.Shriver should have devoted ten times more material to Kevin's psycho-pathology, cut out all the daily grind, and left out the mother's unimportant observations on life.Shriver's letter writer needs a Carl Roger's type sounding board instead of a reader looking to be entertained. Shriver doesn't pay me by the hour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy! Lousy!","review":"I purchased this book and tried to get into it for a very long time. The writing was confusing and the woman just rambled the whole time. I really diliked this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Good Money","review":"I wish someone had told me to keep my money in my pocket for this movie. I was so disapointed and did not even stay with it till the end. One thing that is not is easy to follow. It is dark and evil, something our country does not need to see right now. Watching this movie does not leave you with a good feeling or make you smile. Save you money and go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant until the very last two sentences","review":"Ms Shriver writes clear, concise, insightful psychological prose. She chooses vocabulary that continues to resonate with the reader long after putting the book down. Her story, Kevin, is brilliant. She offers beautifully crafted professional prose that is crisp and accessible. To bad that her narrative stumbles and is captured by the cultural quick sand, those unspoken taboos, that she eviscerates all the way until the very last two sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless doom . . . .","review":"Forced myself to keep reading this in spite of the unlikable characters and altogether depressing outlook, and the payoff was a long time coming - the last chapter, to be exact. The format, a series of letters written to the departed husband, was annoying and self-indulgent, since most of the content was a retelling of what they had already shared and would have been already known to dearest Franklin. So why not just tell the reader, in a less contrived and more interesting way? She made me hate the husband, yet unbelievably kept professing her undying love for him and desire to have him back. Unbelievable on so many levels. The heart-stopping ending somewhat redeems the book but doesn't begin to make up for the first 300-some dismal pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful. this is a hideous book. do not read it.","review":"what a huge waste of time. a truly awful book that isn't even believable. the characters -- all of them -- are about an inch deep. only caricatures. i read Post-Birthday World by this author a few years ago and really enjoyed it, and with the film version of this book coming out, i was hearing the title again and i remembered this author, so i bought it. i admit that it is compelling for a while, but it just always rang false to me. when i was nearly 2/3 of the way through it, i realized that i truly disliked every single character in the book and reading it was putting me in a bad mood. that's not to say that literature should always be fun and light-hearted; i do think challenge is good, and i am up for big ideas. but fiction should be meaningful, and it should feel like truth. it should also be more nuanced. this book is crass and cynical, like a sledgehammer, and it is indulgently over-written to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"When I read the last page of this book I just sat in a state of shock. It is a shocking story, but it is brilliantly written. Lionel Shriver is a master of her craft and the characters are so real you feel you know them, it one of those books which is very hard to put down. I was totally engrossed from start to finish and felt I had lived the whole thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"Somewhat interesting story written through letters to the narrator's husband. I did not get as drawn in as I thought I would though and even though I found the story disturbing I felt it lacked some sort of believability in terms of the main character. Not the events mind you, but her reactions, thoughts, seem false. Perhaps this is the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, weak ending.","review":"This book was compelling and creepy, which is what I was looking for. If you like Stephen King or other similar thrillers, this is a good book. My only complaint was the ending. It was a little too storybook, but that's a personal beef."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start leads to gripping end.","review":"I struggled at first to read this book. I just couldn't get into the story for the first 35% of the book. However, I persevered and I'm so glad I did because the end was intriguing and so sad.I don't know what was wrong with me at the start. I just didn't like Kevin's mum. I thought she was just so whiney and unlikeable and I found the letters awkward and confusing. However, as the book develops and you realise what a demon child Kevin is and as the pieces of the puzzle start falling into place it becomes a gripping, poignant story.I'd love to give this book 5 stars because it made quite an impression on me but I have to take away a star because of my feelings about the start of the book. It's the type of book that you should read again bacause everything is clear. Definitely worth a read. If you're like me just persist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard going - needs a good edit","review":"I was attracted to the theme of this book, but the author makes you work excessively hard in getting to the core. This book could have used a redraft and/or a good hard edit - I was struggling to get through it and skipped quite a lot of it. Not because I have a short attention span, but because of the repetition and focus on boring minutiae, which I don't think adds anything to the story. I'm not sure whether the author thinks her readers are unable to grasp subtleties therefore need everything spelled out for them, but I feel this could have been fixed with further drafting - it really has the feel of being a little undercooked. Better editing would have also fixed the misuse of many complex words and phrases, which you do not expect to read when the format is letters from a professional travel writer (the narrator). All power to the author for winning the 2005 Orange prize and achieving success in a tough market, but I would not rush out to read her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"We do NOT need to talk about Kevin","review":"Combine a bizarre mother who hates her child from pregnancy on yet who is presented as a normal woman, a father who happens to see none of his son's evil viciousness for 17 years, and a child who makes Rosemary's Baby look like the Gerber Kid.This book entails a cast of characters too unearthly to be swallowed, but who the author tries to pass off as believable. Not recommended for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read but . . .","review":"THis is a fast read and well written. A horrifying story and it has some amazing twists. The author knows what she is doing. BUT I would bet my bottom dollar the author is not a mother. She writes about her baby as though she never loves him. Ever. He screams all the time and even at seven months he apparently stops only when the father gets home to make the mother look bad. First of all as a mother of five kids I know that moms love their screamers even when the moms are driven mad. Yes, post partum depression can create bad feelings but this character NEVER loves the boy and she does not know what a seven month old is like. They certainly are not calculating. Then inexplicably at the end, this crazy sociopath son gets some redeeming qualities. So I don't buy the premise even though I finished the book with pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"This is easily the worst book I have ever read, and in my opinion, one of the worst books ever to be published. The only reason I didn't put it down was because I couldn't believe it had actually been published. I had to read the whole thing to believe it. None of characters were complete or credible. The premise was timely but that's about it. The narrator is totally negative and appears to be a sociopath. It's obvious the author has no psychological understanding of human nature. Because Eva is the narrator, and we only hear her side of the story, we never know if she is telling the truth. And I do not find her vocabulary (sprinkled with rarely used words) particularly intelligent, clever or amusing. Her tone is arrogant and self serving. What bothers me the most is that some readers will actually think the work is representative of the human race. I find the novel insulting and nonsensical--not to mention appauling and disappointing. And these are my positive comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit like hard work","review":"While you would never expect this story to be easy to read, it feels like it was written with a thesaurus on hand. It was difficult not just in content, but in form. Why use 2 syllables when you can use 4?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book gave a chilling portrayal of a mother's worst nightmare. Shriver used events from real life, such as the tragedy at Columbine High School, to make the story feel like a biography, as opposed to a novel. The book will leave you wondering if a child can be truly rotten to the core, despite loving parents that provide for every need and want. This is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Horror Novel","review":"I read this book as a straight-up horror novel. It doesn't work any other way. If you take it on as serious social commentary, an examination of school shooters, serial killers, nature vs. nurture, marriage and parenthood, the book turns silly and repellent. Approaching it as a horror novel featuring one of my favorite plot devices -- the unreliable narrator -- allowed me to truly inhabit Eva's point of view and to relish the tale's shocking (and campy) ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of dialogue makes this book drag on forever","review":"I was intrigued by the letter format (the story is told through a series of letters from Eva to her husband). However, I found this book difficult to read and felt as though I was slogging through rather dry writing due to the lack of dialogue. I did like the ending, which made the read worthwhile, but it took a long time for the story to arrive at its conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't anyone talk about Kevin?","review":"Although very well written, and certainly a compelling plot, the story suffers some serious flaws. Is the reader to believe the mother's account of her son's horrifying behavior and not wonder why, over the course of his 15 years, indeed no one EVER broached the fact that he might be severely disturbed and in need of outside help? The title is misleading - not one person ever says to the two self absorbed parents \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\". For this reason the book didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick review","review":"The premise is dark - that a relationship between a mother and her child could be full of such vitriol. Yet, the storytelling is passionate, interesting, surprising, and has lotsa big words. And even though I \`knew how it ends' I enjoyed the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend","review":"I have read one other school shooting book before but this story has a unique vantage point and quite a few surprise twists. It was hard for me (as well as the members of my book club) to \\"get into\\" the story as the author's style and verbage does not make this book an easy read. I did however, finish the book and am anxious to see the movie adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Need to Talk about Kevin","review":"The reader is drawn into this intricate tale through letters written by the mother of an extremely troubled teenager. The story unfolds, layer by layer, creating a searing picture of a family in crisis. The story gathers steam throughout, finally rushing towards an ending that surprised that me. This book will cause you to wonder about the roots of violent behavior and what, if anything, can change its course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb but Harrowing","review":"Shriver grasps how difficult dispositions unfold within parenting as she tells the story of Kevin's development through his mother's letters. With seeming inevitability the failures of behavior and attunement accumulate. Yet,the flaws of these parents do not account for the punishment and anguish they and others endure. The book is grim but so well done. Lionel Shriver must have suffered to have it inside her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was one of the most frightening books I have ever read; scarier than the scariest Stephen King novel ( and I have read practically everything he has ever written). I could not put it down. It was ironic that I picked it up soon after the Chardon high school shootings, but the book is not so much about a school shooting as it is about the mother's life after the event. It is told entirely from her perspective, in a series of letters to her husband, whose whereabouts are only hinted at until the end. Very suspenseful, disturbing,yet compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"<sigh> it is so hard to be a mother...","review":"'We Need to Talk About Kevin' is quite a literary accomplishment. The author is fully deserving of accolades for her achievement. On the surface the story is reminiscent of 'The Bad Seed' where the notion of evil being a result of nature (versus nurture) is raised. But this book is far more complex. It is really a deep self-analysis of the evil child's mother. Her husband thinks she's insane for thinking their son is anything beyond normal. Yet she knows the truth, is torn with both love and hatred for the child, and in the end it all goes horribly wrong. I think the author was very clever in structuring this book as a series of letters from the mother to the father; I thought it made the entire story more personal and emotional. ... oh, and the book's ending is quite powerful.Bottom line: a very sad yet terrific read. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep psychological story","review":"The author seemed a little stuffy to me with his sophisticated words nobody knows the meaning of. The story was engaging but it was really wordy at times and I'd lose interest. The ending really made you think. I'll never forget Kevin."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldnt put it down","review":"This book was very interesting to me because I have often wondered about the nature/nurture debate. The characters are well developed and their interactions are fascinating. The relationship between a mother and her son is fully explored. We are left wondering if Kevin is really evil, or maybe it is just his mother's perception of him. Definitely one of the best books I have read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"nasty piece of work","review":"This book was a trashy, overly sensational treatment of what is an intriguing (though disturbing) topic. It could have -- should have -- been a fascinating character study. Instead, it was predictable tripe: closer to a Lifetime movie of the week than serious literature. None of Shriver's characters felt true. Every last one of them was thoroughly unpleasant and one-dimensional, even the pathetic Celia, who was written as little more than a manipulative plot device. The couple's lack of friends, the husband's apparent mental handicap and the mother's acrid and selfish persona made me wonder about the author herself. I've read The Post Birthday World by Shriver, and I noticed the same bitter miasma seeping through that novel as well. Nasty piece of work. The predictable ending was just absurd. Shriver is a decent writer but there is something unmistakably \\"off\\" about her work -- like the smell of garbage coming through your window on a beautiful day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, dark","review":"This book is a devastating picture of the annihilation of a family from within, by the very person who should be the nucleus. It is dark, disturbing, and one of the most horrifying books I have ever read. As I got close to the conclusion I realized what was going to happen and I quit reading in disgust. Though the theme of this book might have offered a study in psychopathy, the author offers no practical or redeeming information. It is a bleak, disturbing, and very dark book; there is no comfort in its resolution. Don't waste your time or money on this book unless you can tolerate extreme despair and heartache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"The book is so ridiculously difficult to read it made me want to put it down within the first chapter.This book was so highly recommended by all my friends, not sure why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"we need to talk about Kevin","review":"hopeless book, book without any hope. hopeless mother, hopeless father. everything and everybody in this book is negative, I don't know why I bother reading it!There are so many really good books on the market, this one is waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it, terrible book","review":"This is by far the worst book I have read in a long while. I persisted with it as I was told it improved around the 100 page mark, however that did not happen. There is not 1 character in the book that is likable or seems like an actual person. I have no idea how this book won awards, avoid it at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one to root for","review":"I have to admit that after 150 pages, I gave up on this book. There was a time when I would finish every book I bought no matter how bad it was. I guess I'm just either too old or have too many books now to finish that I feel like I don't have time to waste reading bad books. There were no characters in this book to care about. Pretty much everyone is a villain. That may not be the appropriate word, but it's going to have to do. Also, it seemed to me like the author had just received a shiny new thesaurus and wanted to wear that thing out. It was tedious and unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This is the most disturbing book I've read in years. At first I found the story fascinating, but as the novel developed the less I liked it. By the end of the book, I hated it. I think it was written to shock and not to edify. Shriver has a very bleak view of human behavior and mankind in general. There is nothing wrong with this in the hands of a true artist. Shriver is not one those. The critical reaction is completely over the top. It has won an award or two. The book is a pageturner no doubt but in the end it is a gothic horror story in the tradition of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Shriver's sympathies are not with the victims of Kevin's murderous impluses. She seems to think they deserve what they get. The book does not have an artist's insights. It is for the reader who likes his gore very graphic. It is PSYCHO told completely from the point of view of Norman Bates and his mother. So in one sentence, Shriver is a master of vulgar gore. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" pretends to be a look into the psycology of a teenage mass murderer, but it's really a low-rent Steven King horror story. Too long by at least twice, the book hinges on a plot device that would have made a great short story but isn't enough to sustain it. The characters are unconvincing cardboard cutouts, and the nerosis and narcismism of the mother so suffocating I found myself wishing he had killed her instead and spared us all this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally weird","review":"If there was an option for zero stars, that's what I would have given this book.The author has a superior attitude which is evident throughout the book and makes it difficut to read(and stomach).There is no character development for any of the four main characters.It is possible that two reasonable people could have a child that is a \\"bad seed\\". But that the parents could be so far apart in dealing with the child and communicating with each other is not realistic. It also gets old very quickly.There are way too many refences to school killings and they become trivialized.The book might be shoved into the catagory of disfunctional families but it misses that target too because it is so superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to sleep","review":"I got this book after reading the back description. It looked like it would be an interesting read. I couldn't get through more that 1/4 of this book. Boring. The narrator rambles too much.Reading this book made me sleepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be a sucker","review":"If you have bought \\"Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? The Complete 1st ad 2nd Season\\" and all 3 seasons of \\"What's New Scooby-Doo?\\" Don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. \\"Go West, Young Scooby\\" and \\"Gentlemen, Start Your Monster\\" come from \\"What's New Scooby-Doo?\\" and \\"Foul Play in Funland\\" is from the first season of \\"Scooby-Doo!

When you listen to it (please don't!), you'll realize that these are not the original recordings.

The initial cuts seemed alarmingly short on melody--just repeated Tinkertoy riffs with textural variations--and I couldn't believe a guitarist and vocalist as brilliant as Vinicius Cantuaria had been reduced to beating time on a bass drum. Slowly, though, it won me over. The second half is much stronger than the first. \\"Listen\\" is gorgeous, \\"Anywhere Road\\" has the classic, off-kilter shape of Frisell's best compositions, and \\"Procissao\\" is a percolating wonder, with a fine vocal from Cantuaria.

Under a photo of K's elder brother Peter Christian we read...'Irresolution seems almost to shine forth from the eyes...' A self-promoting K enthusiast named Sommer is described as having the 'zeal of a plagiarist.' One could go on and on, and Garff's observations always seem to hit the mark.Also wonderfully, there is nothing here about 'the father of existentialism.'

The foremost authority on Rankin/Bass, Rick Goldschmidt, takes us into a never-before-seen back stage world of misfit toys, reindeer and a certain dental elf with the most comprehensive history ever written about a single TV special. Generously illustrated with production photos, priceless artwork, period ads and collectibles, the story of the Rudolph special is as magical as the story of the misfit reindeer himself. Every aspect of the show is examined, from voices and music to animation and the song itself. The grand finale is Romeo Muller's actual early draft containing many \\"lost\\" sequences and plot ideas, including song concepts by Muller himself!

This is also a GREAT and much less expensive alternative to paintball. Not to mention it's much safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+++","review":"I looked up the 10 most popular Christmas gifts for 2005 and saw the Lazer Blaster. I decided to buy the Lazer Blaster for my son (17) . He said it would be lame and my husband agreed (our past home lazer games were a bust) so I changed my mind and got some great computer games instead.Another son turned 19 three days after Christmas and wanted to celebrate by taking friends to the local Lazer Tag place. I mentioned the Lazer Blaster option and he said he'd prefer that. We bought 6 Lazer Blasters and they are incredible!My husband and 17 yr old left their computer games to join in. College friends came over and everyone had the best time outside. OUTSIDE! My family has left their computer addiction and are getting fresh air!All this and we don't even have the night goggles or walkie-talkies yet!! This is one game that gathers all the family together -- amazing!!!The other reviews have accurately described the Blaster's nuances.

I wondered why it sounded like two voices when I popped it in the player and came here to read up on the history. They should've never released this if they didn't get her voice live. Aside from her none-too-subtle vocal acrobatics throughout, there are times where she sounds hoarse and needs a good cough to release some phlegm. The charm of a live recording is that it is live - which this is not. Her voice is not reacting to the audience adoration; she just barrels through the songs as if trying to catch a train. Some might like this but I'd rather hear her less annoying (read not stereotypically Merman) studio recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Merm does Vegas","review":"Ah yes, Ethel Merman's Las Vegas nightclub act. Originally recorded live at the Flamingo Hotel during Ethel's debut cabaret show, this album was later revised when it was discovered that Ethel's body microphone failed to capture her vocal performance (and if there was one performer who DIDN'T need a mic, it was The Merm). Merman was called back into the Reprise studios to re-record the whole show; and it's that performance you hear on this CD.The Merm's in top form, especially when she rips through a gangbusters medley of her greatest hits from \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\", \\"Call Me Madam\\", \\"Anything Goes\\" and \\"Gypsy\\". If you're a fan of Merman, you'll definitely get a kick out of her nightclub album![COLLECTABLES-6193]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Ethel is phenomenal in this rare, live recording.

The games are rather simple and boring. As a reward players receive tokens to use to build a theme park roller coaster, once again the graphics are just terrible and the roller coaster can only be built so big before you have to start again.i just can't believe that Leap Frog allowed such a toy to be marketed? The board must have been sleeping the day this was rammed through. It's not a toy that will build their name in learning.

My son loved the idea of playing a game on the TV, but in less than 2 word assemblies he was done. It takes too long with various screen music and instructions, when he was excited to just get on with it and build words. It also doesn't come with enough letters to build any but the most basic word sets. There are so many great 4 letter words that need more than 1 of each letter!He actually put it back in the box and said he didn't want it. From the straight forward actions of a child.

I have recommended and given the videos to friends. I credit Letter and Word Factory with teaching my kids to read, but this game is worthless. There is only one game for three letter words, one for four letter words and one for silent E words. But the games are slow and dull. If you put in three letters to make a word it takes at least 10 seconds for that word to \\"register\\". We tried \\"ay\\" (ray, hay, pay, say ...)words and the game eventually pronounced a couple of them but seemed not to recognize the others. If it takes 10 seconds and then doesn't even tell you what you spelled every time then what is the point. I tried to play it with 5 different kids and none of us thought it was any fun. This is the first item that I have ever returned to Amazon because of dissatisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointed","review":"I purchased this product recently and promptly returned it.

It is written like a man would write a series of serious blogs today. Each section had its points but it did not feel like it was as tightly put together.

It doesn't matter because YOU KNOW that it is your reality as much as you have five fingers in your hand. This book will help all those who are starting to become aware that there is more about this living existence of ours that people normaly think to grow into a more universal existence, where love is the engine of all things. Wonderfully fritning and simultaneously beautifull. A must for all those who want to know something more about our reality then it is said to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Content","review":"The book starts out very well. Whitley gives some good perspectives concerning such bizarre phenomenon throughout. Unfortunately, there's not much more here. It's a lot of babble and little content.

It will surely put you to sleep. 2 stars out of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is overrated!","review":"I bought this book because it's popular and widely known and it's NEW YORK's bestseller...BUT after reading it, i have to say it is highly overrated. It's cool reading about his hypnosis on the abduction but then he went on and on talking about his life and some other craps that have nothing to do w/ the case. Stick w/ the main story and stop going off the wrong way!! I am not interested in your life...i bought the book to read about the ufo abduction not your life or your nonsense lengthy opinion. This guy don't have enough interesting thing to say about the case, so he fill it in w/ his thought about his life...which is hella boring. If you're interested in a UFO's abduction case, read Raymond Fowler's 5 books of the Betty Andreasson. Compare Fowler's books to Communion is like night and day, not even close. In a scale of 1 to 10, Communion is at a low 2 while Raymond Fowler's books are at at high 9 or 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad cover, worse content","review":"I mistakenly bought this book due to the comments and what I had heard about Whitley in an UFO documentary. There may be some kind of extraterrestrial life(a small particle or cell, not Whitley's alien friends) but, what this book tells are nonsense. What kind of sane people may believe all of this rubbish? We almost can't assure the existence of water outside the Earth after many years of investigation and this man tells a story about ET relatives appearing and disappearing almost daily in Earth.Despite its lack of usefulness I have learned something from this book: there is a worrying amount of people who seem to belong to the same group of \\"blind believers\\". People who need some evidence in order to believe seem to be a nearly to extinction race.I enjoy with somo UFO documentaries but this book is the worst UFO-related story I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The aliens are watching you...","review":"...and they want you to quit smoking, improve your diet, and exercise more frequently.

The thing is, for me, when Strieber tells his story, it's like the best book I've ever read, but when he pretends to be some scientist or else, and he tries to look so objectif, it just gets pathetic, unbearable...However, I think people should read the book, but really skip some parts because some have just no sense..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodness!","review":"What an astonishing bunch of junk... from a FICTION writer, no less! It's difficult to accept that anyone can take this tripe seriously.

These events lead the author to believe that aliens from space or a phenonenon even more strange was occurring. The events are well-described and the reader is left with the impression that something happened here on some level. His later books trace further happenings and take the reader deeper into the mystery. Mr. Strieber at times reaches a level of poetry in his discriptions of events and his hopes for the future of humankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Communion","review":"True story?! After reading reviews of this book and many books on the same subject I would have to say that this book is very inconclusive.

And even that is getting a little tired these days with Strieber's rehashing of the genre (as if anyone could believe it's anything other than a genre--Streiber would have you believe this actually happened). And if that isn't bad enough, I found the book to be very poorly written and often times found myself wondering just how difficult can it be to find success in this field if talent is no longer a prerequisite? OK I've said enough. I didn't like it, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Let-Down Ever!","review":"Wow... I don't think i've ever been so disappointed in a book. Some books you hear so much about, and how they're out there paving the way for a certain topic, revolutionizing they way we think of something. This book does not deserve any of the above titles.This book is not even the slightest bit believable. At times Strieber himself, admits that he gets confused between what is reality and what is not. At the end of the book he pretty much fails his polygraph test. This book is boring and totally un-credible coming from a fiction writer.To finish, this book is right out boring. Like others stated on here, I kept reading because I just hoped it might pick up. And at about page 275, I lost all hope and skipped to the end. How a book like this ever got such a prestigious title is a complete mystery to me. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"crock of bull for the gullible","review":"Strieber claims to be an innocent joe off the street tellinghis story about being abducted and examined by space aliens.However, his lifelong fascination with ufology and his deepinvolvement with wacko metaphysical and paranormal phenomenomdiscredit his objectivity. In this and his other tomes heclaims aliens watched him browse his own book in a N.Y. bookstore,claims they control his bank accounts, and he leads a gullibleaudience to think that his wierd dreams are of some cosmologicalimportance. They aren't. They're not even interesting orentertaining. Streiber continues to cash in on the ufologyscene, and in the process discredits serious UFOlogistseverywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is a chore to read. You keep hoping it will get interesting. It is just poorly written. He rambles and repeats himself as if he really doesn't have enough to say about the subject to fill up a book. His experts are mostly others who also believe in alien abduction so their credibility is shaky in my opinion. It's hard to believe you could make a story about alien abduction boring but this guy has done it. Afterward it is hard to say if this guy is just crazy or a hypochondriac or just a writer who came up with a great idea to sell books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes and no","review":"The book in itself was very pleasant to read. I enjoyed every minute of it, however i think that Strieber sometimes exagerates deeply which undermines the truthfulness of his story. As soon as you start believing him, a deeply exagerated fact comes up (such as when he describes himself flying across the bedroom) and then you kinda loose interest.However, even though it might all be in his head, it is a good book to read!I give it four stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Communion\\" is different from any book I've ever read.","review":"What makes this book so stunningly compelling is the fact of the author's doubt with regard to his own plausibility. Again and again, he attempts to assert a sense of neutrality, of scientific objectivity. He doesn't ask that you believe him or disbelieve him, only that you carefully consider what he has to say and to make your own judgement. At times, Streiber's writing has an ethereal quality to it that almost supersedes the amazing message he wants to bring to the world - his descriptions of places he's visited and lived and the things which have happened to him there are not detailed or accurate, but rather told almost unconsciously from the heart, as though he has a desperate wish to place you there himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would give it ten stars if I could...","review":"This is one of those great works that has/will change the world. It started me on my own journey to find the truth about my own possible abductions. Strieber is not only a man of courage but a great writer, too. I've read just about all his books and I have to admit this one and Majestic are my favorites. If you enjoy an emotional rollercoaster ride, one that will certainly keep you up all night (you may not be able to sleep!) read Communion. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Written like fiction.","review":"Whitley is a fiction writer. He writes well, in the storytelling sense. This a good book, and I believe him. However it is written with in the storytelling flavor with much fluff added in. It reads musically with ups and downs and shades of color. Thus it is easy to also believe he is writing a fiction novel. The melody of the tone can drown the seriousness of the content, if it is really meant to be believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe it or not this is quite a good book","review":"Strieber weaves an interesting tale filled with speculation and revisionist history.

If you want a CD of Fletcher Henderson that will knock your socks off, you can get many of the same tracks on \\"Tidal Wave\\".

About 85 % of the book is on the period after 1740. About half of the book is about Franz-Josef's reign. The author's mainly cared about 'liberal' reform and concentrates on this throughout the entire book. I think that this is why he didn't give much space to the early Habsburgs, because they weren't envolved in liberal reform. The other main problem with the book is that it isn't clearly written. Someone who doesn't know the history of the times will have difficulties following the book. The format of the book is that it discusses the political, social, and cultural histories of each period.

I am far from convinced that any technical analysis can make profits consistenly, but I know enough about different methods to realize that the author has little knowledge about the subject.I rate it two stars because of the humour and self-critique it entails.

I was not familiar with the author but was hoping it was going to have a Malcom Gladwell style of writing and content judging by the cover but was disappointed.The running \\"gag' of the pouring good money after bad in buying WorldCom repeatedly wore thin after chapter 3. I am not a mathematician but put my foray into this stock purchase as a slap in the face for an uneducated greedy investor and I got what I deserved. At least this was a small percentage of my trading capital. The issue of compound interest has been covered by Motely Fool over a decade ago the the guide to calls and puts can be found in any trading 101 book.

I don't know how good mathematician the author is, but markets therms he is not experienced enough.

It is filled with the type of unsupported statements that would be laughed out of a mathematics paper. The book is neither clever nor mathematically rigorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple, you'll wonder why you never thought of it!","review":"I had the delight of hearing Mr. Lisk speak at a workshop recently and his ideas will change your concept of teaching music in the public school! One reason for the success of his methods is the natural association with students' mental development. Instead of teaching music, he believes that all that needs to be done is to help a student discover their own musical intelligence (a la Howard Gardner). These techniques should prove to be a welcome addition in any middle or high school band room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eileen Gray","review":"Not Recommended.Book contains some pictures of original pieces by Eileen; but other than that, the biography is brief and uninformative, also some of Eileen's rare furnitures are not shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect Everything Less.","review":"I was trying to find a manual (inexpensive being the reason for manual) treadmill that I could use in my living room to run or at least walk on while I was watching television. This turned out not to be the one. Running in nearly impossible because you have to hold onto the bars for stability, and even walking is awkward because the flywheel does not do a good job of keeping the belt at a steady speed. While the build quality is everything you would expect from the hundred and some price range (low), in my opinion this treadmill is unusable. I would strongly recommend not buying this product, even for just walkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all.

Had a problem with the monitor malfunctioning. The company sent me a new one at no charge, that still didn't solve the problem. They then sent me a new sensor pickup and new sensor wires. That remidied the problem. They have a quality product and excellent customer service. I will purchase thier products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suited for Large people","review":"The treadmill is a decent buy IFF you are a small person with your normal walking horizontal width (between the outer periphery of your two feet) less than 12\\" or 13\\" with the running shoes. Because the treadmill belt width is 13 inches only !As i was trying to walk on a continuous roll, my foot kept being stalled by the plastic encasing at the belt sides. That was very disturbing as i cannot walk without taking care not to jerk against the plastic. I have to place each foot effectively in front of the other like a cat walk to avoid that.

I did not know what to expect with a manual. I was previously walking outside for about an hour or using an automated treamill, elevated and at a pretty good clip for at least 45-60 minutes at the gym. I was surprized how stiff and difficult this was to use. I am 63 and in pretty good shape. I weigh 150 pounds and am 5' 7\\" tall. I can use this treadmill for only about 4-5 minutes and then have to change to sit-ups, Nordic Trac or my Total Gym for a while and then go back to this treamill.

Do not buy this book","review":"This book must have been written many years ago. I looked through out the book for a publication date but couldn't find one. Perhaps they don't want to let you know how OUTDATED the information is. There have been so many changes at Whistler that the guide is absolutely worthless! Hotel names have changed not to mention their star ratings. The book mentions Whistler is trying to get the 2010 Olympics and they've been elected to host the 2010 Olympics for years. With them hosting the next Winter Olympics, you would think Frommer's would have this book updated. I do NOT recommend to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I bought this CD after having seen Ken Burns' special on PBS. The energy that came through on screen in the Benny Goodman segments doesn't really come through in this CD. Artie Shaw said that Benny Goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability. That shows in this collection. Afterall, where would Jazz be if Jazz musicians didn't take risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mix","review":"I have many Benny Goodman cd's and I think this one is the easiest to listen to all the way through without skipping ahead to the next song or whatever. It's a nice flow and all well chosen songs. Very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Goodman and Jazz Era CD","review":"This is one of the best examples of the golden age of clarinet and big band/jazz music that I've heard. I enjoy it a great deal and also find it helpful to me as a clarinet player when trying to improve my own style/technique. Mr. Goodman is one smooth and delightful musician. This CD has so many of his world-famous tunes that it would be hard to go wrong with it.It also makes an excellent choice for a gift for that clarinetist in your life who is graduating from high school or college."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel of politics and romance in Renaissance Italy.","review":"Although The Stars Compel is the sequel to Michaele Roessner's The Stars Dispose, it doesn't require familiarity with the prior novel, though such familiarity will lend to an easier reading of this story. Tommaso is the son of famous chefs and has been named personal chef to the Duchessina in early Rome: his encounters with politics and romance as he attends to his duties provides an excellent story line steeped in Renaissance-era Florence and Rome atmosphere. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT perform as billed","review":"The sole reason I purchased this item was because I had a Region 2 (England) DVD I needed to show to my class. This player bills itself as being adjustable to any DVD format. This is simply not true. Despite hours on the phone with customer service over multiple days, it still could not be shifted to play anything except US-formatted DVDs. To top it all off, when the drama was finally over and it was determined that the player was useless for my purpose, I'd had it over 30 days and the Amazon-supported company it came from wouldn't allow it to be returned. Beware of this COBY product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"If you can't afford the price tag on the 5 CD set then this is for you ! Although any serious jazz collector would have most of these songs it is still a great collection that takes the listener through time and a trip to W52nd Street in New York City. The sound quality is excellent, especially on the older songs. If anything this CD will make you hungry for more Coltrane, Sachmo, Dizzy and the Count ! Purchase it and you WON'T be dissappointed !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Compilation","review":"This a great CD to own if one hasn't listen to jazz before. I do not own many jazz CDs, but I greatly enjoy listening to this one. I would recommend this CD to anyone that wants to listen to something upbeat. The CD is great to listen to during a bbq, dinner, other family events, etc. Ken Burns provides the best jazz music in this compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview for a novice","review":"I'm a complete novice to Jazz. Hence this purchase. It serves its purpose of providing a good introduction, and has informed my further exploration of this music. I much prefer the more recent work such as from Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane. But the sound quality on all tracks is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic","review":"Even though I am a jazz novice, I can feel the artists' motivations. I feel their soul, in their music they communicate something eternal, which may not be recreated. Take a chance and you will be inspired. One note from Louis Armstrong and you will thirst for more. Soon you will want Duke, Sarah, Miles, Dave. Don't delay. A few friends, one, or none, and a glass of wine, and nothing could be better to end or begin the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy compilation from a list of HUGE possibilities","review":"Out of 19 hours of footage and who knows how many hours of music to go through, this collection captures the absolute minimum of possible greatness. All of the histroical ginats are here, and with fine selections. And while some jazz fans might hem and haw over the penultimate decision-making of some of the tracks, the collection does justice to the series and to jazz.My only gripe, and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars, is that it doesn't cover anywhere near enough of the later stuff of the series (1960 on), arguably some of the most popular stuff in the form.Great starting place for people interested in going that far back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless product","review":"I have seen countless positive reviews for this product and I was looking forward to trying it out. Although I was unimpressed at first use, I wanted to wait to review until I had finished the jar. I thought that perhaps the benefits of the product would grow over time.The product was greasy (no surprise, and not a problem if it works) and its odor is fairly unpleasant. Not a really big deal, but EM did not help with skin irritation, rashes, or even basic dry skin (elbows, hands & feet). I have no chronic skin issues and I wonder how someone with real skin issues would view this product.It contains ingredients one can find in countless products in any health food store for a much more reasonable price. It does not even work as a hair pomade. I found it a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUNK!","review":"I would have chosen zero stars if that had been an option. This product is bunk! There is no truth whatsoever to it healing bruises or anything else. It looks like vaseline in a jar and has about as much healing power as the same. Do not waste your money on this product like I did. I guess I was a sucker because I wanted it to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, haunting tale","review":"A wonderful, haunting story that ultimately gets to the heart of what fantasy--and stories--are all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and incomprehensible","review":"Stewart is capable of evocative description, using uncommon words. He also incorporates the argot of sailing into his tale. This fantasy work tells the story of an island people in conflict with a land people with a mix-in of ghosts and heroes. In actuality the plot line is often obscure. Excessive use of dialog makes the story drag. In fact, I gave up after page 136. The writing is picturesque but the plot is slow-moving and obscure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I had to read this book for a book group. I found it unreadable. It seemed like it was written by someone in high school who would be better destined to be butcher. I picked it up several times and truly wanted to finish because of my book group, but I could not go further than page 75 before totally giving up on the book. Although the five other members of my group did finish reading the book and said that they enjoyed it, we spent time in the group pointing out some of the particulary badly written passages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meissen: Collector's Catalogue","review":"I agree with another reviewer and was disappointed by the book. There is very little information about marks, periods, maker's marks (no pictures at all) and ninety percent of the photos of Meissen ware are in black and white and are not of the best quality. It definitely isn't a collector's catalogue as most of the pieces are unavailable to the public (unless they have a lot of money). As a new collector it did not help me at all. There is a book by Jim and Susan Harran called \\"Meissen Porcelain Identification and Value Guide\\" which has amazing photos and gives far greater detail on the products, the background, the marks (and forgery's) of this fascinating maker of porcelain."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I was deeply frustrated, by the quality of paper, the poor print quality, lack of sharpness of colors and the fact that, the great majority of the plates are in black and white.

I corresponded directly with Luna Guitars on this matter and they sent me a Dean case because they checked and all of the Andromeda cases were incorrectly cut. This was over a year ago and I recently checked back to see if I could finally get an Andromeda case. They checked again and they still have the same non-fitting cases. And this guitar model has been discontinued so it is unlikely that they will ever get replacement cases. I love Luna Guitars but was very disappointed that they didn't correct the Andromeda case problem. This was especially disappointing since I have their acoustic case and it fits like a glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily of the Desert - Aloe Vera Gelly","review":"It is not pure Aloe Vera.

That flower could serve as a metaphor for the book, which, through chapters that focus on different but related characters, provides poignant and compelling portraits not only of the individual characters, but of the cultures they inhabit.

Chuck is great. If you push the forward reverse selector in the middle position the chuck locks for one handed drill bit changing. 5 year warranty on drill.The impact driver takes philips bits and others and drives screws great.

I'm not a feminist, not a holy man, and not a \\"do gooder.\\" I'm a professional cleaner and I came across this book during a suicide cleanup.

It did nothing for my female, Hispanic suicide victim.I want to let readers know that Hispanic female suicides are very rare, except in Santa Ana, California.

More power to you if that's your thing, but I find them absolutely disgusting. This book does more to incite anger in me than any kind of stimulation (physical OR mental), as many of the girls in this book are obviously naturally beautiful, but have tainted that with unfortunately placed tattoos, ridiculous piercings, and some of the most asinine hairstyles I've ever seen outside of a French circus.

I was gone for ten days so I dropped both of them in the water before I left. The Ph was normal. When I returned home, they looked like they had a cloud of slime or decay around them. The water smelled like there was a dead fish in the tank. Fortunately, my aunt was collecting my mail and sprinkled food in the tank every few days so all 7 fish were alive. I don't think they would have survived. When I scooped the feeders out, they were still large and intact so I know that they were not working well at all. Not sure what it was that caused this, but I wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide view of Hancock's music","review":"If there's one word I think of every time I listen to this CD, it's \\"Evolution.\\" It's fun to watch Herbie Hancock change from his early days as one of the greatest jazz piano players, through his \\"Headhunters\\" period, all the way to the pop hit \\"Rockit\\".

This album is full of bad imitations of the polite jazz from the 1950s.

It is also well written and easy to follow.HOWEVER, it was written before most of the key Scottish documents (e.g. births, marriages, deaths, wills etc) became available for search on the internet. So it misses the new power of computer based research on these scottish document sites and advice on how best to do this. It also shows its pre-computer age in many other aspects.No longer a good buy - unless you don't use a computer ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digging Scotland!","review":"A very young Craig Ferguson, before he developed the polished persona that he has today.

I find I have a better grip and weight seems to be more evenly distributed. I also find that my movements are smoother. The weighted balls are especially good for leg excercises where the ball is placed behind the knee and gripped, much easier to hold onto. They're fun to just play with, too!

This is a truly dreadful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOX SETS (in general)","review":"Small point, but why is the packaging so odd? I have noticed this on a lot of boxed sets... makes it difficult to incorporate with existing collection... or you have to place in separate jewel boxes. Just too much \\"extra\\" that is not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Ken's mom was a jazz fan....?","review":"I admit that I've watched and enjoyed some of this set. However, it is terribly nostagic and fails to emphasize the true significance of any of the artists. I question how much Ken Burn's even likes jazz...Most notably, though I am not a huge fan myself, Duke Ellington should have been pedistaled to the same heights that Mozart, Bach, Ravi Shankar or The Beatles typically are.Similarly, the films failed to recognize much of the social and philosophical significance of the music so commonly discussed by the artists themselves.In the end (which comes a lot sooner than expected), if you exclude the last couple of discs and call the film Jazz: The Early Years I'd probably recommend it. Unfortunately, it was kind of like a history of Western European music that fails to mention anything past Beethoven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for someone who knows nothing about jazz","review":"As a seasoned jazz listener, this is a fairly disappointing boxed set. It vastly overemphasizes the early decades, big-band, and dance music to the exclusion of the more core group-improvisatory material. The discs run in roughly chronological order and it takes until the last disc to get out of the sixties!If you are feeling nostalgic for the music of the 20s, 30s and 40s, or know nothing about jazz and want to start somewhere, I guess this isn't terrible..many of these recordings are perfectly fine and the musicians perfectly respectable. If you're thinking of getting this for someone who actually knows something about jazz, do them a favor and avoid this. They'd be much better off with 2-3 cd's that came out in the last year than a smattering of backfill that probably substantially overlaps cd's they bought years ago because they thought they should have some of X but never listened to more than once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks For The Introduction","review":"I agree with some of the other critics, it's not an all inclusive History, but some could say with their private collections that a complete collection (in a form people could afford) is impossible. I appreciate that someone took the time to collect all this and give us the chance to wet our whistle to the great collections still to be heard. It's impossible to make everyone happy, so I than Ken Burns for trying his best to do the impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Starter","review":"The disdain of jazz snobs notwithstanding, this as an excellent starter and introduction to jazz for those of us who are humble neophytes. I enjoyed it thoroughly and have since branched out to purchase numerous jazz CDs as a result. Believe it or not, having grown up on rock & pop, I had never heard of Miles Davis, John Coltrane or Lester Young before I listened to this set.BTW, just to annoy jazz snobs out there, I have to mention that I bought this set because Spyro Gyra got me interested in jazz. I bought their \\"Got The Magic\\" album at Media Play on a whim a couple of years ago when I passed by a display that it was part of."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HISTORY OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG","review":"As a history of jazz, it is hardly comprehensive. Mr. Burns seems obsessed with Louis Armstrong; even when dscussing the bop era, Armtrong pops up again. Also, as one commentator has pointed out below, for Burns jazz=black. Most great white jazz players are given short shrift with exceptions for Benny Godman and Tommy Dorsey, and of all people, Ted Heath. The Herman-Kenton era is brushed aside with a sentence and many great white trumpet players aren't even methioned such as Ziggy Elman, Sonny Berman, Bill Chase, etc. What about trombonists Bill Harris, J.J. Johnson and Kai Windig?The claim made by one that jazz is strictly an Afro-American music form is nonsense at least by today's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too little","review":"Contrary to what some reviewers have stated, this is not a good place for someone wanting to get into jazz. This is mainly because this set costs too much for that. Also, there's over-whelmingly too much Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday and Dizzie Gillespie tracks here and little else. You would think that with a 5 disc box set, that Ken Burns could have come up with even little known but great jazz artists to include in this collection aside from adding a few more of the wider known ones as well. I am not a \\"jazz snob\\" and I feel it's unfair to some of the newer, more contemporary artists to be ignored as well - the rock equivalent of that would be refusing to acknowledge the talent of Jack White simply because he doesn't play like Clapton or Hendrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"The history of jazz acc. to Marsalis","review":"Ken Burns' Jazz is a misnomer...it's a jazz history done to accomodate Wynton Marsalis' agenda. The agenda amounts to denigrating the accomplishments of white musicians, calling all fusion junk, and promoting Wynton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken Burns pompous ego trip omits Jazz Greats","review":"The Ken Burns series is a joke to anyone who likes Jazz.Sure Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and Miles Davis were great. But there is clearly too much here by these artists.What about Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, Bill Evans, Chet Baker, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Tito Puente, Airto Moreira? Mongo Santamaria? Where are the white people? What about all the Latin American influences? The are among the bestselling Jazz artists of all time! There is no \\"originator\\" in Jazz. Like an quantum mechanics, where everything effects everything, like the butterfly wing in Asia than causes a hurricane in America, everyone in Jazz listened to everyone, everyone influenced everyone.\\"Performance, not pigment\\".

And it's not even good. After past albums where the band shines, this one jsut shows them jumping on the bandwagon. It's too bad that this particular bandwagon fell apart from too many bad \\"swing\\" bands. 8 to the bar is too good of a band to do something like this. Or so I thought. I think they need to take a step back and think of something new rather then trying to keep their swing status alive in the main stream. Especially by copying Richard Cheese and Paul Anka. And let's face it, Paul Anka's attempt wasn't that great either.

The only problems are with the boot covers and the arm piece. They are both too large. I had to sew the forearm piece so that it would fit snuggly on her forearm. The boot covers were a disaster the first time she wore the costume: they came down, became undone on the bottom (even after I altered the length of the velcro), and made my daughter trip. Once I bought her black boots and adjusted the width of the arm accessory, it looked great. She looked awesome and loved being Batgirl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info on fire streams","review":"This book is a bit dated in its tone but the content is first rate and most of it is still cutting edge. I highly recomend this book to anyone who wants to study fire streams or tactics in an in depth way.

His career has gone through so many different stages that any greatest hits collection is bound to suffer from lack of continuity. Besides, each of his classic stages are already represented by albums that should be owned outright, and not excerpted (Birth of the Cool, Walkin', Kind of Blue, Miles Smiles, Bitches Brew).Nevertheless, some people might appreciate hearing a few highlights back to back, and the Ken Burns disk certainly makes for great listening. If you're a Miles freak, this is extraneous, but if you want to get a fair overview, this disk is a great place to dive in. - Tom Ryan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Break and flake easily","review":"These crayons are washable and rich in color but they break easily.

Having overcome the burning of his hands early in life he accomplished much. He was a person who throughly enjoyed his music, loved the Southern Gospel music field, and loved each of his fellow performers, envious of no one.He loved his family and they in return loved him. His story about his young son in the play about the crufixication, burial, and His coming to life again where the son says \\"ready or not, here I come\\", is really an example of Anthony's down to earth nature.He will be missed, by his friends and those who admired his talent.A must for all Southern Gospel fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's child","review":"This DVD is a spectacular representation of Anthony Burger.

All of these songs appeared on the Mighty CHESS label, and vary from Etta James storming opener, \\"Mellow Fellow's\\" to Kip Anderson's laid-back original version of \\"A Knife and a Fork\\". For extra confusion, Tommy Tucker's \\"Hi Heel Sneakers\\" is here, and Pigmeat Markham's \\"Here Comes the Judge\\" comedy soul disc, which was later sampled by Naughty by Nature for \\"Hip Hop Hooray\\", makes its only appearance on CD that I know of.

No way I'm doing it wrong since I've already directly loaded around a 1,000 CDs this way from all the major, and minor labels. I guess I won't be buying anymore Warner CD's.

A talented musical storyteller and interpreter of cabaret song, she's also a savvy business woman and communication trainer. She helps business leaders apply performance skills to their presenting and organizational communication. \\"Leadership Presence\\" shares her ideas through the experiences of those she has worked with.The paradox of great performance is that it requires authenticity and vulnerability. For a performance to work, it can't be \\"performed\\" but must be grounded in real character, feelings, and values. Belle Linda gets this - and shares it with those fortunate enough to learn from her.As I become more and more involved in coaching presenters, I'm rereading this book, published in 2003, and finding it even more valuable the second time around. I'd say it's well worth the investment of time to gain the authors' valuable perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to know in a practical engaging book!","review":"I was a little skeptical when I started this book as the authors are actors.

If you're reading this I assume you know the \\"kompakt sound\\" so I won't waste my time describing it. I\\"ll just tell you that this is, in my opinion, the best Kompakt compilation ever, I own all of the \\"Total\\" series, aswell as Kompakt 100, kompakt Pop Ambient, etc.. and many solo releases. And this group of 12 inches singles compilated between end of 2004 and part of 2005 is the best I've heard. Not as \\"minimal\\" as the first records by this label, and a lot more funky. Hypnotic beats, eerie sounds, and angelic pads are all over the tracks. A perfect record for home listening (i don't know why but I'd recommend it for sunday afternoon, specially if it's raining). I'm not a DJ, just a music lover, and I write as that, but trust me, these songs would work pretty well in a dancefloor too."},{"rating":"2","title":"micro house goldmine","review":"This is wonderful compilation of minimal house and micro techno.One of my favorites in Kompakt's Total series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot!","review":"The Kettler bike is not made for a short person -- if you don't have long legs, do not buy this bike.

I ordered it because it looked nice and sturdy, is made of glass, and had acceptable reviews here on Amazon. The first thing that annoyed me is that this bottle is shaped in a way that you need to hold it with two hands like a cocktail shaker unless you're a giant with huge paws that can reach around it. But you need your second hand anyway to keep the stopper in place, which has precisely zero footing in the bottleneck and falls out at the slightest of tilts, shakes, or moves, leaving a stain of salad dressing wherever it drops. Do not be deceived: This is a pretty-looking but very poorly designed product, and I strongly advise against buying it to save you a lot of frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preety impressive","review":"All things considered, this is really good. I think Duke is the most prolific artist in jazz, so making a one CD compilation that satisfies everyone is impossible. Every song is a masterpiece, specially everything recorded before 1940. I'd actually give it 4.5 stars, because I dont think the inclussion of 'Jeeps Blues' was a good idea. The only track needed from Newport is 'diminuendo in blue', and since that was impossible to include here for time restrictions, they should have gone for something from Far east suite or Such sweet thunder. If you dont have any Ellington, there has never been a better one CD overview than this. Now the sound is surpeisingly good. For some of the blanton-webster tracks, is even better than the latest remastered editions. How do you explain that RCA?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choices","review":"Having heard the Ellington/Coltrane album, I wanted to hear more of the Duke. Unfortunately, the selections for this CD are of generally very poor sound quality and do not provide the best examples of Ellington's greatness. It is at best a very uneven set. It does not compare to the very good selections on the Rollins, Miles, and Coltrane collections that are part of the same series."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty unimpressive, why Ken why???","review":"I know why because of money?

I was intrigued by stories of him as a child. I must say as a social history and/or biography of Flowers this book is a complete flop. I was lucky enough to purchase a rare copy of Flowers biography published in 1928 by Edney and Flowers' widow. The book leaves much to be desired, a contention which Mr. Kaye agrees with. Interestingly, despite this fact Mr. Kaye seems to use the Edney book as his major source for Flowers life. It would have been nice to have had a hometown heros life done in a more concise fashion. Sadly, Flowers legacy seems as neglected today, after the publication of this book, as it was before hand. Poor Tiger."},{"rating":"2","title":"When music was simply beautiful","review":"I can listen to this CD over and over again. No matter who you are, I recommend this music, as well as all the music of this period, which sounds so strange and yet comforting to us today. Far from being either \\"classical\\" or \\"high art\\" this is music that was written simply for its beauty and Jordi Savall and his collaborators are always successful in bringing these obscure composers to us in unbelievably lush performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor batter y design","review":"When it works, it's great. The problem is that almost every time I use it, I have to remove the two batteries, reinsert them and reinsert the battery cover. After I use it once or twice, it stops working until I repeat the above maneuver. I am not sure if it is a problem with the battery compartment design, or perhaps I am \\"resetting\\" the device by removing and reinserting the batteries.I tried calling tech support for assistance, but as usual, leaving a message resulted in no reply.I think Hawkings is a high quality company, and I don't understand why they don't want to give better support to this product.

He takes opposites and tries to mix them, murder and love, truth and falsehood, religion and atheism. He actually thinks that homicide can be love.

It is a book for people who are not afraid to use their minds where religion and spirituality is concerned"},{"rating":"1","title":"A denial of Christianity","review":"Several people have suggested that this book should be called \\"When We Talk About Heresy, Let's Be Honest.\\" It would be a more fitting title. Godsey denies every major tenet of Biblical Christianity. He denies the deity of Christ. He denies substitutionary atonement. He denies the inspiration of Scripture. This is essentially a redefining of God, Christ, and Christianity. This is a terrible book and shows why a change was needed in the leadership of the SBC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this Book to Understand Liberalism in the SBC","review":"If you really want to know why there was a conservative resurgence in the SBC, read this book. Godsey may be honest but he is not mainstream Southern Baptist. His theology, so far to the left of the average Southern Baptist, caused many Georgia Baptists to reconsider their support for Mercer University when this book was published. The very fact that Godsey has retained his job as president of Mercer University points to the deep rift that still exists among Southern Baptists in the 1990's.Jim Shaver, Pastor First Southern Baptist Church Great Falls, Montana"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Reading","review":"Lewellyn's Matical Almanac series has been a must have on my reading list for years.

It took about two months for the cheap, pot metal adjustment mechanism under the seat to break. I was not abusing it (for example, I didn't try to adjust it while sitting on it or anything...although really, you should be able to do that). All I did was adjust it up and down now and then, as both me and my then-6 year old play. It just snapped. Pretty much impossible to repair, also, due to the way it's constructed. So for the last couple of years, I've just had a really short piano bench. Nobody uses it. I'll probably screw a piece of wood or two on it in between the framed pad and the main part of the bench, to elevate the pad enough to make it usable. But then it will look crappy. My suggestion would be to avoid this product. Either get one of those X-frame benches ($50 or less), or spring for a decent piano bench (usually well above $200).

The strainer is only a few inches in diameter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Well, it looks pretty. . .but that's about as far as it goes. One wonders if the people that designed this strainer ever used it. The thing you don't find out until you have this in your hand is that that pretty stainless rim has an overhang on the inside. The result is that when you turn the strainer over to rinse out whatever you strained out, that material lodges in the overhang and is essentially impossible to clean out.

Bob and I started our journalistic careers in the spring of 1967 at The Indianapolis News. He moved on to New York and Reuters and I ran out the clock in Indianapolis. But we both shared a fascination for the bizarre little stories that crop up from time to time - the kind of stuff we'd clip out of the paper and poke into a drawer or a file folder with the intention of putting it all together in a collection someday. That's what Bob has done for us with this book - saved a handful of these gems that make newspapers something other than dreary chronicles of mayhem and tragedy.

This identical problem happened to a previous identical model I'd bought and used for several years, and I liked it enough to try it a second time. I'm now sending it out for repair or replacement under warranty, and I'll report back on whether they were responsive to this request. I don't drop or abuse the kettle, and the fact that this identical flaw has appeared in two kettles in a row makes me think that it is a design flaw.

With the current quality it stacks in a such position that you can not turn it to open or close position. You can get it out using knife, but this is really bad quality of parts as my previous Krupp kettle served several years without any problems.The smell of plastic diminished with time, but remains pretty strong for the whole life of the kettle.Avoid this product.

I would prefer stainless steel however, to the plastic, and will upgrade one day soon.Updated: After using the Krups for over a year, I decided to upgrade to a Breville stainless steel model.

I wanted something economical to cut the grass. There is a reason they invented power mowers. Hand push reel mowers have a difficult time cutting thick grass. This mower did a fair job when the sod was new and the grass was not too thick. Once it got thick, it didn't cut well at all and took forever. The grass catcher is a complete waste of time and money.

For those unfamiliar, Studio channel is where self important over pampered clowns talk about how wonderful they are and why we should take them seriously.This, this THING is about a faked documentary of making a faked documentary on the Loch Ness Monster that the real monster crashes, mabey looking for royalties. Any attempt at a plot is ruined by constant interviews in the scene and if you are still reading this you are more interested now than you will be watching the movie. I forgot the name of the Playboy Playmate who needed the money and finding out would mean putting the DVD back on, but she has a bikini on for a few seconds.If that floats your fishing boat, get a magazine.

Granted, it does this in a way that demands the viewer to almost humor the movie and give it props for trying. I found that none of the gags were ever quite funny enough and the acting was often not good enough to pull the wool over my eyes.What I will say having been a Loch Ness Monster fan as a child, was that the fairly anti-climatic climax of the film where the creature attacks the crew was fun. Not anywhere near as kick ass as Jaws though. We never really get to see the Loch Ness Monster in this film. This is a sad thing as this film certainly didn't have enough laughs or acting to carry itself, and you just feel let down when the film ends. A retarded CGI of the beast would have made it all better! Two people drown but we don't believe it anyway. We really don't care. What did the movie accomplish?

Apparently there is still a place in the market for ignorant middle aged slackers like Zak Penn to whom everything is a joke, and anything that isn't understood should be mocked. This film is not funny, it has nothing intelligent or meaningful to say and it lowers Herzog to the role of buffoon in his own artistic medium. Considering the many thousands of good, honest people this movie attempts to ridicule, I felt extremely offended and sick after making the mistake of viewing it. All existing copies should be gathered together, sealed in a large metal cage and sunk to the bottom of Loch Ness. Perhaps there could even be room for Zak and Werner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why watch this movie?","review":"I had no expectations going in, save the notes on the DVD case. I knew going in it was a mockumentary.However... I'm now reading reviews of it that indicate that it's funny. I just got done watching it, and, much like Herzog himself towards the end, I feel \\"empty.\\" I don't know if I missed a plotline somewhere, or didn't get the joke, but it just wasn't funny. To me, this was a flat, flat film that went nowhere. I doubt it was even credible enough for me to trick my more gullible friends into watching it under the pretense of it being a documentary.I really can't imagine why anyone, short of rabid fans of the folks in the film, would want to watch this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD extras","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I was given this dvd as a Christmas gift. I enjoyed the film very much, mostly due to Werner Herzog's performance. He shines despite Zack Penn's best efforts to steal the lime light. Although I didn't get all the jokes, I found myself laughing throughout most of the film.What I was most happy about was all the dvd easter eggs. Without giving it away, I'll say the commentary by Werner and Zack was by far the most entertaining commentary I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting twist on the military and mercenaries.","review":"I liked this book and the second in the series \\"Lieutenant.\\" As a military retiree I can see the place for military units other than those of a government. Further, I see that with a fair standard of ethical and moral conduct that troops employed as a free lance military can have a beneficial effect on the governments that employ them.

The small unit tactics and combat were interesting to this former infantryman. However, there wasn't much plot, the progress of the story was dully predictable, there was never much sense of danger to our hero, and the enemy was bland and distant. Try another series ... like the Starfist series or Honor Harrington."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior copy of Joel Rosenberg's \\"Not For Glory\\"","review":"When I picked this up, I was in the mood for some fun, if a little shallow, military science-fiction (my Honor Harrington fix). I got the latter, but not the former. The story progressed at a sluggish pace and the hero didn't really show any attributes that made me care whether he survived or not. But what really bugged me was the feeling that everything was just a little too familiar. In 1988, Joel Rosenberg wrote \\"Not For Glory\\" about the Metzadans, futuristic neo-Israelis whose poor planet's only viable export is mercenaries. The structure and 'feel' of the Metzadans was very similar to the dirigents, but also backed up by a good story. Too bad it's out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"I appreciated \\"Hammer's Slammers\\" much more after reading this one, which is a shame as some of his others are not bad at all.

I was hoping for a decent soldiers-in-arms read but instead got a comic book minus the pictures. If you like characters with some depth, don't buy this book. If you enjoy reading about the clash of cultures and what life might be like in the future, don't bother. However, if you want a pure plot driven story that goes into excrutiating military tactical detail, this is the series for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond routine into the boring","review":"Unlike most military SF, this has neither moral quandaries, interesting tech, bloody melodrama, or philosphical musings.

My preferences run from David Drake (my favorite), to the StarWars novels, to Honor and her ilk and beyond. A cover depicting a space marine and a plot about mercs is usually enough to snag my attention and make that last payment on my credit card a few dollars more and a few days further away. Officer-Cadet had the picture and described the plot...but there was nothing between page 1 and 279 to even keep me awake. There isn't much plot to speak of and what plot there is, is propped up by every niggling cliche in the book (forgive the pun).I only hope Rick Shelley's other books are better, though I seriously doubt I'll spend the time or money to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad military sci fi; skip it unless you're a genre fan","review":"The author has potential but the book needs a lot of work.The opening premise is flaky and inconsistent with the cover blurb. The main character draft-dodges service with the Federal Police (a much tougher job than infantry, I might add); this is _not_ \\"trumped-up charges.\\" He leaves Earth to sign up with patently unrealistic \\"mercenaries\\" on a cartoon-stage world.The main character is one-dimensional. The combat is late 20th century; the tactics and technology employed are pathetic. A company of 20th century Marines could eat both sides for lunch; oh, and has the author ever heard of orbital bombardment? Infantry GPS? Crew-served weapons? _ARMOR?_ The client world has neither a distinct culture nor any realistic means of paying mercenaries.I'd recommend S.M. Stirling and Jerry Pournelle instead.

The other book was very clear and helpful. This one just seemed sloppy. The authors just list everything they can think of that might boost dopamine or serotonin without any editorial judgement -- obviously nobody should take dozens of different kinds of prescription meds and supplements at high levels at once. Overall, OK, I guess, but other book, which seems less popular based on the number of reviews, was way better -- it felt like a doctor saying 'ok, here's all the things that might work, but this is the specific plan I recommend and i have found works with my patients' rather than a laundry list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Edge Effect","review":"Very informative book.

I have seen some of them myself, in fact, in Lanciano and also in Portugal and in the U.S. so I can say that Ms. Cruz did touch on the most important aspects of these events.

Unfortunantly I picked up this book having forgot I read it, though it was nice to re-read- I was saddened by the fact that it must not have left a lsating impression on me.

Seeing that Mr. Plalhniuk liked it, I figured it had a 50/50 chance of my liking it (like C.P.'s books)I got maybe 40 pages into it, and i just kind of fizzed out. The writing style he uses is a poor rendition of C.P.'s, which is probably why he liked the book so much... it's his protege. But not in a good way.I got disinterested very quickly, as i did with _Diary_ & _Invisible Monsters_.

He is a masterful teacher, and this book will take you into the art of false identification (at least I take the book as a valid description) from passports, to birth and death certificates, and all the myriad of data points that converge to define an individual in the modern world. One of the published reviews on this web site claimed that it suffered from a lack of plot, but I think the review somewhat misses the driving force in this novel -- it is not trying to save his girlfriend, Keara, nor is it trying to trick the \\"evaluator,\\"; rather, he's trying to evade himself. We are in the world of \\"head games\\" here, so it's a bit wide of the mark to compare this to a Tarrantino action/plot drive.

I even used channel locks to tighten the compression nut, but the boat still overpowered the clamping force of the nut.

I never felt this series though lengthy, got bogged down the way WOT has. The final book is not a disappointment.The book begins slowly, but the reader is rivetted from the first 150 pages or so onwards. The ending is exciting and moves along well. Strides are taken to further develop Kiriel and Diora, predominately.This being said, I felt there were far too many unresolved subplots at the end. Whatever happened to Jewel and Avandar, for instance? I'm sure this is a lead in to a follow on book.

I think the metal wire that sometimes makes noise every time it touches a hard surface (like furniture or the hardwood floor) scares her a little bit.Anyway, i knew it was a high chance that she might not like it, as many other commercial toys i bought for her didn't sparked her interest.

The pain was was not diminished in any way, and I was not able to tolerate getting a full Brazilian wax (again). I was so mad that the product didn't work and had there been any goop left in the tube, I would have thrown it away.Spend your money on a stronger topical anesthetic, especially if you have low pain tolerance.As for me, on my next visit, I'm taking the tequila with me.

Even Midnight Oil made a few (VERY few) concessions towards wider world audiences beyond Down Under, but not Redgum. If you're not from there, particularly if you're from the U.S., it's a little unsettling. But listen to the songs--there's a heart and soul and, yes, righteous rage at the despoiling of the land, the caving-in to ouside interests and the exploitation of the poor, the immigrants and the indigenous people in Australia--and see if they don't move you in the way any music that calls to your conscience should.

Upon going mainstream with a major label, they somehow managed to bring in that crowd and still not alienate the MM die-hards like myself. I've been a faithful listener for about 6 years, and I never tire of any of their stuff...and I have all of it! Warning: upon hearing MM, you will either instantly become a lifelong fan or not like them at all. Brock is a lyrical genius, and it's good to see that he and the band are finally being recognized after 12 years of under-the-radar phenominal stuff. I highly recommend \\"Lonesome Crowded West\\" and \\"This is a Long Drive...\\" as follow ups to \\"Good News\\". They'll give you an idea of MM before they had to trim the fat and get rid of those 8-minute rantings for a mainstream studio album. Also, you MUST see them live.

(IE: The nod to Bukowski etc. came off a little contrived I thought).Some great sounds and good development from the band away from their indie base, but on the whole a CD that quickly moved from my CD changer to my CD-organizer to \\"to be traded\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone just say it without bias?","review":"These guys sold-out. I'm not saying that is a bad thing for the band (who can blame them for wanting to be famous?), just that this CD is clearly a move toward the masses from previous CD's.For my part what is pitched for the masses is really great music if you like that sort of thing.The rest of the CD is not real good for the masses, and really not as good as previous offerings from the Mouse either... so for many long-time fans a let down.I'd recommend borrowing before buying, and make up your own mind after a few weeks of play.

A lot of artists would go blue in the face forcing their music and lyrics to be this genuine. Modest Mouse just gets it, without the effort. Brock would prefer to go blue in the face by forcing a raw voice out of a small airway.A number of reviewers have compared Modest Mouse and Pavement. I don't get it. They're both effortless and original, yes, but ones the mouth and the other the eyes. Steven Malkmus and Isaac Brock are both great writers, but as different as night and day. Malkmus is stream of consiousness.

Perhaps. But between the self-pitying, whiney lyrics and the music that is more of a din than something you could dine to... this CD really struck out.If you are a MM fan, I'd borrow before buying on this one. If you are new to the Mouse, and don't particularly care for whiney lyrics and a CD that is more disjointed than usual... use the \\"similar artists\\" feature to find alternatives. Then decide. My guess is you will see through what the radio has done for these guys per their single, and will get something that is good through most of the CD. Either way, you will have a bit more info before you spend your money.Word to the wise: This site has quite a fanboy effect going on. So I'd be sceptical of the many \\"positive\\" reviews. Compare before you buy, but don't go by the reviews (pro or con) alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Modest Mouse's movement toward a more Flaming Lips-like sound unfortunately doesn't pay off here. While the first few songs work well and seem to suggest that the band has managed to create a more melodic, trippy sound, the rest of the album is a real letdown. It's indulgent, and you're not sure if it's becuase the band is trying the old \\"this is meant to be unlikeable and it's your fault for wanting it to be likeable\\" or if it's becuase they simply didn't have enough good songs to fill a cd.Definitely one of their weaker efforts, but perhaps a transitional album that will lead to something greater next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"four stars","review":"Having never heard any song before Float On, I have to say I was a bit disappointed that the album wasn't as catchy as the single. But that was before I realized that I liked it. The album will (probably) open a first time listener's ears to different types of music, possibly taking them farther away from the mainstream crap that MTV consistently plays.

Well, I can tell you that it's not really worth buying if you're not into this type of music. It's definitely different. They're sound is unique, and lyrics stand out a lot. Some songs are just not worth listening to. While others you can bare. But half of the album is decent. It's hard to review music, but I would say that it is somewhat worth buying. Mostly depending on your background with this band, or other music. If you like their main song, don't expect the rest to sound the same. There are only two main songs on the album.

Sure britany can lip sinc and dance (...) real well, but the music that she is assiosiated with isn't art. It is a precision guided money vacuum. The succubus of teenager wallets, if you will. Actually its fine if you aren't demanding anything of music other than a cheap, immediate thrill that will not cause you to think about anything critically.Simply, modest mouse is the bipolar opposite of her (bipolar as the both qualify as music). As they will cause you to think about certain things critically, demand time to fully appreciate and do what they want, not what record labels think you (the general populus) want.Eh, either way, Nevermind saved a generation from pop, but it would be wishful thinking to think this will do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Impression","review":"I have listened to this album once. Only once. Yep. I am rating this album 2 stars after only 1 listen before it has a chance to grow on me. If you buy this new album expecting to hear \\"The Lonesome Crowded West\\" or \\"The Moon and Antarctica\\" you will most likely fling 2 stars at it like I did. Ok.. now it is time to address some of the other reviews here to set the record straight! This is not the best album Modest Mouse has ever recorded- so don't let any of those sunshiny reviews confuse you. Conversely it isn't an attempt at selling out and it is anything but pop. (Sorry pop fans... keep your wallet in your pocket until the new Shakira disc hits the streets). This is a bit of a departure for Modest Mouse that is neither great nor a total waste. It is just sort of there. But fret not... it isn't total crap and it will be a decent disc to throw in the ole 5 disc changer and hear every once in a while when shuffle permits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modest entry from the mouse? Great? Abomination?","review":"While its true that many Britney fans also like the mouse, and that Indie fans mostly find that sickening... its a non-issue. Bottom-line: Is the music good enough to fill a CD, and are the lyrics keeping it real, or trying so hard to be clever they have to borrow from other sources to be taken seriously?Only you can answer that. Question is: based on very mixed reactions on this CD do you really want to part with your hard earned money before you are sure? Personally I strongly recommend you borrow before you buy on this one. You may like it, I hated the half-baked music and the whiney lyrics... but that could be just me.Good luck! Hope you find music to make you happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly named; like chewing on razor blades","review":"I came, I listened, I bought it. I listened (a lot more), I hated it (to the max), I sold it (quicker than a fox with a burning tail in a field of dynamite).Now the style of music I actually liked, but the more you listen to the lyrics the more depressing the CD was... so I thought maybe I'd check out another MM CD. Well that was until I read another reviewer below that said this was MM's \\"up\\" CD???!!For the love of mercy man, you mean to say this is the Mouse on a GOOD day?!!!!The music leans toward some fine efforts at innovation, but after a few spins in your player... fizzles. The experimentation (which I normaly love about a band) never really latches onto anything that makes the money spent worthwhile.So, in summary: The lyrics suck, but at least most of the music is bad. So if you REALLY love bad news (semi-angry/bitter people need not apply), I guess this review is a dream come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modest Mouse Fans Beware","review":"If you've never heard Modest Mouse before, then I encourage you to buy this album. Its catchy, and enjoyable, and to those accustomed to the MTV/Radio menu, extremely unique.However, if you loved the almost primitive savant Isaac Brock embodied in \\"Lonesome Crowded West\\" or the chaotic, yet cohesive, eruption of genius that was \\"The Moon and Antarctica\\" DO NOT buy this album. Simply download the following tracks: 2, 6, maybe 7, 8, 11 and maybe 15. The remaining tracks, especially \\"Float On\\" represent a (hopefully) temporary breakdown in artistic integrity and an utter lack of originality. Worst of all, the genuine quality that has always been a natural presence in all of Modest Mouse's music is absent from most of these tracks. There's no soul, no intensity, and certainly no catharsis. The fact is, to the Modest Mouse faithfull, this album is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this record.","review":"I'm not going to say I have listened to modest mouse since the beginning, because I haven't. I had to give this album a try to see what all the hype is about, and after a few listens, I must say I am more annoyed than enlightened. I guess this could be your thing, if your thing is out of tuned insturments on off beat signatures with a vocalist who sounds to me, like a fat angry white man. This album lacks balance and content, and sadly, for as much studio polishing that went on, I'm suprised someone couldn't do something more for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a warm cola on a hot day","review":"Great single, good variety on the rest of the CD. Its just that this CD looses its fizz the more you play it.Its more interesting though to read what the \\"PRO\\" (4 or 5 star) camp has written as defenses for why this is a good CD.The reviewer who wrote \\"sit on it\\" concluded to like this CD it may help to get stoned. Another said this CD might be depressing, but bragged that the other MM CD's were much more so. One Britney fan officially claimed this band for pop-culture fans everywhere. Some of my favorites indicated they were *clearly* more mature b/c they liked the cussing.I was going to write a review and let you know the reasons I hated this CD. But perhaps the best reason not to get this CD is the positive reasons given! Job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, I'm from the future...","review":"I'm here to warn you NOT to buy this CD. Two days from now, you do buy this CD.A month later a friend finds out you have the same CD as his pimple-face sister. He tells all your other friends, and they exile you from all that is cool.As a result of not having any friends your social skills plummet, and you end up not being able to get any jobs. Within 3 years you starve to death wearing only a fairy-godmother outfit and a pair of combat boots.10 years from now the world is taken over by angry pimple-face sisters. Thats the problem, we need you to save the world.So please - for the sake the planet, don't buy this CD. Thanks, sorry to slow you down. See you in 10. *vanish*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best, But Better Than Everything Else","review":"Modest Mouse is by far my favorite band so I am quite biased. This album is definitely lighter than their past material but they pull it off beautifully. This album has a bit of the same feel that you get from Grandaddy's 'Sumday' album.The highlights: Track 2-The World at Large, a beautiful song that is even better live.Track 4-Ocean Breathes Salty, a wonderfully written song with great instrumentation.Track 8-Bukowski, just a great song, plain and simple.Track 9-This Devil's Workday, Isaac was definitely listening to alot of Tom Waits when this song was written.Track 11-Satin In A Coffin, probably my favorite song on the cd. You should just listen to it, I can't do it justice.BUY THIS CD!! If you are just getting into Modest Mouse this is a good introduction that will eventually get you into the best of their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad or good as some people seem to think","review":"OK, this is probably not quite up to the level of previous Modest Mouse releases, but I'm sick of \\"old-school\\" MM fans complaining about what the group's become. There is, in my opinion, good material here. The first 4 actual songs are quite strong, although Float On and The Ocean Breathes Salty are a little too pop-like for my taste, but they're definitely fun to listen to. Then the album gets very variable for 5 or so tracks.. Bukowski and The View sound better to me than something like Dance Hall, which i consider almost unlistenable. And starting with Blame it on the Tetons, all of the tracks at the end are very strong. You can say they aren't incredibly groundbreaking, but they sound good! Why is everyone so concerned with these high falutin principles and whatever. They're really catchy songs! It's rock music for god's sake, not a philosophical treatise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be so modest...","review":"For those of you who don't \\"get it,\\" put away your Britney Spears or your Linkin Park and borrow your older brother's Talking Heads tapes and your dad's Beatles albums. Listen to them, listen to \\"Good News...\\" again, and then you'll get it. Brock and company have crafted one of the most diverse and important albums of the last 10 years, taking influences from all over the spectrum to build a sound unique yet approachable, deep yet commercially viable. If those who have negatively reviewed this album can listen to \\"Ocean Breathes Salty\\" or \\"Black Cadillacs\\" and not regard it as brilliant and stunning, then they are either deaf or have the MTV ear. This is a great album that is a must have for any lover of groundbreaking and original music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent News","review":"Isaac Brock's Pacific Northwest collective commercializes their eccentric sound without diluting their indie-cred one whit on the shimmering Good News for People Who Love Bad News. The addition of Dixie jazz horns announces the CD with a brassy fanfare, but after that it's business as usual for the funny/serious/rocking/searching Modest Mouse. Their exploration of Americana is bite-sized here - the songs are normal lengths here - and their melodies get earthier on each release. \\"Float On\\" is taking alternative radio by storm. \\"Bury Me with It\\" finds the blues in a punk club. And Brock's yelping vocals are never off-putting. Could be that his exploration of alienation is as open-hearted as his rejection of it. Good news, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant and accessible","review":"Modest Mouse is hard to love. Many of their albums are grating. I know they are good, but for the life of me I can't enjoy them wholly. Maybe this makes me less intelligent somehow, that I prefer the more mainstream Good News... to their other albums. But I find that Good News gets stuck to me and I just can't shake the songs. This album all feels very new. It is welcome on mainstream radio, but remains unique. The single Float On was a bit hit and rightly so...it feels good and honest. It's what pop should sound like. The album is still intensely creative, and while sometimes that is tiring (I get older waiting for genius songs to grow on me) here the songs immediately catch. Favorites are Ocean Breathes Salty, The View, Satin in a coffin, and black cadillacs.Give them a chance if you haven't been introduced to them...and fanatics don't get all freshman music-angsty on them saying they sold out. you know it's good :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Because Modest Mouse Is Popular Now, Does Not Mean The Album Completely Sucks","review":"Sure, it's not their best. All the polish erases some of the charm of Isaac's strained vocals and seemingly improvised guitar work. But it's still Modest Mouse, and it's pretty damn good. I think this is a natural progression from the Moon and Antarctica, with stronger lyrics that often deal with death and the afterlife, and a more \\"mature\\" sound (Excluding Dance Hall, which is the closest this record gets to sounding like older MM). I didn't want to like this album, what with all the radio play that Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty received, but listen with an open mind and you'll find that it's actually a good album, my favorite tracks being \\"Dance Hall\\", \\"Bukowski\\", \\"Satin In A Coffin\\", and \\"Ocean Breathes Salty\\".All indie fans should give this \\"sell out\\" record a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"no regrets","review":"I was introduced to MM by way of someone's cast off Lonesome Crowded West cd. My next exposure to them was Moon & Antartica. With anticipation, I purchased Good News. The first listen thru I was slightly disappointed. By the fourth listen I was totally sold. Such variety. I really like \\"Float On\\" and was glad to hear it on the radio but it falls way down on my song list below (in album order) \\"Bury Me With It\\", \\"Dance Hall\\", \\"Bukowski\\", \\"Satin In A Coffin\\", \\"Black Cadillacs\\", \\"One Chance\\", and \\"The Good Times Are Killing Me\\". My one criticism is that my least favorite song \\"Blame It On The Tetons\\" is also the longest.How does it compare to the other MM cds I've heard? For me I'd put it dead-even with Lonesome Crowded West - two very different cds, each with their own outstanding qualities. Despite a couple of great songs, The Moon & Antartica fails to come close to the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"Don't even know how to review this album, there's really nothing I like about it. \\"Moon & Antarctica\\" was my favorite Modest Mouse, this is far and away my least. As others have said: no it doesn't sound like MM, yes it sounds like bad Tom Waits or worse, yes it's overproduced & under-thought-out. MM was one of the very last bands I was still excited about, but had I heard this album before I bought it, I never would have bought it. So if you're actually reading this review trying to decide if you should get the album or not, I would strongly encourage you to at least borrow somebody else's copy 1st. Maybe you'll be into it, and you can ignore this and the other negative reviews, but for those (like me) who are dreadfully disappointed with the disc, I think it would have been nice to have had some warning. If I'd never heard MM before and I put this disc on, I honsestly would have turned it off by the 4th song."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very impressed","review":"With all the hype, mostly positive, about this band, I was really looking forward to hearing this album. Bought it, played it a few times and was puzzled. What's the appeal? Where are the good songs? Played it a few more times. Still not clicking. After a dozen listens I realized that this music was never going to impress me no matter how many times I played it. It didn't move me, or rock my soul, or do anything that would merit me keeping it. Not awful, but just nothing special in my musical world. Next, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"intresting","review":"this album is very intresting but its a good album but just those pointless songs like the one with the baby crying crap but its an ok album but not very easy to just put in and listen to without skipping some songs but i love \\"the view\\" that song is AMAZING its great and \\"black cadillacs\\" is good as well as 'bury me with it'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Is Good","review":"It's great to listen to an album with a variety of instruments, tempos, etc. For all you crybabies who want the whole album to sound like \\"Float On\\", just press the repeat button on your CD player and listen to that song 10 or 12 times and quit your whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Maybe I'm not \\"cool\\" enough to get this album, but as a normal guy who likes a wide range of music and does not watch MTV or TRL, this is the worst album I've heard in a long time.

If you had really liked the other albums by modest mouse you will be horribly dissapointed by this one.

Epic managed to ruin one of the great bands of late and you would understand if you listen to all of there previous albums.The lyrics lack any meaning, the great sound of modest mouse has been dronned out into poppy chords that are unoriginal and under the potential of Modest Mouse.

Very. How does this happen? I havent a clue. I dont have a problem with them releasing a radio-friendly song if there were any other good songs on this album. There arent. And Float On is totally annoying garbage. Wow, they finally got radio play. Well, you have to have crap songs to make it on the radio and theyve accomplished that much with this stinker.

I am a complete newcomer. In fact, I had never even heard \\"Float On\\" until a friend let me borrow this (I've since heard it countless times). Now although people have said that this cd is unlike their previous cds and too \\"mainstream,\\" I must say that if this cd is mainstream then Modest Mouse must be fairly quirky (which I gather they are). Anyway, the 1-2 punch of The World at Large and Float On is quite possibly the best introduction to a band I've ever heard. I love how it is almost one continuous song, both containing similar lyrics and song structure. Ocean Breathes Salty is great, too. This can easily take its place among the top ten of 2004 (surprisingly, there's competition this year!) Solid cd..."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars -- Good Stuff","review":"I am new to Modest Mouse, but upon repeated listenings have been impressed by this CD, actually in spite of the single, Float On (which is pretty poppish).Authentic yet musically familiar, serious yet fun, dark yet hopeful... I could go on. Wonderful stuff (even is somewhat overproduced - but not intrusively). I too look forward to exploring their previous work, starting with the Moon and Antartica.Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the trick:","review":"Hey, what's up with the David Grey slam in the Amazon review? That hurts, as a big David Grey fan. No matter.Here is the perfect way to annoint yourself with this band:Upon the first listen, I deemed this album to be crazier then a pet racoon. But, as a CD in my five disc changer, set on random, and filled with more melodic CD's like Iron & Wine, Rhett Miller, Josh Rouse, etc. I grew to like it. So much of my other CD's are very Elliott Smith in nature, so this was a nice foil. It grows on you, and in you. You dig?Then just sit back and wait for the medicine to work. Next thing you know, you can listen to and enjoy the album all by itself. Oh sure, it is still crazier then a gut-shot bomber, but it remains a good album nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to make indie snobs mad","review":"Everytime a somewhat popular indie band makes a hugely successful and critically acclaimed album (TMAA), all of their snobby fans get mad at the follow up, if its not exactly the same. This album is very catchy, has great lyrics and shows a real progression over the last album. They sound very influenced by the Flaming Lips, which is a good thing. Hopefully after another 10 years MM will be as good as Flaming Lips. We can only hope - but based on this album they will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming","review":"I bought this CD with high hopes. However, after several listens (I tried to give it a chance), those hopes were dashed. The lyrics were killing me. I do not neccesarily prefer poetic or abstracted lyrics, but it kills me when a band appears to take itself so seriously but cannot verbalize its \\"philosophical insights\\" in any meaningful way. The lyrics are, at best, amateurish and juvenile, reinforcing my conviction that the only reason some bands get popular is because of this lack of depth (aka accesibility). And \\"Good News...\\" is definitely accesible- even to the 13 year old girls I saw buying the album at Walmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like nothing else","review":"An original, enjoyable, well-written record. \\"Float On\\" is an amazing song, but not really an indicator of the overall sound.

What you heard on the radio was not one part of a bunch of new sounds on a CD, it WAS the good part. Of course, others will probably try to tell you the radio singles were just commercialized and the rest of the CD is da-bomb... yada, yada. Riiiiiiight.

So what else is there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this brutal death metal band?","review":"They used to have such a crushing, organ-churning metal sound that metal knew no equal. Their sound is still brutal, but no where near as heavy as before. The best underground metal stations like K-rock in LA still play their songs, but I don't think that the mainstream metal public is buying it! In addition to his own band, lead singer Jimmie \\"Modest\\" Mousecowitz has lent his blood-curdling death metal grunts to such death metal bands as Cannibal Corpse and thrash bands like The Crown and Grimfist, but on this CD he has really toned it down. The blazing dual guitar attack is still present and the drums still resonate with pounding double-bass and blast beats, but overall the songs have less punch.Modest Mouse, go back to the sound that got you to where you are today - no-holds-barred metal brutality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst music ever","review":"The best way to describe this album is by comparing it to when you burp and puke comes into your mouth. If you like Dexy's midnight runners, grab this album! Guitar riffs are painfully catchy and get stuck in your head (just like the Proclaimers \\"i would walk 500 miles...\\") Vocals are as friendly on the ears as a 3 month old screaming in a movie next to you. Drums are so simple they sound like someone pushed play on an old casio keyboard (the little ones with only 2 octaves). I would have sold this cd on ebay, but instead I put it in the microwave for 4 seconds and made a neat design out of it. Try it sometime...it stinks up the microwave, but worth it!Since the scale doesn't go negative, i gotta give this album a 0/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, what is this??","review":"Ok, I consider myself pretty open when it comes to music, but perhaps I just don't get this band. People say their other albums (like Moon and Antarctica) are better...and I'd certainly hope so! Good News.. is one of the worst albums I've heard in a long time. The vocals are positively disastrous, the music doesn't flow...it just doesn't sound good to me. There's potential, but it seems the band just didn't take their time making this record. Remember that actor named Bobcat Goldwaithe (sp?)? That's what the lead singer sounds like! I admire Modest Mouse for being an original band and trying out a new sound to relieve the monotony of mainstream rock, but I just don't like this CD. Listen to this album before you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Float on, float away ... please","review":"It sounds to me like Modest Mouse can't decide if they want to be XTC or The Talking Heads. Either way, it's best left to the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news for people who like bad news...","review":"The bad news is, this music is overrated. ?Best of 2004?...then 2004 must have been a bad year for music...in fact it was a bad year for the most part. I am usually alined with the thoughts of critics concerning the 'best music currently out there'. But this piece falls far short of my personal expectations for great music. MM is often quoted as being exceptional, unique or original. I have heard nothing new in Bad news...It's not original. It has all been done before and to a higher level than MM attains on this effort. Moreover, if this was compared to the music in past years it would not get a second look. But hears the good news, 2005 is going to be a great year for music...look for new albums from EELS, Nine Inch Nails, Coldplay, Mike Doughty, The White Stripes, Dave Matthews Band and Bruce Springsteen...then pick up the new U2 and Beck if you have not already."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this group considered \\"Good\\"?","review":"I work at a record store, and we have the luxury of playing promotional records in the store, of which this album is sometimes played.It is horrible. Hands down.The music itself is decent, but with the addition of what sounds like Bobcat Goldwaithe as the singer, it goes down the drain and dies.If you want some decent, cheap, exciting rock, go with The Killers or Breaking Benjamin. This group is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good News For People Who Love Bad Music","review":"ya know, i am normally open to anything musically, i like a lot of different styles of music, and i know how to appreciate talented musicians, so i will not go so far as to say that the members of modest mouse are not talented musicians, for that they are. however, if great talent was ever wasted on creating a piece of crap, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"ONLY buy this if you have listened to it and really like it.

Early candidate for Album of the year.."},{"rating":"2","title":"i still love ya MM","review":"GNFPWLBN is a really, really good cd. But compared to other Modest Mouse albums, it falls short. I think its way overproduced, the introduction of so many unnecessary instruments just sounds like they were trying to hard. The banjo is really freaking cool, especially on Bukowski and Satin in a Coffin (the best track on the cd). Whats missing are the sawing guitar riffs and the bends. I heard only a few bends and none of those riffs. Also all the songs end along with the lyrics, where on other albums sometimes theyll keep playing for another 2-5 minutes after the singing stops. If youre a music fan, pick this up, its worth it. But along with this pick up this is a Long Drive... and Lonesome Crowded West, and listen to what makes Modest Mouse my favorite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"O.K., so everyone told me to buy this and listen to it...which I did, several times on several transcontinental flights-force fed myself this disc like it was musical cod-liver oil. I'm a sucker for the \\"You've GOT to hear this band\\" mentality. I just don't get it - I find scant little that's even remotely listenable (from someone who really likes the releases from The Shins, Broken Social Scene and Elbow, not to mention Sigur Ros) but this is pretty crappy even on a sunny day with your best gal at your side. Unless you hear something/know something I don't, hold on to your cash or hope your CD shop doesn't take VISA or something. Fool me once shame on you...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree w/ Kristen","review":"You so-called *indie* people are sad. Why not just be, eh? Why not just like what you like without it having to fit into your sad prescription of indie identity. Lame.Anyhow, as for this CD. I like it. I like the poppy tunes, true, but as I delve deeper into the album--as the tunes roll over to 5, 6, 7--I find myself liking it even more. I love most of the tracks and especially 'Bury me with it'. I don't like track 3 all that much, but you win some, you lose some. This is an interesting record if nothing else.As for that gal who was offended by the swearing.--Grow up for christ sakes! We're not in kindergarten lil' girl. This is *maybe* music for grown-ups, and sometimes grown-ups (OOPS!!!) swear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modest Mouse is the good stuff","review":"Compared to pretty much all the popular music out there, Modest Mouse is at least always original and intriguing. While the rest of the \\"alternitive\\" music scene seems fairly content to pick a Beatles song or a Stones song and make a career out of em. You can quickly hear that many of ModestMouse's songs have 3 or 4 songs going on all at once. And while I agree with many old school MM fans that Good News is not quite the pyschedelic roadtrip that The Moon over Anartica takes you on nor is it the refreshing bucket of cold water in the face that Lonesome Crowded West is and always will be. But it is some of the best damn and smartest pop music released this year.Give it a try and if you like it then definitely try Moon over Antartica and if you like it a little rougher definitely go for Lonesome Crowed West!P.S. Old ModestMouse is not metal-nor is it new punk-its far better and much more original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good news is right","review":"That's my feeling upon listening to this CD. The hit song is good, but it pales in comparison to some of the other tracks on this CD. Reminds me of Radiohead meets Coldplay meets Cake... or some weird combination of that sort. I like it... A LOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sometimes absurd departure from the usual...","review":"I am not a fan of Modest Mouse. That isn't because I don't like their music but rather because I haven't listened to enough. \\"Good News For People Who Love Bad News\\" is actually the first complete Modest Mouse album I've listened. This album is definitely a strange and sometimes absurd departure from the usual alternative rock. I decline to call this \\"indie rock\\" because it was released by Sony. \\"Good News For People Who Love Bad News\\" is a good album, I must admit, but I think it think it is a bit of an acquired taste. Maybe it will grow on if I'll only listen to a few more times. If you are a fan of Modest Mouse I imagine you'll enjoy this album. If you aren't familiar with Modest Mouse and would like to hear some fresh, funky, and sometimes just plain peculiar then check this album out. If you don't like it you can always pawn it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd ive bought in awhile","review":"This cd has to be the best cd ive gotten in about 6 months.

Not a song I dont like on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modest Mouse keeps evolving...","review":"I think this is their best album yet. I remember years ago watching these guys play at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle and what a difference those years in between have made. The lyrics are great and thought provoking...I have nothing negative to say about this album except that Dance Hall starts to get annoying after awhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo!","review":"I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he was super pleased! It arrived quickly and undamaged and it's an awesome disc. So yeah. Woo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl Edition Review","review":"This is a great album! So many variations in style from song to song, just a great album to listen to. The vinyl is perfect and sounds great. The packaging is also good, would have preferred gatefold over both vinyls in the same sleeve, but, they do fit properly. Great addition to any collection.Shipped from Amazon, packaged correctly with no bends or warping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Heads met The Clash","review":"These guys rock. I guess they sound a lot like some of the best 80's bands but in a completely new style. Some sort of folksy punk if that would be possible. Something like Siouxsie & The Banshees mixed with They Might Be Giants... Maybe it is the new millennium goth. I love all the songs and can't stop playing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good they are on the mainstream","review":"I must confess that I am part of those \\"masses\\" that had no idea of this band before they started showing Float On on MTV and VH1, so I really dont have an opinion on whether they sold out or not. I can say this is a very solid CD, with some intense, ecclectic songwriting. It is the CD of a group that has fun with music and whose concept of fun is not writing stupid lyrics and pseudopunk but actually experimenting with sound. I definitely think that it is much better for this CD to go into the mainstream than to leave rock defined by mediocre bands such as Blink 182 or Simple Plan. I would recommend this CD to anyone, because it offers a sound that is nowhere else on the airwaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderate Mouse - not a terrible purchase","review":"Great coupla singles, rest of the CD is not bad either. While I agree the lyrics tend to overdo it on the rant and whine side - the music is good (in spots). The band definitely seems to be experimenting - and on a future album that may pay off enough to fill most of a CD with great tracks.I guess if I liked mainstream a little more I would enjoy the CD as a whole. Same as previous reviewers wrote, if Britney fans etc. like this music so much, I'm happy for them... for those hardcore MM fans who object I guess thats their problem. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Album Curse","review":"There really seems to be a 2-album curse in the universe. Sure some bands release 8 great albums but so many seem to release a 3rd (in this case fourth) that completely falls short of everything that made the first 2 albums so perfect. If you loved the rhythms, changes and the sparse Santos and Johnny guitar lines of lonesome crowded west than this is going to sound like a car commercial to you. I'm really not an \\"early craps the best\\" type, I really wanted this to make up for Moon and Antarctica, I think it might be worse. I'm sure Float On could sell some Ipods and Jettas though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Modest Mouse just keeps getting better! About lost my breakfast over Black Cadillacs!Great piece of work from these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"tragedy strikes","review":"Modest Mouse is one of my all time favorite bands. It was Isaac's raw sound on earlier albums like Lonesome Crowded West and Sad Sappy Sucker that made the band unique and to me and pulsating with energy. Yes, this album is polished, but it is also watered down and much more boring compared to their older, jagged melodies that were throbbing with pain and electric. One would hope that when a band makes it big they're not selling out, but I feel like Modest Mouse just got dumb with their melodies. I for one shed a tear :("},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty iffy","review":"I'm a pretty big fan of Modest Mouse and I can say basically that this new CD is a step in the wrong direction. It seems that they've gotten bored of making the type of music they had with Antarctica. The brass band, and random screaming of dance hall, is just not very good quality music. Another thing that i'm not very happy about is the more pessimistic feeling of the whole album. It generally just depresses you rather than making you think. I'm sorry if I made this album look terrible, it's not;hence the rating. However, I recommend going for the Moon and Antarctica first, then Lonesome Crowded West, and if you still have cash to blow, buy this album. There was a lot of hype and I guess my expectations were a bit too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - I can listen to this over and over...","review":"This is one of those CDs that I love - I can pop it in anytime and not get tired of it. One of my favorite bands of all time is the Pixies, and I think that's why I enjoy Modest Mouse so much. The lyrics are interesting, the music is very Pixies-like, and there is a lot of passion in the way the vocals are put forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I liked it!","review":"I understand why people may call this CD \\"more mainstream\\", and I also understand why they might do that; but I don't agree, for the most part.I think the songs, in general, are crafted very nicely, polished but not too glossy---nothing's as sappy or plodding as people like to make it out to be---but the only thing I have a problem with is the lyrics (again, in general), as they aren't nearly as interesting as anything on Modest Mouse's prior releases. Imagery and wordplay Brock still uses in spades, but there's nothing as poetic as the songs on \\"The Moon and Antartica\\" or \\"The Lonesome Crowded West\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!...but different","review":"Im not realy in to this kind of music.

This album shows that Modest Mouse will continue making excellent albums even with a lot of pressure on them. Good news is the most positive/optomistic album they have made although the general themes still shave themes of alienation and company. Isaac's lyrics are still very insightful and clever although they don't have the sharp edginess of Moon and Antartica. Overall it's very much worth buying, especially if you're already a fan of their previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to this instead.. it's better","review":"I'm in the \\"modest mouse old stuff is way better\\" boat.if this is the only modest mouse album you have bought and were disappointed.. i feel you.. i recomend downloading these songs if you want to hear their better stuff..heart cooks brainlounge (closing time)convienient parking3rd planetgravity rides everythingtiny citie made of ashespaper thin wallswill suspention of disbeliefthese are my favorite modest mouse songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you and what did you do with Modest Mouse?","review":"I'm starting to think that departed drummer Jeremiah Green had much more to do with Modest Mouse's music than I previously thought.

It doesn't even sound like Isaac Brock singing! Is this a conspiracy?! This band now sounds like half bad Beatles wannabes, half Modest Mouse cover band. So disappointing! ARGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Modest Mouse Album I Own","review":"I first heard \\"Float On\\" on the FUSE Network, I liked it. But then I started to think, this is a very unique song, and then it lead me to think, if this is their most Radio Friendly tune out there, they gotta have crazier/better stuff on their Album. So Based on that and that alone, I bought the Album.They do a nice job of mixing diffrent genres, where at times it seems like they are playing bluegrass, but with drums, and bluegrass DOESNT Have drums. But it seems like they're playing Rock, but it's too slow and diffrent of instruments. Overall, this gets a four because of the Standout Tracks.The Standout Tracks are Dig Your Grave, Bury Me With It, This Devil's Workday, and The View is a nice beat and good bass guitar. The slower song \\"Blame It On The Tetons\\" Is original and enjoyable.I only heard tracks from modest mouse on this album, and no others, so my opinion may not be as balanced. But this is a good starting point to listen to Modest Mouse. Good Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xcellent... if you like this sort of thing","review":"Clearly the bands popularity and radio play are bringing in lots of new fans. Personally I don't care if people who buy Britney and Avril like this too, more power to 'em. But for me - call it my special wierdness I know - this CD's lyrics and music just came across like it was trying too hard to appeal to the mainstream.Some bands are carried to greatness by working their butts off to produce a unique sound that leads a trend (think Nirvana), some find a way to enjoy momentary fame with hip sounds and luv'd up marketing. Not to say these guys are not working hard, its just that (to me) this CD has the smell of death about it for MM.

To get to the point, I bought the Modest Mouse CD, never heard of this band before, total impulse buy.When I got back from lunch I popped the CD into the computer, put in the ear buds and apparently entered a time machine...I was transported back to the days of Bono and Gloria, David Byrne burning down the house, Siouxie hanging with Banshees, Robert Smith telling boys not to cry and Bjork wailing about Regina.

Float on has the most horribly put together music video I think I have ever seen. I will admit the background music is SEMI-catchy but the vocals are simply dreadful-painful even! I can not believe they play this crap on the radio! It sounds exactly like Franz Ferdinand-which is not a good thing! The yelling is not even music. There is no genre to classify this in considering it is not rap or classical or blues or anything. But it certainly is not rock or punk and is not catchy enough to be pop! I think this starts an all new genre called G-A-R-B-A-G-E! And not the band garbage either...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Warning...","review":"I must say that while I love many kinds of music, varying from jazz to electronica, to rock, I hate modest mouse.

To my ear, the vocals are what really kills this group, with the lead singer's singing style grating on my ears with every word. What i'm saying is this, give it a listen before you buy it.

How do you describe their music? You don't, because its not music. It's repetitive droning of slurred lyrics that carry no tune and have 0 sound appeal. If you like Modest Mouse you're retarded. Its not a matter of taste, it's the sad, simple truth.Edit:Sorry if I offended anyone, I was a bit hyped up over the whole thing.

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, like any of the previous albums. I feel the same way about this album that I did about Phish's Hoist (dating and profiling myself with that one): a super-duper creative and original band that either got tired of being poor or had a run-in with a sleazy producer. Either way, buy all the old albums before you buy this one.My dissapointment doesn't mean that this is a bad album. It has it's bright spots.

I absolutely hate indie/minimalist/experimental rock. And Modest Mouse falls into that category.Why do I hate this album and the band? Because they lack musical talent. Their songs are painful to listen to because of the lack of musicianship. The singer CANNOT sing whatsoever. He sort of hits the notes and occasionally screams things, but is that singing? Definitely not. The guitar riffs are boring, pitchy, and annoying. The lyrics are completely worthless. They really write about nothing.That being said, this album could have been a lot worse, and I have heard a lot worse. I don't like it at all, but you know, whatever works for you.

While Float-on is a good single sure, I was looking for new sounds across the rest of the CD... but the new sounds just got harder to listen to the more play I gave it.The lyrics do attempt to be clever in their irreverence, but since some are canned ideas from other authors rather than coming from the heart... they eventually got to be as enjoyable as watching book-review re-runs; if such a thing actually exists.

His voice is just not really there or here, becuase its all over the place, and its annoying. On top of that, this is not what I would call outwardly catchy music, its more of a - listen 3 or 4 times to the album and youll understand!- type of thing. So I suppose I would recommend this to indie, smart art, how-goes-it type people, who can be really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very dissapointed with this CD","review":"This sounded great the 1st few times I played it, and maybe its just me... but the depressing lyrics (be it wrapped in \\"up\\" sounding music in some cases) and discordinate music began to really hurt my ears after a while.It didn't take too long till I began to loothe this band. Too bad too, I normally like CD's where every track in unique... just that this was was not a good kind of unique.It was I suppose you could say unique-in-its-ability-to-inspire-the-tossing-of-cookies the more play you gave it. I would also suggest you borrow a friends copy first before you buy if you think you might like it.

I think you'll be happy you did not spend the money up-front is all I'm saying. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"It seems that the only good song on the cd is the one that was a single. Float On is a great song, but it's the only good one on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only Know one other person who gets it!","review":"When it comes to music in this era i'm lost!! This band is something different. I really like how they jam and go from yelling and flippen out to a mellow country-esc type of sound. I'mma country music hater but there style does it for me. I give g.n.f.p.w.l.b.n... four stars and antisipate another release!

Reminds me of \\"You Get What You Give\\" By The New Radicals in that you never get tired listening to the song.\\"Bukowski\\" a nice stripped down song good use of the Bass, IMHO, this also applies to \\"Satin In A Coffin\\"Of the tracks on this album \\"One Chance\\", \\"Float On\\" & \\"The World At Large\\" would be the stand out tracks for me.Would I recommend this album - YES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Listen","review":"Overall, this is a great CD, though there are a few little problems in my opinion. I don't know why, but the Interlude: Milo irks me to no end. The horn intro and the same part used in This Devil's Workday can get tiresome, but in my personal experience, that was only after I overplayed the CD. I've read a lot of negative reviews on the song Dance Hall, though I personally enjoy it. That being said, those are very easy to overlook. The CD gels very well as a whole and even if the horns get to you or you can't stand Brock's voice in Dance Hall, that's really only two songs on the CD that you wouldn't be thrilled about. Overall, I'd recommend The Moon and Antarctica over this if you're going to buy one Modest Mouse CD, though if what you've heard of Good News For People Who Love Bad News is already approaching too melancholy, I'd stay away from Moon and Antarctica. All in all, it's an excellent purchase and I'd recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"top-notch","review":"This book is second of a 5-part series, and covers two of the nine major forms of Tae Kwon Do: Tan Gun and To San. It not only provides an overview of the entire form, but breaks down each form into each individual move, complete with a written description, 5 views of the move, and a photo showing the application of the move against an assailant. (The photos are dated, but since retro fashion is in, it looks kind of hip.) It also shows combination attacks and self-defense techniques.

There is no Moondance, no And It Stoned Me, no Sweet Thing, no Madame George (at least not the familiar version), no Cypress Avenue, no Domino, no Tupelo Honey, no Wild Night, no Jackie Wilson Said, no Gloria. Essentially, this is an excuse for Bang Records to cash in on Brown-Eyed Girl. These tapes have been reissued over and over again in a million different formats since their original release in 1968. The REAL best of Van Morrison, twenty songs long and containing all of the aforementioned songs but Tupelo Honey plus a few more, makes for a good intro, plus Astral Weeks is nothing short of mindblowing and Moondance is good. Buy those instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a small room","review":"We recently added a sunroom to our home and wanted to try and extend the time we could use it with a space heater. We wanted something that not only provided supplimental heat, but also added to rooms decor. This little electric stove was the perfect addition. Its compact size was perfect since the sunroom had large windows and very little wall space. At only about 2 feet high it fit perfectly. It throws off some heat as well, although I'm sure in the dead of winter here in Boston it may not provide enough to suppress the chill. The kids really love the flame effect that it provides. It looks fairly realistic, but is completely cool to the touch, other than the small blower box on the bottom, so there is no issue with small children playing around it. You can definitely find less expensive ways to provide some heat to a cool room, but if you want something that looks nice and gives off some heat this item is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk that doesn't work even with replacement parts!","review":"I have had this for two years. It ran last winter till about March and quit producing heat. This fall I called and they sent me a part from Dimplex to hopefully resolve my problem. $65 later, still not fixed. After calling twice and waiting the one time 2 hours to speak to someone, they sent me another part free of charge. This fixed the fireplace for about two weeks and now I'm back to square one!!! Good luck if you buy this....cuz I have had no luck at all with this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, works great.","review":"Even the \\"wood and fire\\" looks realistic and can be pretty hypnotic. Well worth the purchase. I withheld one star because I needed to get something--a black shelf--to place it on, bc the heat comes from the bottom and I didn't want to damage the floor.

My husband was killed in a mine accident in 1997. So never got to know that he had family in Ireland and the U.K. It was a cruel and unforgiveable crime on both the British and Aust government. His files were stamped not to be released until 2025. By that time most would have passed on and never known about their true families.

I have around 10,000 photos on the drive, most of which it appears I will lose, along with family movies and such.I would strongly recommend avoiding LaCie products altogether, they have zero commitment to making a quality product and zero commitment to building lasting customer relationships.

Perhaps the \\"First Day\\" era songs with Robert Fripp jar a little with the overall mood due to their guitar-driven agression, but they are only a minor distraction.

Hanukkah: A Counting Book is a delight to explore, and is guaranteed to entertain adults as well as children. Children will love the fun graphics as they learn to count while absorbing the meaning of the holiday, and parents will be intrigued with the unique logic of the text and graphics, which are woven together in a creative structure which unfolds progressively, much as the holiday itself unfolds from night to night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beating the competition","review":"This book helped me see through a lot of the cobwebs most economists spin every day. For once I can look at just one index or maybe 2 and get an idea where things are headed. I hope they bring out another book. Very easy reading. I recommend to anyone with some money at stake in the stock market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infomercial for their web site","review":"I bought this book because of an article in the Wall Street Journal listing it as a summer reading pick by investment professionals. I agree with several of the other reviews that the book touts the authors' expertise in designing business cycle indexes. There is litte detailed explanation of their methods. The authors and their company may be good at predicting the turning points in the business cycle, but this book provides little detailed insight into that process. The book does allow you to receive a promotional three month free subscription to the \\"light\\" version of their their Recession-Recovery Watch weekly newsletter, which costs about $100 a year. I will continue to keep taps on their prediction performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"An advertisement for ECRI rather than an economics book","review":"I'm disappointed because the majority of the book reads more like an advertisement for the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) than a book that can give you insight into actually 'beating the business cycle.' While a couple chapters reveal some of the methodology ECRI uses, the majority of the book deals with the history of ECRI?s founder, the success ECRI has had in predicting recessions and how ECRI clients use the service.I'm an admirer and user ECRI?s work. However, if your interested in learning about the business cycle, I would just go to their website and subscribe to one of their professional forecasting services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advertising literature sold as a book.","review":"This is a good book though it repeats itself and does not go very deep.

I agree with other reviewers, this is basically an expensive marketing brochure for their paid ECRI services.There is almost no meaningful content in this book.

I plan to re-sell it on Amazon soon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlocking the secrets of business cycles","review":"This is a surprisingly easy book to read, considering how often discussions about economics need translation for lay readers. It unlocks the secrets of business cycles for everyone to benefit from, and does so in an understandable fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you ever PAID for a brochure?","review":"Look. They got tired of trying to explain to their customers exactly what their products are and how they work, so they wrote a book to educate and sell them. It's basically a hardback brochure. I'm sure they give it to all their hot prospects. But we the little people get to PAY for it.There is some useful info on leading indicators but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere free. And once they teach you which of their magic proprietary indicators to keep an eye on, guess what? You're supposed to sign up for a subscription to get them, not even the simplest of the data is available free althought the book implies they are.Booksellers need to stop carrying this kind of 'gotcha' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Propaganda","review":"This book is nothing more than a marketing pamphlet for the author's services that cost an exorbitant amount of money. They repeatedly tell you how other forecasters and economists fail where they succeed. How other forecasters and economists continually suffer from \\"attribution bias\\" blaming their failures on uncontrollable events while taking full credit for their successes. However, they also attempt to explain away the failure of their indexes to successfully predict economic shifts, and therefore also suffer from attribution biases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating the Business Cycle","review":"I was extremely disappointed in the book, as I expected to read about how to analyse the business cycle. I found that this is an extermely pricy advertisement for the service that these authors run. The promise on the cover of the book is that they are going to show how to predict the turns in the economy, however the method is to buy their service. I think that they have done a great deal of research and have found many good indicators, however, they didn't tell us any. Also, they failed to define what they mean by the terms they explain (like what a recession is) nor did they isolate root causes for a recession, thus their conclusions are tainted. After so much research, one would think that they could at least give the reader a few good indicators to work with. On the other hand, they did illustrate well the practical uses for the advance information that such analysis provides. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who is serious about business cycle research."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Advertisement","review":"The authors of 'Beating the Business Cycles' have achieved a great feat. They have written an advertisement for their ECRI products and make the readers pay for it - 'excellent'! (as Mr. Burns would say).

All it does is tell you is how great the ECRI is, and if you read the 5-star reviews below these readers seem to review ECRI not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating the Business Cycle","review":"Not expensive but not worth the time to read. A book of this size should clarify how they calculate their indexes. Jest of the book was trust our indicators because we are smart. Geoffrey Moore's books do a better job of illustrating what data ECRI's indicators are looking at in the economy. Over all very disappointing and not worth the time I spent reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply superb !!","review":"One of the most anticipated books as far as I am concerned and every bit worth the wait. Business cycle (and how to beat it) is explained in such a simple manner that only those who have mastered it can. I wish this book had come out a few years ago. Because of this book, I now expect to make informed financial decisions. I certainly hope to profit from it going forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot to pay for an advertisement","review":"You pay for a book, you expect some information.

They have a tendancy to go against the grain at the right time. I wish I'd taken their views more seriously in 2001, but I won't make that mistake again. The book does not bog you down with statistics or economic terms, but it does clearly show how to monitor economic and inflation cycles. I do wish I could see more of what they give their big clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like it","review":"Just talk about how their system performed in the past, no useful insights for those interested on business cycle models"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little more than an advertisment for online services.","review":"I expected to get to understand something about the business cycle, its stages and how to find the signs of where we are in the business cycle by reading this book. Instead, to paraphrase this book, (a) There really is a business cycle and it isn't dead. (b) We (the Authers and our colleagues) invented the business cycle (c) You can get some hints about the current status of the cycle by going to our website and (d) you can get the real inside info by giving us money.Reading this book is not totally without value, but it is very repetitve and light on for content. It is not much more than a pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of fluff, almost no content","review":"The actual information in this book would fit on one page: inflation, employment, and output are the drivers of the business cycle. The rest of the book is just a 200 page ad for the authors' advisory service. Their service may be quite good, but you can't tell from this book since it contains no data or hard statistical analysis. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only!!!!","review":"If you are not familiar with the concepts of economic forecasting and don't mind paying for information, this book may not be a bad read. However, if you do know how the economy and stock market operate and have access to cnn/fn, cnbc, bloomberg t.v. etc. to get your economic data, this book is not for you. It probably will not teach you anything that you don't already know. Most of your reading time will be spent learning about how great the authors think they are and how their subscription website can help. There is very little emphasis on teaching you how to interpret the easily available information for yourself. There are definitely much better books out there on the subject.

Not acceptable, I sent it back.Besides that I like the BOSE sound and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much a companion...","review":"I bought these speakers a while back. I heard them in the store, they sounded great. I thought, these will make my high end system sound amazing. WRONG! They ultimately suck... with one redeeming quality: they look nice. Trust me, I'm a recording engineer and listen to a plethora of music, and these speakers just don't cut the mustard. With little to no low end and a slightly tinny higher end, they weakly exhibit your music, unless all you listen to is Vivaldi. I have yet to replace these little suckers, but that only comes down to affordability for quality hardware. I wouldn't say that ALL Bose speakers suck, because I have heard others (with subs) that, at least, represent a low end. But I will say that anything, and I do mean anything, sounds better than these. If you are looking for cheap, mediocre-sounding computer speakers that you only plan on listening to podcasts with, go for it. If you like music... don't betray your ears with these. But... they look purdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Pure Garbage","review":"And I am Bose guy, having four of their 201s in my main 7.1 surround system, as well as a pair of the noise canceler headphones. All are terrific products, so I took a chance with these thinking I'd get the same results. Boy was I wrong...After hooking them up to my iMac, the right speaker, which I assume has the power amp, started making this loud buzzing noise, almost like r/f interference. Tap the speaker top, noise goes away. Then it comes back, louder than before. I tried moving them around, buzzing noise still emanates from right speaker. tap speaker top, noise goes away. F this.I dont have the time nor patience to deal with second-rate electronics, so back the store it goes.Total pure garbage, a def strike against Bose. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect speakers","review":"If you are using these speakers near your computer in a medium to large sized room - these are as amazing as they can get. I had five different speakers and these - by far - have the clearest and fullest sound. I even tried them with my 46\\" inch TV and they work great for all sounds effects.All 2-4 star reviews must have come from people with perfect pitch or professional musicians who hear frequencies that none of us ordinary human beings hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive for what you get","review":"I like electronic music and that genre leads to incredible sound opportunity. These speakers have terrible bass and treble at high volume. I love Bose products but these are not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"I bought these speakers a month ago. When they worked the sound was awesome.Clear, crisp and then one month later they suddenly stopped working. I'm very disappointed. When Googling the product I found a few complaints about these speakers suddenly not working & various suggestions to fix the problem via the control panel which did nothing to fix the problem. The only sound we could get the speakers to make was static when the plug was in half way. Also checked online for drivers to install butfound nothing. Sad they did not work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose made these??","review":"For Bose the sound quality is very poor. There are sympathetic vibrations in the housing for many frequencies that are in the common range for both music and voice. At first I thought it was the surface I had them on but after placing them on the same pads I use for my studio monitors it is confirmed, the housing of the left channel actually rattles. I am very disappointed with this Bose product. In addition the audio cable is attached to the left channel, if a male to male mini-phono was used it could be replaced when the cable wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Literally Stink","review":"I am returning these today. They have a horrible stench that two different odor neutralizers and baking soda has not touched. I've had them airing out for a week now and I can't stand to be in the room with them. I've got them boxed to go back and I am still smelling them. My husband isn't as bothered by them, but he sits across the room from them while I am right next to them while working at the computer. The stink extends out about 3-4 feet. I looked at the box and it does say in teensy-weensy print that the product has chemicals and phalates known to create birth defects and reproductive harm. Made in China. These are clearly defective, as no one else has complained about this, and it's not a stench you wouldn't notice. As far as sound, not bad. Not great. OK for computer speakers. Little pricey for the actual quality. Even if they were free, I can't do the stench anymore. I've had a low grade migraine since I opened the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 8 months...the buzzing is killing me.","review":"While I liked these speakers at first; having had them for 8 months I wish I could return them.Maybe I'll write Bose to see what they say. The speakers have 2 big problems, that only appeared over time.1) the buzzing when they're plugged in, but with volume all the way down, is irritating and prevents silence in my room.2) the connector for the left speaker has gone bad, I only get both left and right speaker after I've fiddled with the connection.This really sucks, because I've had them long enough that I probably can't return them and not long enough to consider them a good investment. Bose, this is a strike against you."},{"rating":"1","title":"notable noise when power on!!","review":"Notable noise when power on even with very low volume setting. At quiet environment without music playing, I can hear this noise 5 feet away form speaker, probably due to cheap built-in amplifier. Usually you will hear some hizz sound only when inches away with regular computer speaker even for cheap model around $20-30. I went for the \\"bose\\" name brand, but I am so disappointed about the quality. Though, the service of bose is good, they replace the power supply and a new set for me. But the hizz sound is still loud enough to bother me. I have to turn the speaker off when musics is not playing, this make me unable to hear computer opertion sound when speaker is turned off. It is just too bothersome to turn on/off speaker all the time. The sound quality is okay but not great. No bass control is also one of the shortages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Too much bass, weak mid-range. Music sounds muddled and lacks clarity. Imaging is OK. Maybe good for hard rock and heavy metal, but not suitable for classical music, country, jazz etc. Bose MediaMate is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider others","review":"Don't have anything good to say. They were returned and changed for speakers that had base to them. The sound was flat. They sound great in a large shop. Terrible at home where there is no noise to distract you from the fact it is flat and not worth it. I was very disappointed. I have other Bose items I LOVE-noise canceling headphones. We replaced them with speakers that were the same style-no base box. The Klispch sound 100x better at teh same price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"Fantastic sound in a little package--relatively little.

BOSE - YOU HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WITH THESE SPEAKERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, not perfect","review":"With 300+ reviews pretty much everything has been said about these PC desktop speakers. There seems to be a sweet spot in the volume settings between 9 and 2. Below or above that and they aren't in their optimum range and they don't sound like it either.Now here is the surprise; they have a decent amp built into them. I have no problem driving my 300 ohm Sennheiser HD650 headphones with these at the same volume settings as the speakers by themselves. For example I cannot plug the HD650 directly into an iPod because the iPod doesn't have enough power to drive these. Of course a standalone desktop headphone amp would be even better but hey for $90 I'd say it's definitely a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"I bought these because I have always wanted a Bose product. When they arrived, they were packaged carefully, and I liked the form factor. The primary letdown was the sound was tinny and the lows (base) were very poor. For $100, I expected more. I ended up buying a $35 2.1 setup that sounded much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers multi-media","review":"Their compact size, appearance and superior, and clear sound quality all for a reasonable price make them a great choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these speakers!","review":"BIG sound from this Bose product. I've used several bookshelf speaker systems and these are the most satisfactory. Full stereo bass as opposed to a 3rd separate bass box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome speakers","review":"Purchased these to add to my gaming laptop. I'm thrilled with these speakers, add lots of volume compared to the speakers on my laptop. Unlike some other comments about these speakers, they do turn off using the volume control knob. Go ahead and buy them if you're looking for extra volume for your computer games. Didn't buy them as music speakers, haven't tried them for that purpose yet, but for that I do have my home stereo so it's not an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose let me down.","review":"The bass is boomy, loose, and overpowering with no way to adjust it. These speakers are NOT worth the money IMO. If you listen to anything with a decent bassline the song will be ruined by the speakers trying to overcompensate for their lack of size. Usually a Bose fan, but I'm pretty disappointed with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from Bose","review":"I bought the Bose speaker set for my husband for Christmas. I figured the sound would be excellent considering that they were such a known brand. After hooking the computer speakers up and turning on some music we though the computer volume was turned down. We checked the sound on the computer itself. The sound was turned up. Needless to say...not what I exspected from Bose at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Companion 2 multimedia speakers have been a big disappointment. I had to put thecpu on the desk because the cord was too short. The speakers have a continuous weaving buzzing sound that aBose tech tried to eliminate by changing the power connection, but that was completely useless.The sound is good, but I have to recommend against the purchase of these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I expected better","review":"I purchased these speakers with a $100 budget expecting them to be the best I could find in my price range. I was pleasantly surprised at first at how well the speakers sounded, considering their small size. The bass isn't great, but it definitely kicked harder than I ever imagined 2.0 speakers could. The sound is pretty clear, but that also leads me to my only con. The speakers are producing a really low humming/static noise that is audible when there is no music playing. it is annoying enough to give me headaches after a while, so I am forced to return the speakers and hope a different pair does not produce the same noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insultingly bad speakers","review":"Please notice what I did not: most of the positive reviews for these speakers are from people upgrading from their computer's built-in speakers. If that's the bar, then yes, these speakers amazing. They would also be fantastic for someone learning to play drums who wishes to isolate the drum track from the vocals or any mid and high range-- because that's all you hear.I'm a little shocked that Bose would release something so crappy with their name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Bose","review":"I'm on my third pair, after the left speaker from the first two pair quit working. All three sets have a noisy, static-filled volume knob too. These speakers are junk. The first pair was purchased at an in-store retailer, then replaced by Bose directly via mail about four months later due to the left speaker no-longer working. The replacement pair did the same thing about six months later. These are just junk. They have the Bose label, but obviously lack the quality demanded by Bose-loving consumers such as myself.Don't buy these pieces of garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent computer speakers","review":"I bought this a year or so ago, and the sound is just amazing. I'm not a particular Bose fan, but for $99 the clear, rich, solid sound from these speakers is great! I have them placed on either side of my monitor on my desk, and sitting right there in front of them the sound is PERFECT. Even the bass lines sound great, which was unexpected. I consider myself to have a discerning, demanding ear and I love these speakers. I will say that if POUNDING BASS AT HIGH VOLUMES is your main requirement, you can get that from cheap speakers with a bass box. But you won't get sound quality like this, not even close. For the money I am VERY happy with my purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound, very crisp highs, mids. Bass is better than expected.","review":"For a 2.0 set of speakers, these do the trick. While the bass is not booming, it is better than I thought a 2.0 set could be. Sound quality is very good on most anything one would want to listen to, with the exception of any bass heavy song, some electronic does sound good however. These speakers also get very loud, I hooked up my Xbox 360 and iPod at the same time and was totally blown away. Explosions in Halo 3 were not too bad, and the sound is enveloping. For the price, they are a good buy, just wish they had a power button to turn off the speakers while not in use but it is not a deal breaker. Piano, classical, rock, alternative, it all sounds very good on these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers!","review":"I love these speakers! For a reasonable price, you can get great sound from your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent treble, acceptable bass","review":"Good value for the money. I use them for the projection demos, hooked up to my 17\\" Powerbook. Trebles are outstanding, and basses are more than acceptable, especially if you consider how small those speakers are! However, I have to mention that they are not light at all. In fact, they weight as much as a portable DLP projector. They are very easy to pack (small), but not so easy to transport (heavy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bass","review":"I bought these Bose speakers to hook up to a Sirius Stiletto Home Dock so that I could listen to Sirius while working in my home office. I returned them the next day. The bass level on these speakers was set incredibly strong resulting in a very muddy sound when the speakers were set at a comfortable listening level. If the speakers were turned up very loud, they sounded better, but still not what I expected from a Bose product. Having the speakers set to such a high level is not practical - phone conversations were impossible, not to mention at that level everyone in the house could hear them. I replaced these speakers with a set of JBL On Tour portable speakers and am much happier with the sound from those speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, LOW power, not for tv audio","review":"Bought these to connect to my Sony TV since the TV's built in speakers sound crappy. Note: i have a full on 7.1 home theatre system for it, but have chosen to simply the set up (less wires, less remotes, less power, etc..). Figured a good pair of self powered PC speakers would compensate for the tv's speakers. I tried an old pair of Altecs as a test to make sure and it sounded good, though the Altecs sound tinny - thought going to a Bose model would give me good sound quality.What I found was that the Bose amplifier is really weak. I had to turn the volume up more than half way to even hear them. Yes, then they sounded good, with that Bose like room sound. I figured my TV's pre amp out was probably just really weak, so I tried them on my PC and got basically the same weak result. Im betting there is only a 15 amp in the speakers.For $90 I guess I dont want to worry about the low power issue. Sound quality maybe, but not power.Returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"I bought these speakers at Bestbuy. As soon as I turned them on, there was a hum/buzz. It was very pronounced if I turned the volume 50% or higher. It sounds like feedback, but it even happens when the speakers aren't plugged in to anything. I returned them and tried two other sets while in the store (thinking that maybe I had a bad set). Nope, all three sets had the same hum/buzz. If you are highly insensitive to noise, then these maybe okay for you. However, if you listen to music with your ears and your brain, then the Bose Companion II \\"speakerettes\\" simply won't do. And, you don't need to pay $99 for junk. Pay less and get what you pay for.Man, is Bose all marketing and no substance? I'm beginning to wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen before you buy!","review":"I really like the build quality of these speakers compared to others at the same price range. Also the ability to connect two devices at once was very helpful.BUT, the sound leaves much to be desired. They sound like another reviewer said... \\"no highs, no lows, it must be Bose.\\" If you play games or enjoy listening to vocals DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS! I returned them and bought the Klipsch 2.1 ProMedia speakers - which sound very very clear and the sub offers plenty of \\"clean\\" bass. Also, it provides a second mini jack port so you can connect other devices - like cd players, and ipods - without the need to buy an adaptor (like the Bose)."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I bought and returned these speakers immediately. They have no range! Notice that under \\"technical specifications\\" -- on amazon, on the bose website - anywhere! -- there is no info on the frequency response!! They must really want to keep this info hidden because it's terrible; it's very standard to know what you are paying for to find out what the frequency response (Hz) is. I bought them anyway, without knowing, and learned why I couldn't find this info. I just took it for granted since bose is such a respected brand, and they are not the cheapest. So I started comparing Hz (after talking to a sound geek that I know) and got the Creative Gigaworks T20s which cost the same as these bose and are much better with separate bass and tweeter too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted these to work!","review":"We have a Bose car stereo system and it is amazing, so I purchased these Bose speakers for my iMac. The sound was just average compared to other speakers... but the speaker loudness was very disappointing. So... they weren't great out of the box, but they were tolerable for the price, so we kept them. Big mistake... they ended up not working two months later. I wouldn't purchase these again. We have gone back to using the Altec speakers and they have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Wow, I had heard Bose speakers were supposed to be cutting edge, and absolutely incredible. Maybe their other speakers are, but these computer speakers are shockingly bad.It's not that they are THAT bad, but the fact that they are soooo expensive and not worth even half of the price, is the part that amazes me.The first ten seconds I plugged them in and turned them on, I knew I was in trouble: The most immediate thing you'll notice is the shockingly poor balance between the treble/bass frequencies. Any voices you are listening to (song lyrics, video game dialogue, etc) sound muffled and muddy. If you are listening to music, the bass completely overpowers the higher frequencies and destroys the balance. And to top it ALL off, there is no treble or bass knob so you can adjust them. REALLY poor design choice, if you ask me.I'm taking these back tomorrow and getting a pair of $30 speakers. I'm sure they'll work just as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bose Companion 2 Series II Multimedia Speakers","review":"I needed speakers that would produce really good sound at a reasonable price for my Macbook Pro.

I picked them over Logitech and some other brands because they had stereo jacks that made them easy to connect to the TV and their size fit my space. They did not improve the sound at all. There is such a heavy bass bias to these speakers that it made listening to speech very difficult for both my wife and I. They would probably be OK if you are playing war games that featured a lot of explosions and crashes. They did nothing to dissuade me from my opinion that Bose products are overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"So muddy it's silly (for music)","review":"I am not a distinguished listener, but I do own some quality gear. These are total mud. The mids and lows are completely washed out; they seem that they are trying to be \\"boomy\\". As another reviewer mentioned, there's nothing regarding the frequency response in the documentation, a small warning flag. I wanted some cheap speakers for my desk without taking up a lot of room, and from a physical perspective, these are great. But the sound they produce is just garbage, unfortunately. My 1998 Yamaha MST-15 computer speakers sound better.Note that I bought these for casual music listening.

Well, if your goal is to shatter your windows, this is not your set. But if you just need high quality sound for your immediate surrounding near your computer (or for that matter, little space around your iPod), this set produces ample sound. While bass may not be overwhelming, it is definitely there. And it doesn't compromise mid to high range either. This set maintains high quality sound at lower volume level. I thought that lack of treble and bass control would bother me, but no, I didn't need them at all, as it sounds good right out of the box.

Nice crisp highs with the solid base Bose is known for. Compared to any speaker set in this price range, the Bose is a no question winner. Set up took a good 2 minutes and I ran it through the paces from AC/DC Bonfire, The Beatle, Love, Rush, Moving Pictures, Tony Bennett, Stepping Out and The Who, Quadrophenia - these speakers passed the test.

It was very \\"boomy\\" as compared to my old 2.1 Nakamichi speakers w/sub. I toned this down with the equalizer option on Real Audio player, and the sound is very rich. If you don't have an equalizer adjustment on your puter, you may not like the deep bass of these speakers. I have the bass setting set to 0 and it sounds good there.I did like the extra input jack on the speakers for an MP3 player/Ipod. This is great for folks who have their music libraries on their Ipod and don't want to buy another set of speakers or are tight for space say in a bedroom or dorm.I only have these speakers 1 week so can't comment on reliability. I would have rated them a 5 if not for the bass issue. If you have an equalizer adjustment on your puter, I would recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money or time with these","review":"got these speakers because i didnt have much room on or around my computer desk for speakers.... i liked the way they looked (although they are bigger- tall and deep- than i expected) but had a clean look to it. then i went to test the sound - and all i can say is the sound was decent - not great - not bad... until i started cranking the volume a little-... then the sound started fading in and out- it was like somebody would take the volume button and turn it down and then turn it back up. so i googled if anyone else had this problem with these speakers...and found some instances on the web. i called the bose guy to see if i had maybe done something wrong or if he had a suggestion... he said he never heard of a system doing that- return it and he would send me some more...very nice about it. but im gonna return to amazon and choose another set of speakers... bose had their chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Just picked these up for $69.99 at B.J.'s Wholesale Club.

I'll be returning mine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly satisfactory for the purpose","review":"My computer isn't my principal listening station, so I didn't buy these speakers to replace my main system--which is also Bose. That said, these are excellent speakers, and I have spent hours listening to different kinds of music, my preferences being classical, jazz and world music. If you like super bass or super volume, these won't satisfy you, but if you like a balanced sound with articulate bass and decent highs with crisp definition and don't want to spend a fortune, these are great little speakers. I've read the negative reviews, which indicate that some people have had problems with them. If you do, exchange them and get a set that works properly. I would give them 5 stars for performing as expected. I only gave them 4 because they aren't equivalent to the bigger Bose systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jacks never fit right","review":"I have the older version of these speakers, and they have been great for years. But I bought this model for my son last year, and right away we had sound issues related to poorly fitting jacks and plugs. I taped all the wires to the speakers so they won't come loose, but we still get sound fluctuations. Its frustrating to own a decent speaker but have it fail due to something like wiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made For Music Listening","review":"No Mid level sounds to capture true music sounds. Only highs and lows.Good for watching movies and gaming but that is all.I bought these speakers and returned them the same day due to poor performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review...","review":"When I first opened the box, I was impressed. These speakers were very much aesthetically pleasing. Also, the build quality was quite nice.As for the sound, these speakers are not so stellar. My first impression was that it was almost as if Bose had tried to make these speakers not image. I have sampled numerous speakers over the years, Martin Logans, Quads, B&Ws;, Magnepans, and various other brands, granted these are not computer speakers and are not in the same price range, they sound great and image fantastically. Even my cheap computer speakers image well. The Bose Companion 2 is full of decent sounding bass, but the mids and highs, though clear, are lacking, as is typical of Bose. Also, the lack of an on/off switch is quite odd, and disturbs me.These are decent speakers, but I would recommend that you try other brands before buying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose=big brand, quality=poor","review":"While the actual sound fidelity from the speakers is good, as you would expect from Bose, the overall performance and quality is ridiculously poor. The sound zaps out from one side or another at random, the volume levels fluctuate for no apparent reason. There is static. When music is not playing but the speakers are on, there is a very loud and unmistakeable fuzzy hum emitting.And this is a replacement pair. The first pair did the same thing. They made me pack it all up in a big box and send the set back to them (cost about $25) to be replaced with a new set. It was so annoying to ship them back and wait that I can't be bothered again, since the next pair will probably have the same problems.I will never buy another Bose product ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"left speaker does not work!!","review":"I can barely hear the left speaker - and it is brand new.

There's no physical way to control the bass or treble. And bass oftentimes is overwhelming. Having said that, the speakers are very loud and crisp. I recommend using these speakers with some equalizer software. Since I use Macs, I use \\"Hear\\" whenever I'm going to listen to audio--whether it be news or music or audiobook. Hear has tremendous capabilities, and when you start using that application with the Companion 2's, you'll immediately feel the difference. I'm sure Windows users can find software similar to what I'm using."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst company ever","review":"its so sad that people are still raving about their sound, have any of you listened to other equipment? maybe the name bose just makes it ok to make and sell junk from the 90s and 80s, other speaker manufactures have made leaps in bounds in music and movie sound reproduction in the past 20 years, bose is the same old bose, they sell the same mediocre stuff(at least its become cheaper) but they still cant get this stuff too work all the time, what are they doing if not upgrading the sound to where every other company?people let your ears do the deciding not the name of the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SIMPLE ENGINEERING","review":"I bought these speakers yesterday, and tested them with my wife's Viewsonic High Definition 27\\" tv where I wanted more volume and full sound.

After listening to both for awhile, I could clearly feel that companion 2 lacks sounds separation, not as good as companion 20. For 2.0 speaker, I believe this is the top of the line, and if money's in concern, of course you'd go for $99, as it's as equally great, but you will think different once you hear 20. Just save a week of drinking and go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality sound, could use a little more punch","review":"I have been using the Bose Companion II since December and I am very happy with them. I chose this pair of Bose speakers over a Logitech surround sound system simply because of the name. I knew I could trust Bose to deliver a quality product that would not be hit or miss. Very simple setup, sleek look, and great sound. Hook them together and plug it into your headphone jack! They are unidirectional, and perfect for people who want to turn them up and not disturb roommates, family, etc. My only complaint is that they tend to \\"pull back\\" the sound to a \\"safe point\\" at higher volumes when listening to music with heavy bass. The low frequencies tend to get quiet. Very annoying when listening to a live recording and you have to rush over and turn the speakers down before the audience cheers! Then again, this is a pair of high quality DESKTOP speakers, and not a home theater system. Excellent bass response, but don't expect to tear the roof off the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to Bose name","review":"We have a Bose sound dock for my iPod which has amazing sound. I love this product, so I chose the Bose Companion 2 speakers for my new laptop, assuming they would have the same quality of sound. They DO sound good at a very low level. The bass is nice, and the sound clear. But if you turn the volume up to anything beyond a low level, the sound gets muddy and tends to fade in and out. Wondering if perhaps it was my laptop and not the speakers, I plugged them in to my husband's desktop with the same results.For what it's worth, the speakers are attractive, nicely sized, and came well packaged. But for $100, I know I can do better so I am returning them. They definitely do not live up to the Bose name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceclent for their size.","review":"I listen to Rock Rap and R&B plus im a gamer and I have used them in each scenario and they have rich sound and base for their size even at higher volumes I cant remember ever hearing any 2.0 speakers this size sound so good. If you are having problems with the sound quality then you might want to turn down the volume on your comp to 50% and just use the volume on the speakers to adjust it from there. Also I live in Germany working for the U.S. Army and i was very pleasantly surprised to find out that they are multi voltage 100-240v if you dont know that means u dont need a power converter to use them in other countries great if you travel or get deployed to other countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Unpacking these, I was impressed by how solid and heavy they were and how well they were crafted. They should deliver pretty good sound for my small home office, right? No. After of couple of hours of listening, I gave up. The base was overwhelming, and not in a good way. Vocals were muffled in the mix and sounded distant. Sometimes iTunes' equalizer can be tweaked to help somewhat, but not to any significant degree with these.... the heavy-handed base smothers everything. I packed them up to be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I ordered my Bose Speakers on July 17, the estimated delivery date was by July 27th or 28th, at the latest.

I returned it and bought a Klipsch Promedia 2.0 and there is simly no comparison!It's not fair to reqire this kind of tiny speakers to perform, but the Bose's problem is to use a price tag to impress the buyers in stead of focusing on quality.I believe some of the reviewers here are just new to home audio. I still remember how I was excited when upgrading my OEM dell speakers to a entry-level 3.1 system for the first time.Well, if you do not believe me, just buy a pair of Klipsch ProMedio 2.0 and see for yourself if Bose worths even $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bose....it speaks for itself.

Ordered another set of the M-Audios and tossing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Awful, But Strange Processing Problems","review":"I bought these, trusting in the Bose name and quality that is usually inherent in their products. However, once I put them through the paces, a fatal flaw became readily apparent.For music that is simple and not very dynamic, these speakers have excellent clarity. However, when I put on fast, hard music, the whole processing fell apart. They basically sound like they've been overcompressed and that a random envelope filter has been applied. The effect is not as noticeable at lower volumes, but at higher it is completely destructive. Listening to Chopin piano pieces, it was excellent. But try playing the Dead Kennedy's version of \\"Take this Job\\" and suddenly everything sounded like it was in a tin can. Muddy, overprocessed and awful.I suppose I won't completely give up on Bose, and I realize this is the cheapest thing they sell. But I expected a lot more from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compression Circuitry? Why???","review":"I just think it's so obnoxious to have any sort of compression circuitry in a speaker. Songs were not meant to sound like this! If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's basically what makes the speakers sound like someone is messing with the levels while you listen to a song, turning them up and down. When it gets too loud, Bose has implemented a circuitry to smash the volume down to the appropriate level that they deem. This makes for a very awkward listening experience. Thank goodness I didn't pay for these (Dad's old speakers).Besides that, they're Bose, and Bose always has dark sounding speakers. Screw their brand recognition...they're crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value. Great sound.","review":"I was a little concerned with a few reviews that I read here and by the low price of this 2.0 speaker system, but I went for it. I needed a new compact speaker system for my laptop, didn't want a subwoofer and couldn't stand my USB powered speakers anymore. I'm a bit of a audio snob and constantly complained about the tinny sound that my old speakers pushed out.The Bose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system is a great value - well under $100 and I could honestly say that it sounds like a 2.1 system (with subwoofer). The sound is full and bright, like one would expect from Bose speakers. The speakers aren't something you would put in your laptop case, but they are nice looking and built solid. I couldn't ask for anything more. Very satisfied with the Bose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the new speakers","review":"Got the speakers as a Christmas gift and they live up to the high Bose standards.

These speakers have also been knocked off my desk onto a tile floor many times, had stuff spilled on them and in general have not been treated all that well, but they keep going and the sound has not changed.I now play all of my music through my computer because the computer sounds better than the stereo. I also have used these with my MP3 player and have hooked them up with my MP3 at parties and no one suspected that I could be using computer speakers.

You have authenticity here.Martha Lipton likewise contributes an older world charm and charisma to Copland's settings for Emily Dickenson's words.Carl Sandberg's resonant reading of his own words is worth the full price of this set.And then the inimitable Oscar Levant's piano treatment of the orchestral pieces...Levant had a wry touch to his interpretations that gave him a voice all his own.There's much more here, quite a bit that's less than familiar and therefore increases one's familiarity with Copland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I can't understand why this cd is in this 3 vol set.

In fact it may be music appreciation in it's purest form, untainted by a message. GoGo is a power trio of guitar, bass, and drums. Their front man and guitarist is a lady as is the bass player. The male drummer calls himself 'Turkey' - he's very, very good. They rock, they ska, they even vamp a bit. If you like music with lotsa guitars and a lot of drive you'll like this band. This is a pretty ambitious album for a band stuffed into the surf punk category. Check out their 'Best of' cd too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Of A Great Band","review":"Knowing the story of the Comsat Angels, of their years of commercial disappointment and frustration, it's remarkable that near the end of their career they would produce such an outstanding album as My Minds Eye. At this point, there was little hope that they would ever score a hit single; maybe that's what freed them to just create great music. To those familiar with the earlier Renascent releases, the sound has evolved here; the post-punkness is virtually gone (this album having been recorded in 1991). Steve Fellows' emotive vocals shine through, especially on Always Near, Magonia, and I Come From The Sun. Other great tracks are Shiva Descending, with its slight Mid-Eastern musical hook, and the catchy Field Of Tall Flowers. But then all the songs are good. By all rights, this brilliant album should have been topping the charts and the band showered with acclaim. Consider yourself lucky that you have come across it here...and don't hesitate to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strong smell to me","review":"These wipes come in containers that are individually sealed in plastic overwrap.

The show was never that good, and the animated series while better than what was allowed on prime time wasn't as good as their crack at the fairy tales and current events. Granted, these are animated by DIC, so the art is okay at best, but the writing is witful and acerbic, and even downright raunchy at times.

When seeking these works I look for those that clearly clarify each and every verse. As well as provide as much background imformation on the suject as possiable. Since scholars often times differ on their interpretations, works that present a fair representation of divergent scholarly view are preferable. Again as a student a good bibliography is a must for study and continued growth. Last of all the author should stick to the subject at hand and not twist Biblical commentary to meet their own personal theological ideas and present such as absolute fact. Sadly, in all the above, this work fails miserably. The author tries to present non dispensational, antiquated Romanesque, post trib, replacement theology as if it were indeed fact.

The actor Laurie should stick to acting and not writing, as this book is both adolescent and confusing.

I don't know if it was the cast of characters showing up after a 100 page hiatus or if it was just way the story was being told. Eventually, I sent down the book and never finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spy Spoof in the tradition of Wodehouse","review":"A grand spoof on the spy novel written by a well-known British actor (Jeeves and Wooster, Black Adder) which follows and skewers the classic conventions of the genre: ex-Army hero drifts in and out of work and falls into the middle of an international conspiracy involving CIA, et al, beautiful love interests, exotic locales, motorcycles, etc... The first half of the book (the setup) is consistently funny in typical British satiric fashion, almost every paragraph has a lovely turn of phrase or nasty aside. The second half of the book (the deed) is less so, concentrating more on action. I'm not surprised the pace couldn't be held all the way through, given the high wit of the first half. This is not to say the book isn't excellent and fun reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's trying too hard to be funny","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed Hugh's acting in the TV series House and his interview. However, exaggeration is a better strategy for him in acting than in writing.The beginning of the book is intriguing, both in writing and story-telling. Nevertheless, after 20 pages, the really-long-sentence-with-forced-in-humors became irritating. The book tries too hard to sound funny, which somehow interferes the flow of the story. I stopped after about 30 pages, so it might get better later on, but I can't say that.If you like books that read like a comedy show and are not very demanding for a well-plotted story, I would recommend The Good Omen by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"The purchased item was delivered within the estimated timeframe in a perfect quality.

Wodehouse and the \\"Jeeves & Wooster\\" TV series starring Hugh Laurie.After a couple of weeks, I checked back with her to see how she had enjoyed it. She confessed that she wanted to like it, but threw it away after reading just the first couple of chapters; the language (particularly the frequent use of the F-word and the profane use of deity) was simply too much for her.If you don't mind that kind of language, I suppose you won't even notice it in this book. But I wish I had known before purchasing it for mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I couldn't read past the first few pages and I finally gave up.

I was recommended this so called politcal text, written by a young academic (whose university is not I hasten to add stated) by a co-professor.

What a great book. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not exactly \\"House\\" but very good","review":"Fans of Laurie's Doctor House will not find an exact match in this novel, but they won't be disappointed either. Thomas Lang has much of the author's own sarcastic, biting wit about him, and he comes across as much more interesting than your typical spy/thriller hero because of it.Humor is a strong part of this, and the inner monologue shared with the reader is full of self-deprecating, ironic comments, and the text is rife with send ups of standard cliches. There are a few times he goes over the top with these, but it suits the style and the tone of the book perfectly so those are easily overlooked.Language is a bit strong for my personal tastes, but certainly in bounds for the setting and the genre.A strong ending, with a few unexpected twists. Overall a fine novel and I hope to see more from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book by a great author","review":"This is an excellent book.

A great story, made me laugh out loud. It feels like House's sense of humour crept in to the book. I recommend it to anyone who read Douglas Adams as a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly overlooked.","review":"Okay, I bought this because it was cheap and I am a fan of Hugh Laurie (best known for being TV's 'House'). I was very surprised at the story he spins and at how well he does it. This book is in the style of 1940's detective noir stories set in the present day. The characters are intersting and engaging, the action is believable and exciting and the story moves along at a fast pace. This book will have you sitting on the edge of your seat (or couch, toilet, or wherever you do your reading). His wit and sense of humor comes across well with the main character and makes him seem more real. This is actually a fair shade better than most of the old time noir tales and would be well worth it no matter whose name is on the jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy about","review":"I LOVE Hugh Laurie - I love his acting, and he's an incredible musician. However, I just didn't care for this book. I didn't even get through the first three chapters before I gave up. Someone else might enjoy it (and others obviously have from the reviews), but I didn't. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"As Dr. House, his continous cryptic dialogue is interesting. As the main character in the book, it was less than interesting. In his wtitings, he just could say \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" without oververbalizing each thought. Got tedious afterwhile. Moreover, the plot had a lot of holes in it from my perspective and the word \\"plausibility\\" kept coming to my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"From commedian to craftsman- Laurie delivers","review":"Many comedians make the transition from entertainment to literature, with varied success. Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie's friend and collegue, made the transition with such bestsellers as \\"The Liar\\", delivering a wit that only a comedic wordsmith can. Laurie's debut offering \\"The Gun Seller\\" makes its mark with no less quality.Based in the genre of the hapless spy, ushered by the powers that be, Laurie acheives a new depth of with and perception, through characters and complexity of plot, that make this novel more than just an entertaining read.The story is addictive, the protagonist a delightful anti-hero, and the language worthy of Hope and Campbell. Its the type of novel that has you dog-earing pages so you can return and ponder the mastery of Laurie's expression and wit.If you like a good laugh, love a great book, and are a sycophant for prose of the post-modern, then \\"The Gun Seller\\" is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"Recommended to me by the author (whom I was under the impression was a shrubber), and because he held a power milker to my head, I decided to check it out. To my dismay, I can't say anything bad about it - it's a good fable, and I am impressed. Very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I finished it","review":"(Kindle version)The first half of the book really wasn't too bad. Mr Laurie went a little over the top with the \\"Hard Boiled\\" style but not so thick that made it hard to follow. I mostly cared about the protagonist and the story moved along in a bit edgy but lighthearted way. Unfortunately the second half of the book bogged down with long, drawn out scenes that weren't believable and not lighthearted. The hard-boiled dialogue seemed a little out of place with the turn to seriousness that he introduced. The protagonist I thought I knew changed into an insensitive killer that made me wonder if I knew him at all.I half thought to give up on the story but by then I was 75% through it so decided to plod on. The ending did tie up for the most part but I found myself more relieved to have finished rather than satisfied with the conclusion. In summary I can't recommend.Thanks for reading the review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant style, gasp-out-loud funny.","review":"I'm not a big fan of the action novel or the spy genre, generally, and it's all too rare that a comedic novel actually thrills. This jaunty (yes, jaunty) read clears all these hurdles in a single bound of fantastic storytelling. Laurie's expert comedic timing and brilliant phrase-turning are so exhilarating that the plot hardly matters: from the opening sentence you can't wait to read more. As it happens he's pretty good at plot, too, stringing together scenes like so many ridiculously shaped beads that, once finished, make a really quite festive sort of garland.It's too bad this book got no visible publicity here in the States; it could have done really well, and then he might have gotten an advance to write the next one. I'll buy two copies, whenever it's published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"A smart, refreshing comedy! If you love 'House,' you'll love the humor in this book.

It has a good plot and fun characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Just finished this book. It held my attention. I liked the main character, not part of the main stream. The remainder of characters were not well developed. The plot took awhile to materialize which, in my opinion, was good.

I'm hoping he meant us to be comfortable with the lead - as we were always comfortable with Bertie. If so, my vote for the movie lead is Hugh Laurie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first novel for Laurie","review":"\\"The Gun Seller\\" is the first book by actor/writer Hugh Laurie, and it was a very good start. This novel has everything, intrigue, drama, action, love, and most of all, comedy; the kind of snarky high brow wit that only a brit could muster. This is a really hard novel to review without spoilers, but basically, if you took Casablanca, and added some Syriana and Monty Python, then you would come pretty close to this novel. I will say that the ending was a slight disappointment to me, but I won't give anything away. I felt that the last 100 pages kind of went a little too far off course. All, in all, an excellent book by a great up and coming writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Funny and Thrilling!","review":"I just finished the book and I was amazed by something I find fleeting in other recent readings- I actually enjoyed it to the point that I didn't want to lay it down. I am now waiting for the next novel the Paper Soldier to hit the US market, but it looks like it might be a wait for that. If you like a fluid, satyrical, well appointed read then this is a good book to work on. He's definitely one of the best of his generation, and look forward to more wonderful writing in the future from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond meets Dr House.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

Mr. Laurie wrote one of the most exciting and funny novel I ever read, and even if the book has some Jimmy Bond scent, you can easily see that the writer has his unique and very thoughtful style. You will love this book and feel that it's been a good thing to meet mr T. Lang after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Laurie's book is marvelous! Fast, exciting, unpredictable, funny, very entertaining. I couldn't put it down and laughed all the way, except when I didn't.

Exceptionally well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gun Seller - Enjoyable Tongue-in-Cheek Funny Read","review":"The Gun Seller is an enjoyable book and a parody of most spy thrillers. Hugh Laurie writes in the first person about a reluctant hero, with dry humor that will have you laughing out loud. The characters come to life throughout the story and there are some unexpected twists. This is a good read for any mystery fan. Here's hoping Hugh Laurie writes a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is anybody in there?","review":"Okay, I want to know what happened? Did Hugh Laurie's brain go on vacation 2/3rds of the way through the book? When I sat down to read The Gun Seller I thought that it was fun, witty, and exciting. The sarcasm was fun for a while, but then it got irksome. It was a bit showy and over the top. Every paragraph and almost every sentence was hosed down with mockery. Then, about 2/3rds of the way through the sarcasm just stopped. There must have been a serious kink in his ridicule hose. Uh, where did Hugh go? It ended with all seriousness and down to business with a few chuckles here and there. Overall the book was an okay read, the story line was good, but I felt like he rushed the ending or overdid the beginning. I can't decide which."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-consciously daft and frequently labored","review":"This book starts funny but gets less funny as it goes on, not because the jokes aren't as good, but because they're pretty much the same.

I think that's because we are accustomed to using our best skills in familiar surroundings. In this book, a spin doctor whose specialty is understanding people and what motivates them is pulled into an underworld where the prime motives are violence and power. In the old cliché, brain beats brawn - but in this story, brawn hits back and hard.As a woman who works in Washington, it was refreshing to me that the author had power-broker Eastman use his emotions and intuition to navigate. He is stripped of hubris and relies on his thinking abilities even as he knows he's vulnerable.

When I heard it was a \\"comic thriller\\" I expected something more slapstick--and was glad to find something far different.

Therefore, it is by no means objective, nor could it have been. Eusebius, after all was a Christian bishop. Readers who want objectivity will perhaps be a bit disconcerted. Despite this fact, I personally found this book most satisfying, as it provides a window into the early Christian past. It is in fact, as we look through the annals of Christianity, the only comprehensive historical body of work from this period. This alone makes it invaluable, and a must read for anyone interested in early Christianity and early Christian thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone interested in Christian history","review":"The original Christian history book by the original Christian historian. Still worth reading today for a peak at early Christian life. Eusebius also records so much of history that would otherwise be lost to the sands of time. This is an excellent translation and the list of \\"Who's Who in Eusebius\\" at the end of the book is an awesome resource. I recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the early Christian Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"To give just a brief overview of the book it covers the life of Christ from His birth to death in only a few chapters which include great information on the Roman rulers of that time as well. After this period he moves on and discusses other Roman rulers and the general activity of the Church until the Apostles died. Then he gives accounts of ecclesiastical and secular leaders up until his general time.The book is great for those wanting to know more about the early Church history. In most topics he does not go very deeply into the topic but instead gives an overview and touches on most things rather lightely. If you want to learn about the development of the Church in this time period this is a great book and one that is easy to read (I thought it was at least).So I would recommend anyone to read this book who has an interest in ancient Christian theology. There is not much I can say that has not been said in other reviews, so get the book and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Historical Work","review":"As I was reading \\"When Jesus Became God\\", the name of Eusebius, and his work on Church history, appeared repeatedly. I told myself that I would have to read this work, to get further insight into the early history of the Church. I'm very happy that I did, for this book, even though it is 1700 years old, is extremely interesting and informative on very early Church history. Many, many names were unfamiliar to me, but the helpful \\"Who's Who\\" in the back was a life saver. Constantly consulting it extended my reading time to double what it would have been otherwise, but I couldn't have understood the work as well without the assistance.

I was disappointed. The book offers very little explanation about each sections use or simply how to use the equations.

The course was tailored towards a mixture of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering students.From a math major point of view, this text lacks depth in its exposition. To reiterate prior buyers' comments, Farlow's exercises are largely trivial. Farlow introduces a wide range of material and concepts; he does not, however, develop them thoroughly enough to satisfy readers who expect and prefer greater mathematical rigor.I highly recommend Logan's intro text on PDEs (Springer 2004), especially for those possessing an advanced undergraduate mathematics background. Logan succeeds in all areas where Farlow fails--Logan is an all-around solid text. If you already have Farlow, pick up a copy of Logan as a supplement.

This book is an excellent review of a host of methods for solution but what is more important is the physical interpretation of the PDE's the author insists on. Most of the physical examples are drawn from the fields of heat and mechanics but they can be easily applied to electromagnetic and semiconductor charge transport problems. Every aspiring senior in an engineering discipline should study this book for his own good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I used this book in an undergraduate course, and since I couldn't see the board during lectures, I relied on only the book and it was very easy to read and understand. The major drawback of this book, and I don't know if this accounts for it's abnormally low price, is that there seem to be far more errors in the solutions than most books have. About 100 pages into the book, I had encountered so many errors, that thereafter whenever my solutions were different from the solutions in the book, I wondered first if the book was wrong, not if I had done something wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introductory book","review":"I can't say it presented much detail. Lots of derivation was missing and sometime it just seem like they're not adding enough-For example, the section on Duhamel's Principle was lacking. Though it does a good job on explaining how this principle can make some problem much easier to solve, it does not have enough examples to fully understand. Also, like most reviewrs pointed out, there's not enough problems~Usually four or five problems on each section. Lastly, beware of the several mistakes on the answer on the back of the book. My professor had to give us several of the correct solutions. Overall, its a good book for engineering major, and for those who just been introduce to partial differential equation.

It's a wounderful work of literature and has all of Molly's stories from MEET MOLLY to CHANGES FOR MOLLY without changing a word from the original MOLLY books. I love the American Girl books, and this is a fast way to collect Molly's charming saga. I would recomend this with five stars to any girl- or boy! -ages seven to eleven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully told stories that bring WW2 to life for young girls","review":"What a pleasure to read the entire story of Molly in one hardcover book. ABSOLUTELY worth the money! You should know, however, that the historal sections at the end of each of the original six books are NOT included. There is one large section on the history, but by no means as comprehensive as the six sections found in the entire series. Still worth buying...Now I have all of these new HC books AND the six book series! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAG KEY HOLDER - YOU WILL BE SORRY!","review":"I installed one on a brand new car two weeks ago and when I went to grab the key holder yesterday the only thing left was the magnet.

It reminded me a little of Marcel Proust's \\"A La Recherche du Temps Perdu\\". She likes to dwell on images and incidents for pages at a time. In her case she can command the reader's attention throughout. It takes a particular talent to do that and I think it is a remarkable achievement especially as it is Ms Morris Wu's first novel.I would like therefore to recommend this book for anyone interested in Taiwan history with four stars****as I want to encourage the author to continue writing, bearing in mind the comments and improvements recommended by the afore-mentioned reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermostat is glitchy","review":"Bought this thermostat and when installed tested it agains the three other thermostats in my house and it was four degrees off consistently.

Now after programming several times, there is a glitch that on Sunday the set temperature is glitchy and continues to run past the set temperature.I like it but it has many problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent features, completely dependable operation","review":"This thermostat replaced the original which came with our gas 'woodstove,' a cheaper brand, which had ceased to function.The Skytech installed easily and its more flexible feature set (multiple programmable heat time periods for each day of the week) really adds value to a programmable thermostat.

This is just the way the opera, in particular, strikes me. I'm no great opera fan, and to my knowledge, America just has not yet proved itself in the operatic field although it's tried. It will take time, but I do see Copland's work as someday being considered the best example of American opera. This is all subjective opinion, obviously, and I'm sure there are those more knowledgeable who will disagree.

The summary on the back cover is not reflective of the novel, so don't expect many of bad hair days or much else of what the back cover suggests. Like almost all chick lit, it hits all emotions and has a happy ending. The southern attitude and way of life was a great break from the londoners that I am used to reading about. It is a great summer read, and a curl-up-in-bed read that I am sure you will enjoy. You'll fall in love with the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Hair Day and A Bad Book!","review":"I honestly don't know why I even finished this book, I really couldn't get into it from the beginning and I never did. The second I heard them refer to Esther Williams more than once, I should've known.The book takes place in a VERY small southern town with not much going for it rather than a Trav'O'Tel, car museum, a long family feud. The two families were all but a few people left in the town and pathetic attempt at the Hatfields and the McCoys. Of course the new generation of the two families were a divorced woman who owned the local hair salon, which she took all too seriously, and a handsome man she lusted after for 20+years. Of course these two get together in a Romeo and Juliet sense and bring the families together and end the feud. That's about the entire, slow paced book in a nut shell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute? No, a dub gone wrong.","review":"I think the CD is genuinely meant to be enjoyable, but with the title \\"A tribute to Whitney Houston\\", one expects more than this CD offers. Whomever the singer may be, she tries to be a Whitney Houston duplicate which she is not. She should have put her own emotions into the song and should have became the song, rather than try and sing it as Whitney would. The singer has a beautiful voice, but she should have tried harder to be more \\"herself\\" than like Whitney. The musical scoring and background tracks were very close to the originals and I would have been very impressed by that; except for the fact that the overall quality and engineering of the album was terribly poor. I think that your average buyer would pick up this CD thinking it to be a masterpiece, and would take it home to be sadly mistaken. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have mercy on this CD!","review":"A masacre of butchered music from talented artist have been used to make these tribute CD. This is not the only tribute CD out, there are those of Mariah Carey and Britney Spears. This person should have quit while she was ahead because her voice is not getting any better attempting to ruin the songs of talented artists. This girl in know way sounds like Whitney yet alone of urban desent. A 64 pinto with is mufler falling off sounds way better than this. This girls voice can't compete and it is sad that she would atempt to make this mockery a funny joke. The only thing funny about this is the fact that this girls voice is horrible. Her voice is as bad a rotting orange peel except much worse. I hope Whitney never hears this because she's probably be ashamed. Even Whitney with all her \\"PROBLEMS\\" still sounds better than this untalented girl. Go spend you money on somthing worth wild. Listen to the clips if you don't believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My three most favorite books of all time...","review":"I disagree with B. Borden's review of these books. These three books are my three favoirte books of all time. Killer Angels is absolutely the best. The writing style in Gods and Generals seemed so close to the Killer Angels that you would think it was the same author. The books cross-reference one another. After reading Gods and Generals I had to read Killer Angels again and it just FLOWED so smoothly! The Last Full Measure gave me a sense of closure by completing the saga. I would probably give The Last Full Measure 4 stars, not quite as much of a page-turner as Killer Angels and Gods and Generals, but still VERY good reading. (My wife makes fun of me because I had a few teardrops roll down my cheeks reading the end of The Last Full Measure)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading!","review":"An amazingly well written historical account of the Civil War using a fictionalized approach.

Read a real book by someone like Bruce Catton, not some novel that takes huge liberties with the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star general","review":"Shaara has the ability to allow the reader to know the generals and soldiers in the Civil War. He must have read countless books in preparation, for he includes details that I haven't read before. Shaara takes the reader to the battlefield, and we learn the strategies and accidents of each battle. Shaara takes the reader to each general's tent, and we find out the strengths and weaknesses of each man. We learn about the horrible wounds and the lack of medical training to treat them. Each battle is described as though Shaara had been there and were writing a diary. The Last Full Measure gives the sorrow of the loss and the dignity of the surrender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War Trilogy","review":"Three of the best books.

It gave no helpful information and seemed very farfetched. The only good thing in this book was it showed the writer's determination to find a successful treatment for this disease. But it gave you no answers and was vague the whole way through. It mentioned different things in your surroundings to change to improve your health, such as fabrics and furniture, never mentioning what those fabrics were. At the end of the book it gives you a website. The website is nothing more than a place selling CD's and information supposedly to unlock this secret.

However the title gives the impression you are going to receive medical and practical information in dealing with the illnesss. This is not the case. It is misrepresented by the title. This book is all about a woman's belief in a \\"healer\\" Yet she used every medical opportunity to treat herself. I really wanted to throw this book across the room while reading it. It offered no valid information. It just read as if she was absolutely crazy. And worst there was no information about the means of \\"healing\\" from this person. It was all vague \\"you'll know what's right\\" and you have to find the right healer rhetoric. This book should be catagorized as fiction.

If you fill the tumbler with coffee, it will continually come off. Once the tumbler is 1/2 to 3/4 full the lid will stay on better. I still gave this tumbler 2 stars because I love the size and style of this tumbler and the fact that coffee stays hot forever, but the lid is too much trouble for me.I called Thermos customer service and they offered to replace my tumbler with another insulated tumbler that has a screw down lid. Great customer service from thermos.I you are buying this to use in a car, I would reccomend that you get one of the thermos brand tumblers with the screw down lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid pops off if full mug is tipped over","review":"The mug is excellent at keeping coffee hot but it is useless as a spill-proof mug. The lid is not a screw-on design and instead relies on a single rubber seal-ring and friction to hold it on. The problem is the rubber seal-ring is a lose fit and end up too close to the top of the mug rim. If the mug is accidentally tipped over you will probably end up with the lid popping off and the entire contents spilled all over the table! That is what happened to me on my very first use!! To make things worse, the bottom of the mug has rounded edges which makes it easy to topple over a completely full mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good insulated cup, poor lid design...POP!","review":"My husband liked this cup for awhile. BUT the lid has a poor design in which it is held on by a thin rubber gasket and it pops off with very little effort. Tonight, he showed me it popping up with nothing in the cup. You just push it down, and POP! it comes right back up. Very poor design for a travel mug lid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid pops off, makes this not a worthwhile buy","review":"I love Thermos brand, especially since their products really do keep hot drinks hot and cold ones cold for hours. And the lids are the easiest to clean- since they come apart you can wash them and prevent disgusting-smelling mold from growing in lid, which happens easily with other cheaper brands.I bought this model and it was great for about a month, but now, the lid, which is a pop on/off style, won't stay on. It pops off every few seconds. It never was too secure, but now it won't stay on at all. Of course I first discovered that when I was driving and took a sip only to have my whole smoothie spill all over me and my car.I'm now looking for one that has a screw-on top model."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have had mine for 3 years","review":"It sounds crazy, but I have been using mine for 3 years, I think more than that.I understand what people are saying about the lid popping off but its due to the plastic ring which is what seals the lid. I realized after a couple of spills, that the ring needs to be aligned correctly or it will not seal and the lid will pop off. I love this tumbler. It is the best travel mug I've had. I've tried other ones, they may be 'pretty'/more attractive due to their colors but they never keep drinks hot and were hard to drink from. This one you just slide the tab and drink, even with the tab open my drinks stay hot/warm for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great qualities, but it's bad qualities are very, very bad!","review":"Thermos generally makes excellent quality, durable products. This mug keeps hot liquids very hot and cold liquids very cold, for a long time. Also, the tab over the drinking hole is detachable so you can clean out the sludge buildup. Most importantly, it has a stainless steel interior. Plastic interiors retain flavors and make drinks taste terrible. Unfortunately, the lid just slides off an on, really easily. So when this wobbly mug tips over, the lid comes out and the coffee follows. If you lie the mug on its side, tie a thread to the lid, and tie the other end of the thread to a centipede, the centipede will have no problem pulling it off. I tested this. After pulling the lid off with ease, the centipede yawned sarcastically. This type of lid is much less costly for them to manufacture. I would have paid a few bucks more for a screw-on lid. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent insulation, horrible lid","review":"I've been a fan of Thermos products for a while and when I got a new car (and my old thermos mugs no longer fit) I went to Thermos for a replacement. Purchased these and at first I thought they were pretty nice. They do an INCREDIBLE job of keeping cold things cold, and hot things hot. BUT, the lid has gotten to the point that it falls of at the drop of the hat, even when drinking. Reaching down to the cup holder takes care so as not to bump the lid off. Drinking from the cup takes care as not to tip the lid off. They have become almost worthless because of the ease at which the lids pop off.I do not recommend these.I gave it two stars only because of how well they insulate. But, they are not worth anything more because of the massive lid design problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leakmaster","review":"It's so close to a great travel mug with a fatal flaw: it leaks, splashes, and spills. Kind of defeats the purpose of a \\"Travel Tumbler\\". It retains heat much longer than my plastic insulated mugs and has a nice feel with the rubber grip. But with the drink hole slider shut, coffee manages to splash out of the cover on my walk from the car to office. If it tilts in the cup holder turning a corner - it leaks. The top just pushes (rather than screws) in and has the tendency to pop off.

For one, it keeps drinks hot and cold for a very long time. I can leave this cup in my car for 4 hours on a 20 degree morning and the contents will still be hot when I go to drink it. Second, it is dishwashable. It's hard to find a good cup that you can throw in the dishwasher.Now the flaw. As has been stated numerous times before this awesome cup has a stupid lid design. Ever since about 3 weeks after I bought the cup the lid refuses to stay on. You don't have to tip it or jolt it even. As we speak it is sitting on my desk with the lid popped off, all by itself. I've resorted to taping it down with medical tape every time I use it. That works fine except I didn't pay 20 bucks for a coffee cup that requires the lid to be taped down. Not to mention if the tape comes unstuck it dumps all over my shirt.All in all, if you are looking for a good coffee cup, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermos 16oz tumbler","review":"Found this \\"tumbler\\" to be downright dangerous. When you fill it with hot coffee and put the lid back in place, the heat inside causes pressure to build up and consequently pushes up on the lid. Needless to say if you're not aware that the lid has come loose, and you're driving down the road taking a sip, you'll have scalding coffee dumped down the front of you. The lid is designed with nothing more than a thin rubber membrane around the outer edge for retention, and does not screw into place. In addition to this, the lid has no vent hole to allow the liquid to flow out evenly, and therefore only comes out in drips and dribbles as air might find a way in through the mouthpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky lid","review":"Keeps beverage hot or cold very well, but the lid, while secure on my tumbler, leaks severely from under the slide-valve when the tumbler is tipped on its side. It even allows the beverage to slosh out of the top if the tumbler is jostled. Not much good for a travel mug. Might be okay at the desk (if you don't knock it over)."},{"rating":"2","title":"loving it","review":"great everyday commuting accessory and work companion especially during stressful hours; my husband and friend also love it for daily use"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, but could be better","review":"I have this product and I have never had an issue with my lid sliding off. I am sure though with time the rubber seal inside will lose all ability to hold and I will have to buy a new one. The air hole in the lid could be a bit bigger or better designed.But as far as keeping coffee hot, well, oh my word. It keeps it hot for 3 hours easy in 34 degree weather.Overall I would buy this mug again and again. I probably will have to with the rubber ring lid, but this mug works well. I even bought one for the mother of my daughter for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never could get my computer to recognize this player","review":"I have a 2 gb player, which I like. I wanted a player with more capacity, so I ordered the 8 GB model. I tried charging the device but it never seemed to take a full charge. When I attached the device to my computer, I got a message about invalid drivers for the device. I looked at their online support and tried their suggestions, but it didn't help. I talked to Creative Zen phone support many times, they seemed to be more interested in getting rid of me rather than helping me. They would send me emails suggesting solutions and hang up as quickly as they could. I updated Windows, motherboard drivers, changed registry settings, cleaned the drive and reset the device, all to no avail. I returned one device and got another, just to see if the first device was defective. It didn't help. I tried the phone support again, and they sent me the same emails I got before. I finally gave up and am now looking at other higher capacity devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I have an ipod and now also this one.

You do not need to stick to itunes dictatorship.-Audio quality is very good. Sound level as well.- Radio option is convenient.- Photo browsing is easy.- Browsing is fine through keys. Sometimes you hate ipod is so touch sensitive specially if you forget to press hold key.Cons:- Slow transfer speed. Compared to ipod it takes ages to transfer songs. I read it can be because of less quality of flash memory which slows all process. Nothing to do with usb2 because ipod is fast in the same computer.- Slow on speed.

I did like the features and the size of this player, when it did work. However, the support is not good at all. There is no 800 number to call and all questions are answered by email. The process takes 24 hrs. If you don't receive a positive answer, you need to wait for another response, another 24 hrs. This is irritating.

Both saucepans and the skillet were badly damaged, as if the box were dropped on end from the top of a building. The stock pot and lids are lightweight, flimsier than I expected. And because all of them were to some degree oval instead of round, none of the lids fit properly. Several of the pots and lids also had minor cosmetic flaws in finish and/or small scratches.This seemed like a set of \\"seconds\\" quality, and since I wasn't willing to risk another set in the same condition, sent them back for a refund. Overall, I decided that it would be better to go shopping in a store where I could check the set for flaws or damage, pick them up, see how they feel. For the money, not such a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set for the price","review":"First for the price you really can't go wrong. It would be a good \\"working set\\" for just about anyone.Pros-Cost, you really cant get a single pot for the price on Amazon for this set.Non-stick surfaceGood weight/qualityCons -The large stock pot doesn't seem to be as thick or heavy duty as the other pots/pans.Lids are kind of thin, I would think the might get banged up some.Long ship time from amazon approximately 2+ weeks. They tell you that up front.Overall - Again I'm trying to be fair, if your expecting some show pieces for you kitchen to display these probably aren't for you. If you want a nice working set of pots and pans you can't beat these for the price.Update 12/08- Since my review the price doubled on the Nordic Ware set. What was a great deal at $50 is just so-so at $100ish. Still a decent set, just not sure you couldn't piece together something else for the price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I received my cookware very quickly and I love it! I'm not a gourmet chef or anything, but I do cook 4 to 5 times a week. There is nothing like having a good set of tools to work with in the kitchen and Amazon did not disappoint on these. The set is sturdy and attractive, and easy to clean up. I think if I keep it away from metal scrubbers and cooking utensils, the set will last a long time. This set can also be used in the oven by removing the rubber grips from the handles--fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sound","review":"Halfway thru the movie the sound cuts out and is gone for the rest of the video.The first half was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was a great poster just not the shipping","review":"let me begin with i orderd this on the 19th of nov and did not receve it untill the 23 of dec. when i did receve the poster it was of great quallity.

You finally see it and the director falls short of delivering what could have been the best movie you have ever seen. You want to like it, but just when you are about to, it falls short. That describes this game. The premise is fantastic but is basically a 3D version of Mario Brothers. It is very linear/scripted, you can't interact with your environments and it is lacking any real appeal other than the idea of having a super hero character. If the environments were more \\"Grand Theft Auto\\" this game would have hit a home run. If it was free online play it might be a good way to waste a couple of hours but @ $15 a month, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheels","review":"My problem with this book is that the wheels that go with it had been forcibly broken off and stuck in the envelope with the book. There's no way they can be put back together and fitted onto the bottom of the book, the way they're supposed to be. (See photo of book.) At least, I can't figure out any way to do it. Possibly, the company that sold me the book could send me some instructions. Otherwise, the book is of very little use because my grandson won't want it without the wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superseded by Recently Revised Version","review":"Why pay $163 on an old outdated document when you can join PMI and have access to the entire PMI standards library?

There is more quality in the knurling on the screw than in the entire unit of the others I have used. This unit is solid. There is not one piece of plastic on it. The rods are smooth and the connectors hold tight. The base can be mounted it many positions, even perpendicular to the spindle by using the angled ledge on the top front.

Television shows in the last 15 years have been going down the toliet and Swingtown is a perfect example.Sexual perversity, vulgarity, excessive violence and a general disrespect for the intellect of the American television audience seems to be the standard today for the network executives. Apparently the people who make and market television shows are digging through piles of garbage with the perverse notion that this is where quality television resides.The leadership at the current television networks, specifically CBS, have lost or buried their moral and intellectual compass and Swingtown is what they have left us with.My question stands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many eye hooks!","review":"There were so many eye hooks on this it's almost impossible to put on. The garters don't reach the thigh highs if you are a plus size girl like me. The belt is very plasticy feeling.

The recipes were more gourmet and ethnic than I expected, with a lot of new dishes. Even if you choose not to cook them in a tabletop/toastr oven, they're nice to have around for only 1-4 servings. As for the books toaster-friendly side, I'm not so sure. The authors give few special techniques or safety tips, a must for an appliance notorious for being a fire hazard. Also, most small toaster ovens are hell to clean, making it questionable whether you'd want to broil a lot of greasey things like hamburgers in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"nitty gritty","review":"the nitty gritty cookbook it great i had no idea how to set the temps for the oven for differents recipes the book really helped. thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toaster Oven Cookbook","review":"This is a great cookbook.

On one occasion I left my coffee in the car for the entire day and when I took a drink it was still warm!But....The fatal flaw that this mug has it's top. It does not screw on. It has a slip on top secured by a rubber \\"O\\" ring. If the top is removed at any time after filling (with coffee) the top will not stay in place. It will actually pop off while it sits on your desk and not over time, almost immediately.So if you drink one cup of coffee a day and don't need a spill proof mug, this is the best you will find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"My husband got me this mug for a gift a couple of years ago.

The music backgroud gives false hopes to the Spear's fan; for upon hearing the womans voice on the album, all one can do is cringe. Lowlights include Oops, Baby one more time, and Sometimes.

I expected it to be various artists covering her songs in r&b, rock, rap, etc. Once I heard it, I was like wtf? First of all, it's only one girl singing every song in a boring monotone. Britney doesn't have the best voice, but she's a soprano compared to this singer. It sounds like my mom trying to sing a Britney song. The whole album is done with the same beats britney used. Not what a tribute album is supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Pat Boone changes metal to lounge, now this!!!!","review":"This Britney Spears tribute CD isn't too bad, but is still the worst CD since Pat Boone's \\"In a Metal Mood.\\" The singer on this album sings like Dennis DeYoung singing like a woman. When I heard \\"Dear Diary,\\" I could have sworn it was Dennis DeYoung or some strong-voiced softie (balladeer). Their version of \\"Satisfaction\\" is okay, but nothing compared to the versions by Britney Spears and the Rolling Stones; Devo still holds the record for the worst version of the song. All in all, if you're into people killing other people's songs, this CD's for you.

How can you compare britney spears to janis joplin. The reviewer \\"a music fan\\" said that britney spears is much better than janis joplin. That is laughable, they are from two diffrent times, and styles of music. Janis joplin died at 27, that is right, but she was a strong woman, in a mans world. The time she was around, woman were not the thing in music. She made it possible, for woman to be taken serious in music. So dont compare Janis 2 britney, that is a joke. Britney never wrote a song, she has songwriters writing songs for her, she has only to go into a studio, and put he vocals over pre made songs. Remember that she had nothing to do with the music, or lyrics, of the songs. Janis wrote her songs, she had talent, britney doesnt. Britney is just another t & a shaker, without the looks, what are you stuck with? Just another singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! This would get a zero if I could give it one!","review":"Yuck, this doesn't sound anything like Britney, it is insulting thy would even release somthing like this. The girl who is singing sound like she just came out of a bar and has just one to many beers. Her voice sound horrible, like she recorded these in her garage and used the echo as her backup singers. All I have to say is this CD has flop written all over it. Buy the reall thing, don't waste your money on this pathethic voice. My cat's meow sound better than this girl's singing. This girl sings so bad they are afraid to tell us who she is. This album seams like it is one of \\"Eminems\\" sick jokes. This girls voice is so horrible it brought tears to my eyes and pain to my ears. They could just keep this CD, because it isn't anything I'm going to add to my collection any time soon.

Britney does not sing on this. The artists who sing on this are unknowns who want to be heard. I listened to the samples on this website once or twice and it was not good.

It is NOT for someone else to try to imitate, at least not for a CD that sells commercially."},{"rating":"1","title":"...laughable, sorry...","review":"The one redeeming quality of this CD is that when you compare the tribute artist's singing to Britney's, you realize, if you hadn't already(unless you honestly DON'T have an ear for music), that Britney Spears IS a talented singer. It is an illegitimate assessment to state that Britney can't sing simply because you don't like Britney's original, quirky style, as ability and style are truly two different things. When you compare the tribute artist's emotionless, monotone voice (I'm quite sorry, whoever you are) to Britney's vocals, you realize Britney is quite talented, after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"I can think of about 20 great bands right off the top of my mind who deserve tribute albums and haven't gotten them yet, but I'm not going to whine about that in my review. Its true, but too redundant.There are quite a few things about this album I don't understand. First of all, who are these people? Who's singing the songs? Can anyone clue me in on that?Second, tribute albums are usually comprised of greatest hits. Yet I haven't even heard of half of these songs. Why? Mainly because she's only had, what, 7 or 8 singles now? How does that merit a tribute album?Any \\"true\\" Spears fans wouldn't DARE using a Barbie doll to symbolize her--she's so \\"above\\" that, come on. Is this album for real?My guess is that, if anyone here actually bought or listened to this album--....The only reason I won't give it 1 star is because, at least someone else is singing the songs. Who could sound worse than her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"A tribute to Britney Spears??? Excuse me??? Remind me again who is she??? A ditzy manufactured barbie doll, with no shadow of a talent, that makes her a diva or something???There's something you might wanna know, oh poor 10 year old Britney fans: Britney is not an artist. A model? maybe. A gogo gurl? you've got this one right. But an artist? I don't think so. Tributes are for people like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, etc. People that have somewhat of a talent. A vision. People that have some sense for what they're doing. Hate to bring it to y'all, but Britney is no way to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when do no-talents get tributes?","review":"This album should get zero stars. To honor this \\"so-called\\" pop star who hasn't any talent to begin with is a slap in the face to the music biz. Let's see, she can't really sing. Her dancing is pretty much robotic. And all her stage performances are stolen from real stage talents like Madonna and Michael Jackson. And to top it off, she sings horrible bubblegum pop songs that she could never write herself. Nor does this person even have a production credit either, yet she still sells millions to people under 16. Looks and a push-up bra can get you so far.And after 2 years of making a joke out of herself, she suddenly gets a tribute album? At least when Madonna had several tribute albums, she actually worked 18 years to deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! I did it again!","review":"That's right, I bashed another tribute album for its mere existence. Since when do no talent LOSERS like Britney, NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys get tribute albums? Come on! Where's the tribute albums for artists like Sublime, the Ramones, the Beastie Boys, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Beck? These artists deserve tributes. I could think of a zillion artists who should get tribute albums. I can also think of at least a dozen female singers who are a million times better than Britney (Dido, Tori Amos...) . If you want a tribute album, check out tributes to some great bands, like KMFDM, Black Sabbath, NIN, and please, stop buying this crap, and leave Britney on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased, non-academic and simplified","review":"I must confess that the strength of this book is its organization. For education purposes may seem great - simple and comprehensive. However, as for the contents, it is very disappointing (example 1: the author is using we - Americans, and them - Soviets, East Europeans; example 2: the author exaggerates many issues - like pollution of the CEE and gives no factual data; example 3: he generally uses media, tabloid-style language).This book is not a good source of knowledge for anyone. It is not appropriate for the beginners (BA level American students) because it gives a completely distorted and simplified picture of the CEE region. The person who knows nothing about the region may take this description as the reality, which is not correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with caution","review":"While this book provides a decent cursory review of East Europe, it is not to be taken as an authority on the subject.

I already wrote a long criticism in reviewing another of Roskin's books, so I will not repeat it here, although he deserves all the criticism he can get.

Not a problem, or so I thought.It arrived. I opened it, and tried adjusting the plastic setting screw. It is so delicate that I think I adjusted it too far, pushing it past a stop point. Now, there is no maximum setting that I can find. It rotates endlessly.And, the performance sucks. My plan was to beam my DirecTV music channels from the living room to an upstairs exercise room and to an outdoor radio on the deck. I can tune in a channel, but the reception is fuzzy at best, and the sound is horrible. It basically sounds like AM radio.Count me as extremely dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very excited about getting this device. I thought I would be able to listen to internet radio all over the house.When I got it and set it up, I could only go about 3-4 feet before I got interference on my radio. I tried the suggested modification from other posters but this made no difference. Crane seem to have changed the VR2 dial since earlier posters and it is not obvious how to turn it fully, it just keeps turning forever. So no luck there.Couple of mitigating factors: 1) the input level on the side seem to be faulty on my unit, I got better results when I pushed it at an angle but obviously I could not keep my finger on it all of the time and 2) where I live, the FM spectrum seems to be very full and there are not many clear frequencies and as soon as I got more than a few feet away I got other radio channels.So, I sent this back, it's no more than a piece of frustrating junk to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor range","review":"I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard. It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box. I performed the power boosting \\"fix\\" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal. This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations. If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car. It's physically well built and works fine for that. I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Monitors go farther!","review":"Don't waste your money! I have been a FM hobby broadcaster (neighborhood broadcasting) for years. I'll take a Ramsey FM 100 B any day. Even after trying all modifications available on the internet, extending the anntena with a new piece of antenna attached, and various other \\"tricks\\" I found only a minor increase in range even after putting it on the second floor. The volume, even after adjusting the volume knob, is not nearly loud enough (or even close to other FM station) on our stereo, clock radios, or even the car radio in the garage.Our FCC certified baby monitors go 5 times farther with a louder signal.I don't think asking for 100 feet of coverage to cover a regular city home & lot is asking too much!

Come on CC Crane you guys should be able to do better than this!!! Might be good for voice but poor sound even up close.

I feel ripped off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great","review":"I stream XM from my PC with this transmitter and it works great in my 3 story house. I either wear headphones and work around the house or turn up my stereo where ever I am and get clear sound. completing the tips to increase the range is a must. I also reccomend finding a station that doesn't have any other noise on it. this takes some trial and error. I put on my portable FM player and roamed the house at a certain frequency. if I heard any noise I move onto the next frequency. Once a semi clean channel is found I set the transmitter to that frequency. Make sure you don't clip the signal it will ruin the quality (too much volume on the input)I highly recommend this for those people who want to transmit a stereo signal around a large area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Increase the range with out opening the box.","review":"Pry off the CCRANE label on the bottom and you will see two small holes and one large hole. The large hole gives access to the VR2 which if turned clockwise to the stop will extend the range. You don't have to open the box! Also using a flat screwdriver rather than a Philips may be better to prevent stripping out the plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you dont know What your missing then buy this wanna be !","review":"Everything Everyone is saying is true. this unit works after you do a bunch of crap to it.

Too bad because I had high hopes for this product, but now it's got to be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap, only buy if you enjoy throwing away money","review":"The other reviews are correct, this thing is worthless out of the box. I set it up on my jukebox to transmit roughly 6 feet with a clear line of sight to a receiver that plays on my outside speakers. If this thing cannot transmit 6 unobstructed feet, what good is it? So I opened it up and turned the little dial inside. At least I was now getting a signal, albeit weak and static-y. I would pretty much lose the signal when anyone opend the outside door, about 4 foot out of the line of sight. Oh, yeah, the volume button was wobbley and never worked unless I shimmed it with a little piece of folded paper. This thing was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"FM Transmitter","review":"I had high hopes for the Crane. Read many good reviews (some bad). But, it didn't work well for me at all.

I returned the original one I received to Amazon and they were prompt in sending me a second one which unfortunately was no better than the first.

Got this transmitter to be able to send podcast and streaming audio to any FM receiver in my house. Once I made the MOD it went from a range of 20 feet to 2 houses down my street. No need to replace or add to the antenna. Works perfectly, Great sound, Easy to MOD, VERY HAPPY!!!For those critical of voiding the warranty for preforming the MOD, Get A Life! C Crane has to deal with the all powerful FCC and can't release this unit with the recommended 1/4 turn of the VR2 pot. I for one am very thankful that this adjustment was so easily made and available to be made. I hope it lasts and don't need to return for any warranty issues, but if I do, I can remove 3 screws and cover, 1/4 counter clockwise VR2 pot, replace cover and screws and Bam!

I thought that it would be able to send a decent signal through the wall to the next room from my computer to where my radio and home stereo is but it is a very faint, scratchy, and weak signal. So if you are not right on top of your radio, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! The short coiled cord which plus in to the output of a iPod or computer is less than sufficient for most applications. It has so much spring in the coil and the length is so short that it pulls the tiny featherweight unit until the coil has basically retracted back to its original shape. Poorly designed.

The T.V. had to be turned up way too loud so that I could hear it while on the treadmill. I purchased this FM transmitter and used my arm-band fm \\"walkman\\" type of device to receive the signal. The reception was terrible unless I stood right next to the transmitter. If I walked even SIX FEET away from the transmitter, the signal was lost completely. I tried all kinds of different frequencies and even tried putting the transmitter across the room from my other stereo equipment.I did NOT try the hardware modification that one of the other reviews mentions.I returned the Crane FM transmitter and went bluetooth: I bought the Motorola S9 and the Motorola DC800 stereo adapter.

When it did work it had to be within a few feet of the receiver, but sound was still full of static and easily interupted. I had more luck with the Tunecast, which isn't saying much.

This didn't help matters from a reception standpoint, in addition, the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer.Third, the volume pot itself is of very poor construction.In short, it doesn't work, you won't be happy--even if you attempt to \\"fix\\" it yourself-- don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply didn't work","review":"An electronic device with an AC adapter that is not dual voltage is an anachronism.

The unit should have automatic gain control for the input level, but never mind that. No matter what station I used I got a high-pitched whine along with the true sound. This happened on two receivers, so I know the problem resides with the transmitter. Could probably be filtered out with an equalizer, but the primary receiver I have in mind don't have that capability. Simply unacceptable. My advice, save yourself the trouble and money for return shipping and go for a higher-end unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad signal is so weak","review":"I've owned my transmitter for several years now. Were it not for the range problem (and yes I did try the \\"range fix\\" that another reviewer posted), I'd be very happy with my unit. I like the frequency selection, overall sound quality (when it does work), and the ability to control the input level. But the weakness of the transmitted signal really hurts this unit. Unless my transmitter is just a few feet away from the receiver, it is worthless. My brother owns the same model (only his is white while mine is black). His unit definitely has a stronger transmitted signal as he can transmit a good clean signal throughout much of his home.

Got an internet radio but needed an FM transmitter to send signal out to our radios in the house. First bought a Hilly .5 watt FM transmitter which worked good. But because I am sensitive to EMF radiation, I returned it and bought this Crane low power transmitter. The Hilly transmitters are much better quality and power so if that does not bother you, go with the Hilly transmitters.First I opened it to increase the very low power. Tricky to do and ended cracking the volume dial. Be careful. Got more power but difficult to set up as got a 60 hz hum which I can not remove. Limited distance of 20-25 ft thru walls. Reception in our radios is barely acceptable but I have to live with it until the classical station we listen to increases their power for us to pick up their FM signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underpowered for the money","review":"I purchased this item to replace a simple battery operated mp3 transmitter that I have had for years.

By no fault of the manufacture, (due to the heavy restrictions by government rules namely the FCC) the little FM transmitter has very, very little range of transmitting its signal.Here are some of the results found.Distance was at best 20 to 25 feet (even after finding the little power adjustment underneath the back label and carefully turning to full clockwise position) also added a 12 inch piece of wire to the end of the built in antenna, and that made a very slight improvement.The transmit audio, when adding an MP3 player to the FMT was fair to good, but, if your FM receive radio was not getting anything but a strong signal, the audio was poor.The concept and idea about the little FMT is a good one, but, sadly it is a looser. Save your time and money, and look for something better.Hope this helps.Mike M."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuous background noise","review":"I read lots of review before I ordered this product.

It is truly a stereo FM transmitter. But instantly I noticed continuous background noise from the transmitter. I turned \\"stereo\\" to \\"mono\\" on my FM radio and the noise is reduced. But I don't think it is worth to use it on mono only. I feel sorry that I have to return it. It is my first return on Amazon. I hope Amazon will give me a full refund.

On one radio, I have to switch from stereo to mono, and it works fine. I have not done the 'mod' where you take off the back and turn a screw to increase power.

But it just seems like he doesn't care anymore..just as Tiesto is rockin right now.. that was oakey 10 years ago...I just hope Tiesto doesn't follow the same sell-out path..Now release Perfecto Fluoro 2 and prove me wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oakenfold is not worth the bucks","review":"Oakenfold is losing his brillance and his touch. His work seems rushed. It sounds unlike anything you would expect from the great oakenfold! I think he feels he has his footing securely in the music world and he is going to remain on the top heap! Instead, he shows me that he has long since needed to retire. This is crap. I couldn't get thru the cd without falling asleep in my chair. SAVE your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"If you're a long time Oakenfold fan, then don't read this review. I admit that this album is not a highlight of Oakenfold's mixing career, but we the songs on this album are not half bad. If you're new to Oakenfold's work, than this is definitely a place to start. This cd advertises with the title that it is CLUB music (meaning that these are songs that you can definitely bump and grind to at a club) which is exactly what this album has succeeded in. With remixes of Justin Timberlake's \\"Rock Your Body\\" along with vocals by pop artists like Natasha Bedingfield, one look at this album and you can already make inferences that the beats will be poppy. One major gripe I have about this album is that the selection of songs and the order they appear on this album are inconsistent with no careful though or planning."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"Just because you *can* remix something doesn't mean you necessarily *should*.

This is a two-for-one offer, so you also get his album \\"Love Is A Now And Then Thing,\\" which I had never heard of before this release. It's not quite as good as \\"Solitude,\\" but has some really wonderful tracks. Both albums focus on melancholy yearnings for lost love, which is why I have always saved them for rainy days, or evenings with candles and wine.

The answer given in The Crouching Dragon are not only exciting, but original and provocative.

Them two kids get Charles de Gaulle to fix it for them.It was a very boring book, very dull and hard to follow. No one was nice or sympathetic, and all the parents were paper-thin.

As the book was given as a gift by someone who knows the author, I started reading with interest, but was painfully bored by the third chapter and skimmed through the rest in order to try to give it a shot. I give Patti Lewis credit for fighting back against hard odds and even going so far as to write a quickly produced 305-page documentation of her efforts complete with point-and-shoot color pictures that look like evidence entered with the court.Basically, unless you have personal ties to the author or are tied to her particular Mohave County, Arizona complaints, you will want to pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Difficult","review":"We love big jigsaw puzzles but had to give up on this one.

Some of it seems like Masami Tusda introducing new events just to create some drama and keep the story going.Kare Kano's lesser moments are still better than 99% of other shoujo manga, however. Volume 16 focused on Yukino and Arima, with Asaba making some appearances, as well, but Vol 17 will apparently bring back the rest of the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Softcore cable porn","review":"This film is packaged to look like a mainstream movie but it is anything but mainstream.

There is even a silly subplot about one of the regular strippers searching for hidden treasure in the club.There is lots of flesh and simulated sex but it diesn't even reach the level of late night softcore cable porn.A pre-pubescent male would be bored with this movie after ten minutes (but would keep watching and hoping that it gets better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually attractive women but not much else","review":"This movie seemed like an excuse to string several stripper scenes together with a mildly interesting plot.

I was only interested because I was trying to figure out how low the budget was.

Quality seems very good. We like the additional cushioning at the one end, like a pillow. Inflates quickly and firmly (on battery). Which is really the only down side I see, as others have noted. You have to have the battery charged in order to use it, or have a car. If you plan ahead, there's no issue, but if you leave the battery discharged (as you should), you need to remember to charge it before your guests come over. Again, a non-issue if you're going camping and have your car nearby. Probably a cost saving measure on the design. So if you know it going in, you should be pleased.

It CAN NOT be inflated immediately when plugged into a wall outlet. The normal charge time is 12 hrs, but the initial charge time is 24 hrs. Thus, if you want to use it in your home, you MUST either still inflate it using a car cigarette lighter or wait 12-24 hrs before inflating it.I've never before seen any chargable appliance that won't work immediately when plugged into a wall outlet. I have no idea why it will work immediately plugged into a car but not plugged into a wall outlet.

But, without a mattress pad, in cold conditions, you can definitely feel the cold through the bed.

There never was an armenian genocide. Armenians were citizens of the Ottoman Empire. However, they helped the armies of the Russian Empire, with the hope that Russia will give them a country. They killed, Moslems and Jews, sometimes with despicable atrocities, killing old men, women and children. They even dug out unborn babies from their mothers wombs, after they raped them. They fought the Turkish forces, cut down telegraph wires. Sometimes the armenian terrorist forces of 200,000 were larger than the Ottoman Army present in the Eastern Front. They also burned towns en toto, and/or vandalised Turkish homes. The Turkish Government had to relocate them to provinces away from the war zone, to be able to fight the enemy. They were relocated to Syrian Province of the Ottoman Empire. During WWI many Ottoman citizens died due to famine and diseas. Moslems, Jews, and armenians died. Armenians call this a genocide.

The archival, diplomatic and survivor documentation is esepcially impressive. Balakian's emphasis on U.S. humanitarian efforts was particularly well written and thoughtful. My only complaint is not with the book itself - Balakian is such an outstanding writer - but rather with the topic. By about page two hundred the inhumanity and brutality of the Young Turks - especially Talat Pasha - started to give me nightmares. On the other hand reading about the heroism and courage of Ambassador Morgenthau (the American Ambassador to Turkey during World War One) renewed my faith in the capacity of humanity for goodness."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me weep","review":"and it made me proud to learn of America's first international human rights endeavor and the many acts of altruism carried out by State Department officials as well as by grassroots Americana -- from Sunday schoolers to Clara Barton and more --to save Armenian lives during the tragedy of the horrific Armenian Genocide.

I read it once and gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOOK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD FORGET!!!","review":"This book is absolute trash! It contains no new information, everything is just recycled from somthing else, from the likes of rolling stone or MTV.

Totally untrue. This book is shoddily written, especially the part about 1992, which kind of seemed to jump around. The author didn't mention that Gn'R got the MTV video vanguard award in September 1992, that's a big deal! Although Axl Rose is very interesting, I think the book would've been more balanced if there was more about the other band members. I do understand though, that Axl Rose is Guns n' Roses, in a sense. I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate being compared to Michael Jackson! I'm quite surprised that all the astrologers haven't gotten interested in Axl, being that he was born during the huge Aquarius stellium in 1962. Also, maybe there should have been more about Axl's bipolar disorder; that is a serious mental illness.Overall, the book wasn't that well-written, but if you feel you absolutely must know more about the band, it's an okay guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old News","review":"The author must have collected his information solely off of the internet and nothing else. There is nothing new in this book that any fan would not already know. Any given Guns N' Roses website would be just as informative without the ridiculous price required. The author constanly repeats himself using old quotes from the members time and time again. Perhaps his way of page filling? It is a lazy effort and best avoided by all means. Rather than waste your money, visit www.heretodaygonetohell.comor one of the many other GNR sites that will provide much more than this weak publication can offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey idiots, pay attention!","review":"why are people alwys bagging on axl?! anyone who feels the need to do so will NOT enjoy this book. but for anyone who wants to or already does understand the man, this is the tome for you. i think its very well written, i dont understand peoples problem with it, i guess its cos they are american!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love you AXL!","review":"the whole point of this book is to focus on not only the Guns N Roses of the past, but also as it is right now. it is ridiculous some 'fans' complain about there being too much focus on Axl, he IS Guns N Roses now.however this book does indeed focus on the earlier days of the band and does it fairly, never underestimating the contributioon of the other ex members. it seems it was too early to focus much on Velvet Revolver, but not only is that band crap - this is a book about G N R!!!i recommend this for both casual observers and true fans, there is simply so much information in it and i just couldn't put the book down. Guns' is my favourite band and i know a lot but there was still information i hadn't heard. the author backs it up well also, so it seems very plausible.he also goes very far into Axl Roses' psyche which makes for an entertaining, if often distrubing read. simply, if you ever want a book on Guns N Roses make it this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This P.O.S. really sucks","review":"I am a pretty big GNR fan and am appauled that anyone found that \\"book\\" to be even readable.

He FORCED the rest of the band to sign over the name and he has ruined what good name they had. Now guns n' roses is just Axl McFat and the guys who aren't Slash.

First, this is a genuinely good read (just based on the story....) with characters (all be they real...) that you root for and others that you shy away from (Emmitt Boyle and Marc Rich are drawn as evil incarnate....) Aside from this, this book serves as a record of a number of things: 1) a model for how a small-town labor struggle could be conducted on a broad-based front; 2) the ways in which capital does not exist in a locality so much as scattered throughout the world; and 3) an illustration of how labor stoppages in small towns have evolved from the days of Pinkerton thugs and picket lines to something more conplex and... well, modern....I'd really recommend this book to about anyone but, well, honestly, only people really into labor are ever going to read this.

But why? Why does anyone bother to listen to those tapes he left? Besides, why does anyone go through the trouble of setting up those devious contraptions? We may never know the answers to these questions but that's what the Saw series is all about. If no one bothered to continues Jigsaw's work, there would be no story. So as the series progresses, things are made up about Jigsaw's past (i.e. ex-wife losing his child). On the director's commentary, it is explained that a lot of what happens in this film runs concurrent or before the last Saw installment. For this reason, watching it is rather confusing at first. It's intricate but there are not as many profound philisophical statements as in the previous installment. It's suspensful and full of gore. I like how they use the montage to reveal how things came together in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw XII is REALLY going to suck","review":"Saw IV is the newest installment in this series. There's not much to say about this one. There were some good moments, and they used the opportunity to go into detail about what turned Jigsaw into the man he is. It was almost a sequel and prequel combined into one. The film flowed nice, even with all the flashback sequences. The problem is that they tried too hard to tie the film in with the others and made it WAY too confusing towards the end. Other than that, it's all been done. The look and feel was still there from the first films, but I think it's time to unplug the Saw and leave it alone now. Four films were enough, and maybe even more than enough. I do still love the look, feel, and creepiness of them... but let's not turn them into the next Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. We don't need Saw XII, or even Saw V for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw","review":"Creepy movie, as all saw movies are.

There was more a storyline than just gore by itself. Sure Saw IV didn't have the crazy bloody scene which it is famous for, but violence isn't that great if there isn't a clear story to back it up. Which is why I think this movie delivers a clear plot. The ending sure needs a lot of improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tobin Bell Is The New Vincent Price","review":"I can't wait to buy this dvd. I am now hooked on Saw and Mr. Tobin Bell. His Jigsaw character has brought new life into the Horror genre and this installment has it all. Loose ends are tied up, new questions are tossed at us, we find out even more about Jigsaw's past, and there is action, thrills, and gore galore. Saw's mixture of terror, CSI style detective drama, and action is very addictive. Tobin Bell holds it all together though. This man is a great actor and a modern day Vincent Price in my opinion. Check him out in Boogeyman 2 and Buried Alive also."},{"rating":"2","title":"BluRay","review":"Another Saw thriller. What more can you say.

Yet, the storyline was extremely confusing and hard-to-follow, and yet, I had seen the Saw movies at least 4 times each. They could have gone with a much more simple and effective idea if they had used the cliffhanger from the third one. Instead, they created a movie in which you simply accept what is being told (you think \\"somehow, it must make some sense\\").

Oh, character development, it only took the 4th movie to get into it. Guess what? it was unnecessary and boring character development. I don't care what made Jigsaw so awesome (obviously only referring to the first movie), but he is, so stop prying. I don't need to know about his ex-chick-E-baby to know what makes him tick. What am I his girlfriend or something? He kills people for a cause, don't muddy the waters. Once you kill off a character, guess what, don't go and tell us his life story, that's just lame. while I'm at it, the girl from \\"Becker\\" are you serious?

I felt the series was starting to slip a little in Saw 3, which I mostly did like along with the previous 2 movies. I won't speak about the acting only because there really isn't any to speak of.

In an attempt to recreate the fiendish riddle-like qualities that worked so well in the first two movies, and passably well in the third, the filmmakers have stretched the premise too far. The story, such as it is, twists back on itself to such an extent that the chronology of events in the previous movies and those of this instalment become hopelessly confused.

It manages, despite the books' length and focus, to be superficial. The language is often awkward and trite. The author never lets a chance to get in some \\"politically correct\\" dig at things like slavery to escape his text, and manages to discuss these issues in a way that sounds more like a sermon from the front of a 10th grade class than a serious biography.Like other readers, I was dismayed at the poor writing and editing of this book from a major publisher.

About every third sentence in the entire text is not a sentence with a subject and verb -- instead what you get is a clause, dangling by itself, with a period at the end. Also, the author must have sat down before he wrote this manuscript and compiled a list of every obscure word he could find in the dictionary -- -- and made sure he used every last one.

Just because he lived life in the open, without pretense or real ambition, most people wish to revile him and any vision that shows what he probably was: a completely open patriot without pretenses of grandeur. Perret is to be congratuated for a fine job.By the way, people, secondary history books are intended to entertain as well as inform. This one does both, even if the latter is not the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a Grant admirer who has read McFeely's prize-winning and somewhat critical biography and Grant's own Memoirs, I was eagerly looking forward to Perret's book. I could not finish it (and my reactions should be taken accordingly-maybe my complaints would have vanished in the last half). I will describe my reaction because I do not see here any other similar one. I felt the book repeatedly presented its material with a gratuitous snide spin, what seemed to me to be a sophomoric effort to be clever at the expense of the subject that seems entirely out of place in such a book. One example appears on page 45 (hardcover): While courting Julia Dent, Grant heard a rumor that there was a dangerous rival for her affections. Perret reports that the crisis passed because there was no rival. \\"If there were any other serious suitors for Julia Dent's plump little hand, no record of them survives.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly paced and poorly researched","review":"I won't give this book a paltry one star as others below have done. It's not at the bottom of the barrel, just close. The problem is that Perret is not an historian of the Civil War. He is not a Bud Robertson, Krick, McPherson or Gallagher. In order to write a good biography of Grant, you have to have a solid foundation of his military tactics and strategy. Perret doesn't have this and makes it obvious. The book is not badly written, I thought it was interesting in places. Maybe a bit overblown sometimes. There is no great biography of Grant which is surprising considering he was quite a fascinating fellow and horribly misunderstood. I think the people writing the reviews are fanatics on Grant and resent all the mistakes. I can scarcely blame them, the errors are outrageously numerous. I still think Bruce Catton's books, though 30 years old, still sparkle. This book does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss This One Adios!","review":"My Lord, is this a bad book. Since 1949 I have taught, written about and ruminated about the great conflict known as the Civil War. It took me two years to get around to read this book because my students and colleagues bashed it across the board. I just finished this book recently and now I know the source of the contempt. It is justified. Perret, it appears, has done virtually no research into the Civil War, antebellum politics or any of the main players around Grant. His psycho-babble about Grant's marriage, his relationships with subordinates and others is simply nonsense. Names, dates, places, faces and vital information is misstated repeatedly. Bruce Catton, my man, you can rest easy on your mantle as the still the most readable and accessible of all Grant biographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Researched","review":"I was actually motivated to read this book by finding Eric Foner's review of it in the N.Y. Times. Foner was less than enthusiastic and after completing the book last week, I am too. Perret is out of his league here and it clearly shows. Though his writing style is adequate (nothing more), the errors are among the most numerous I've found in any quasi-major biography. It's simply appalling that the author did not correct the errors in the galley stages of the book. I don't recommend this biography, not even to novice Grant readers. McFeely's book, though critical, is much the better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent Treatment","review":"Having studied Ulysses S. Grant since High School I think I know him pretty well. This author does not know Grant. He makes too many mistakes to be taken seriously by people who know about Grant as a military man and as a soldier. I got so sick of the errors I actually tossed the book aside in disgust several times. But I did finally finish it. There's nothing new in this book that already hasn't appeared in abler studies by Bruce Catton and William McFeely. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, it is unreliable and the research here just isn't new, interesting or even accurate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I have studied Ulysses Grant for 41 years and have amassed a library of 400 volumes that are a biographical studies of him. This book is at the bottom of the barrel. It is poorly researched and inept in it conclusions. Spare yourself the price of this book and read Bruce Catton instead. He got Grant on the mark, Perret misses completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the real Grant? No.","review":"As a supporter of General Grant as a military figure in American history, I don't recommend this book. If Grant himself read this book, he would not recognize himself. Sherman also would not see Grant in these pages. Sherman would spit out his whiskey, throw down his cigar in disgust and say, \\"This is not Grant!\\" The author's purpose is to try and elevate Grant to the level of Lee. As a man, Grant was probably more moral and \\"pure\\" than Lee, but Grant had so many pockmarks on his resume, mostly due to his excessive drinking early in his career. Grant learned to control his appetite, but this struggle is not explored. My amazement is that such a lightly researched and spotty biography found a major house to publish it and enough readers to warrant a paperback version. It's better to read Jeff Shara's new civil war novel, which has more peeks into Grant's real personality than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Grant book of all","review":"This is a terrible book, full of mistakes of the most elemental types. The author hasn't got a clue about the real Ulysses S. Grant and it shows throughout this limping entry into the Grant field. This book is regarded as a fatuous joke among those who follow Grant's life. My advice is to avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had to chuckle at a line another reviewer wrote, \\"I found none of the errors other people have alluded ot.\\" Well, I guess not, if you are not a particular scholar of Grant. You have to really know your subject in order to count the errors. I counted them and came up with 112. I know other people I have seen on the Internet count up to 200. I have seen Mr. Perret in person at the Smithsonian and it was quite obvious he did not understand Grant.The book is not poorly written, that isn't the primary issue. The issue is the mistakes and the lack of research. If it doesn't bother you that the author cannot even identiy people in Grant's cabinet or his own children correctly, then read this book. If it does not bother you that he spends exactly 9 pages describing the most fascinating period in General Grant's life (his race with death), then buy this book. If you want TRUE history, it ain't here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid but not stunning","review":"Perret has written a good biography of Grant, but this is not a book in the same class as McCullough's Truman or Donald's Lincoln. Perret too often dismisses or criticizes Grant's contemporaries, or later historians, without really proving the point with facts and citations. He seeks to make Grant out as a fairly strong president, one who dealt with the critical issues, but the presidential section of the book is so short that one is left not fully persuaded. Finally, although he mentions Grant's own love of maps, the book has only three maps, making it hard to follow the Civil War sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I'm a huge George Harrison fan, but I did not enjoy this album at all. Most of the songs did not sound very good with other people singing them, and the arrangements were horrible.It sounded like there were too many musicians playing different off-tempo parts all at once. Many of the songs seemed to just plod on with overused female backup singers attempting to hold things together. What a mess.Get Harrison's real albums to hear these songs done right. I did give this two stars just because there was some salvation here in the fact the Harrison did write great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure JUNK!","review":"I saw an advertisement for this on television and decided to look into it.

Joy at hearing this wonderful gift the performers give to there friend George, and saddess for the reminder of what the world lost all too soon. The performers which include Paul McCartney, Billy Preston, Tom Petty and theHeartbreakers and Eric Clapton, allow through their preformances the true star of the night to shine,George's remarkable work. Probably the most moving of the performances come from Jeff Lynne,George's partner in crime in the latter years of his career.In Lynne's singing of \\"Give Me Peace on Earth\\" and \\"I Want to Tell You\\" you hear the love and the loss Lynne feels over the loss of his friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Concert","review":"This concert will make you sing and feel memories.

The concert was great with all of the guest musicians doing a simply fantastic job. You could feel the love for George. I would recommend you buy the complete DVD version of the concert rather than the CD. Not only is the music mixed better (in my opinion), but there is a huge omission on the CD.

I THINK THE WHOLE CONCERT IS INCREDIBLE! I LOVE ALL THE SONGS. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE GEORGE HARRISON HAS TOUCHED, HOW MANY PEOPLE HE HAS INFLUNENCED. HE WILL BE GREATLY MISSED. THERE WILL ALWAYS AND ONLY BE ONE GEORGE HARRISON. HE AND THE BEATLES DID EVERYTHING FOR MUSIC AND I DON'T THINK SOME PEOPLE REALIZE HOW INCREDIBLE A GUITARIST. EASILY IN THE TOP THREE IN THE WORLD.

When yesterday came around, I drove to my local Borders, which only had the CD, not the DVD :-( Nevertheless, I picked up this CD and I definitely do NOT regret it- it's absolutely beautiful. You can just feel that George was there in spirit- every performance has a touch of him. My personal favorite cuts are \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" \\"If I needed Someone,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" \\"I Need You\\" (Petty is incredible), \\"Handle With Care\\" (Mike Campbell from the Heartbreakers plays a VERY George-esque solo), \\"Something\\" (Paul plays a ukelele inspired first part before Eric takes charge in the middle), and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" Being an avid Eric Clapton fan, I was not surprised how well Eric plays and how great his voice sounds, but I think he really makes the record. George can now rest in peace- I hope to meet you one day, George."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is great","review":"The best thing about this DVD, aside from the great music, is that it is obvious that everyone is having a great time on stage.

Unbelieveable that George is gone. I treasure his music, and this all star tribute is a glorious treat. The Indian music on the first CD becomes a bit tedious after a few minutes, but bless them, their hearts are in the right place, and maybe I just need to listen to it a bit more. The second CD is my favorite and contains some of the best George Harrison compositions written. George, I'll miss you and your music, but thank you for all you've given to us and to the world. Hare Krisna."},{"rating":"2","title":"George was there (in spirit)","review":"Love this CD. This is without doubt the best tribute concert I have ever seen/heard. The music was flawless. The whole DVD / CD is worth buying just to watch/listen to Eric Clapton do \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". The man is truly amazing.

I used it once and they were really helpfull!The only things I didn't like about it were:1. it was a little disappointing to open it see that it came with a tiny scratch on the eyepiece, but it didn't prevent me from clearly seeing the result. The whole eyepiece looks very fragile... I was always afraid of breaking it.2. it doesn't come with anything to clean the slide with... ended up using a q-tip to clean it.I used the microscope the whole month of April and am glad to say that thanks to Ovulite it was a breeze to pinpoint my best fertile days and just found out that I'M PREGNANT!!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoiding Pregnancy","review":"I'm currently using this to help avoid pregnancy, and determine if I ovulate at all.

Also the bag for this vacuum is bigger than the canister it fits in. Therefore the bag fills very very fast. When you pull the bag out of the canister to throw it away there is plenty of room left in the bag. So the canister will only allow it to fill to its canister size. There goes $200. down the drain. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst vaccum I ever owned !!!","review":"This is with no doubt the worst vaccum out there.

This vaccum need alot of improving!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Costly repairs","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner as it was advertised as beltless.. This was really neat as long as the warranty lasted.. Two months after my warranty( 1 year) expired, the brushes stopped spinning. I took it in for repair.. and the bill :-1)$70 for a gearbox ( the wonderful technology behind beltless)2)$40 for labor....Total without taxes :- $110.. Isn't that wonderful!!!So, in short, this is a great vacuum till it breaks down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Savvy is Junk","review":"I bought a Hoover Savvy U8163-900, this is the same model, just with different attachments. The purchase was based on several reviews claiming it was superior to belted vacuums because there was no belt to break and automatically shut the head off if entangled. I had no entanglements that I am aware of and the gears still stripped out in the beater bar assembly at just about 1 year after purchase. Cost to replace and repair the mechanism instead of a belt was almost $100. I junked it and bought another brand. This is the third Hoover I've owned and they were all junk. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe mine's faulty","review":"Maybe I should have mine adjusted. I came online to look again to see what people thought of this vacuum. I bought it from Amazon (no complaints there!) a few weeks ago. The darn thing won't pick up Cheerios, on either carpet or floor. It mashes raisins into the floor. I have a toddler (if that isn't obvious) and my old Hoover Windtunnel had no problem at all with any of those things. I miss the dirt indicator light but I'll probably get over that. I have wood floors and short pile area rugs. If the vacuum is on the lowest setting (which it should be) I can't move it. If I raise it up to the medium setting, it doesn't pick anything up. I hate it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most comprehensive study of domain modeling I've ever read","review":"This book is the bible of domain modeling.

The book discuss the practical aspects of OO techniques as they apply to real world applications. It goes beyond the \\"identify the words and nouns\\" approach of identifying objects and methods, into entities, value objects and aggregates. I also found the book to have a refreshing approach regarding XP methods, and the tight interdependence between modeling and design (and how each one feeds into the other in a closed loop)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"In my idea, it represents \\"The book\\" that each developer who wants approach Domain Driven Design methodology must have in his own books collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential, but oft Neglected Stuff","review":"Developing a language to enable communication between team memembers and with domain experts seems like an obvious thing to do. Most teams do not do this and start their application by solving technology problems. This book describes the utility of a domain-driven approach to building systems and shows you how to apply this approach effectively. This book makes excellent use of patterns to demonstrate how design, architecture and development practices such as continuous integration interact with each other to determine how good your application will be. Like all good patterns books, the information in this book seems obvious once you read it. But it is material most people overlook. Buy this books to understand the value of a domain driven approach, or if you already understand that, use it as a guide for teaching others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"If your process for writing an application is to start with the database, or to start designing UI, you should read this book.There is nothing new in this book -- but you really should read it.This book details the way many architects and analysts have been creating their applications for years, and for good reason.

The dvd burner did not work in either of them as well. Same problem in both. They should do a recal and give people their money back. Very poor for such a high rated company. I have a Sony FS now, and it gives kind of the same clicking sounds every few min. Never had this problem or noise with any other laptop besides sony.

The book states that there are campsites surrounding Lake Medano. Before you hike all the way up Mount Herard expecting to camp by the lake, those campsites have been closed down and no camping is allowed by the lake. There is one designated spot off the trail before it splits off towards the lake, and one or two other areas suitable for setting up a small camp. This was the only inaccuracy I came across, but it might be worth the time to call the rangers if there are any questions about current conditions.

Very nice camera, got the controls figured out, took about 100 photos. Really like the long optical zoom. At some magnification, the 740 has the impaoct of a >6Mpixel CCD because of the excellent lens.One HUGE problem just discovered though. The Camedia Master (and Pro option) software stinks! It looks like poorly done software from an asian source. Worst of all, the Olypus softrware cannot print to any networked printer. Every one of my other Windows applciations work just fine over the net. Olympus says, \\"Gee, were sorry\\" and that they have no plans to fix this major error.If you need to use this camera at the office or home with a printer that is not directly connected to your PC, pass on Olympus and look for another manufacturer! The problem is endemic to all Olympus cameras!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the Reviewers","review":"Thanks to all of you who have written reviews on this and other cameras listed on Amazon.

So after it arrives, I learn I cannot use it because it also requires an adapter ring. Great!So the adapter ring arrives and I connect the two to the camera. Well, the lens is so big it blocks the flash. I got the wide angle in the first place for indoor/portrait type photos, which often require a flash. It is just absolutely unbelievable that a major camera manufacturer is putting out garbage like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Sensitive","review":"I bought this camera for the incredible zoom function. But, after using it for a couple of months, I dropped it a distance of about 3 feet. After that the zoom no longer worked. So, I sent it to Olympus to be repaired and it was not covered under warranty. I am not careless with my camera, but I dropped it once like everybody probably has. The camera shouldn't break that easily.

The multiple modes were difficult to figure out on the fly. We also had many pictures that were blurry. We figured out that the blurs were caused by pressing the button to take the picture. So, we purchased a monopod, and set the camera to take three pictures at once. After that, the pictures turned out FANTASTIC!

The chrome handles are very nice, and the faux wood finish is much better than I'd anticipated.

By the time I was finished constructing it, the paint had already been chipped and scratched in many places and I was very careful while building it.

For example John Gilmore (Severed: The True Story of the \\"Black Dahlia\\" Murder, Laid Bare: A Memoir of Wrecked Lives and the Hollywood Death Trip) recalls getting into the sleazy paperback business with Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Ed Wood) as a mentor (as he also does in Laid Bare). A lot of great pulp writers (Donald Westlake, Lawrence Block) have books featured in this beautiful tome.

Each tale is unique, but share in common that the perspective of micro is in the eye of the beholder. Using advances in physics that make the previously mentioned movies seem dated; the anthology furbishes the audience with delightful tales that run the gamut from micro-creator to sentient atoms. Besides strong interesting tales, the key to the collection is that these tiny worlds seem real due to physical symmetry in their design, no mean feat for any contribution let alone a Baker's dozen. Fans of existing acceptable state of the science in their fiction will appreciate each contribution that not only provides effective insight into current theories and knowledge of inner space, but also does so within powerful tales that makes these realms seem so real.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a blessing time everytime I hear it!","review":"This choir has no bad songs.

I was surprise by the reading I got. Tap = 430ppm and filtered water = 35ppm. So, I order 10 more of these for friends and families. Then the truth of the product Quality and Accuracy was reveal. All of them read differently using the same tap water. Well, to make the story short. One of the testers was not reading at all while 2 of the testers read 750 and 830 which is way above the range of tap water. Now, I am confused are these reading are accurate to determine the purity of my water. The worst part is that I am unable to call their customer support. The voice message keep telling you that their customer representative is busy serving other customer and leave them a message. In conclusion I do not recommend this product to anyone from now on. If you need to test the purity of your water I recommend buying the tester that you can calibrate with a reference fluid which is much more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Only worked for about 3 months and accuracy was uncertain.

In fact, the Ripper case is just an afterthought.In the beginning things are murky due to flashbacks to an earlier shooting where some policemen were shot.There is also a side story of an affair between two of the detectives on the (Ripper) case.Also the tragedies that both the mistress and the wife have suffered, which are not even connected.Wish they would have stuck to main plot, it was just a little too scattered for me.What could have easily been a 4 or 5 star movie only gets a 2 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Chose this vid to see Paddy Considine's acting work.

Kerri is not ready to accept her mother's death, let alone her father moving on with his life. But, making a 'special' friend of her own, proves to be the best therapy. In a summer filled with adventures and some misadventures, Kerri also discovers life goes on. Kerri matures emotionally and realizes that sometimes death is not end, but a new beginning. Her faith, which she has always leaned on, is still there for her. I strongly recommend this book for all youth --- and parents, I think you also would enjoy the read. A strong, morally responsible book. Mrs. Patterson is to be commended for her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs help","review":"This controller worked fine for a few years with my 45 watt solar system.

I give it 4 stars because the packaging does seem a bit cheap, i.e.: the quality of the jar, and appearance of the cream.

The center of gravity is too far forward and when going over slightly uneven ground, like from pavement to a slightly raised grating or the slight ledge from street to a driveway, the front wheels stop and the stroller tips forward. The only reason it did not completely flip over, with our baby's head toward the ground, was that the rear axel beneath the handle bars smashed into my shins, both times, preventing the rear wheels from flying up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great for Me!","review":"I absolutely loved using this Snap 'n' Go and was sad when I had to stop using it. It was so easy to open and close and pop the infant carrier in and out of. I did have a Baby Trend carrier, but my sister had a Graco and still had success with her Snap 'n' Go. I used it for about 9 months until my son grew out of his infant carrier. In that time, I never had a problem with wheels falling off or my child tipping out or anything like that. We mostly kept it in the back of our trunk of our compact car (which it's nice that it's small enough to do that) and used our jogging stroller for walks, etc... but we did take this one on vacations (airplanes) so if something was going to break, I would think it would have.I highly recommend this one because of its price (we found a new one on Craigslist for about 20 bucks) but overall, I recommend ANY stroller frame as opposed to a travel system. It's light and small and can manuever anywhere. LOVE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't snap!!!","review":"Why on earth is this called a SNAP n' go when there is no snapping involved?! The car seat just sits in the frame à la shopping cart, with a flimsy belt to tie is down. The wheels can do some pretty rad moves, but I wouldn't do those moves with my baby in it! I'm returning it and buying a chicco one so my carrier snaps in properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way to secure - does not snap on frame, and awful strap.","review":"Surprisingly poor quality product given how many people have bought and reviewed it. It is easy to assemble, but does not do what it is supposed to do = securely hold an infant car seat. I tried to use it with a Chicco Keyfit 30, and neither of the two mechanisms that normally secure a car seat in a travel system work here!1) Like a prior reviewer noted, the seat does not \\"snap\\" into anything - it literally just sits on the frame. (Maybe because it is designed to accommodate a variety of car seats, it does not really fit any of them well...)2) The securing seat belt snap is such a flimsy poor quality material that after attaching it, you can easily loosen it just by tugging at it.Completely irresponsible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap n stop","review":"Car seat does not \\"snap\\" into device securely.

The straps that go over the top of the infant car seat to prevent the seat from flipping over are constantly getting stuck in between the folding rails/frames of this stroller. Additionally, the red stoppers on the bottom of the handlebars have to be turned out every time you want to fold the stroller up for storage or in when you want to place the car seat on the stroller. Why couldn't they design it so that the stroller can fold or unfold in just one or two simple steps? Not to mention the aforementioned straps that are constantly getting caught in between the frames when folding and unfolding this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with keyfit 30","review":"I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy. This makes my snap n go indispensable. It isn't the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light. One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn't compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller. If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn't endanger the integrity of the seat. I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint. It handles pretty well. It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infant Must Have","review":"Didn't want one of the big bulky travel systems so I'm glad I found the Baby Trend Single Snap N Go Stroller. I've heard some say it wasn't universal for their carriers so I thought I'd mention that it fits my Chicco KeyFit 30 perfectly.

It folds up in a snap and can fit in any trunk. It's so much lighter than most other strollers, is great for quick trips to the store and can easily be pushed with one hand. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is hard to push on bumpy, uneven ground and sand (but this can be said of a lot of strollers).This is the perfect alternative to a big, bulky travel system an it's a lot cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't Snap N' Go Stroller","review":"I bought the Baby Trend Snap N' Go stroller for my chicco keyfit 30 car seat and it does not snap in at all! I would not recommend these two products together. The only thing that holds the carseat into the stroller is a flimsy little strap and at a slight angle the car seat moves....thus no walking up any minor hills or on semi-bumpy roads without putting your baby at risk.I really liked the idea of having a less expensive stroller option for running errands around town and being able to get in and out of my car without having to transfer a sleeping baby into a stroller. However, if you bought the chicco keyfit 30 (a great car seat), then you should buy chicco's version of the snap n' go to make sure your baby is safe and secure, even if it is double the price. The quality of the stroller is double the value as well so you are getting what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will ruin your Chicco Keyfit 30!!!","review":"This product is NOT compatible with the Chicco Keyfit 30, as it is advertised!I went to have my car seat inspected, and the tech found two stress marks in the shell of my daughter's car seat.

The damage done to the car seat Is not merely cosmetic - it compromises the safety of the car seat.In all fairness, I double checked the instruction manual to make sure I had not used the product incorrectly. I hadn't. Now I have to buy a new car seat because of their false advertising!The car seat tech supervisor recommended I ask Baby Trend to pay for it.

With titles like \\"Respect\\", \\"Courage\\" and \\"Power\\", he puts into words (non-rhyming poetry) the feelings we experience in our jobs, in our relationships and in ourselves. Some have a religious tone and most relate to the Black (African American) experience. Poems like \\"Mending Depression and \\"Lonier Still\\" affect everyone.Aiken worships his women (four of his five children are female)and his family and these form the basis for many of the 46 one-page poems included here.A thoughtful first outing by the compassionate poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a first effort.","review":"I actually found this book on a plane, someone had left behind-probably purposely.

I do commend Aiken for the effort, although a lackluster one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prolific Poet? I don't get it.","review":"After reading some of the reviews on this site, I expected a wonderful read in this collection of poems. It just goes to show you you can't always trust reviews, especially on-line. I found the poems a bunch of mindless prattle. One of the previous reviewers claims that aiken knows women as demonstrated through his poems. From my own interpetation, it seems to me that either he's been married several times and/or is afraid of strong Black women. This book is just a bunch of chapters of \\"chatter\\" written to give the author something to publish so he can say that his book is in the library. My guess is that all of these previously terrific reviews of the book came from the author's parents.

It was a nice try, but a little more effort would've helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big embarassment to all Mariah fans.","review":"A true Mariah fan would never try to record any of her songs and try to sell as a tribute to her. This so called album is more like an embarassment than a tribute. Mariah derseves more respect than that. From us true Mariah fans who have respect we apologize for this so called tribute album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELL","review":"I think I am going to be sick. I don't think I have Heard anything more disgraceful in my life. I am a HUGE Mariah Carey fan. I thought this was going to be an album full of well known female singers that could actually SING! This album sounds like a skit on Saturday Night Live. IT WAS HORRIBLE, and I just listened to the first sound sample on the site! To make this short, I just have a few things left to say: Mariah would be appalled and embarrassed, if (which I hope she doesn't/hasn't)she ever heard this. This album is a disgrace, and should not have even been recorded. I hope this review helps any other Mariah Carey fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A DISGRACE","review":"THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.

I was looking into buying a tribute CD and now I can't really remember why. This one is not brilliant and not completly bad if you can't afford to buy the original artists work but then again most of us can. I'm glad I listened to the samples on this page because, if when recording Mariah's hits you can't even reach those notes which made her such a phenomenon in the early 90's, it's best not to try and leave it to those who can make the notes and a proper tribute to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah should be embarrased!","review":"They call this a tribute? Hah! It's more of an insult. Who in the *&%# is that singing on the album? Well, whoever it is that person couldn't even sing a Britney Spears song. I am extremely dissapointed.

Expecting a person to reach those notes would be expecting too much. Can't reach high notes? Fine. Don't have Mariah's astounding vocal flexibility? Fine. But I think some intense vocal sessions would come in handy. Actually, judging from the artificial quality of this singer's voice, we can conclude that the unnatural and synthesized sound is the product of too many singing lessons. I think this very poor performance is the peak of this singer's vocal prowess. Just comes to show that some people are born with talent, while others, no matter how much money they spend on vocal coaches, will never compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't nuthin' like the real thing!","review":"Since 1990, the music world has had the meaning of breaking records redefined by an artist that not only can write the hits, but sing them as well (okay that's an understatement; she sings them beyond astonishment). Sadly when the makers of her tribute album picked a vocalist to highlight Carey's hit, they had a big miss.The \\"Tribute To Mariah Carey\\" LP is nothing more than a sad attempt to capitalize on an artist who can belt out a tune like no other. No, I'm not mad at this album. I'm glad they wanted to tribute her, but why pick a unknown singer (the term singer is used loosely) who can't sing and who can't even hit Mariah's trademark notes (ie, \\"Emotions\\", the song where Mariah redefine high notes, the singer on this LP doesn't even come close to hitting this note).Let's hope the makers of this cd never have a tribute to Aretha Franklin, who will they pick, Britney Spears?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect gift for someone you hate","review":"I listened to the sample tracks earlier today, and couldn't believe that anything could be so horrible.To give an educated review, I decided to trek to the local used store, and see if they had it.

Go to Switched On CD's in Novi, MI and see for yourself.)So, I took it for a test drive in the store's CD player. Luckily, they had headphones, because I'd be embarassed beyond belief if anyone saw me listening to this.Beyond being a total assault to your ears, and a complete insult to anything Mariah Carey has done, this CD actually made me wish I was deaf.I'm quite certain that you could go to any junior high school, and pick a random girl out of the choir class, and STILL have a rough time coming up with something worse than this....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ridiculous","review":"Don't even dare to listen to the samples...

I dunno if this was a joke or if the person was serious while making this but I dont think they should have attempted to recreate her voice or her songs. It just doesn't work.

This is not a tribute to Mariah it seems to be a money making ploy to capitalize on an amazing artist like Mariah Carey.

Here we have a well written version of what I call \\"practical spirituality\\".

And the gospel (or good news) as told by Darel Rutherford is that we're not stuck with the original version of who we are, we get to choose again.

Brief, focused, but conversational in tone, it was very educational for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading, premise is flawed","review":"This book should really be titled \\"The Nine Questions Practicing Jews Want Non-Practicing Jews To Ask About Judaism\\". Instead, the title gives one the impression that this is a basic guide to Judaism for non-Jews. The authors cleverly draw you in with various commentaries before revealing their true goal: to bring non-practicing Jews back to religious practice. Everything they say to try and persuade \\"strayed\\" Jews to become religious hinges on the belief that the Torah is the Holy Word of God. If you believe that the Torah was written by humans and is historical fiction, these arguments won't sway you at all.

This book is not neutral about Judaism: it is written by two passionately religious Jews (Prager is religious, not Orthodox) who do an outstanding job at presenting a case for living Jewishly in today's world. Amazingly, The Nine Questions has a great deal to offer to Jews who are already deeply committed to Judaism, as well as to the tentative or skeptical Jewish or non-Jewish thinker who is interested at learning what Judaism has to offer to life in modernity. The writing is crystal-clear, and the book has a straightforward and honest tone which is very appealing.

It was also not very smooth in gear changes especially when it was cold out (slight grinding even if you waited after pushing in the clutch to change gears).Today I changed out the old stuff for this MT90 and all I can say is it made an INSTANT difference. The transmission is buttery smooth shifting in every gear and it was cold out today (12/31/2011). And that howl I assumed was normal and part of my 102K is completely gone.

The kid is 13 and I wanted something well written but still fun, that was a change from Harry Potter, Eragon, or anything closely linked to the whole teen sorcery genre. And this book does have some Chinese mythology in it, which he likes, so I thought that was a plus too.I did read this book myself, just to make sure it was a good story for a young guy without any *gasp! mushy stuff. I was pretty pleased. There is a lot of action from the very beginning, as well as a lot of humor. The characters are like sophisticated superheroes, and overall this is a really fun book (I think) for any teenish reader who likes action and adventure without mush ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"This is a great book.

With them, I manage to forget far fewer things when I shop at the grocery store (I'm sure I'll always forget something - with my faulty memory I can hide my own Easter eggs - but since the dawn of magnetic notepads, I don't have those moments where I go to the store just to get milk and come back everything but milk).When I found this notepad, I was pleased, because it is about 1/2\\" thick, which means lots of pages so I don't go through pads as often. Wrong. What it meant was that I used a few pages off the top and then the pad fell apart under its own weight. All of the pages fell to the floor in a clump, bound by their overtaxed adhesive binding, leaving the cardboard backing with the magnet sitting proudly and uselessly on my fridge.The pad is now on my kitchen counter and is just enough out of the way that I'm back to forgetting the milk again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to view great to learn","review":"This book is a must.

I'm an adult and I read books in this age group and genre a lot, and I worked for 10 years in a popular bookstore chain, specializing in intermediate and young adult books. I think I'm qualified to judge such books, and this one was just not worth my time. The writing is stilted and the characters are shallow. The plot isn't well developed at all! It looks long, like another reviewer pointed out, but it's really not due to big margins, big print, etc., but it takes forever to read, it's just slow going. The ending is disappointing, too. Choose something else to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"increidble fantasy!","review":"Losts of people say that the plot is slow, the translation is horrible, and even that they dislike that it's three stories in one: The story of three girls with enchanted stones, the story of the choosen one, and the story of a sick girl in Paris. For me, this is what makes the book interesting! I think it's increidble that this girl wrote this book when she was about my age. She is my idol, since I, too, am writing a novel at the moment. This book is creative and well-thought out. The three main characters, Jade, Amber, and Opal, each have one of the classic traits: Vain, shy, and outcast.

Flavia Bujor has an admirable talent for writing. I first picked up the book because of the catchy title. Then I looked at the back and saw that it was written by someone about my age and the book had an interesting plot. I bought the book and started reading it. Once I started, I couldn't put The Prophecy of the Stones down! It had a mix of a few settings, but all the stories were set out in a logical sequence, so eventually they all combined and explained why certain things were put in the story the way they were near the end. If you like suspenseful fantasy stories, this is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prophecy of the Stones","review":"The book is a great fantasy book. It was really hard to put it down because you wanted to see how everything fitted together. I thought that the author was very creative by the way she put a twist on the classic battle between good and evil. The main story is told by a girl in a hospital dreaming it. Until the very end you really have no clue what the girl has to do with the story.You really start wondering what happens when the book tells you pieces of the girls future. The girls have a prophecy written about them, but you don't know how it will turn out or how it will happen.The book is definately one you will have trouble putting down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have we sunk this low?","review":"What if the author information had not been released, and no one knew it was written by a thirteen year old?

I started reading it and was captivated from the start. Some may like it and some will not, it just depends on the kind of reader you are. Me, I read a LOT.

Try Eragon, or Amulet of Samarkand, or the Golden Compass, or Artemis Fowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"I bought this book because I saw an interview on tv with the author. I thought it sounded like an interesting read. After reading this book, I have to admit that it's interesting maybe if you're younger than 15. Now, I know the author was only 13 when she wrote this book, but it does show. The dialog was lacking, too many events just \\"happened\\" with no real reason or point to them, it was slow reading, and the character descriptions were a very dry at times. All that being said, however, I have a feeling the her next book will be much better, because the potential to be an awesome writer is there, she just hasn't reached it yet. I recomend going to the library to check out the book instead of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a 15 year old","review":"Had to FORCE myself to read to the end of this one. The whole way through, I kept saying to myself, \\"it feels like this was written by a 15-year old\\". Then at the end of the book I found out I was right! Immature writing, way too much melodrama, love at first sight (not once, but TWICE), serious plot flaws, an unnecessary parallel plot, and poor proof-reading made me feel I had wasted my money on this one.At the same time, I wish the author well, and hope she will continue writing. Will be interested to see what she will do when she gets a bit older...and wiser..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice, or even a good choice","review":"This book was obviously written by a young teenager. The names and places in the story are somewhat original, but I can't help but notice the unoriginality of a few, such as \\"Fairytale,\\" \\"Rivenbell,\\" \\"The nameless one,\\" and \\"the outside.\\" The oddest thing is the creatures that go on strike against death. That is certainly out of the ordinary, I must say...I also had a hard time reading this book. I was constantly confused, leading to irritation and aggravation. When I read a book, I hope to enjoy it. Causing a reader to shed a few tears here and there, laugh out loud, and smiling once in a while shows skill in a writer. Yet in Prophecy of the Stones, I did not do any of the above. If I were forced to recommend this book to any age group, I would recommend this book to children, because a child would not notice the many flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prophecy of the Trash","review":"I was incredibly dissapointed, for one thing. It's very hard for me to figure out why Bujor couldn't stand to have even one of the girls ugly. The plot about three people working together to save their world didn't improve much. Think to your cliches... A snobby rich girl, a sweet peasant, and a quiet bookworm- welcome to reality. Each step was predicted, and Joa didn't contribute at all. I didn't know why she was there in the first place since she apparently has no relevance to the main plot. Yes, we all had those fairy tale dreams. And yes, they're perfect little children movies and shows. But NO, they are NOT that appealing to my taste. I doesn't actually matter that the poor girl is a teen, but the writing itself. If the book wasn't as boringly predictable, THEN I would be impressed. Even if I am younger than her, I learn from others mistakes. So, an easy bet to whoever can beat Bujor's writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book","review":"The gist of the story is interesting. But it's rather slow going, and shall I say... unrealistic? There's hardly any detail or depth, characters do a lot of things out of the blue, they give out information too easily, they trust too easily.The story strikes me as something similar to a fairytale; plot holes everywhere, the main characters are so pretty and wonderful. It's sort of even written like a fairytale (not quite though)The writing isn't that great. In one sentence, the word \\"she\\" was used 5 times.But as I said, the gist of the story *IS* rather interesting. Bujor has interesting story ideas. If she could improve her writing quality and realism of characters, she could be a good writer.I'm also a teen writer, and I congradulate Bujor for finishing a novel. That's a big accomplishment--even if the writing isn't great. Go teen writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Prophecy","review":"I couldn't bear to read more than seven chapters of this book. I know it was written by a thirteen year old, but it reads as if the editor didn't actually check it for flaws. One problem I had was that even though the three girls are in what seems like a medieval time period, one of them has a watch! I also couldn't feel any sympathy for one of the main characters. All in all, I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this book was realy bad. i wonnderd why til i saw it was writen by a kid only a litle bit oldr then me. it was girly. plus it kept on going bak to the chosen one and some grl in france. i dnt git the point of thet. dnt red it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm ...","review":"If I could, I'd give this book less than 1 star. Wow, wow. I'm am sickened to think that such an interesting storyline was wasted with such a terrible book. The dialogue is awful, character development is awful, dicriptions are awful, the plot changes whenever the author get's bored. Just, just ... ewww! I hate it. I bought it thinking, wow! this girl must be good for getting a book published at only 15! Ummm, no. Don't read this book, or if you do, definatly do not go out and waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"\\"The Prophecy of the Stones\\" is a fun read. It's not a particularly brillant book, but it's good. It kept me interested, and I wanted to keep reading it. The dialogue could have been better, and only one other think irked me. The characters. They were all so PRETTY. That annoyed me to no end. Who wanted to read about 'Mary-sue's? But I got over it, and I loved reading it. The author shows potential, though I don't think this will be her best work. I think it beats 'Eragon' by a long shot, and I think the author's next book will be better. I'd also like to add that if you're an adult, you may not like it much. It's more a cliche kind of kid book. But really, it's good. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this book sucks.","review":"Okay, try to imagine a book with sappy endings, a shaky story line, a dumb plot, and next to lifeless charactors with almost no personality. Then imagine an even worse book than that, and you're basically imagining this book. While reading this, I had to supress the need to fall asleep and/or throw the book at a wall. It was that horrible. I think this is possibly the worst book I've ever, ever read. I mean really, they made Death sound like a sissy wuss, and the prologue was reeeeeeeeallydumb. I had to burn my copy of this book. I so don't recommend \\"Prophecy of the Stones\\". Please save yourself of this horror and DO NOT even touch it. I'm afraid yo could break out into boils just by looking at this horrible excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Needed Editing Before Getting Published","review":"This story has a pretty original plot, and some interesting ideas, and may be worth a read on the basis of that alone. I think it would have been valuable to the reader to include some additional background information, as it would have helped the reader understand why we cared about the outcome of the book... I know, I know, good versus evil, obviously you want good to win, but I would have liked a little more than that.I did not realize that this book was written by a teenager when I read it, however, I don't think that that completely excuses whoever decided to publish it for the boring and simplistic writing. Perhaps the awkward sentence construction was due to the translator, but that should not have been excused either. There are some very awkward moments in the character development as well. All of this would have been improved by a more stringent editing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read.","review":"The first time I looked at the cover of \\"The Prophecy of the Stones,\\" and then stared at the title, I thought it was going to be boring, and despaired when my mother caught me looking at it, thought I liked it, and then bought it for me. I read the first five or six chapters that first night, and then I instantly became hooked. Like \\"Eragon,\\" \\"The Prophecy of the Stones\\" was written by a teenager! I'm surprised that many authors now are still in school, or have just graduated! The book - which I just recently finished - has a great tale of fantasy and the wording of it was incredible, I couldn't help myself and then reread it again for the second time - it's that great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read!","review":"After having finished Eragon I felt inspired to read works by other young authors, big mistake! Bujor was thirteen when she wrote this book and it really shows. Her story of three girls and their quest to find their destiny is shallow and at times trite. Her characters are one demensional and make snap decisions about their fates and that of the people around them without much thought. The reader is often left wondering what drives the heroines and is often left disappointed. This work is insipid at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"Well, i agree with the other reviewers who thought that the author had a great idea, but not so great writing. Although she surely is a better writer than me and i give her props for finishing a book, i think it could have been better. A few times i had to reread a section because i was confused. Especially that whole Joa thing. I sort of understand, but she could have made it more clear. It's basically a cross between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Actually, a lot like LOTR. A King Theodon was even mentioned in the book. The names, odd creatures, places were LOTR-sounding. Does anyone else agree? And the whole getting-together-to-fight-evil-creatures-so-the-world-is-not-destroyed idea. Don't get me wrong, this book is pretty good, it's in my top 30.

True, this is a completed publication by a teen, but I can tell the book was written by a teen. The writing style is immature, and the story does not flow. I wish I read French so that I could see how this translation compares. This is NOT a good book for adult readers. I had a hard time finishing it. However, my pre-teen Godchild enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Warning: this will be a very short review, because there really isn't much to say about this book.In short, the plot has plenty of potential, but Flavia never takes it anywhere. As previous reviewers have noted, there are too many plot holes. It seems that Flavia wanted to write a \\"deep\\", symbolic novel, but as she probably didn't know much about symbolism, being only 13, she didn't succeed. To her credit, she is a tolerablely talented writer. But this book still did not deserve to be published. Read this for a few laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book in the world","review":"I thought this was the BEST book I've have ever read and the peoole who didn't like it are crazy!!!A book by a 14 year old was better then alot of books by aduts!!!!!!!I felt like I was really there, it was amazing!!!!!I think that everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"This book has some interesting surprises.The characters are totally diffrent than each other.Opal,is a commoner that is emotionless.Jade,is a snobby noble.Amber,is a dreamy peasant.I like how this novel switches off between the girls and a real world sick girl named Joa.I would NOT give it 5 stars only because the characters are a little stereotypical.

The story was original, the characters where well thought out, though a little stereotipical. The story seemed to flow, and kept a good pace. The world of Fairytale was good, with lots of imagination going into the landscaping and the inhabitants. The story of our three main girls, Jade, Amber and Opal, ties in with a story of a girl in present day Paris, who is dying, though it is never explained from what. These parts of the book are the most confusing, and are hard to keep up with. This all ties in to a very satisfing ending, which seems to make sence of all that has happened, and really makes you wonder. All in all, a great book, one of the best I have read in the genra.

Line breaks and stanzaic patterns had completely lost touch with meaning and content. After these poems, the collection improves, at least marginally. Every now and then a rhymed or off-rhymed piece appears, and many poems use either a loose pentameter or a free verse line of which, as Theodore Roethke would say, one can see the ghost of formal verse lurking behind it. Pinsky uses assonance and consonance to enrich his lines; concrete imagery and language are plentiful, which will please readers who look for this feature first and foremost; but few lines herein are really memorable. Still, I would single out poems like \\"Shirt,\\" \\"Icicles,\\" and \\"From the Childhood of Jesus\\" as noteworthy ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic, pompous, pretentious","review":"Pinsky's poetry is, alas, too much like his public persona: [see summary line]. When reading his poems, one feels lectured to, condescended to. As if poetry were solely about the display of \\"knowledge.\\" But Pinsky's poetry does not pass the first test of good writing: to be interesting. His lame use of forms does nothing for his poems, and his continuous reliance on identifiable subject matter makes for tedious verse.Those who admire the discursive style in poetry might like Pinsky's essays in verse (for these ultimately are not poems but essays). Those looking for more friction and frisson within and between the lines should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mask defective?","review":"Let me start off by saying this is the second mask of this kind I have purchased, so I know how it is supposed to look. The mask i received had the correct face, yes, but the hair was not attached properly I guess, and the look of the whole mask was ruined. The eyebrows were supposed to be big and bushy, as pictured, but they were instead flat and seperated into two lines, making it look like he had two eyebrows over each eye. Also, the hair on one side hung straight down, and the hair on the other side shot straight up. Clearly, there is an issue with how the mask is being produced that is causing some errors in workmanship. I don't know if this particular company is to blame, but I would want to see the mask in person, before I bought it if I were to do so again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not without issue.","review":"I got this as a joke for my husband who once casually mentioned that he liked bats.

I'm a novice gardener, and this year will be planting my first vegetable garden, so I wanted to have as much information as possible. This book has been great. The only thing I don't like about it: because the author lives in England, that climate is how he calculates his \\"when to plant\\" timeline. It's easy enough to ignore, and I was able to find information online about my area. Also, because he's English, some of the names of plants are different (like \\"marrow\\" an \\"courgette\\" instead of \\"squash\\" and \\"zucchini\\", and \\"capsicum\\" instead of \\"peppers\\") - so as long as you're willing to do a little bit of research past the book, it was a good resource!

His killer beats and hot lines come together to make awesome songs!Plus, he has great collaborations on this album including, 112, Kelly Rowland, Lil Mo', Busta Rhymes, etc.This cd is for everyone! It's filled with hip/hop (freestyle), R&B, club songs and killer beats. So whether you like rap or not it's a great cd!My favourite songs on the album are \\"Focus\\" (a definite club banger), \\"She Wanna Know\\" (a slower R&B/rap song) and \\"U Ain't Gotta Go Home\\" (pure rap/freestyle).So I highly recommend this cd! Even if you're not a huge fan of rap or you never really gave rap a chance. This is a cd for everyone!

I'll tell you right now, there are 3 and a half good songs on this cd-the Just Blaze produced \\"Pump It Up\\", the Lofey produced \\"10 mins.\\", and the White Boy produced \\"Focus\\". Stay WAY away from this album, cause Budden's producer White Boy does 95% of the tracks, and does a BAD job with all except one. He is one of the worst producers around, and unless he's under an alias or somethin' right now, it's no wonder why he hasn't produced another track.

I've been hearing JB for the past two years on mix tapes and I liked the single \\"Pump it Up.\\" But this record is just not very good. In fact, I can't really think of one good reason why you should go buy this record. The beats are overproduced and under-whelming and while JB's lyrics are not terrible but they are not really exceptional either.. JB has this nasal drone and very little elasticity in his voice and while JB's definitely got his own style it's just not all that inspired or inspiring. Just listen to one track, any track, with the exception maybe of \\"Take a Walk With Me\\", and that's what you are going to hear, that same nasal mumble. Def Jam made a mistake doing big cash promotion for this record. The money should have been spent on Keith Murray.

Tracks like \\"focus\\" \\"pump it up\\" \\"fire\\" are strictly for the clubs. He's bringing you the best work right now. Hot club songs, real/pain music. Summer bangers... whoa! \\"Ma Ma Ma\\" and \\"She Wanna Know\\" are off the chain! Can't forget \\"#1\\" where he brung it back to the good ol' days. The kid is only 22 and been thru so much.

Who you ask? 50 cent of course. He dissed the whole g-unit camp including ex-member game and he destroyed. But whatelse would you expect. So for everyone who thinks that Budden's rhymes are weak because he didn't sell millions and millions of records. I challenge you to buy his new cd which is in stores soon.

There are only four tight songs on this album Pump It Up, Focus, Fire feat. Busta, and Give Me Reason. All the rest is garbage I'd rather burn this ... from a friend for 3 bucks.

And Joe occasionally spits some seriously wack lyrics (\\"Things are complicated like Avril Lavigne said it be\\" ...yikes).

There are also amazing guest spots on the CD from 112, Lil' Mo and Busta Rhymes. The track with 112, \\"Ma Ma Ma\\" has an awesome R&B vibe to it.

Although listed under a horror genre it doesn't come across like a typical horror/slasher flick, this movie has a more ghostly/thriller feel and there's an actual story behind it and not a bunch of teenagers being chased by chainsaws. A few bloody scenes but it is not scary. Took a little while to figure out for sure what was going on but towards the end it all starts to come together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural thriller with some bends & twists","review":"The story moves along nicely and does a great job of building suspense as the movie progresses.

There are numerous variations of trim possibilities within these pages. But the best thing for me was the pages of molding profiles showing the various types and styles of molding available. Not all of it is available in my market, but it gave me ideas for molding I could make using my tools. Overall a really good book - I keep it by my bedside and go through it regularly just to create new ideas for trimwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5-star idea book","review":"This is definitely a \\"big picture\\" idea book. Lots of pictures to give you ideas about how you can use trim, as well as some design tips and discussions of using trim, the use of colors and such. My only real complaint is that I wish there were more closeups so I could see more detail on the trim used in some of the rooms.It's not at all a guide for installing trim, which makes the brief chapter covering the tools used to install trim seem a bit out of place.

There isn't cushion on the side of the bottom. I regretted to buy this at this point because the side cushion is the reason I chose it.Assembling was crazily hard. You should prepare a hammer before assembling for two reasons.(1) Some holes are too tight and slightly misaligned. You have to hammer screws to insert them into these holes.(2) The upper brace cannot be tightened with side pillars because brackets which are welded on the upper brace prevent from proper alignment. You have to hammer and bend the bracket for proper alignment.These issues might be due to the piece-to-piece variation of this product. I believe the variation is beyond acceptable level.So, my conclusion is that, I don't recommend this for you unless you have no option other than this for religious or medical reason, or you are an enthusiastic and expert assembler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative but not stuffy","review":"Skin. The organ you probably take the most for granted. It seems extremely simple, but as Nina G. Jablonski shows us in this book, 'Skin: A Natural History', it is extremely complex. I chose this book for my alternate reading assignment in my Biological Anthropology class this past semester, and it's fascinating. She goes over, of course, the \\"basics\\" that most (if not all) of us know from our introductory biology courses in high school or college, but she takes it a little more in depth as well. ...For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (though subjective) review of the subject","review":"I work a lot with skin and though this book might be a good review of the subject without too much \\"crazy biology\\".This book does exactly that.

We read this book for my Anthropology 101 class for these reasons (and also because it was written by a BMC alum). Jablonski's research is sound and her credentials are superb; however, the book is never above its reader's head. While topics such as the function of melanocytes and the effects of UV radiation on folates and calcium absorption may sound impossibly abstract, they are explained expertly and easily in this work. In addition to the biology of skin, this \\"natural history\\" also examines skin's function, skin diseases, decorations of the skin, and the future of medicine for skin. Throughout, the book is fascinating and well-written. It was one assigned reading that I couldn't put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"It is shameful that this is even sold on Amazon. This copy is NOT the real Oblomov!

The screwdriver no longer comes with the useful blue handle, instead it comes with a perfectly rounded black handle which makes absolutely no sense at all. How are you supposed to even use this thing? They have to be joking. I'd return it, but honestly, it's more trouble than it's worth at this point.

There was around 4 inches of space on my Technics, and my 10 inch mixer had around an inch of moving space. The picture showed a perfect fit for my technics, IDENTICAL to the ones in the picture.

It touches on other areas but really isn't suitable to the beginning welder, sheetmetal worker, or tool and die hobbiest. It would be best for the person who wants to make historic replica items from a forge who one who wishes to supplement historical replica woodworking with some basic metal work in brass or iron/steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for learning","review":"This book covers the basics of blacksmithing that appears to allow a beginner to learn the beginnings of smithing and work his/her way up to more complicated/difficult projects. Haven't had the chance to apply my reading to physical projects yet but they appear to take you from simple and build on what you learn to the next lesson of a slightly more difficult project. It is best to read and reread the beginning chapters so that the teminology is understood and read through the projects before starting so that can understand what the steps for the given project. As with other books on blacksmithing, some things need to be read a couple of times to understand if you have never hit hot iron or have watched and listened to a smith working just because there are some things that are almost impossible to explain without some idea of the basic process of smithing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Reading","review":"I joined my two teenage sons couple of months ago in Aikido and find it fasinating.

After about two months I noticed a surprising amount of wear on the bottoms of the weight pockets, and a month later, the velcro strips started tearing off.Overall, the quality of the materials is extremely low and I expect the weights to be completely unusable within another month or two. Very surprising given the reputation of Everlast (truly a misnomer in this case.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everlast? alas \\"No\\"","review":"I bought these about 10 months ago and thought initially that they were well made and comfortable. However, like 2 of the previous reviewers, I have had a similar problem of wear and the weights falling out of the bottom, much to the amusement of other members of the excercise class. This is due to friction at the end of the metal weights that are sharp and cut the fragile material. Maybe it would be possible to reduce the wear by wrapping the end of the weights in masking tape. It is a shame that Everlast do not have website where we could feedback as these have not been well designed and they need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Design, But The Quality Of The Materials Are Terrible!","review":"Within two days I started getting holes where the bottom of the weights are. This really surprises me because Everlast is the reason I bought the product, boxer's use their products, yes?I had a pair of TKO's for six yrs before they started showing wear, however the design of the Everlast is better than the TKO ankle weights. Everlast should reevaluate the material used to make this product, and use a much stronger one that will last customers longer than 2 days.I could go the warranty route however, they will send me another pair that will do the same exact thing, and I'm not paying for shipping 10 pound weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Weighty Issue","review":"I bought these to help rehab from a torn quad muscle.

There is a maximum of 5 pounds per ankle pouch. I was really hoping for the ability to get 10 pounds in one pouch, but that was easily mitigated.They worked really well for what I was using them for.

My worries was unfounded.The delivery was on time and to the right address.Have taken about 300 pics and I love the camera! I am a real amateur and found it easy to set up and operate. The biggest bonus is that I can play with different settings without having to pay to see the results.This camera is crammed with features. The one I like most is the panoramic picture feature: you set it up and take up to 10 pics, stitch them together using the supplied software and bingo, a 360 degree picture.The only feature that still trips me up is the auto focus in bad light. Gotta take your time and keep the camera really still.I would advise investing in 128MB extra memory - it allows about 30 pics at full resolution and about 400 at 1024 x 768."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow autofocus - not great for movement","review":"I got this camera because of the 10X optical zoom and the good reviews. I have two kids under 4 years old and I knew digital cameras would have trouble with them b/c of their (the cameras, that is) slow shutter time relative to film SLRs, and based on what I'd seen using other people's digital cameras. But I got the C-750 anyway. I sent it back after a week. The autofocus was unbearably slow, even when set in 'sports' mode, with or without flash. The pictures were often either blurry or I missed the moment because of the slow speed of the camera. A digital camera review web site I read ranked the C-750 as 'slower than average', and I would say that was also my impression comparing it to relatives/friends cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor customer service.","review":"I think the quality of the pictures were great if they were taken outside. I was a little disappointed by the customer service that I received. We paid about $500 for this camera about two years ago and the battery casing broke on it. The tension of the batteries broke a little plastic piece on the battery door. I thought that this would be replaced with no cost, but they charged me $130 to fix this cheap plastic piece. They obviously had problems with this before because it was a totally different reenforced piece of plastic. I thought that Olympus would stand by their product and fix this for free. This piece broke after having the camera for about 6 months and it was always in its camera case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked very well over years of use.","review":"Borrowed one of these subcompact digital cameras from a family member from time to time.

Durable -has lasted more than 5 years including camping & hiking. Performs okay at kids sports events. Best results with subjects between 5 and 25 feet, & for super macro closeups. Not digital SLR quality, but close enough for my purposes. Light enough to carry on strap across shoulder with camera resting in jacket pocket, protected but ready to go.
