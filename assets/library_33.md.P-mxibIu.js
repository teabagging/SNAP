It's light, crispy, holds up well under heavier toppings such as vegetables, and is low calorie. However, I found this product to be too salty, even for a confirmed salt lover such as myself. The salty-garlic flavor can overwhelm many toppings, especially those already containing salt. A fresh, sliced tomato with herbs, no salt, is fine...adding a little salted hard cheese such as Parmesan decimates the flavor of the cheese. I ordered a subscription because the price was fantastic, but I'll be cancelling it and replacing it with another Kavli crispbread product."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the ADJ o-clamp instead","review":"get the o-clamp from ADJ, you wont regret it. the o-clamp will not scrach up you tripod or truss and will be more secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has something for everyone!","review":"This book has a variety of afghan patterns for every skill level. This book is a special part of my collection because I used a pattern from this book called \\"White Lace\\" to crochet a very special afghan for my little girl. I didn't crochet it in white though since my favorite color is purple. I crocheted it in a very unusual purple yarn that I received as a gift from a dear friend (which made it even more special). I also love the pattern called \\"Lacy Shells\\". It is a great pattern for the beginning crocheter since the entire pattern only has 3 rows and row 3 is repeated until desired length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Book!","review":"I had this book years ago when it first came out and used it a lot. I lost my copy so I reordered it again. This has always been my go-to book when it comes to making afghans. The patterns and instructions are easy to follow and fast to make. It even has a section on how to crochet the stitches so you want be left wondering what to do. If you are on the fence about getting this book, I would tell you to go ahead and try it. I think it is one of the best afghan books out there. If you like to crochet this is a must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty afghans","review":"This book uses some of the bulkier yarns and the use of double strand yarns for many projects. I find that the bulkier yarns are a bit on the pricey side and tend to stick to the yarns that I can double up. They do work up quicker than a traditional single strand. One of my favorite afghans is the peach and cream MAM one.

The 30-page appendix on math learning resources covers texts and workbooks, math software, preparation for math contests and standardized tests, summer camps and distance learning programs, advanced summer math and science programs, and other topics.This is a good book both for parents who struggle in math and for parents of children who are gifted and are looking to accelerate their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Read This and Gave it To a PARENT","review":"I am not a parent, but my 6 brothers have plenty of kids, and their kids now have kids.

I have other Pogue CDs that are really enjoyable and I like some of the songs on this album, but c'mon. The tunes aren't that memorable and the best songs ('A man you don't meet every day', 'Navigator') are too few.I really like the Pogues. Songs like 'Sunny Side of the Street' and 'If I Should Fall From Grace of God' are great! I'm a big fan of 'Irish Bar Music' but this album just didn't cut if for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airbags not included: You must take this ride","review":"The disk opens with a warning. A few lines of traditional Irish ballad worries seem to promise a nice bit of clomping about, but then \\"The Sickbed of Cuchulain\\" launches into a hell for leather death march through every drunkard's bacchanal ever. If, by the end of the song, you're not drunk or reaching for a bottle, you're a Puritan or deaf. However, \\"Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash,\\" thanks to Declan McManus's production, is an *album,* not a song or two.This disk functions as a whole entity. We have all the major themes of life represented, as well as updatings of all the traditional ballad themes. From the man of adventure to the expatriot's return to the defeated love, the record moves through phases of life, changing tempo and going from laughter to sentiment and back. \\"If I Should Fall from Grace,\\" the next album The Pogues put out, is fine, but \\"Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash\\" is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a canny gun man","review":"Some music returns to you in the most unusual ways. I first heard the Pogues in college in 1985 and played this record, yes record, on my radio show 91.3 FM WKNH. While grieving for the loss of my closest friend from those days, I began a journey of reminiscing of those days, which included listening to bands....The Pogues, Jesus and Mary Chain, Jellyfish, The Posies, Thin Lizzy, Mott the Hoople, and The Clash.... we so often listened to and talked about with such passion. So, now, Dirty Old Town is playing and Shane's tales of death, drink, and dispairare as poignant as ever. Great music is great in any era. Its evident that these songs came from a man struggling, partying, living, and dying in the moment. Great artists are like that. They feel something visceral and are able to capture it in some form. BUY THIS MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pogues' jolly roger","review":"The most outrageous Irish band at their best. Mixing bucaneers atmospheres with traditional folk ballads it will get you into the realm of the pirates saga. No way you can define simply rock,punk,folk or whatsoever this stuff. Pure genious blended from Shane & Co into shining tracks as 'Sick bed of Cuchlainn', 'Sally Mac Lennane', 'Dirty old town', 'I'm a man you don't meet every day'...So just get a Cuba Libre, get this Cd and 'take the road for God knows in the morning'."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful music","review":"So I actually intially stole this cassette on a whim as a teenager, oh, 13 years ago because I heard it was good music. My friends and I put in the stereo as we drove away and laughed our butts off. I kept listening, though, and eventually bought all The Pogues' stuff legitimately (and eventually paid my dues for my corrupt ways.) When in college, the tape warped and I had to shell out the import price for this cd. I have never regretted it.

The Celts were some of the original people to form a \\"punk\\" style attitude. they scared away the Romans, The Vikings, The Saxons The English, Blah, blah Lets just say if you enjoy a good time and need something to boost your evening/morning buy this album- then buy \\"If I should Fall From Grace From God\\" (Less Pirate) Then Buy \\"Red Roses For Me\\" (Moderate Pirate)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I must admit to being a little put off when I first gave a listen to Rum Sodomy as I was expecting something more along the lines of the Dropkick Murhpys than traditional celtic sound.

Every song is great, except for their cover of Eric Bogles' \\"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\\", which is bloody disgraceful. They must have felt they had to have a go at it, as it is one of the most often covered modern folk songs ever written (along with \\"Dirty Old Town\\", which is also done on \\"Rum, Sodomy and the Lash\\", and much more competently). The Bushrangers version of \\"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\\" is a much more sympathetic version.Anyway, apart from the above, this is a damn fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buyers should know...","review":"If you're considering updating your collection with this version of the album, the remastering is excellent but the version of \\"Rainy Night In Soho\\" is not the original Poguetry In Motion EP version, but the inferior 1991 remix."},{"rating":"2","title":"pe rod color match","review":"This material was a fair but not exact color match for the yellow product (a rotomolded hdpe kayak hull) I was trying to repair, but I decided to use it anyway.

To give credit where credit is due I'd have to mention the background animation was stunning. I enjoy massive gore in a zombie flick as much as the next horror fanatic but the humor and fan service totally tipped the scales and I personally lost interest mid-series. I appreciate that an anime zombie series was created, unfortunately it totally failed to keep me invested in the story or its characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change","review":"I have to say, aside from all the panty shots and ridiculous boob bouncing (sound effects included) this anime was amazing. The action and animation is superb and the story is very convincing. I thought the girls in the bathroom scene was hilarious and i have found alot of the crude humor to be very lightening. Now i will admit some of this is so ridiculous, like a bullet doing the matrix between a pair of boobs but i think this anime is a great change. Only problem with this collection is that the OVA is not included in it. I reccomend this whole heartedly however i think this is an anime you save up for and not make an impulse buy. I mena it is $40 for 12 episodes. Kinda close to, too expensive but it's worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School of the Dead: Complete Collection [Blu-Ray]","review":"High School of the Dead: Complete Collection [Blu-Ray]First saw this show online and loved it.

It felt like the characters had more super powers then anything and it just seemed so fake. I was thinking the show was about trying to fight zombies and stay alive but when you give the characters the powers they have, well I had trouble adjusting to it, it just put me off. I'm not putting any more time into this review, I just want to add my two cents that I was psyched for a zombie anime and this turned me off. Others may enjoy it but I could not get into it. Be warned if your a fan of zombies like I am! This series should've stayed dead LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Trash. It is amazing how many people gave this anime a high review. It's trashy fanservice. The whole show is a setup for it. It is everything wrong with shows in Japan- more and more crap like this is coming out and because people like those who gave this a 4 or 5 stars keep giving it, well, 4 or 5 stars. If you want to watch naked boobs, big boobs, panties, there are a lot of websites out there you can jack it to. For god sakes, if you want toons with boobs and hot girls, Japan makes that too, it's called hentai. Leave porn to porn and tv shows to tv shows. Nothing against a little fanservice as long as the show doesn't go out of its way for it. This though, is ridiculous. Its entire plot is based around fanservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, all i can say is this wont work in the US","review":"Sadly this product does not state anywhere that it works in any region, the only hints are that it has english dubbing. I figured id take the risk and buy it hoping it would work in the US. I didnt notice there were reviews i guess, so i didnt check to see if anyone said it didnt work in the states. But all i can say is what a waste of money, a blu ray that i cant watch on my PS3 that doesnt even state what region its for. On the back of the blu ray it states its for use in canada. Hopefully VLC media player still works with any region dvd like it did with the UK might boosh DVDs i got. If not youll need to download an older version of VLC media player to watch this if you dont live in canada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I really loved this.

The plot follows through for the most part, and given that they haven't make the further episodes to make use of the various plot details set up in the first season it has some hope for improvement. I gave it only 4 out of 5 because it was advertised as a comedy, but even viewed as a very low brow comedy it doesn't fill the bill. So if your into the teen jiggle shoot-em-up anime/manga you will probably like it, just don't expect to get any laughs out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Mature Anime","review":"This Anime is not for the fan who are not ready for Bloody, Violent, and Mature situation. I personally love this anime. There are a lot of sex related jokes that you will think go too far, But will be laughing so hard that you wouldn't care until after the fact. The dubbing company is fairly new and unheard of, But they did a really good job with this one. Only real complaint I had with there dubbing job was that they added a lot of not really needed swearing. If you are into Mature animes, you will love this one. If you aren't, I would recommend something more like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School of the Dead","review":"Fantastic.Love this series.

It's largely true\\".) To the short aphorism: \\"On every topographic map, / the fingerprints of God.\\"There are many explorations of aging that both of them share (\\"Getting older I'm much better at watching/ rain.

I'd always been interested in Asian culture & history, and I picked it up in a book store on a whim. It's well over a thousand pages in length, but once you get past the beginning, it's hard to put down. Over the years I've recommended it to many friends and almost all of them have enjoyed it.The novel can best be classified as historical fiction. In the story, European sailors are first starting to discover Japan. Throughout the story you get to know an English sailor who gradually becomes accepted in Japanese society. The story is filled with romance and action, while at the same time providing an overview of the Japanese samurai culture.If you've ever had an interest in Japanese culture, I strongly recommend this book. While the historical elements are fictional, the time period is accurately described and you can get an interesting feel for the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great 20th century novels","review":"This was the first Clavel novel that I ever read.

It's just that good.Clavel must have performed a mind-boggling amount of research to produce this work. It is full of details about life in 16th cenutry Japan. Culture, politics, sex, class distinctions, race relations, and more are all covered. As far as \\"historical novels\\" are concerned, this is probably the pinnacle of the genre.If you enjoy historical novels, are a history buff, enjoy Japanese culture, or just want to read a great book, you can't go wrong with this one.

My friend suggested the book because I was really into Japanese culture. It was an excellent book and I was very happy that I read it, although my grades did suffer a little. After reading the review of Stuart W. Mirsky, I realized I had to make a comment on his mistake. He claims that James Clavell had a few characters in his book using Judo and kicking, when they were not around in Japan in the 1600's. This is in fact not correct. In the book, the characters do not use Judo, they in fact use Jujitsu. It is evident when one character pushes on a pressure point against the main character, that it is not Judo but Jujitsu. Jujitsu is Judo, but with the use of pressure points included. Also, in order to recieve a black belt in Jujitsu, one must be adept at kicking. I highly suggest to Stuart W. Mirsky that he researches material before he goes talks about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payoff not worth the length","review":"Shogun was very entertaining up until about the last 100 pages, when it became apparent that there weren't enough pages left for the story to resolve in a satisfactory way. Plot lines that went on for hundreds of pages were either lost or resolved in a paragraph or two. The ending was terrible and anti-climatic. Overall, it was a fun read until the end but I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't like long books. It's just not worth the time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"This was advertised as Vol. 1 and 2. I only received Vol. 1.

I found that I could not put this book down, and i've read it again several times since then to pick up more of the details. The way Clavell was able to get into delve into Japanese culture so completely is amazing. It is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent interpretation of Japanese history","review":"Set at the end of the feudal period (c.1600), this novel is (very) loosely based on real events. Mr. Clavell's characterizations were true-to-life. The premise of the story is familiar to many through the TV mini-series. An English pilot guides a Dutch privateer to Japan in flight from the Spanish. Due to a variety of political pressures, religious and financial factors and mostly to his personal magnetism, courage, skill and luck the pilot (John Blackthorn) becomes a pawn and a personage. His patron, Toranaga,is Clavell's avatar of Ieyasu. Must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic novel","review":"Welcome to Japan, its a masterpiece of a story that takes you into the heart, the pride and culture of Old Japan, in a highly intriguing storyline, flanked by an exceedling engaging group of characters.The only weakness to this story, which is not a weakness, is the author, James Clavell isn't Japanese. Which fortunately doesn't take anything from the classic nature of this literary masterpiece, but it makes you wonder how an outsider would be able to craft one of the best works of the Old Japanese Empire in this present time.A western sailor enters ancient japan in a time of war, and is used as pawn to play the premature war of the minds of leader, seeking to rule an empire.It slow to build, but after the first 100 pages, you would thank the heavens for letting you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"Quite literally life changing.

So five stars for Shogun, but I would only give the Kindle version three stars, at most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes My Top 10 All-Time List","review":"This rates up with the best books I have ever read. The book looks imposing (more than 1200 pages) but once you start you will be about 500 pages into it before you know it.Super-rich in history with one of the most interesting characters, Anjin-san (Japanese for Mr. Pilot). Anjin-san is marooned in feudal Japan and makes a decision to change his Western thinking and fit in to the totally foreign but alluring Japanese society.He is drawn into a forbidden love with a Japanese noblewoman, while battling jealous Japanese nobles and fanatical Jesuits. He earns the trust of Lord Torenaga who is a wise tactician in the art of waging war and diplomacy. Can Anjin-san survive the constant perils he is put into and win the hand of the woman he loves? Trying to find the answers to these questions left me spellbound by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping Epic of Historic Japan","review":"This novel only covers a time span of about 2 years if you exclude brief flashbacks, but it is otherwise epic in its scope. There's many classic themes combined in this one giant book (over 1000 pages in 2 volumes). It starts with the \\"Fish out of water\\" theme, which can be taken almost literally in the case of the main protagonist, an English sailor most at home on the ocean who is stranded in Japan not long after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in the reign of Elizabeth I. While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the cultural descriptions, they are fascinating nonetheless. Also, if there's a book written in English that contains more ritual suicides, I'm not aware of it. It also touches on themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, racism, loyalty. I found it to be a page turner and a quick read in spite of its length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read","review":"All of Clavell's works are very good but this is the book that got me hooked. A must read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classic epics of popular historical fiction - with an emphasis on the word \\"epic\\"","review":"Shogun is larger than life, in every way imaginable. It is, first and foremost, a huge book (I read it for the first time as a teenager, and it is still one of the longest books I've ever read (at 1152 pages, it is only exceeded as a single volume novel by War and Peace, Cryptonomicon and...not much else, really). And the same thing applies to my experience reading the book at 14 and reading the book in my early 40s -- I could not put it down. There will be some who complain about the historical veracity, but there are few who would complain about the sheer entertainment value to be found in the pages of Shogun. The details are fascinating, the characters are compelling, and if this is not exactly the literary tour de force of a Gore Vidal or Robert Graves it is no less incredible an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shogun Review","review":"Best book i have ever read.

It's an amazing historical trip.."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. I was sad when I finished and could not pick up another book for 2 months. I had to let this one soak in and didn't want any new story to infringe. This is actually based loosely off of a true story of an Englishman who becomes friend to last true Shogun of Japan. Wiki the book. Just an amazing, amazing work. You could almost mistake the adventure as being your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape to Another Time and Place","review":"I just couldn't put this book down! James Clavell is a good story-teller and does an excellent job of introducing one to a different time and culture. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and when i wasn't reading it, I was thinking about what had happened and what might happen next. When I finished it, I was disappointed that Clavell had not made it longer. This book has it all: intrigue, romance, action, and drama. Clavell does an excellent job of developing the different characters. As the reader, one gets a chance to see this new world through the point of view of many of these different points characters. An excellent read! Don't let the length scare you away. When you get done you'll be glad it was the length it was. I know I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"ON THE TOP TEN LIST","review":"On the list of top-ten, this may be number one. Everyone should read this book. I'd advise it for those over 15, because some of the content is hard to understand, and there is a language transition. But it is a great story, and it really keeps one thinking and reading. It places you in the middle of Japan as you follow the soon-to-be-intermingled lives of dozens of characters. There is English piliot Blackthorne, who ends up on Japan's shore by mistake and ends up bending the situation to fit his own needs. There is the brilliant japanese genral, Lord Toranaga, who keeps all the characters under his thumb. There is Mariko-san, who unwittingly becomes tangled in a romantic plot of her own. There is the Father Alvito, who is working for the benefit of his church, and nothing will stand in his way... or so he thinks. As all these plots meet and unfold, readers will find themselves turning the pages to unravel the next battle, the nexy mystery, the next occurence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry in action.","review":"The characters, the relations between them are very beatiful described in this best seller. One can feel to be living in the medieval Japan, and feel like inside the history, taking part of the actions. A good related book, with very good script. It started me in the Japanese Language knowledge and I have read it 7 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely entertaining","review":"This book is spectacular. And so not to spoil anything, I will say that it's worth every cent. This book has many intricate plot lines and when you begin getting bored (there are scenes with rather dense dialogue at times) something new and exciting always pops up. Such as lots of talk and then \\"suddenly on the horizon there was a brilliant fire...\\" etc., etc.,This book is a great beach book and also it's longer than Les Miserables (which I have also read) this book is easy to fly through. I highly recommend it for ages 13+.Beware parents if you don't want your kids exposed to gore or sex too soon, but other than that, this book is definitely for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a literary masterpiece.","review":"What a beautifully complex novel James Clavell has woven.

Politics, sex, romance, drama and action are all crammed into this novel.It is tragic to learn Clavell has died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Colossal! Stupendous!","review":"This is the best novel of fiction I have ever read. I read a LOT. The people of Japan come to life, and the characters are totally unique. Blackthorne learns his role well, and the women... ah it makes you want to go to 16th century Japan to live. If you're a man, that is. I just bought this book on a whim, and now have bought all of Clavell's books. Buy this book. You will find the 1210 pages are much too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended historical saga... action, adventure, love, religion, politics, all seated in the exotic","review":"This is one of the few novels that I read and reread. The author does a great job painting the background and digging out the personality of all his characters, immersing the reader and making the story come alive. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few things to say","review":"I've noticed people have said most everything there is to say about this book. So, I'll just touch on a few key points.--This was a really, really good read that I will definitely be revisiting.--I never liked Japan before. I wouldn't say I'm a fanatic but I appreciate the culture now.--I love how lovingly he depicted ancient Japan.--His descriptions and characterization are spot on fantastic.--I truly must admit that I envy this man's ability to plot out a book. The levels of deception and honor and just the intricacies of every move are incredible.--Sometimes the by-the-book romance feels... abrupt. There were times of \\"pillowing\\" where I had to flip back and re-read because it happened REALLY suddenly.--The end is also a bit sudden/feels a bit rushed, which you automatically hate because, well, you're really invested in and love the book by that point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rip-snorter of a page turner","review":"Loved this book when I read it years ago, loved it again upon re-reading. I'd forgotten many of the details, so Clavell's rich tapestry of 18th Century Japan was a joy to read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Societal Clash","review":"I read this book approximately twenty years ago and it still is one of my favorite reads. The descriptiveness of the time period and the vast differences between the Japanese and Dutch societies. If you are a fan of history and a story line that moves swiftly This book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grand disappointment","review":"Before embarking on these 1100 torturous pages, be warned that though this may be an epic, is is certainly not a classic. The writing is very turgid and, what's worse, irritating as hell! I lost count how many times the word 'truculent' - obviously Clavell's favorite adjective - was used The direct translation of Blackthorne's broken Japanese is irritating and, as others have pointed out, just plain wrong. And please, scrap the one sentence description of every character we meet along the way....\\"he had three teeth and leathery skin\\"....\\"buck teeth and bulging eyes\\"....blah blah....believe me, it'll drive you nuts.Life's short and time is precious - don't waste it on this bloated monstrosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"bogged down with war politics","review":"I was riveted by the first third of this book but felt bogged down with war politics in the later parts of the book.

Alas, i was let down, it was more of a love storie than about battles. I didn't like the book very much. But im 13 and I may not have fully understood its signifigance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel...utter drivel","review":"I enjoyed this book, until I reached page 350, and realized that there were 800 pages to go and I knew exactly where the book would end up. I'm taking a class on the politics of Feudal Japan, and we discuss this book at length.Leaving Clavell's gross inaccuracies aside, we still have the fact that this is a rather poorly written work. One can tell that Clavell is trying to throw underlying themes and messages into the mix, but they're thinly veiled.If you're interested in good historical fiction, I urge you to invest your time into a better-written title, such as \\"Carter Beats the Devil.\\"Leave this one on the shelf, save the 8 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shogun the book is a waste...Shogun the TV Movie a gem","review":"I was first introduced to Shogun via the TV mini-series. It is a gem. Usually the book is even better than the media version. Not so. The book is full of cursing & trash talk. It is tedious in plot and story development. The only saving part of the book is the addendum page (yes, just 1) that \\"completes\\" the Shogun saga.Avoid the book, buy the DVD version of the story - interesting, entertaining, educational and well crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns the scriptures into rubber...","review":"After studying more I now agree with all the teachings about the Virgin in this book.I was brought up Protestant and taught nothing about Mary and how she is Mother of God and Bride.I didn't get it.Took me a few years now and I've switched from the 66 book Protestant bible to the 76 book orthodox/catholic bible and read the Catholic Catechism in its entirety finally.I had a lot of catching up to do.Excellent book.Theotokos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaimie Alexander Rocks","review":"It's hard to find a low budget horror film that's not a rip off of a bigger movie or a sequel. Hallowed Ground is neither. It's an original, well acted, movie with just the right amount of gore and plenty of scares. And what really makes this film cook is Jaimie Alexander's performance. There wasn't a moment in the film that felt false. Unlike most horror shows were the girls do a lot screaming and call it acting, Alexander is very believable. Don't worry, I'm not her manager or her boyfriend, I'm just a horror fan who's seen enough to know when something is really working and she totally kept me in the story. Cool deadly scarecrow and good scary music put this one high on my Halloween list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, but nothing new","review":"Hallowed Ground is one of those quasi-religious horror yarns that you've seen before in different iterations, meaning you're not getting anything new here, but then again, you probably already knew that. Jaimie Alexander (Rest Stop) stars as Liz, a girl on the run from her past that winds up in a small town, and learns that she well may be part of a prophecy involving the resurrection and rebirth of the town's demonic old preacher (a briefly seen, scenery-chewing Nick Chinlund). Taking many cues from Children of the Corn and its ilk, Hallowed Ground isn't anything terrible in the least, but as said before, it isn't anything you haven't seen before either. The acting isn't completely horrible (which is a nice change of pace), but the effects work is pretty bad in itself. Either way, you probably know what you're getting into with Hallowed Ground, so don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor (beautiful) me!","review":"An interesting thing happens when people write memoirs of terrible things that happened to them: readers are afraid to say anything bad about the books themselves, because it looks like they're being unsympathetic towards the tragedies described. I felt for Dani Shapiro when her father died, but without that incident, this reads like the work of a self-obsessed rich b*tch who epitomizes solopsism: nothing in the world matters to her but her own experience and what people think of her. It is very important, by the way, that you think she is beautiful, as she reminds you constantly throughout the book. That, to me, is the quality of someone who hasn't quite worked out her own problems--someone who is sadly aware of how she acts and says and what you think of her as a result--and someone who is probably not completely honest with you, dear reader, because the ugly parts of her--the ones for which you won't feel sorry for her--are most likely omitted."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what are you left with after reading this book.","review":"Another dysfunctional family accounting. Dani Shapiro is not that interesting of a person. All the lamenting and agonizing is boring. The last 20 pages are the only interesting and un-soap-opera part of the book.Memoirs are a ticklish and problematic art form. This book comes off more as journalism, both the reporting kind, and the narcissistic psychiatry kind.As a comparison, Kafka Was The Rage read as a good memoir and a work of art.In the spirit of art criticism though, keep on writing. Recognizing when one has done a boring work is part of evolvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, cry baby","review":"I read this in a women's lit class, I did not enjoy it at all. I found her to be a whiny, spoiled crybaby who refused to take any responsibility for her life and her decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading, it was hard to put it down!","review":"I heard excerpts of Dani's book on public radio. I caught the middle of the review and did not realize that it was an autobiography. When the interview concluded, I knew I had to get the book. It was great reading and unbelievably moving. This was a young woman caught up in a very destuctive relationship with an older, wealthy and very controlling man. I was embarrassed for Dani for her honesty and intimate details of her affair. Would recommend the book very highly. However, I bought another one of Dani's books (Picturing the Wreck) and was dissappointed. Maybe the next book I buy will be better reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"For once fiction might be better than the truth","review":"I picked up this book hoping to find out about some character development of an orthodox jewish woman, but found it to be rather superficial and meaningless.

But, what I got instead of a book is a pamphlet that essentially repeats what the author has been told. It reads poorly and when he does not have facts to make a statement about an individuals ethnic background he makes them Serbian or adds a \\"probably Serbian\\" to them. Good lord, this man writes more in the way of a rant than an educated view of a country. He doesn't see that the country does have a mixed population and that there are Albanians, Muslims and other groups living in the country and that they are not traitors. And what the hell does the title have to do with the book... ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ON THE INSIDE","review":"I watch movies to laugh, be scared, sometimes even enjoying the dark and twisted movies.

A real master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lace-work of words","review":"Labyrinth is like a lace-work of words. It's definitely surreal, and there are explosions of paragraphs that describe nothing so much as madness. It a story of a quest that isn't, a journey to a center that's not there. It's slightly insane and cyclical, but it's beautifully wrought. The plot is certainly secondary to the tale-telling, and the times that the book drops out of the narrator's head and dips into dialogue serve as resting points for your sensory-overloaded brain. At times, it can be a little bit hard to slog through the metaphors and find the meaning behind it, but it's rewarding in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is cut because.......","review":"The reason they cut these old movies is because if 3 people find something offensive, the studios do not want a frivilous law suit on their hands, so it's it's just easier to cut the film to appease the minority of people. Older movies were not politically correct, and as a result, out come the scissors and let's snip away! Yet today's movies try to offend everyone when it comes to sex and drugs, but that's o.k. because it appeals to the 15 year old movie goers.

Frankly I'm surprised they haven't updated it. I do have issue with the speaker phone software and conference call. There seems to be a bug in th esoftware that adjusts the volume too low with out any rational reason. This is particularly a problem when you're on two line conference call. The parties on either end sometimes have trouble hearing each ohter and then sound voume kicks in, then it fades.

Now I'm out of luck and searching for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1.5 years","review":"Do not buy this product. It will disappoint you. I bought the product 1.5 years ago and it is already not working. There are 2 phone lines on the product. When trying to use the first line it shorts out the phone line. My $35 phone works fine on the line and my Polycom can not get a dial tone. After a while the line just says \\"Please hang up and try your call again...\\". Even when this phone was new the speaker phone part was good, but others can not hear you. When I tried using the handset everyone would complain that they can not hear me on that either. Technical support at Polycom is terrible. They charge $35 just to talk to you after the first year. I wasted the $175 and am down to one line.I have had the phone for over 4 years now and the second line just stopped working. It is going to the garbage pile now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly-ass phone design","review":"This is one of the UGLIEST looking phones I have ever seen. Not only is it aesthetically unappealing, it is functional non-ergonomic. The display is not angled toward the user--the display is hard to see if the phone is at arms reach away.Poor design--for a phone that costs this much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not recommnd this product","review":"I cannot recommend this phone to anyone planning to use the speaker phone. This phone replaced an old 2 line Panasonic phone that died after 6 years. I work from my home office and bought this phone because of the success I had in a corporate environment with PolyCom products. This phone is a major disappointment. When using a headset, there is no headset sound for my voice. The speaker continually pops and hisses, often noticed by the person or group in the conversation. The speaker also \\"clips\\" my voice, again, often noticed by participants in the conversation. You must be directly over the microphone for your voice to be transmitted. When speaking from a short distance away from the phone, I've had participants ask if I was still there. I do not recommend this phone for home office use."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Stinko","review":"This phone simply stinks. I have had nothing but problems with it. Although the sound quality is fairly good (not great), I frequently encounter lock-ups, in which case I have to unplug the phone and reset it. Also, something has happended to the phone so that it now constnatly displays both phone lines as being in use, regardless of whether any line is acutally being used. I replaced it with a GE phone with better displays and which cost about $75.00 less. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"SoundPoint - DisaPoint","review":"Be wary of this phone. It's [pricey] and I have not been pleased with the audio quality of the speaker, mic, or the handset. It is an atractive phone, but in my opinion is does not represent the audio quality of other soundpoint products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this dog","review":"I bought this expecting it to be a great addition to my office. Six months later I have to dispose of it. It needs to be rebooted now almost every day for the speakerphone to work. It's a piece of crap. Sorry, there just isn't a better way to describe it. do not buy this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality for a Premium Price","review":"I bought this model of phone many years ago and was impressed enough to buy second one after the first one got old. I had problems with the second one pretty much from day one. Unfortunately, I blamed these multiple intermittent problems (poor sound quality, echoing, feedback, lights going on and off, etc) on our phone system. By the time I was able to determine the phone was the problem, the warranty had expired. Now I own a $300 paperweight.Like many premium brands, I suspect Polycom started to cut corners on quality control. Maybe I just bought a lemon, but the experience has moved me back to more affordable devices. My $80 RCA phone works 100% better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this phone a couple of years ago. The phone kept getting very hot so I returned it and the new one did the same thing. I also noticed that the sound quality was not as good as my old AT&T or Panasonic land line phones. After about a year of using it, I started hearing a lot of static on the line. Of course, it was out of warranty and they would not help me. I could have gotten it fixed but it was cheaper to buy a new phone. I noticed that the price has really gone down for this phone.. I wonder why? Hmmmm could it be a quality problem? Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent phone!","review":"Needed a new home office phone. The speaker on my ATT 993 failed. I thought I would give the Polycom brand a try since it is something I see in every conference room I go to at every company I visit. I have not been disappointed. Programming is fine, no better or worse than any other phone. A great 2 line phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The speaker quality is not what one would expect on a $180 phone, there is always a bit of a buzz on the speaker. And the other reviewers are right the hand set is not comfortable and the ever present buzz when you use it gets really worse if your hand touches the Handset cord. I work from home and sound quality is key. I've used the more expensive Polycom phones at the office and they work great. This one is not worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted money - lasted only a year","review":"Sound quality is awesome - that's why I bought it (after trying out one that somebody else had). But after a year it suddenly developed a loud hum that is always audible to both calling parties during calls - so now it is not useable. So what do I do? Throw it away? What a waste of resources. I wish manufacturers would make things that last at least a reasonable amount of time.Also, during it's life, it had trouble disconnecting from calls and did not display caller ID after the calls (couldn't go back to see he called previously, for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgrade my office phon with the Polycom Soundpoint Pro SE-220","review":"I received this phone a few days ago and I definitely rate it a 5. Very easy to setup. I work in a remote office and am on conference calls for the majority of the day and prefer to use a speaker vs a headset. The sound quality is great. I have also used the handset a few times and it works great. In addition, I have also gotten very good feedback from my callers about sound quality. Highly recommend. I read the reviews before purchasing and was a bit concerned about the 'loud dialing', but it is really not that loud and not a big deal. I most likely wouldn't have noticed if I didn't read it in the review. This phone was exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails as a speakerphone","review":"The phone itself is fine, but you get this for the speakerphone. However, when I got it, everyone says my voice is too faint (even though I am next to the mic). So I ended up using a headset, which defeats the purpose of spending the money on this phone in the first place.This Polycom is not the same quality as those in corporate conference rooms (of course those units cost a LOT more)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound Quality, Hard To Use","review":"I have found the speakerphone sound quality of this phone to be quite good, as you would expect from a Polycom product.The trouble with this phone is its stunningly poor user interface. Bringing up the call history list is an exercise complex menus and confusing button placement. The screen is not back lit, making the display hard to read at most angles and conditions.It's a nice phone in some ways, but Polycom's design makes it too frustrating to be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Phone","review":"I've had this phone for about a week and it is excellent! The quality, touch/feel of the phone, and even its aesthetic make this a steal at this price. I use the $1000 version of this phone at work and have always liked how natural the full-duplex conversations are with the Polycom phones. This phone has the same technology and in trying this phone with several people on both handsets and speakerphones, they have all said that the sound is clear and natural. A few commented that the microphone does sound a bit softer than might be preferable. My only critique would be that the higher-end Polycom phones come with a combined power/telephone-line cord so you only have to drag one cord across your desk, but instead this phone can accept two lines. If you talk a lot on the phone, especially while on the computer or on teleconferences, this is a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw","review":"This speaker phone emits a constant white noise from the speaker all the time. Even when the speaker is not in use. I returned one unit to Polycom that has this problem and the replacement had the same problem. The noise gets increasingly louder with time. This must be a design flaw. The noise is very annoying if you work in a quiet environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound quality, terrible service from Amazon","review":"Overall, the sound quality of the Polycom Soundpoint Pro SE-220 I received is terrible. There are often buzzing sounds and the speaker phone breaks in and out with odd crackling sounds. This item was a Christmas present and was not even opened until after the 30 days Amazon allows for returns. I figured Amazon would make an exception to the 30 day policy since this item was a lemon right out of the box and it was not opened due to Christmas within the 30 day window, I was wrong. I have to assume that this problem is with my phone only based on other reviews of this phone, but if you are going to buy this phone do not buy it from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality!!!","review":"I hear hissing from the speaker! It's easy to notice the hissy speaker at night when it's quiet. I thought it might be a defected phone because I like the quality of Ploycom phone (sound station) at work. Then, I went to exchange for another one which has same problem but the hissing volume was lower than the previous one. In addition, I can hear myself from the handset earpiece. I was totally disappointed and disatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speaker Phone","review":"As good as a speaker phone gets. Same basic sound quality as any of the high quality conference room phones. It's funny how many times I see this phone on TV and in pictures now that I bought it. The functions are a little too robust for what I needed so it is more difficult to get to some functions than I would like. It doesn't work at all without power which is a disappointment since I want one phone that doesn't need power for when the power goes out so this one won't fill that slot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Well For Three Days","review":"Ordered this phone because I work out of a home office and the GE 2 line phone I have is not a good speaker phone. The Polycom SE-220 worked fine for the first three days. On the forth day, I noticed that the phone would no longer place or receive calls, and an earlier time of 2:34 p.m. was on the display. This apparently was when the phone decided to die. No amount of disconnecting the power supply to attempt to re-set the phone worked.The phone is shipping back to Amazon today. I am disappointed in that I really need a good speakerphone, but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as helpful as I'd hoped","review":"I've been looking to update my outdated Mac troubleshooting books and thought this would be a good replacement. I was sadly disappointed. In the past few weeks several issues have come up none of which were covered in this book.

You end up rooting for the cows (well, I did anyway!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful across many age groups","review":"When I took this out of the box, I knew I would read it to the staff. Then I used it at a Storytelling Festival with 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. Everyone loves it. It is perfect for Story Time with the repetitive text. The pictures are wonderful. When I read it for Story Time today, I found my assistant peeking over the shelves. \\"I love to hear you read that', she said."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's a typewriter?","review":"I bought this book for my great nieces. When my sister read it to one of her grandkids, she had to explain what a typewriter was! I hadn't thought that they have never seen a typewriter! Still a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cows with demands","review":"I absolutely loved this book in the book store and snatched it up for my three year old. My husband read it and wondered if the author was inspired by the cartoonist Gary Larson (The Far Side) who often depicted cows performing humanlike tasks.These cows have smarts. They get a hold of an old typewriter and instead of just typing gibberish, they decide to use it as a tool to get something they want.I love the surprise ending - you'll have to read the book to find out. Quack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kids and parents!","review":"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this book -- as do I. From the very first time we read it (at just over 2), she has been fascinated with the notes that the cows and Farmer Brown leave each other. She has started asking for notes for herself and now sleeps most nights with a note on a 3x5 card. Its been a great way for us to provide her with little affirmations -- and at her own request.This is a great book that I will give to friends with toddlers. Easy to read, good illustrations and a cute story that doesn't bore Mom and Dad on the 10,000th read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"The cows and hens on the farm find an old typewriter, type their complaints to the farmer, and post them on the barn door. When the farmer doesn't comply, they go on strike. The cow will give no milk and the hens no eggs. The farm animals stayed up all night negotiating, and the Duck, who is a neutral party, delivers the ultimatum: they would exchange their typewriter for electric blankets since it was cold in the barn. The farmer accepted, eager to remove the typewriter from their possession. But the ducks got the typewriter and began their complaints--wanting a diving board for the duck pond! Very funny with illustrations that led to it being a Caldecott Honor Book. It shows the power of communication through writing. Super picture book for maturing beginner readers and may possibly instill a measure of motivation for writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Click Clack Moo: A Great Book For You!","review":"Click Clack Moo: Cows That Type is a very cute children's book. Kids will enjoy Doreen Cronin's use of repetition and onomatopoeia. The illustrations are done in water color which adds to the book. Cronin ends the book on a happy note with the \\"neutral\\" duck. There was absolutely no reason to dislike this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter after I heard other parents talking about what a gem it is, and I couldn't agree more! My daughter enjoyed it, but I'm sure that I enjoyed it even more. She's moved on to chapter books now, but she will occasionally pull this book off the shelf and read it aloud to me just to see my reaction. It's still hilariously funny after many, many reads. I've already started reading it to my 2 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not for little kids","review":"For very small toddlers or older children this may be a cute book. I thought it was cute and funny when my son was one but now I really dislike it for older toddlers/preschoolers. It demonstrates behavior & language that are not appropriate--specifically blackmail and making \\"demands\\" and these behaviors are rewarded. Also for those with agriculturally inclined youngsters the idea of cows and hens withholding milk and eggs is really confusing. I have not enjoyed explaining (repeatedly) what an \\"ultimatum\\" \\"neutral party\\" and \\"strike\\" are to my 3 year old. Maybe I'll tuck it away for when he is older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.","review":"The book is mildly amusing, but that's about it. I was very disappointed as the premise held such promise. But the book is overly repetitive (how many times do you have to say Click Clack Moo before it dtrarts to grate? Ferwe than are required by the text, that's for sure), the drawings are not very impressive (too many are too dark and amorphous) and the story, such as it is, doesn't amount to much.I think most kid's at the lower end of the target age range will like it OK, but for the life of me I can't imagine how anyone familiar with any of the classics of literature aimed at this age group could ever regard this as that sort of effort. It's mediocre at best.If you want a great book for this target age get Courduroy, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, Gregory the Terrible Eater or Bailer Goes Camping--all much better stories that are far less expensive than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Udders of the world unite!","review":"Doreen Cronin, Click, Clack, Moo: Cows that Type (Simon and Schuster, 2000)For some odd reason, I was expecting a story that played on the novelty of, you know, literate cows rather than a treatise on a cow union under negotiations with their oppressive, capitalist farmer boss. Still, whether the kiddies will get the underlying themes is debatable at best. Decent use of language which the kids will enjoy, though the repetition may begin to grate on the parent after the fiftieth repetition. *"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate messages for young children","review":"Yes, the book is funny. However, when one considers the messaging, the book has problems. First, it teaches kids that going on strike is ok, acceptable; let's promote being pro-union, anti-management (anti-captialist?). Second, it teaches them a negative way to deal with conflict - just withhold something and you'll get what you want. Third, nowhere in the book is the responsibility of the farmer mentioned - the farmer houses these animals, feeds them, and cares for them. The messages in this book are inappropriate for young children. Let's wait until they're old enough to have a class in labor relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics for Kids","review":"My granddaughters love this story (ages almost 5 & 3).

At the time we were studying about just war and how to resolve conflicts peacefully and it was quite entertaining when the priest teaching the class came in one morning with this book in hand. By the end of the book the entire class was hanging on the professor's every word, though the point of the lesson has left most of us now, a copy of the book now sits on my youngest sister's book shelf because the greatest thing that I got out of the book was that it made a great Christmas gift for a five year old, and became one of the first books she read on her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor with a lesson","review":"Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type teaches a great lesson about compromise in a humorous way.

Clever plot and amusing demand letters written by the disgruntled farm animals keeps everyone's attention. The illustrations are colorful and lively.

The wacky, sophisticated humor is terrifically appealing, and the story delivers a gentle message about fairness and the power of words.

I love the humor and never get tired of reading it to her. I know the jokes go over her head but no matter, she loves the repetitive refrain of click clack moo and all of the farm animals. Perhaps words such as ultimatum are a bit lofty for a children's book but I look foward to discussing it's meaning with my daughter one day. It's great to have a new vocabulary words to learn instead of reading the same baby words over and over again. Although the vocabulary is a bit sophisticated, the plot of the story is simple enough for her to follow without losing intrest. This is a book I reach for over and over again.

My 11 and 10 year old daughters readily volunteer to read it to the little ones so they can have the excuse of hearing the story and giggling for themselves.

The cows gave up the typewriter so they would get the electric blankets.

The animals had a meeting and make a deal with Farmer Brown to trade the typewriter for electric blankets. But this still didn't solve his problem.

Certainly the media would not have fallen in love with this book if farmer brown turned the ungrateful, inefficient and pampered cows into hamburger and drumsticks and replaced them with more appreciative, hard working, and efficient cows and chickens.

So this phone ... - no question about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disappearing Caller ID and Garbled Messages","review":"A co-worker purchased the same phone and had the same problem.

I was wrong with this one. The biggest problem I have found is that no hands free headset works well with it. They are all too quiet for hearing and speaking. People on the other end can never hear you when you use one. I've looked around and can't find one that works with the phone. I try the headset in a different phone i have and they work fine. Also this phone can get staticy. At random times, I will get a bunch of noise while talking. I would recommend something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Programming horror show","review":"Very difficult to program; range of reception short.

It's a difficult/awkward shape. It is also a pain to hang up, both the handset on the wall, & after speaking.The OFF button has to be hit, not the talk button.There is a very annoying wooshing sound when I am speaking to someone. They can not hear it, but I can. Makes it difficult to speak because at first I thought they could hear the noise as well. Previous Uniden 2.4G did not make these noises. Can only assume it's the equipment.Features that were simple & easy figure out on Uniden don't seem to exist on this phone. They may be programmable, but haven't looked at manual.I would check the unit out in person before buying as I did. I made a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&amp;amp;T 2.4gig 1455 phone","review":"If it has an AT&amp;amp;T logo on it, don't get it. I have had this phone for about a year. I dealt with the static because this phone wasn't my main one. The problem I have with this phone now; the handset cannot connect with the base unit. I put a new battery in it, and followed everything the manual and what I could find on the web said to do and still it can't connect. Totally useless. I would return it but unfortunately I did not buy it at Target. I got it at the now closed Service Merchandise. This phone now sits in a pile of my other AT&T &quot;goods?&quot;.I do not recommend this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Phone","review":"This phone works well. I live in a large apartment complex and have never had problems with picking up other people's conversations or major static interference. The handset was somewhat awkward the first few times I used the phone; the ear piece is a little too flat and the curve of the back of the phone is not quite right. However, after a few uses, I grew accustomed to it and I am quite happy with this phone. The answering machine is easy to use and can store many messages. The answering machine remote access feature is also very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"The sound quality is horrible. Nothing but echoes and static. The price was very attractive and I thought the name brand carried some credibilty. I was wrong. You get what you pay for. Cheap is cheap!

I have borrowed this book from the library many times. That is the reason I bought this book to begin with. Rather than have to search for it at the library, I just have to search my house for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadheads","review":"Dirty Three are in essence the Grateful Dead, squashed down to a trio. The formula is the same: modal jamming on a simple riff, build to a climax, and let it die out. Occasionally I think the band stumbles into some good moods, but this is quite pedestrian music-making: Warren Ellis' intonation is, frankly, atrocious, and don't dare tell me that he's playing out of tune on purpose a la Ornette Coleman. He is incapable of playing an extended line in tune. The other two aren't bad, but without someone playing in the bass range, they lack bottom, and as a result, lack punch when they really need it. Not truly bad, but nothing to write home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"the power of dirty three","review":"This is my first Dirty three recording and I am enchanted by the melodies Dirty three bring out. There is alot of communication between these three and they have a very gentle way of bring there music to a climatic state of bliss. I am a huge Mogwai fan and I am glad I found the Dirty three.I feel they have A greater understanding of the true spirit of music. If you like soft guitar melodies, tight drumming, and hypnotic violin playing this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Dirty Three pack more emotion into a single song than most albums do. This album is incredible...it swings from delicate love songs to grinding, weeping, tragic stories of loss. And all without words....only violin, drum, and sparse guitar. This is one of the finest albums I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather Forcast feature Misleading","review":"I love this clock. The time and temperature features are nice to have. It is great to have an accurate clock that I never have to set. At one glance we can tell what the temperature is both inside and outside.My only complaint is that the Weather Forcast feature is a little confusing. It only has 3 icons which indicate either that the weather is getting better, getting worse, or staying the same (whatever that means!?!) and arrows up or down for an increase in pressure. The icons themselves are misleading. A picture of a sun means that weather is expected to improve (not that it will be sunny). A sun with clouds icon means that weather is expected to be fair (not that the weather will be sunny with clouds). And an icon showing clouds with rain coming down means the weather is expected to get worse (not that it will rain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"This was not the best book I have ever read.

This one stands alone.This one's unusual in that the hero is the one who wants nothing to do with women; he wants to be a monk! But Chloe very much wants to be a wife; alas, she doesn't know her parentage and cannot be one of the Brides of Virtue without that knowledge. So she tricks her way into a group of brides-to-be. She not only has to discover her parentage and find herself a husband, but she also has to decide who the other 4 brides will marry. But the king appoints Sir Hugh to help her, and he begins to have very un-monklike thoughts about her. Their battle of wills is full of humor and struggle.As good if not better than The Husband Test. Delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised","review":"I picked up this book at the grocery store for a diversion, not really expecting anything spectacular, just a nice, light, fun read.I was so pleasantly surprised!It is well written and interesting. The heroine is someone I actually found to be sweet and kind and found her to be very sympathetic. The hero as well was a sympathetic character, and the author did a wonderful job of outlining his background so that his behaviour did not appear to be unwarranted or strange when his \\"darker side\\" rose up. I genuinely liked these characters, and that's hard in a romance novel. Usually, the heroine is a pampered princess who must be tamed by the patient hero, or the hero is some sort of monster who bends his will to the heroine. It was so refreshing to see two strong personalities come together and compliment each other without one being forced to lose his/her identity....I can't say enough about this refreshing book and hope to read more by this author soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love the jacksons","review":"i like the muisc because it's bring me back to the 70'slike soul train.I like that music think happy becuse.today ain't nobody thinkin happy. because people arethinkig about killing each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book so expensive?","review":"I found this book too expensive.

His institute in Dallas, Texas is where world class people go to improve.This book which ties the spiritual aspect to the normal physical and mental parts of fitness completes the circle where people live. Without the spiritual there is almost always something that is missing. When performing at increasingly higher levels people need to know that there is more to be had and that it is available.Dr Cooper continues to pioneer and then make his findings known.

Negative Trend only lasted for a few years, then in the early 80's, two of it's members would go on to form the now legendary band, Flipper. but you can listen to this snapshot in time to hear the raw, urgent punk fury of a truly under-rated band that came and went in the blink of an eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of history.....","review":"From my understanding, Negative Trend was one of the opening bands for the last ever Sex Pistols concert at San Francisco's Winterland in 1978. So, that in itself is cool enough reason to buy this. The thing that makes it better is that Negative Trend is the band that gave us Will Shatter and Steve DePace of Flipper. So this is what half of Flipper sounded like before they were in Flipper. Learn why they were chosen to open for the Pistols on that fateful night through this music. Know that this was one of the first volleys by us Americans in the realm of \\"punk rock.\\" Short and sweet. An EP rather than an LP. Nevertheless, elements of the truth, later told by Flipper, are visible here. Buy it.

Suspense, intrigue, romance, international locales, with an eye, ear and nose that makes the reader almost there in the restaurant in Florence.With the Biblical heroine Esther as motif, Gordon brings the characters in this story of modern day international intrigue through challenges to loyalty, love, honor and friendship, and keeps them human.

Consumer beware! This is nothing more than Alpha Centauri repackaged and maybe a little more eyecandy. This is yet another formulaic, static, staid pseudo-strategy game with nothing new or innovative whatsoever. The combat is frustratingly illogical, (axe-wielding warriors defeating tanks?!?) and simplistic, and the controls are simply juvenile and clumsy. Forget economy or commerce too, they are nonexistent in this game. They claim to have hyped up diplomacy, but do not be fooled! All they did was put some pretty pictures in the windows! There is really no difference in this game from Master of Orion, a game which is a decade old now, but clearly the better of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sham Civ","review":"CIV3 is unrelated to the Civ2 and SMAC. It is only a CIV in name. The real heir to the CIV series is Rise of Nations designed by Brian Reynolds, the same person who designed CIV2 and SMAC. CIV III is a poorly designed game on half baked ideas. The game is dummer (no pun intended). The AI is dummer (it knows nothing of diplomacy) and the 'puter cheats harder. It is, however, winnable if you out-cheat the 'puter. Save often, fight wars, try verious fighting sequence at the same turn until you have produced a leader. You are on your way to winning at any level. It is a laborious and boring way to playing. But what can I say, it is a poorly designed boring game."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"1. Exhausting2.

Many of the features in Civ III are appealing, and after a bit of mindset adjustment, are actually quite fun.The problem: bugs. Even at patch v1.29f (the last one offered before the Conquests expansion), I have yet to play through an entire game without running into some kind of computer-move hang, or game crash, or SOMETHING that completely obviates the substantial amount of time you've put into a particular game. Seeing two days of gameplay go up in smoke because an important strategic resource appears NOWHERE on the entire map is not fun.I'm not too eager to plop down another $20-30 to get an expansion for a game I can't play in the first place, so I guess I'm out of luck. My recommendation is to save your money, and cherish the memories of the earlier installments of the franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Civ 2, but...","review":"This game introduced a few great ideas and concepts, but I wouldn't consider this a groundbreaking game like the first two. Other than the few new additions to the game (like culture) and the improved graphics and sound, its very similiar to Civ II. I consider this a good thing, because the game has kept a lot of the things I like about it, but if you're one who wants a new gaming experience then don't rush to buy this. This is a good game for Civ fans and turn-based strategy enthusiasts, and I thought it was a great game that kept me occupied for hours on end.

Just as in that game, you can never find a winning scenario. I don't know how some of these psople wrote reviews on winning and becoming supreme deity status. The game is slow, there is no diplomacy between nations. Everyone of them declares war on you. All of the opposing civ's reach higher status than you. The other problem is you always run out of resources and are down to 0 gold before you know it. You can't customize policies with other nations and they all want to blackmail you into giving up all of your gold.I like Medieval better. Not as much detail but far better strategy game."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"What can I say?This is a great book, even better than the first (TTYL) one.

I think time has brought to light that the ragged feel of these versions by and large does them justice. The killer take on \\"Shelter From The Storm\\" is worth the price of the disc alone.There is a very cool swagger to the way the Rolling Thunder Review approached these songs. \\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" benefits in the same way \\"Shelter\\" does. The original versions on 'Blood on the Tracks' are nothing short of wonderful but don't have the raw edge these live versions do. I appreciate that Dylan was never one to duplicate what he did in the studio. I love that he takes risks and re-interprets his songs.Bob Dylan's live albums in general have been a mixed bag. This and 'Live 1966' have become my personal favorites.

That CD set was so incredible that I went out looking for more and found this. The difference is Rolling Thunder bootleg was recorded early on in the tour(s) and this came pretty late. There is a definite difference in the energy level. I wonder why they just didn't release those early recordings?

This is a very special CD but, unfortunately, there has been no official release of the Television special itself on DVD or CD (beware of the very poor DVD bootleg that is being sold as that TV special). To be clear, this CD does not reproduce the TV Guide interview, nor is there any video elements to this CD. However, this CD gets a Five Star rating (for what it is, not for what it isn't)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's Rain","review":"When I read that Mick Ronson played on this I was intrigued. Unfortunately he's only on the first track. Still, I like Dylan and enjoyed this overall. One thing I've noticed on his live recordings, I think he's unaware his mic is connected to amps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the real albums","review":"All of these songs are being re-released on this album. I am a huge, huge Dylan fan, but buy the songs as they originally appear on the original albums, as Dylan originally intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Get Many Chances Like This!","review":"This was one of those rare performances where Dylan's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great. The sound is rough, the intonation is off, the recording is filled with horrible buzzes, whistles, and clicks. None of which matters. Once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk, you'll prefer them to the original album cuts. I know I do. Absolutely essential to any collection of Dylan's work, \\"Hard Rain\\" is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine live album, in spite of what they say.","review":"It seems only a few of us Dylan fans find any worth in Hard Rain. Well I am one of them. He blazes through classics Maggie's Farm and Shelter from the Storm. He gives Idiot Wind the incredibly angry person remix. He cuts a version of Lay Lady Lay that is virtually unlistenable and gives us corny lyrics such as \\"You can have truth, but you must choose it!\\", but that's not what we're talking about. One Too Many Mornings, I Threw It All Away and Oh Sister are also good. Then there's Stuck Inside of Mobile and You're a Big Girl Now, OK here but much better in-studio. I don't like all the anger in You're a Big Girl Now, nor the guitar solo on Mobile. I also wish you could actually understand what Bob's saying on One Too Many Mornings, but you can barely catch a word over the chaos. Now I've gotta find the original...Fine album, recommended to any Dylan fan who can get over the fact that the song It's a Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall wasn't included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ragged, funky stuff","review":"It's loud, it's out of tune, and the recording quality is quite poor. It's also fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Droning","review":"I really do like Tangerine Dream, but not this album. It's too long and too similar. While Underwater Sunlight is one of my all-time favourite records, this is monotonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Unbelievable!!","review":"I have never heard a CD that comes anywhere near this CD for boring! It's like every song is one 20 minute long note and every song even uses the same note. They just hit a key on the synth and let the recorder go. Someone occasionally adjusts a phase shifter or sequencer. This is a CD that no one will ever be able to top for boring. A feat that will not be surpassed for all of eternity!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found it!","review":"I saw this book one day at the store but I didn't buy it. Then I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was very hard to find just based on what I had remembered. The book is deep and on the sad side even though it's a really special book. I'm not sure how I would give this book as a gift unless you had that specific scenario going on from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized, random topics with little meat","review":"I don't think I've read a computer book as poorly organized as this one. The basic premise seems to be present some random aspects of XQuery or related topics in a chapter and have no flow through the book.There is a lot of good material in the book but try to find it - it's more or less impossible because the index is abysmal. There's no real introduction to how to use XQuery - instead we start off with XSLT. That may be OK (they are related) but it seemed a bit strange to me.Another problem with the book is that some of it is out of date. The XQuery specification is a work in progress but the book was written after (and refers to) the final draft - but a lot of the examples are not compliant with that final draft.The best thing that I can say about this book is that it forced me to research issues more deeply and therefore find out what I needed to know. I wouldn't buy this book - try to borrow it and see if it meets your needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"Totally agree with previous post titled 'Poorly organized, random topics with little meat'.The book has a amateurish feel, full of topics that are not coherent, basically just a few lines here and there to fill up the page.Look for O'Reilly XQuery by Priscilla Walmsley, a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....difficult to review this one","review":"Unfortunately, I personally know this author. Despite the fact this man is wonderful and means well - this book gives the Latter-day Saint some things to think about, but some of the doctrine presented isn't endorsed by the church and one should be careful about the the information presented as \\"factual\\". Because it isn't, it is the authors \\"theories\\". And though he may make some strong points about these theories,using scripture to prove these theories, I'd be mighty careful about making it a part of your personal beliefs. The book is very dry and is written like a research paper. If you don't mind reading through the dry style of writing, you just might be entertained by the theories he has. I don't want to spoil the surprise should you have a desire to purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long","review":"I bought 4 phones for my small business. For the 1st 3 months, everything worked well except for the handset design. The handset easily slips off the cradle and if it not placed directly near your mouth when you are speaking, your voice is not heard by the customer. By about 3 months, one line of one phone stopped working. At this point, the hold buttons are intermittent. I would not buy this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful story!","review":"It gave me chills, to read Deborah Hopkinson's newest book, A BAND OF ANGELS. Every bit as touching and inspiring as Hopkinson's SWEET CLARA AND THE FREEDOM QUILT, this is a true story about a little-known chapter in African-American history. Ella Shepard and the Fisk U. Jubilee Singers' dedication to a cause greater than themselves led them to preserve many of the old spirituals that were on the verge of being forgotten. They took this music into the world, raising money to keep the doors of Fisk open, so others could come behind them and learn. Raul Colon's artwork is full of tenderness and a look of long-ago longing that blends perfectly with the text. A great book for sharing during Black History month, but even better for just any time of year, any time you want to share a story about a strong woman, and human beings who find a way to triumph in the face of adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty","review":"Obviously you're looking at this disc because you are a Peter Green fan. Disc One is Peter Green solo from his \\"mid\\" period. It's not bad but you would be better served by \\"In the Skies\\" or even \\"Little Dreamer\\". Disc 2 is all Fleetwood Mac live stuff. At first glance it seems interesting as some of the song titles are unfamiliar. However, the sound quality is so poor it's unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What songs are here?","review":"Dear Amazon,There's no track listing here. There also isn't a track listing for the Fleetwood Mac CD \\"Perfect In Every Way\\". Do you expect us to be interested in buying a CD when we can't see what songs are on it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of Africana history","review":"While reading this book I had to remind myself that the events happened only 40 years ago. The stories seem to belong to a distant historical era, when they are really the beginning of the modern safari era. The professional hunters mentioned are now legendary figures from the safari industry's golden age. Of the countries detailed, most are closed to hunting and several have vanished through the sands of political reorganization. Some of the species detailed are almost mythical creatures, rarely seen let alone hunted. Museum permits for hunting certain species, do it yourself safaris or a hunter having an audience with the emperor to obtain permission to hunt have almost no modern parallel. For planning a modern safari this book has almost no value, but for stepping into a piece of Africa's safari history it is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comfort, but hard to clean","review":"We bought this item because our california king sze bed has a tad hard. We love the product but it doesnt fit in any washer, not even the ones at the laundry mat. We had to take it off our bed til we can wash it in the tub, and then there is the problem of drying it. It doesnt fit in the dryer either."},{"rating":"1","title":"mix-up","review":"I think Amazon mixed things up here. Everything mentioned here refers to the original 1980 Tangram (which deserves 5 stars), the tracklisting as well as all the reviews (mainly from years ago....). But this is the 2008 \\"re-mix\\" (or rather \\"techno-overdub\\") of Tangram from 2008, which will hardly delight fans of the original album. So be warned if you follow these reviews, you WON'T get the original Tangram album (unless they show the wrong cover-art and album title...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tangerine boys can't compose music","review":"The most important works of Tangerine Dream were made early 70s. Those albums could be called 'ambient'. But now they are trying to make melodical stuff and we can see that they can't compose at all. Themes on this album are too simple to entertain me. Also a sonic palette has nothing imaginative despite of synthesizer arsenal that is used. This is perhaps suitale for boring and unimaginative people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Images but could use more words","review":"I just recently got this book and I must admit, as a graphic designer, this book is quite helpful with learning more of the different animals' anatomy and structure but the only negative thing I can say is that it could be even more helpful if it had more words in it to go along with the images he shows you. Adding some instructions would help a long ways to showing a person how he got to each image. But all in all, it's very helpful.Mike Sexton,Owner, Birdman's Designs"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a waste of money","review":"I have many art books and this is not worth the paper it's printed on the illustrations were poor do not waste your money the other reviews must be written by friends of the book's artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"An attractive drawing book","review":"My daughter (who got this book in 5th grade) often goes to this book to get cues on how to draw a horse or other animals. The drawings present the animals in action in an attractive way. The drawing steps are kept to a few major sketches for each animal, which seem to be about right for a child or person who enjoys drawing and seems to have a bit of a knack for it but would be turned off by too many technical instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good learning book","review":"This book is very detailed as to how to draw various animals. Very good illustration. Pleased with purchase. I bought it for my granddaughter as she likes to draw. She will get alot of use out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference, especially for the price","review":"I'm glad I bought it. It's a pretty cheap book to come by here, and worth it to have a quick reference of basic anatomy for several animals. Plus the illustrations (759 of them, says the cover) are lovely and offer some wonderful inspiration for dynamic poses. They convey weight and sense of motion very well. There are more pages dedicated to horses than to the other animals, but there's a nice variety in the rest. Plenty of deer, cats (domestic and a few different big cats) cattle, foxes, rabbits, bear, and more \\"odd fauna\\" like kangaroos and giraffes get a few pages too. The dogs included are nice but with all the vast differences in breeds the selection is limited to a few extreme types. This book is not heavy in text but the advice it does provide is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Delivery","review":"Great book to have for people who are interested in drawing animals or fantasy creatures --either realistically or cartoony. I bought it so I could understand the animal anatomy more so I could draw taurs (beings that are half-human, half-animals.)The delivery was prompt and the book was new and well-packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy accident!","review":"I accidentally purchased this book thinking it was another one I was interested in buying. Upon it's arrival, I realized this book was definitely not the book I thought it was; it was even better! So many illustrations that really help artists capture the movement of animals. I love this book, and even appreciated that caricature section. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sealed very tight","review":"I was using some other kind of food container for work lunch.

But to the Native Americans the ancient ones are sacred and the artifacts they left behind belong to the people who knew not the concept of individual ownership.A THIEF OF TIME will take you on a journey through the lands of the Navajo nation with Hillerman serving a tour guide. Enjoy every moment.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best but wonderful","review":"Hillerman really knows how to spin a good tale and tie together all sorts of different subplots together into one knot as they all interrelate. Joe Leaphorn doesn't believe in coincidences, and neither does the author. And nothing simply coincides in his books, all the subplots come together neatly.An anthropologist disappears, two men are found murdered, a backhoe is missing and Joe Leaphorn, who's wife has recently died and is retiring from the force, wants one last big case before he quits. He cooperates with junior officer Jim Chee who just wants to find out who stole that damned backhoe and murdered those two men in the truck.The book is really full of surprises and has a totally surprise ending. Not the one that I was really hoping for or betting on, but it was a shocker. A little hard to follow all the plots coming together however, which was why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chee and Leaphorn do it again.","review":"Hillerman's greatest triumph.

A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived ending.","review":"In my opinion, the most satisfying mysteries are those in which the \\"whodunnit\\" is drawn from facts and circumstances that are developed throughout the story. Having the solution depend on the introduction of a character (or an unlikely turn of events) introduced right before the end is disappointing. I admire Tony Hillerman and I have enjoyed many of his books. This one, however, left me with the impression that he started without a very good idea of where he was going, and he just ran out of ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so read","review":"This was the first Hillerman novel I ever read.How it ever became a best seller amazes me! Fortunately it was the only book I had with me on vacation, or I would never have gotten through it. About halfway through, however, things did improve.Hillerman does a good job of evoking the flavor of the Southwest and the story is interesting enough. But, I made the mistake of reading this immediately after having read Michael Crichton's \\"Timeline\\" which is a much more engaging and entertaining book.Based on my experience I doubt that I'll read another of Hillerman's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT big enough","review":"I bought this clock for my home-bound, slightly disabled step dad.

His story gives the reader insight into how difficult it can be to realize you are wrong about some of the most important things in life and how difficult it can be to move into a direction that is very different and even considered wrong in your previous way of thinking. I would recommend this book to anyone who is Protestant and is curious about Eastern Orthodoxy. In the second half of the book the author goes into explanations dealing w/ the most common hot button issues Protestants have w/ Orthodoxy. Some explanations are stronger than others but overall I found them to be good and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book that explains why","review":"I would recommend all who are seeking a deeper spiritual walk with the Lord read this book. It explains why the modern Protestant movement does not fulfill the deep in built desire of mankind to know the Creator.

Wilkie wrote two classic novels (\\"The Moonstone\\" and \\"Woman in White\\") which I enjoyed very much. \\"Moonstone\\" is a mystery and \\"Woman...\\" is a drama with a few Gothic horror touches thrown in. I was looking forward to this book--but was VERY disappointed it. The stories are all well-written but they're somewhat long-winded and (most importantly) not even remotely scary. Most of the times the purportedly scary incidents are of human origin! In some of these various incidents go completely unexplained or the resolutions don't make one bit of sense! I was more bored and frutrated but was supposed to be a horror book. Boring, long-winded and not even remotely scary.

After I received this mattress pad I initially put it under the mattress cover and was quite disappointed as there was absolutely no difference. I later removed the cover and put only the mattress pad. I must confess I have not experienced that feeling of sleeping on a cloud.

I have used cordelss phones i the past that got static and interference just by turning my head, not the case with this.Some nice features include: storing a name and number in memory and once you enter it on one phone, the other phone automatically receives that as well, adjustable ring volume (including ringer off), change the style of ring for the base and each individual phone, intercom system between two phones, and an easy to use answering service.Highly recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice features for the price, but poor performance.","review":"I was attracted by this multi-handset phone's low price and many features, however my wife immediately noticed an echo when using the handsets.

There is one spot in my house (near the answering machine base) where I feel like I am in a tunnel, but all I have to do is take one step over and all is well.

The AT&T name was also a factor. We are VERY disappointed.... We have only had a short time and are preparing to throw it away and buy something else. The phone has an echo frequently when you are using it, and it seems to have poor reception in that it's often difficult to hear the other person talking. Also, when the handset is picked up, the caller ID disappears from the displey. BUT the worst thing is that it periodically will emit a shrill tone (usually in the middle of the night) which continues until you press the talk button several times.

But these phones are the worst. After having them for about 3 weeks, we began having terrible results with the volume/speakers in the phones. I took them back, and got a new set. These lasted about twice as long, before the battery life just became worthless. We are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time - say, 1 hour. And you can't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out, and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again. And yes, we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge, and all that kind of stuff. Still...I have never used a more frustrating phone, nor will I ever purchase an AT&T phone again.

First, the phone arrived after New Years Day. Then it did not work properly. I tried to contact AT&T and that was a joke. When I finally did reach a person, after about 40 minutes, I was switched to several people, who evidently have never had any training in \\"customer service\\". I was finally told to contact the supplier of the phones. It started all over again. After many problems, time, and inconsiderations, I was supplied a label to return the phone for service, which I did. Now I have contacted the supplies again, and they know nothing about the phone. My advice is to stay away from this perticular phone, AT&T, and their supplier. Was an AT&T fan, but I have since cancelled all of my services with AT&T.

There are two major problems: 1. messages I receive on the answering machine sound like a garbled computer-generated voice that is generally unintelligible on playback - no exaggeration, and 2. battery life is just plain pitiful. To a lesser degree phone sound quality and mic pick-up are also problematic.I confess that I bought this phone on looks and what I thought was a good corporate reputation - Clearly a bad move. My only regret is that I missed my 30 day return window. Now I'm stuck with using this \\"phone\\" every day and it pains me to no end.

The memory is not very efficient, the callback feature is terrible and the redial doesn't work at all. The scrolling button for the memory is backwards (left is up, right is down), plus when you enter a received number into memory, the '1' is not there. Since the received calls show up on the screen without the '1' in front of them you have to re-enter the phone number. Also, the redial does not work. When I push redial, I get a #.

They're presented here as case studies in conceptualization and construction, with lessons that are widely applicable. For example, how to accurately lay out and cut angled tenons, how to obtain a flat surface on an otherwise curved leg, how to fashion a slip seat, etc. And throughout, Miller details a bunch of clever jigs and methods of work.A caution: familiarity with the ABCs of furnituremaking and access to some modicum of shop stuff is assumed here.

It is all right, but the film is really more in the amateur category than of a finely crafted film. Some obvious gaps in continuity, perhaps due to the short shooting schedule. Avoid the commentary, as the director is so full of himself, and Lauren Smith mainly laughs and giggles.On the positive side, a lot of the movie is conveyed without dialogue, and I am referring to the tension between the characters.Are the people attractive?

Was she having delusions of being a second Callas? What was it? At some point (later than this recording) she got her act together and did some marvelous restrained singing.

I was frankly amazed that I listened to Fogelberg back in the day. Today it sounds like a bunch of sappy, maudlin, over-produced fluff. I found his high-pitched voiced annoying. Unlike almost anything I listened to back in the 70s and 80s (and I listened to huge variety of music) Fogelberg just doesn't stand the test of time.As I came to a greater singer/songwriter, James Taylor, I was afraid I'd feel the same way -- but I didn't.

I fell in love with it instantly. So much so that I couldn't stop listening to it for the eleven-hour duration of the flight.

Nether Lands is probably the best album ever to be made in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nether Lands- a hidden gem","review":"This is a very good representation of Dan Fogelberg's early work.

Still using his ethereal vocals, Dan manages to foreshadow the maturity he would adapt in later years, those years that would broaden his audience and establish his pop star status.There are four especially impressive Tracks on NETHER LANDS: the elegantly orchestral beauty of the title tune; the mournfully touching SKETCHES; SCARECROW'S DREAM's dreamy imagery; and the brutal honesty of FALSE FACES.The remaining tracks are quite good but don't have quite the impact of the above-mentioned four tracks.While this is not my personal Fogelberg fave, it is a superlative tribute to Dan's unique artistry that was silenced far too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, accurate, but battery-powered","review":"The clock is a bit smaller than I expected. I guess that's because I was expecting it to be the same size as the atomic wall clocks that are popular these days. But that's fine - the digits are 1 1/8 inches high - large enough for me to see without my glasses. It would actually make a pretty good travel alarm (though the atomic time setting probably doesn't function overseas).I chose this model because I already have one of Lacrosse's weather stations, and it picks up the temperature signals from the same transmitter. Unlike other atomic clocks I've seen, these clocks from Lacrosse do not seem to be built on cheap crystals that lose seconds (or even minutes!) every day and rely on the atomic clock to keep itself accurate.This would be the perfect alarm clock for me if only it could be plugged in, and remain lit continuously.

I hoped that I would also get better sound quality with messages since computer memory and processing power have gotten much cheaper since 1998. Unfortunately the messages on this machine are worse than my old Panasonic, which weren't great to begin with. I also was annoyed by the feature that plays back the date, time, number of messages, etc. before it will play your messages: my old phone does this but the AT&T speaks v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y so you have to wait until it finishes its spiel before you can hear your messages (even if it's an old message). The sound quality of phone calls themselves are fine. I didn't try any other features because the message quality was poor enough that I'm returning it. Fortunately Amazon makes that easy and painless -- go Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This phone looked like a good alternative for people with wireless networks who want to avoid 2.4GHz interference but don't want to pay the inflated prices for 5.8GHz phones. It has useful features like answering machine and speakerphone. But the sound quality is very poor, even distorted. Callers sound like they are at the bottom of a deep well. You can hear an echo of your own voice in the handset along with a constant buzzing. As 900MHz phones get phased out, it looks like there will be no good alternative to 5.8GHz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakerphone died after about a year","review":"It sounded garbled and staticky when using the speakerphone and the caller id lcd screen broke.

I decided to take the jump into the digital answering machine world and I've yet to experience it! Upon setting the machine up, I found that the outgoing message did not work, playing static with no recognizable words. I called the AT&T help line and it was determined after 15 minutes or so that I had a malfunctioning unit. What a bunk machine! So that has been my experience with this machine and I hesitate to purchase this model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy owner!","review":"This machine does not have a battery back up so if you have frequent power interuptions, do not buy it. You will lose your outgoing message and your time/date stamp every time. You can play back messages, but you have to hit repeat and play several times in an unknown sequence... I've just lucked out to get it to replay. It doesn't work the way the manual claims in this respect. And, my outgoing message doesn't sound like me according to callers and the incoming messages are so garbled we can hardly understand the message (which requires us to replay which is really frustrating -- see above). This is a terrible answering machine. Do not waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of [junk]!","review":"This is the WORST answering machine I have ever owned since I first started using them over twenty years ago. It fails to record messages on a regular basis, it is very difficult to set the time and date, and worst of all, it does not allow the listener to re-play a message. If you do not obtain all of the information in the first go-around, you are S.O.L. This is really and truly a piece...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of [junk]","review":"This is the worst machine I've ever purchased. It won't replay messages so if you don't get it all the first time you're SOL. The memory fills up quickly with messages you can't listen to. Turning the machine off is the only way to dump the memory. It doesn't give you a date stamp, month day and year, it will only state the day of the week and time of the day which is not at all helpful. I never would have bought this piece of [junk] if I'd known it is an utterly unreliable useless machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful game!","review":"Well I was first drawn into the game because of my love of \\"The Sims.\\" (Plus EBgames was selling it for 5 bucks, know I know why!)Like the Sims you are able to interact with the environment and other people but it is a very limiting game due to the specific number of interactions and items available. It's fun for the first 10 minutes then you realize that there's not much difference in gameplay. It's pretty redundant. You make sure needs are met, click the same buttons to win the case, which isn't hard. Soon you find that you're just clicking buttons in a certain order over and over again.*One of the most annoying things about the game is that unlike the Sims where you can change the settings to \\"see\\" through the walls, you can't do that in this game so your character might be doing something but you can't see it because of the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This game is like a no-frills version of The Sims.

I think it's just sad that these generic Sims clones like The Partners and Singles are missing that capability when the very original game in the genre, The Sims, supported it fully, drawing almost no gender lines at all when it came to the characters' relationships. If not for that tacky and somewhat offensive flaw, this would have been a very satisfying four-dollar purchase, but because of it, I'm going to try to see if Menard's (yes, I actually got this at Menard's) will take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disapointing","review":"Comfortable grip, well finished overall.

So you cannot disable answering on one of the lines or have one line automatically routed to a different mailbox. In my opinion that makes this phone useless for a two-line home or office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"1. This machine had the worst manual I've ever seen. Even setting the clock required digging in the back of the book somewhere instead of being in the setup section. Did not explain functions clearly or completely.2. A battery backup would probably be more worthwhile than than the handset spare battery charger feature. Every time the power glitches here (frequently) it loses its settings. Haven't had it working long enough to tell whether it loses its messages when this happens, but I suppose it does. The manual doesn't say one way or the other.3. Mine (1 wk old) has started talking Mickey Mouse and I can't understand what it's saying when selecting functions any more.Overall I am totally disillusioned this AT&T product and I certainly would NOT recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 1 Year","review":"This phone started out great.

The decoder clues are hard to read, the code wheels are hard to move, and the decoder pieces are easy to lose.

I wasn't sure if it was just going to be a historical romance, or get down with a little battle. It is a nice blend of character driven story with plenty of action and romance to appease most people. The acting is good. There are no performances that truly stood out to me, but no one is bad in it by any means. The romance is interesting and believeable. The fighting and battles are on a smaller scale, so don't expect any Braveheart type of battle scenes. The story feels like a combination of King Arthur and Romeo and Juliet. It was an enjoyable watch with a few minor flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd look for something else.","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. The information is 10 years old, the exam has changed quite a bit. I took the FE exam this semester and passed, but definitely not because of this book. I tried to study with it for about 4 hours and decided I was wasting my time. Yes it includes a lot of material, but I didn't really think the solutions adequately explained the problems. Also, the exam itself was way closer to the NCEES FE Exam practice problems than the problems in this book. They change the exam on a yearly basis, so a 10 year old book is not very relevant. If you're looking for a book to freshen up your technical knowledge before an interview, I would expect there are better books out there. The only upside to this book is that if you used, you should be able to pick up the book and the solution manual for under $50. For those preparing for the FE Exam, good luck!

The kids liked having him stand on their desks and I let Alexander visit some table groups as a reward to the kids. But eventually, he lost both forearms and I had to reattach them with wire. I don't think the kids meant to pull off Alexander's forearms, but he is more of a decoration than a toy that kids can manipulate and send off to battle.

Sadly, there won't be a fourth, as George Alec Effinger died last year. It looks like we'll get a taste of it, with \\"Budayeen Nights\\" being due in September 2003. From what I've read, this is a collection of short stories and is not the 4th novel we've been waiting for.In this book, Marid works as a policeman in the Budayeen (a walled portion in an anonymous Islamic city, where pretty much anything goes) and making sure that his patron's interests within the police are taken care of. At it's heart, like the first book, it's a mystery...but one with a colorful (to say the least) cast of characters. There is a focus on cybernetics, landing the book squarely in the cyberpunk sci-fi genre, but the electronic gizmos are not the focus of the story. The levels of sex and drug use, and to a slightly lesser extent the violence, in these books is astounding but I don't feel it took anything away from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I have always been very pleased with this product.

I immediately contacted the seller by phone as well as through Amazon.Good news: my money was refunded the very next day, and the customer service was excellent. Bad news: the guy who contacted me checked the Men's Direct warehouse and found all their remaining tubes were empty as well. I recommend ordering from aMENity directly, to (hopefully) ensure quality product. Not sure why the tubes were empty... quality control issue, or perhaps the gel somehow dried up?

A sailor toy gives him his blue pea coat to wear. Little Whistle is appreciative and promises to return it one day.

Sounds to me that the transmitter is leaking signal into the speaker (maybe badly designed speaker wire path etc...).I replaced this phone with a Olympia OL 2400 (must be the same logic chip - menus are 90% identical - buttons - while located in different places are 100% identical). The Olympia is smaller, has a louder ring and does have a much much less noticable 'buzz'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible is all I can say.","review":"I bought this system thinking it would be a great convenince. However, although one phone worked beautifully (even if sometimes caller ID was slow - sometimes now showing up at all) and did not give me any problems; the other one had sporadic sound. I would be in the middle of conversation when all of the sudden I could not hear anything. Whomever I was speaking with could hear me clearly. I tried getting this fixed with the manufacturer, but basically got the runaround - \\"Don't return this item, please call this number,\\" then stay on hold for 30 minutes, get disconnected, call back, repeat until so frustrated you want to throw the phone - which probably would have fixed the broken one. Exchanged it for a second phone system at the local Target only to have the SAME problem (this time with both phones). Finally gave up and returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!!!","review":"I bought this set plus a base with answering machine. What a waste!!! I have returned it. Normally I use it only 15 feet from the base but would loose reception. Lots of noises and my voice sounded hollow. Like I was in a cave. People were constantly complaining about the phone when I was using it. Finally I packed it up and sent it back. I've gone back to my old Panasonic. My father bought the same phone and also returned his for the same reasons. A total waste of money. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Clarity!","review":"We bought this phone, charged it for a full day and picked up the receiver to hear nothing but static! It has *HORRIBLE* clarity. I could barely even hear the dial tone over the static. We returned it and bought the Uniden cordless with dual handsets for the same price. We had originally purchased the phone based on AT&T having a good reputation as well as the great value (dual handsets for $...) but it turned out to be a bust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this phone","review":"I bought this phone and it has been the worst cordlessphone I've ever owned. The battery life is patheticallyshort. They recommend charging it in the baseever night. Even doing this it still (does not last long)after making a few phone calls.

The display is easy to read, the range is good, and it looks and feels of high quality.So why only 2 stars? The charger in one of the base units (the one connected to the phone line) overcharged the rechargeable battery in the handset. The resulting heat damaged the circuit board inside the handset and it stopped working. Now my dual handset phone is a single handset phone unless I buy another one. Of course, I realized all of this just after the one year warranty was up."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice if you like to hear yourself speak","review":"If I could give this phone no stars I would have.

It goes dead off the charger after only 1 hour. I've already replaced the batteries once, but it still doesn't work. In addition, there is no volume control for the handsets and the volume is very low. I stopped using one of the headsets because of the battery and volume issues. The second one didn't seem to have these problems for about 4 days. Now it has all the same issues. In addition, that annoyingly loud beeping that goes off about once a week (the other day it woke my sick baby up at 4:30 AM). Even bad phones would call this a bad phone. I've only had this phone set for about 3 months. Run from this phone now. AT&T surely has gone downhill recently. It's so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase unless you like to listen to yourself talk...","review":"A few other reviewers have mentioned the \\"echo\\" when talking on these phones, and I completely agree.

Don't waste your time with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't feel up to at&t standard","review":"This is the first at&t phone I had problems with. Problems with the phone included giving out a long tone when not in use. Also had problems where I couldn't be heard at all and no the mute button wasn't pressed by mistake. When not in use, the battery charge when left off the charger was no longer than 8 hours.While the shape was great to hold, if you have to rest the phone between your ear and shoulder (as in taking notes), the phone would very easily slide off onto the floor. Of course, this could be solved by using a headset, if you have one.Granted, I could of ended up with a lemon, but these are the problems I encounted with this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I've ever purchase","review":"I don't know what the problem is with this phone, but 30 days after I purchased it from Best Buy (ironically, they only give you a 30 day guarantee) the phone would not hold a charge. I called AT&T customer service, and basically had to [pester] them to get them to send me replacement batteries for my practically brand new phone. I replaced the batteries, and within two weeks, the batteries would no longer hold a charge. I've had many cordless phones in the past, and have never had this experience with batteries not holding a charge. I have again tried different batteries, and the phone is just junk! I wish I could get my money back, but AT&T wants to keep sending me new batteries instead. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product Reliability","review":"I initially liked the features of this product and the price was reasonable. It was a particularly convenient way to have a cordless available in a location where I did not have a phone jack. It worked fine for about 9 months but then one of the handsets began to malfunction. It just displays a message stating that it is Out of Service. No amount of plugging and unplugging or setting and resetting the handset will correct the problem.Based on my experience I would recommend spending your money on another product. There are certainly other choices in much the same price range that would likely offer better long term value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"This phone performed well for about the first 4 months.

So I e-mailed AT&T and explained that I do not have receipt and how should I go about getting the phone fixed and they responded by telling me to and said to forward the phone along with the Receipt.

The extra handset and charger allowed us to put the phone in either the office or the bedroom without worring about the phone jack.

We have delt with it for 2 years as we had spent a lot of money on it at the time (this sort of phone was new to the market) and the battery seems to be getting worse and worse.

The book follows these three strangers as they interact with the locals and each other. Eventually, the three strangers find just the thing their soul needed, but not before some excitement.I read this book after completing the Trust Williams series (also by Robert Farrell Smith), and found the story quite charming while still maintaining the same sense of humor that I have come to love in this author.Although there's a heart on the cover below the author's name, there isn't much of a love story feel to the book.

It was really creepy...basically its about a kid with a baseball hat and roller-skates hits random people with a golden baseball bat and everyone is wondering who it is. He gets the name Lil Slugger and a demon is born. This might be the best anime show in my opinion, but it really creeps you out. The animation is beautiful and scary and the story keeps you guessing until you find out something in the show and you start to guess with new theroys. This is defientley worth the buy, and even though the only down-fall is its only 13 episodes, its still great.

It also has some RPG/Strategy element of Freedom Force as well. You get to use Stealth and Cunning with some fights as well, starting from archery to sword fightings.

This is very annoying and distracting! My voice does not match a touch tone and does not trigger this odd behavior. The device's software should allow the user to turn off this \\"feature\\".Also, when I reboot my PC, I must reset Skype's audio settings each time, to use Vosky's USB device vs. the PC's audio ports.

Now although you will see some gruesome images, you won't see the typical \\"Saw sequels\\" and \\"Hostel\\" type gore. I enjoyed this movie for that reason because I have always enjoyed movies that set the proper atmosphere, actually much like the first \\"Saw\\", and don't spend all their time trying to be gorier than previous movies.

Weak lame scares, lame effects, and over all waste of time movie, no scary at all.

Jackson there to bring Stephen King's book to life. I liked to be creeped out when watching a good horror/drama movie, and this movie never produced anything that made you eat your popcorn that more quickly. The bulk of the movie offers mild waves of the ghosts of former tenants of Room 1408 showing up to spook Mr. Cusack, and the occasional visit from his specter of a daughter who died of cancer. Is the movie a bittersweet drama of Cusack's character coming to terms with his daughter's death, or is it a spookfest trying miserably to produce some scares? It fails in both accounts.Want to be really scared while watching a movie? Buy \\"Paranormal Activity\\" and sit back for the ride.

In point-of-fact, both of the afore mentioned entities did their jobs quite well. The product came as described and on time; so kudos to the seller and amazon. The product itself however, did not work. It played fine through about the first hour or so, somewhere right around 1:05 the movie just jumped ahead to the very end of the movie, and every time I attempted to go back to that point (or even shortly thereafter) the movie just froze up and would not go anywhere. So in order to see if it was a disc problem, I attempted to play the movie in 2 other Blu-ray players, and as expected, the same problem arose. Amazon gave me a full refund and I returned the move so all is well that ends well I suppose.

It is well made and produced for a horror, but it is not a full out horror movie. Yes it is about a haunted hotel room, but there were not that many shocking moments. This is more of a character story about a man trying to deal with the death of his daughter and his non belief in god or anything beyond the living. I think the story fails to be a balls out scarefest and it also fails to bring a full and satisfactory conclusion to his issues. Cusack does a fine jobe and a brief appearance by Jackson is also good. The ending was a little weak and the alternate endings presented in the extras are really no better.

I kept hoping that somehow it would 'pick up' and get on its feet. Unfortunately it never did, and in fact just kind of gave way to a bizarre nothingness somewhere in the middle. Basically this is about a cynical paranormal writer staying in a hotel room where all kinds of bad things happened over the years. And really? That's about it.Yet, there was so much to work with in the story. It could have been deeper, the plot more involved. The characters could have been so much more than they were. This film is a hodge-podge of mostly nebulous loose ends that never get tied up. It moves at a snails pace and you wait for something that just never happens.

However, after about an hour I couldn't watch anymore and had to give up. My husband finished it and even though he loves horror films more than I, he agrees that it was overly done, tried way too hard to be scary and have twists/turns, and just missed the boat somehow.I wish I knew what could have been done to make the movie better, but its hard to pinpoint exactly what I hated a about it... perhaps I went in expecting too much? Perhaps I was scared about the occurrences in the room because I frequently stay in hotel rooms? Or perhaps it was just a bad film? I guess you can decide if you absolutely must rent it or buy it for yourself, but I just can't give this one my endorsement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The short story was much better","review":"This movie had alot of potential - great story and excellent cast - but it didn't work well for me. There are very few King books that translate well on the big screen (with a few notable exceptions) and this one just didn't work for me. The movie really had little to do with King's story, aside from the fact that the protagonist is a writer doing a story about a 'haunted' hotel room.

The problem was everything else that WAS on screen except Cusack. There is a quote on the DVD box from the reviewer at Maxim saying this film ranks with \\"The Shining\\". He must've seen the 90's remake. This movie is not even close to anything achieved in Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\". Samuel Jackson was only in this movie for literally one scene, and it wasn't that great.

I would definitely recommend this placemat for encouraging toddlers to learn the alphabet and letter sounds. I was a little surprised that dry erase marker doesn't just wipe right off. It takes some glass cleaner and a little elbow grease, which is one reason I gave this item 4 out of 5 stars.

I don't usually approve of 'best of' collections, and usually rate them accordingly, but I'm prepared to make an exception in this case because of its completeness, variety of programming and the great value for money that this release represents.

You are in charge of creation, feeding, raising and placing them on farms. Although you have the ability create a custom dinosaur, I didn't find this an easy task.The installation was straight forward and no complications occurred, although I recommend restarting after install to make sure the game runs the first time. The game ran on 98, 2000 and XP without any problems, I did have to update to DirectX 9 for Windows ME.Also during installation I had to disable my virus scanner to complete the install. Graphics are very good and the play is good and you set the pace and build up your theme parks, etc.Overall this game is rated E for everyone and judging from the content this seems appropriate. I think that once the younger kids master the creation they are going to want more, which leads to Dino Island II."},{"rating":"2","title":"so fun I couldn\`t stop playing","review":"this game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun that i want to stay on it sooooo long! it dosent have that good of graphics though.but it has funny things in it like when the dinosaurs fart.i like that you can make shows.the best part is mutaning the dinosaurs.this is the best game ever.i hope that others get a chance to play dino island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Older Kids","review":"I have to say, this game was definitely not what I thought it would be. I was pretty disappointed. I do like the fact that you can make your own species of dinosaur, but that is about it. The graphics need a lot of work...they are very unrealistic. But I just think the whole game itself is very bla. I think it's becuase there is only one focus of the game, which is to take care of the dinosaurs and attract guests.Don't get me wrong though. This is a really good game for younger children that are learning how to use a computer. But as for older children, they would get bored with it quickly. I would suggest spending your money on another computer game like Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis or Zoo Tycoon (1 or 2). They are much more challenging and realistic, and overall more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Fencing Book","review":"Aldo Nadi was one of the greatest fencers, and his logic is still the greatest, even today. This is book is about great fencing, not the poke and hack technique (could you even call it that?) that is adopted today. If more people were to read this book, the fencing world as we know it would improve greatly. This book is about what makes the sport great-- Finesse over firepower, courtesy over barbarism, and honor over winning at all costs. Definite recommended reading for those who are already fencing, although non-fencers might find it perplexing. He does outline exactly how to come into the guard postion, how to grip the sword (assuming no pistol grip is implemented), however. Recommended reading for all people who aspire to be truly great at fencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great album","review":"the baddest band that i've ever heard or seen.there music is timeless and endless.this album was pure genius and crafty.the song-writting and production not to mention the vocals are still a cut above the rest.i play this album as much as that's the way of the world,i am,all-nall,grattitude,the hits one and two,box set,etcc. cuz this group could always give up the goods.and this record is another landmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Reviewers are Right","review":"I bought this machine to replace my old cassette-based Panasonic that had finally died from incessant telemarketer calls.The AT&T's set up was easy and all the features work, but the sound quality is unacceptably low.

Such a compelling subject and here we go .....fast food theatre....for the attention deficit CGI starved. The Prometheus relm does not set the bar very high for any sequel film expectations. This is not billed as part of the Alien franchise, oddly enough the only notable scene in the movie was the engineer getting suited up and sitting in his H.R. Geiger designed seat. A purely original shot used in the first Alien film. The first Alien movie was and still is an outstanding piece of work! Otherwise Prometheus falls short in establishing it's own presence in science fiction originality. A more intellectual approach to this paticular subject would not be unwelcome.

However this is of course is not a case with what others card I have; in Panasonic no lag and with Kingston about a 1/2 sec.This is a good card, if you are not considering in-camera write speed.

The thesis is: if you can define what an art object is then you can define what art is. I don't think this was answered. It seems to me that the arguments are so intellectualized and so abstract that they are far removed from the reality of what we call art. I've read several of the writers he mentions: Gombrich, Wolfflin, Ortega y Gassat, Tolstoy. Overall I think the critiques he offers are superficial, and edited to fit his train of thought. For example on page 102 he mentions Tolstoy's critism of the imitativeness of Wagner's art.

I suspect he is trying so hard to be anglo-analytic in his approach that he forgot that art touches the heart as well as the mind. Wollheim focuses entirely on the mind, and the mind games that ensue do little to enlighten one's understanding of art and its objects, what and why they do what they, and why they're important. This book was used in a course I had with Wollheim as a lecturer; both could not have been more boring and banal. The book was widely resold as many students didn't bother to read it, or began to read it and gave up. The consensus was nearly unanimous in irrelevance to the artist especially, and no less irrelevant to the philosophy students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Other reviews did indicate the fact that this camera is hard on batteries, but I did not realize how hard.

The last BR album I had bought before this was \\"Mia Vita Violenta...\\" which I liked pretty much instantaneously. I guess that means that the two albums are pretty different. This album has a fairly consistent tone and sound, much like their first album. Feedback, distortion and jangled melodies give rise to Sonic Youth comparisons. (In fact one song has a chord progression that sounds just like a SY song, though I can never figure out which song.) The thing I like the best about this album is that it's packed with raw agression and energy and doesn't loosen its grip.

Now, she finds herself working with a human to stop the forces that killed them. She should not even be friends with Dain, much less feel the way she does about this man. They are meant to be enemies, not lovers.** You will want to read this book quickly, for you will be anxious to see how it ends.

I can only say that she must have a \\"thing\\" for a main character letting his/her main squeeze be beaten or killed without intervening. Sorry, but if the main character, in this case the female vampire, lets her \\"love\\" get carted off to be beaten and doesn't interfere, even though she has the ability to protect him, this is just not recoverable as a relationship. I don't know what was going on between the two main characters, but love and romance it was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no way to turn it off.","review":"The user interface is bizarre - keep the manual handy, because random pushing of buttons can land you in some strange places.Their customer service confirmed that there's no way to turn it off. Maybe you should just leave the battery cover off, and the battery out when not in use?All I wanted was something to measure cumulative power usage. There are other meters that do this much more intuitively.(as for calibration: I ran it for 2.5 hrs monitoring a light with a 60w lightbulb, it measured .163kWh, which comes out to a 65.2 watt bulb. Whether the bulb was straying or the meter, I don't know.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it's worth","review":"I've had and used mine for over 2 years. I'm happy with what it does. Of course this is not a precision piece of equipment and should not be looked upon as such. As for the complaints of not being accurite using a light bulb, take them for what they are worth. There is no proof that the bulb will actually use the amount of power that it is rated for. The bulb will use more power on startup and less over time. It takes a bit more to light the filiment then to keep it lit. Bottom line is this product does what it is supposed to do. It gives you a ESTIMATE of the cost.Jon KC9AXZ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid At all costs","review":"Its not accurate. I tested with a known load over 100 hours. I plugged in a 100 watt bulb and left it on 100 hours, which should give me 10000 watts or 10 kilowatts. According to this meter, it said I used 80 kilowatts, that's that's 80,000 watts. I'd say that's just off alittle. They advertise + or - 2%. That's more then 2%.Avoid this product. Its junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It SUCKS!

Compared to other phone brands I used (Uniden and Vtech), this phone has the worst handset sound quality. The handset sound becomes overmodulated that I could not understand the other party.

There's not a whole lot of static (although more than there should be), but the voice sounds like it's been run through a \\"robot voice changer\\" toy. Well not that bad but you get the idea.

Airline Tycoon Evolution is very little bang for your buck, I'm afraid. There is an added componet to the game- an airplane model builder. It is fairly unimaginative and on my edition and those of 2 other people I have spoken to, the game will often crash. It is not a faulty driver, I have a Pentium 4 with the lastedt Nvidia graphics card installed. There is also a fault where after 30 days of Free Game play, you are required to enter a password, something like Paragraph 4, line 2, word 3 on page 19 of your manual. Unfortunatley, you have to contact the studio who are promising a patch to be downloaded from their sitr. VERY FRUSTRATING. Other than that there is very little difference between this edition and the original. Stay with the original because it looks like one junior programmer spent all of an hour making this one. It [is bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Work","review":"This game, while including some very nice expansions on the original Airline Tycoon, had some major bugs in it.For starters, parts of the text in the game were in German. Particularly the news-stand articles. Also, part of the airport announcements were done in German, and English. The copy of the game I had was supposed to be the US release version, so there should have been 0 German text to begin with.Furthermore, the planes that the player could build weren't painted in the livery of the player's airline. They were left in unpainted metal. Furthermore, the design elements were limited, and some not very attractive. It gave the aircraft a cartoonish look.Overall, I'm disappointed with Airline Tycoon: Evolution. If you ask me, it was more of a De-evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Games","review":"THis game was fun. it was a long game it also gives you all the levels form airline tycoon.

It is the most annoying games that anyone could think of.

The car adapter does work, but within 30 seconds of my cell phone registering a charge, it said it charging was complete....when it really wasn't. It took 3 hours to charge up my friend's phone with direct sun. It took 4 hours to charge up ONE PIXEL in the battery icon of my Microsoft Zune.

To be able to write superior action/fight scenes so vividly that when the female leads cracks against a wall your own breath catches. Then to handle such a romance!!--between two people wounded in every way and tentatively trying to build enough trust to mend their hearts, bodies and souls. I am in awe! Because these books are created worlds with specific language, rules, etc don't just jump in. They are all worth buying as a set and would make a great gift for someone--mending anything from a broken heart to a broken leg.

Although these characters, Cyd Brighton-former I/B OPS/junkie and Finn- the mech with heart, have peaked up in other books in the series, they belong to Maverick. The book is well written and carries on the series well. There is not a lot of sex and ouey, gooey destined to be together stuff in this book. Actually, the one making most of the doe eyes, destiny speeches, and fast come-ons is the bad guy (demon) of the tale. Instead, there are two flawed characters, one scarred inside and the other damaged outwardly who together discover that the most human of beings isn't always fully human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dissappointing","review":"After reading Liz Maverick's first book in the series I wasn't going to buy the last one, as a romance writer she sucks and should stick with Sci-fi, but I have to give her some credit the main heroes in this story wasn't too bad, but why even stick in Marius & Jill's story, it made is seem like there was another book in the works, it ruined this book for me, and I will never buy another Liz Maverick book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Features 7, Sound quality 0","review":"Yes, this machine has a lot of bells and whistles but the sound quality is so poor that I cannot understand a great many messages that are left.

Extremely simplistic sentimental plot. Gable and MacDonald have zero chemistry (Gable did not like her at all personally) and Macdonald's prima donna presence combined with her irritating singing (which there is WAY to much of)just flat out destroy this film. I'm sure the 30's audiences must have loved the special effects which I will admit are superb. Maybe this is the basis of what all the acclaim was about. Gable and Tracy are good but are given little to work with. Gable turned the role down repeatedly but was finally convinced by the studio somehow. If you want some real 30's Gable entertainment see any of the movies with he and Jean Harlow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need To Be A Big Fan","review":"I recognise that this is an important film but I think you have to be a big fan of Gables to really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast correction -(DVD, 2006) listing","review":"Just correctig some information in the listing.....

At any rate, most of the concepts presented throughout the book apply to every professional into the sea transportation and port operations areas.The first chapters look into very basic concepts, whereas the final ones are more specific. Chapter 13 (named \\"Safety\\") covers an up-to-date subject that has been of great concern all around the world.

Close-Up is all that remains of this incredible and tragically short-lived band.

Written a gripping and serious spy novel, that is. Although not as intense as his previous novels, The Kill Artist takes a top seat in the international spy genre. This international thriller, with well molded characters, will take you all the way from the Mideast to Paris and from London to Canada. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the main player in this book and Daniel Silva knows this topic well. The only problem I had with the book was the lack of gut wretching suspense that I come to expect with this type of novel (I guess I expected Ludlum). Still, a good spy novel with great characters and timely subjects, gives this one a high mark.Highly recommended for the serious international thriller fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book was a true disappointment.

Conversely, it also shows us the inner workings of the opposition. In this instance, it's Tariq- a ruthless and gifted terrorist who wants to bring problems to the Middle East Peace process. Shamron's problem solving answer, of course, is the actual artist (art restorer actually) Gabriel Allon who is the kill artist.It's a good thriller and offers some insight to issues beyond the headlines. It also demonstrates the staggering personal cost and toll of entering into such a profession and life.Silva does a good and credible job. Not a bad book and not a bad series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller of the year!","review":"This is the best book I have read in years! I was up all night reading it, couldnt put it down. Fabulous characters and great plot with shocking twists! Silva has created another fun, entertaining book. Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Human Hit Man","review":"\\"The Kill Artist\\" features, Gabriel Allon, one of the world's foremost painting restoration experts. Allon is also a former Mossad hit man. He is lured out of retirement when he is presented with the opportunity to eliminate the terrorist that destroyed his family.This book is an international espionage novel that develops at a measured pace. The action is not as fast-paced as a Robert Ludlum or a Vince Flynn novel. However, the brooding, introspective Allon seems to be a much more realistic character than the nearly superhuman Jason Bourne or Mitch Rapp.I look forward to reading the further exploits of Mr. Allon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth all the hype","review":"Daniel Silva is one of those authors whose name gradually becomes familiar. I decided to pick up some of his novels after hearing favorable reviews on his latest book. I have just finished the Kill Artist and it was......OK. In my opinion, it took a long time for the plot to develop, halfway through the book I was ready for some kind of action. I also soon grew tired of the flashbacks and wanted the story to progress in the here and now. The novel did improve near the end but by then I was just slogging through the thing.Hope the next one I read is an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long. Slow. Boring.","review":"Sorry, folks.

I want an agent, editor or publisher to tell me why this book has gotten such good reviews. Each chapter has a new cast of characters who, more than likely, tell their story in flashback. Who wants to keep a roadmap of the cast of characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book.","review":"Silva at times, made it hard to take this book seriously.I don't understand how Silva (or his editors) could think a popular supermodel who has dominated the fashion industry for 10 to 15 yrs, could be a viable candidate to be an UNDERCOVER spy.Also, the staging of the final confrontation was clumsy and predictable.This is just not a good book. Bordeline sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanaticism at its best","review":"If you wish to acknowledge that vengeance is an acceptable human trait, than this is the book for you. It very early on depicts how two very religiously driven tribes have cultivated hatred for each other. I found it to be a disgusting, although perhaps realistic portrayal of humanity and its ridiculous obsession with religious tribalism. I never bothered to finish the book. Creating heroes out of murderers driven by religion only propagates the practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Kill (a) from Silva\\"","review":"Just another great read from Silva.

There was more violence and four-letter words usuage than I had noticed in his later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro to a new series","review":"I found Daniel Silva on amazon as I find most of the authors that I end up reading; by perusing what other people who are reading the same book as I are reading. Anyway, this was an above-average spy thriller that pitted a retired Israeli agent against a militant Palestinian who was/is bent on destroying the Middle East peace process. Since this book was written almost 8 years ago and there is still no \\"peace\\" in the Middle East this book is just as interesting today as it was when it was written.Recommended - and can't wait to read the next books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre spy thriller","review":"The characters were boring, the bad guys acted stupidly, it never really take off.

The Kill Artist was not as polished The Fallen Angel, but is, nevertheless, a good read for those who enjoy spy thrillers with lots of twists and turns. I look forward to getting my hands on The English Assassin, the second book in the series. A solid four star novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Spy Story","review":"I'm a fan of spy novels in general, and other reviewers are right, Daniel Silva is the heir apparent to John LeCarre. In fact - dare I say it? - I prefer Silva. Silva's writing meanders less than LeCarre's and Silva gets to the point faster without throwing style overboard. It's nice to read a spy novelist who's returned to the European theatre, and with a brooding, cultured protagonist -- which is what we get with the character Allon. The subsequent books in the Allon series are also very good, but you should start with this one if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill Artist","review":"I keep giving away my copies of this book, so this time I'm keeping it for my personal library!

Always well written with a credible plot and the end is never what you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Michael and Delaroche","review":"This was an exciting, interesting, thriller, well worthy of four stars. However, the book was a dissapointment to me, since it was nowhere near as good as either of Silva's previous efforts. The main characters in this book simply can't compare to Osbourne and Delaroche, and I think he'd do better to resurrect those characters than to stick with Gabriel(which, unfortunately, he appears to have done for his next book). Also, why have Peel at all if you aren't going to develop that story, and why set up the whole Gabriel/Jackie thing if it is going to fizzle out as it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un-put-downable","review":"In the murky world of Islamic terror, Tariq is one of the few people that Israel actually fears. This book is set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace talks and the possibility that Tariq needs to be stopped before he does something terrible to derail the process. I had thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" and this book was \\"un-put-downable\\". The contrast of the quiet art restorer's life in Cornwall with the action-packed lifestyle of the man chosen to put down Tariq is incredible. His character is given enough pain through the loss of a wife and child a decade earlier. All-in-all a terrific book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always something for the end","review":"Silva sticks to a theme he seems to know well with charaters that have been interesting to his readers. As a result, some of the suspense is lost. However, it was enjoyable and kept me turning the pages when I probably should have been doing something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced thriller with interesting characters","review":"Silva's spy thriller has multi-faceted characters, an interesting plot, and makes the reader long for the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Kill Artist","review":"I have become a Daniel Silva fan and I enjoyed this book, but it was not one of those books that you feel like you can't put down/stay up all night types. His more recent books are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flawed Worldview","review":"Let me start by saying that I did not finish the book. I made it about 2/3s of the way through before I put it down. It was not that the book was boring; the story about terrorism and counterterrorism was somewhat compelling. The problem was with the characterizations, especially of the protagonist, Gabrielle Allon. I read this book based on a recommendation of the author by an online pundit. I think I know why he recommended the author; his worldview, at least as it comes across in his blog, is pragmatic. This is a pragmatic book. There were no \\"good guys\\" in this book; there were no heroes. The message of this book is that to beat the \\"bad guys\\" we have to become like them; we have to become \\"bad guys\\" as well. This is a thoroughly pragmatic worldview, and it left me feeling \\"slimed\\". Perhaps if I had finished it I would have discovered something uplifting. But life is too short sometimes, and I have other books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"Can Amazon explain why you can buy the book for 7 dollars with the added expense of printed pages, while digitally with very low overhead it is $10? I like my kindle but will continue to frequent local bookstores unless Amazon can be more reasonable in their pricing of older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perdictable","review":"The book was well written. The subject matter was typical when it involves Israeli spies vs Palestian spies. Israelis are the good guys, oh so clever, Palestians the not so noble ones.

Lauren Springer gardens in Colorado and understands the harsh mid-continental climate and its challanges to gardeners trying to create beautiful, yet durable landscapes. The book is divided into sections addressing both plant types (e.g. annuals, perennials, roses, etc.) and site conditions (e.g. hot & dry, shady). Numerous color photographs are throughout the book and a section in the back highlights a goodly number of what she considers excellent plants for harsh climate gardens. The only drawback to this book is that she recommends many plants which are difficult to locate commercially.

Yes, it's plastic and we needed to make a hole in our hard, rock-filled Arkansas ground before pushing the stake in. But once set up it's great.

It sounds nothing like his film scores. It is dissonant, and often difficult to listen to. But it is usually a rewarding experience. What it lacks in melodic themes, it makes up for in colorful orchestations and moments of striking beauty. The third movement of Treesong is a good example of this. It begins on a note that seems out of place, but eventually resolves.Not everything can or should sound like Star Wars. Film music, by its very nature requires a differnet kind of writing. There is certainly room for Williams to write concert music in a modernistic style that departs from the Wagnerian influence of his movie scores. Oh well.

Yes, the book uses the language of very good behavioral sciences, and that is appropriate. With all the headline things that have happened in the world with schools, its important that major leaders in schools have good grounding in practical science of behavior change.

After reading it I was very disappointed, however because of the ending or lack there of. I felt like I had read this whole book and was expecting it to all tie together in the end or at least get some answers but I got neither! It seemed to me that all this book was is a format that layed the groundwork and storyline for her next book. I will think twice before I buy another one of her books. It is really too bad because I had read every one of her books and loved each and every one except this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she just get tired of writing?","review":"I'm at a loss. This book started out gang-busters, typical Collins ..... lots of raunchy sex, bitchy characters, the hooker with the heart of gold, the handsome underdog. With not a lot of character development, Collins weaves a fast-paced plot that keeps you turning the page. But all of a sudden, you start to feel like you're in one of those restaurants where the waiters try to rush you out the door so they can seat more customers. Detail and explanation are deemed unimportant ...... Collins rushes at breakneck pace to finish, and then just stops. Instead of telling the rest of the story -- and believe me, there's plenty left to tell -- she just ends it and gives you a few-sentence description of what happened to each character. I felt so cheated. I would rather invest my time in a well-developed story that actually has an evolved ending. Oh yeah, that's Nora Roberts! So long, Jackie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is The Worst Yet","review":"I am an avid reader of JC and I always love all of her books. However, this one didnt quite do it for me.

Madison Castelli is a great charcter, along with her best friend Jamie.I am really glad that Madison and Jake finally hit it off in this book. AND what a romance it is......As usual, JC leaves you clinging to your seat. I found myself, a few times skimming forward, trying to get a peek at was was going to happen next.

I rated this a 4star because -I rate everything by her best work - CHANCES. The main character, Madison, and her friends were very interesting and live that fast paced life among the powerful, rich and famous, want-to-be-famous. She does the dark side of the new characters well (sex, drugs, rock n' roll) and she ties up everything in the last chapters - just the way I love it. This book was Fun, Fast and a Quick Read! There were two characters that I know she is going to do books just about them - SHE HAS TO! (oops, did I sound like Kathy Bates?) I cannot give the names away - I cannot spoil it for those who haven't read it. Don't wait for paperback - this is goooood. I'm left wanting more - there should be a prequel!!!!

First, she made no effort to keep us interested by fully developing her characters. Half the fun is figuring out how all the people fit together, which normally culminates in a spectacular and shocking conclusion. At the end, I felt cheated and annoyed that I spent the money on a hardcover edition, which I usually do because I can't wait for her paperbacks. No suspense, no surprises . . . she has officially written her first dud.

She didn't expand on the relationship between Madison and Michael. Where is the author that wrote the Lucky Santangelo novels. That was great writing!

This may be the worst book I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, and the characters are so one-dimensional that they seem to exist solely to allow the author to mention protuberant body parts.

Characters are very shallow and totally unbelievable. The book is a repository for every conceivable thought that any of the characters might ever think about sex. In fact, that's all the book is about---sex. And not good sex at that. The extreme and gratuitous vulgar and obscene language adds to the lack of depth not only of the characters but of the book itself.

I'm no prude (I don't think a prude would read more than one of Collins' books!) but this is 90% filler, with honestly boring sex chatter. Also WAY, WAY too many passages with things like \\"Madison ate a salad for dinner. Then she took the dog for a walk. Then she returned 16 phone messages, first from ..., then from...,\\" You get the idea? This whole annoying story could have been told in about 30 pages.

Jackie flounders for words while Joan just creates shear poetry. Here, this book is a rehash of other works by Jackie. Romance is dead in this opus, and it is extreemly disappointing to see Jackie reusing old plot lines once more. Here we have it all over again, the woman in danger, the man who may or may not be a hired killer, and another man who wants to save her... it's not just \\"been there, done that\\", the writing is a poor quality. The story drags on far too long and it's almost as if Jackie is begging us to put it down and go out for a walk. While Joan's prose is crisp and invigerating, Jackie wallows in conformity and boredom.

The story first strives, unsuccessfully, to be poignant, then once Roget's has been exhausted, the author seemingly tacks-on some wholly implausible drama to stretch out what really is short story material.

The movie, like his prior work, looks great on paper, but when it is finished it is a jumbled mess, that watching more than once will only serve to confuse the viewer even more. This film should be filed under art-house. It is a statement, not necessarily open to interpretation, but definitely not for the casual movie patron.

I absolutely love this movie, and I had to watch it three times before I understood what the hell was happening.There is a reason why the tagline on the film's poster is \\"Everything is connected.\\" Every single scene, event, and character is involved in the same plot! The reason why that may not be apparent is because of the keyword here, SUBTLETY. That's why I love Syriana; I can watch it over and over and still notice new connections, new subplots, and new revelations. If you want a film full of predictable conflicts and resolutions, stock characters, and a soundtrack ripped off of a \\"Now That's What I Call Music!\\" album, go rent \\"Failure to Launch\\" or some other dime-a-dozen feel-good film.

Addicts use all kinds of rationalizations to defer the spotlight from their bad behavior. That's how this multi-plotted film plays out. Several story threads ultimately come together in a somewhat grey tale of corruption, at both the corporate and the government levels. This is a moral tale about how far down the dark path the country has gone to feed its addiction to oil, as a nation with only a small fraction of the globe's population, but a huge percentage of global oil consumption. George Clooney does well here, and I usually don't like Hollywood message movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"effective use of subplots and makes a strong point","review":"Overall the movie took time to understand, in trying to figure out how each sub storyline came together you'll discover how things we don't think about much affect others in a much greater sense. but if you pay attention closely this movie makes a strong point in our political system and our need for foreign resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoughtful entertainment","review":"Excellent movie.

Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan. However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.

Every scene buries whatever pertinent, relevent piece of information it conveys in static. You'll still be waiting for the ultimate point of most scenes to be releaved when they end. After the 20th scene that seemed to have no relevence to any previous scene I pretty much stopped paying attention. Despite writing and direction being credited to Stephen Gaghan the film bears so much similarity the tv series K Street produced by Soderbergh and Clooney that I'd assume they were calling the shots in the editing room if not restructuring the script to fit their cryptic style. I assume even those who were dedicated enough to work out what the film is actually about would have to admit that the statement could have been driven home better with a more coherent narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold off on buying this 1st edition","review":"Definitely worth renting, but if I were you I'd wait until either Warner Bros or Criterion releases the deluxe edition. I've heard Stephen Gaghan speak in person on his film and simply can't believe he doesn't have an incredible amount of backstory and commentary to be expanded on a future dvd edition. \\"Featurettes\\" and deleted scenes - that's all you get here? Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"I've read a few reviews that complain the movie is too confusing and needs to be viewed more than once. I found the film to be complex, yet the general theme of oil/greed/international intrigue/politics was pervasive and held it together nicely. It therefore is enjoyable seeing it a couple of times - always something new to pick up on. Great stuff!!!If you enjoy this, read Robert Baer's book 'See No Evil.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and complicated","review":"I found this film rather boring. It was too complicated and too long. Most of the time I wasn't even sure of what was going on. I have seen Geroge Clooney in much better films."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Maybe I'm stupid, but I have no idea what this movie was about. Something to do with oil and coruption. But other than that, I couldn't really figure out who the characters were and what they were doing. The cast was WAY too big and the storylines kept jumping around so fast that by the time it got back around to what George Clooney was doing I had forgotten what he did in the scene prior to that. I was completely lost in this very confusing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie. Political, long, hard to follow, no real plot.","review":"Trust me, I like Clooney, but this movie is aweful. I kept wondering when the storyline was going to tie together, but it never really does. It looks just like another political movie trying to get their conspiracy out. It is not action packed either like the previews suggest and is instead dull and very uneventful, much of the movie is blogged with pointless rhetoric. Very one sided whether you are democratic, republican, independant or indifferent. Two thumbs down. Not worth watching for free let alone worth paying for. Clooney's worst flick. If you like Clooney and the middle east may I suggest Three Kings and The Peacemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 2 hours of your life","review":"This is a truly awful movie that contains some fine acting, a fact which causes me to feel guilty about hating it so much. With 290+ reviews, I'm not going to write anything of length, except to say that when you see the end of the movie, you'll be astonished that all the pseudo-virtuosic storytelling techniques--which made it so tediously complicated, a mental exercise nowhere approaching entertainment or edification--simply resulted in a display of the most banal stereotypes imaginable. If you react like I did, you'll hate yourself for sticking with it to its incredibly trite end, because the payout, after a lot of labor, is really scant.What a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop making shaky movies!","review":"Is there a tripod shortage in this world?

In a very realistic way, it incorporated all the many elements that really go into decisions and actions re: foreign policy and big oil. The writing, acting, and directing was ALL superb. The movie stays with you long after you leave the theater. I did have to close my eyes at the torture scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed by the story","review":"Although I like Clooney's and Damon's acting, this film left me with the impression that I lost two hours watching it without gaining anything valuable. The complex politics of the oil industries and the connections with corrupted Middle East governments is a common secret today as are the roots of islamic terrorism, but this movie simply could not produce something new and strong enough to catch the attention, with the exception of some very brutal scenes indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"This movie is so disjointed, so convuluted as to be nothing about something. Think of a New Orleans Jazz band with each instrument playing a totally different song at the same time and you have this movie in a nutshell. Too many strings left untied, too many subplots within subplots. I saw this movie because I generally like George Clooney movies but this isn't near one of his best. To quote a character from \\"JFK', It's a riddle wrapped in an enigma. It's also not worth your time seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Too Convoluted","review":"Too many storylines! The scenes jumped around all the time. The filmmakers didn't blend the the storylines in \\"Syriana\\" very well together, so it left the movie ending hanging out there as to what the meaning of the movie was really suppose to be.The only redeeming feature was the acting and the cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many stars","review":"OK if you like to watch CNN and could make a boring (I mean I think more than half the audience I was with fell asleep, they were sleeping through the credits at the end and people had to wake them up) movie about oil and corruption. OK good thought went into the story but time drug like a doctor office waiting room. I give it 1 star because I see to many of you gave it 4-5 stars.

It's long, it's boring, and it's hard to follow. I kept watching thinking that the film would \\"pick up\\" at some point, but before I knew it, the credits were rolling. I disliked this movie so much that I threw it in the garbage as soon as I took it out of my DVD player. I wish I had the 128 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Anti-American/ Pro Arab Movie","review":"This was a Very Anti-American/ Pro Arab Movie in my opinion..I hate that Matt Damon played in this movie, because I liked him. I expected it from George Clooney. Our Country isn't perfect, but we do more good than harm in the World. I hope all those that watch this Movie don't believe everything (or even half) of what this movie portrays. Movies like this try to kill American Pride.. F U Clooney and Damon..

And no...It's not because I don't understand the subject matter. It's another Clooney message movie, but this one can't really decide what message it wants to convey. Someone needs to remind George that a movie should actually have a plot and a at least one character that the audience will give a damn about. What a waste of time and popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SORRY DEMOCRAT RANT","review":"A political rant about oil companies, which will be dragged out of the closet whenever a Republican is President and put back into the closet whenever a beloved Democrat is President.The name of the oil company is, of course, \\"CON\\"nex, so that the political fanatics who this film was made for can be sure to instantly recognize the universal symbol of their devil, conservative businessmen who keep a woman and children in the house and who don't partake of the radical ideologies of communism, the welfare state or Islam that inflame all liberals.The basic plot is idiotically childish. There is no reform in the middle east because the United States in conjunction with big oil has assassinated the only liberal reformer, who believes in woman's rights, ever known to wear a white Arab's dress. Why? Because he was planning on selling our oil to China at higher prices than we pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Convoluted Disconnected Hard-to-follow Mess of a Film","review":"Syriana was directed by Gaghan, the screenwriter for Traffic. Though not a fan of that film at least you had Soderbergh's direction and could follow the plot lines. Here we have so many vignettes that (in spite of the tagline) are disconnected, you quickly lose interest. There are no human characters to care about here. There are torture scenes, terrorism scenes, sophisticated sounding lawsuit dialogue you can't make head or tail of. George Clooney just finished a very good film, \\"Goodnight and Good Luck\\", and though this film gives him more onscreen time than others, it's still not enough to make us care about his character, a CIA pawn. Matt Damon you care about even less in his role as oil liaison whose wife is only there to fill out the background.Syriana utilizes a certain style of filmmaking, which some may like: shaky camerawork, convoluted dialogue, and fuzzy plotline. I prefer human drama where you care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syriana? SorryIsawit!","review":"I want a refund. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. For one thing, it has NOTHING to do with the book it claims to be based on. The book, \\"See No Evil\\", unabashedly blames many of our current intelligence woes on the Clinton administration. The movie tries to make the political statement that a bunch of yahoo Texas wildcatters are the puppeteers pulling the strings of the United States Government.Not only is it a bad, fictional re-write of a compelling real-life book, but it is terrible entertainment. There is absolutely no reason for Matt Damon's character, or his family to exist. His character doesn't have any affect on the outcome of anything that happens in the movie.Read the book....skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syri-Sucka...","review":"This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The details are wrong, the big picture is inexistant","review":"The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent. I won't bore you with the list.All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake. Tell us something new.The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line. A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasnt expecting the tragic ending!!! Good movie tho.","review":"Bought this cause of George Clooney......didnt expect them to kill the main character!! Wow. intreque,spys,princely envy,got it all, even some \\"brutality\\" against George; then there was the bombing of the navy ship!

It wasn't \\"bad\\", but it wasn't \\"good\\" either. And more resembled a TV mini-series lumped together for a few hour movie. Barely 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break","review":"The story line of this film is a complete muddle! They tried to toss everything into this movie but the kitchen sink. This film makes the movie Heavens Gate look like a masterpiece as far as a story line that can be followed and making sense. To me it seems this film was just thrown together to make a buck by including anything and everything to cover any and all bases! What a hodgepodge mess! And people paid to sit through this in movie theaters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I want my hour and a half back. This was the most boring movie I've seen in the last several years. I don't know how they got Damon and Clooney, and all the other top level stars to contribute to it. The money must have been real good.It sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Disjointed","review":"Maybe if I read some of the story line ahead of time I would have enjoyed it more but I just couldn't put it together. Too many different characters and plots without the connecting dots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaay overrated!!!","review":"God, I would rather pay $4.00 a gallon than see Syriana again. This is one of those movies that you THINK you're supposed to like, buy you don't really know afterward. I've seen complicated movies that are good and/or fun to watch. Syriana is NOT one of them. The one part that was entertaining at all was the scene with the caravan of vehicles, one of which gets targeted and destroyed with a bomb. That alone had some suspense and generated interest as I watched it unfold. Otherwise, this movie was a bomb itself. It features great actors (Clooney, Alexander Siddig, etc.) but just isn't worth the money or the time. I'm sure many will disagree with me, but it's my personal opinion, and that's all it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, boring mess","review":"This movie is listed as a thriller on Netflix, but there is nothing thrilling about it. It is very slow paced, particularly since it is only 126 minutes long-it felt much longer than that (like Lord of the Rings long). It is also hard to follow because it jumps all over the place and the cast seems to be in the hundreds. George Clooney plays the stereotypical amoral CIA agent who becomes disillusioned with his work. Matt Damon plays the fast talking energy trader with starry-eyed dreams of reforming the Middle East. Then there are the cartoonish Texas oil men, US politicians, CIA types, Arabs, and Chinese. This movie is just more conspiracy theory junk about how the American government and oil industry is bad and the Arabs are helpless, good people that are being exploited. I couldn't wait for it to end-not even worth renting."},{"rating":"2","title":"a disquietingly \\"realistic\\" feel","review":"George Clooney and Matt Damon would be enough reason for me to see this movie. I think they're both truly fine actors, and I always take great pleasure in watching them work. Even though they don't interact directly in this film, their presences and performances add brilliant facets to a gem that's far from a mere bauble.This film wants several consecutive viewings, especially if the viewer tends to blink often, but that may be a strong argument for seeing it the first time. There is much afoot, and none of it appears connected ... until ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clooney BAD actor","review":"Clooney has NO RANGE as an actor!!!! I can't be the only one to see this?!?! He plays George Clooney in evey role, no change in voice or attitude! C'mon Hollywood, Just because they have a pretty face or because their folks were in the show bus means we have to suffer through a lifetime of bad acting! How bout people with talent!!! Oh, Yeah this movie stinks too!! Terrorists are misunderstood, and the US is evil, yeah right!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"This is the most hyped and overrated movie of the last several years. The filmmakers spend more time trying to justify how important and relevant this movie should be than actually telling a story. It tries to answer many questions, but the questions are never clear and in the end we don't really care what the point; if any, is supposed to be. The result; a two hour wreck that doesn't go anywhere.Difficult to believe that the people behind the excellent \\"Traffic\\" are responsible for this turkey. Clooney is not that good of an actor and actually he has been better in many other films. The fact that he won an Academy Award for this one is unbelievable.Summarizing, get \\"Traffic\\" instead. If you have already seen \\"traffic\\" watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, bad sound","review":"Boring and bad sound. This is a largly conversational movie. I had to keep fiddling with the DVD remote to hear the whispering or low voice sequences then again to turn it down during the blaring music non-dialogue \\"action\\" scenes. Also I found the subtitles totally annoying. I'd preferred to listen to most of it instead while puttering around the house since there was not that much in this movie that really needed to be seen to be understood.It did, however, give a little bit of insight into Arab life, their rulers and the motivation of various factors and factions working against them. Might have worked far better as a documentary, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, unconventional, educational","review":"Syriana is loosely based on Bob Baer's book 'See No Evil'. The creative license taken with Baer's book serves us well, and we end up with a complex, entertaining, and somewhat educational look at America's involvement in the middle east. I've heard complaints about the plot being too complex and hard to follow. This isn't a 'boy gets girl' or 'good guys vs. bad guys' movie. It shows some of the complexities involved with foreign relations, particularly as it relates to oil, middle-eastern monarchs and terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly, the poor reviews were spot on","review":"I was aware of this film's poor reviews going in, but it's George Clooney - how bad can it be? Well, pretty bad. I could forgive the self-righteousness of this film, but not the mess that is the screenplay. I spent the first hour wondering when the disjointed plot elements would come together, and the second half realizing they probably never would. To compare this movie to Traffic is a flattery it does not deserve. Basically what you get is a rather confused propaganda piece that can be summed up this way: US government: bad. Oil companies: extra, extra bad. Clearly, Mr. Clooney the politician got ahead of Mr. Clooney the actor on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and hard to follow","review":"There's a lot of action and the acting is fine, but what in the world is going on in this film? The main point is made that oil causes corruption, greed, killing, and maiming, but figuring it all out was very frustrating for this viewer. Better to skip this one, despite the casting of fan favorites George Clooney and Matt Damon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take this one too seriously","review":"This movie is entertaining. It really is a good thing to watch, but only if you keep in mind that it is a movie. It is not a newscast, not a documentary, its just a movie. I am sympathetic to those who don't want to attack our use of oil for fear of upsetting the economy. But they are taking things too far by claiming its propaganda. Its not, its just a decent movie. That's all. So watch this one and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDED A BETTER SCRIPT WRITER","review":"SYRIANA is a jumbled, confused mess as far as its plot is concerned. However, George Clooney is always watchable. Recommended for psuedo intellectual film buffs who like to sort out cryptic plots over a Starbucks and maybe for those seeking validation of any number of wacko conspiracy theories regarding oil companies and mid-east oil riches.

Save your money or at least rent it before you even think about buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, convoluted and somewhat incoherent","review":"I like a story different than the traditional cookie-cutter plots, so I can't give it just one star. But the movie was boring - you have to really pay attention and figure out what is going on, otherwise you just watch and very little seems to make coherent sense. That is, there are several plotlines running at once and you are trying to figure out how they are connected - by the time the movie is over you have an idea, but then it's too late to be involved with any of the characters because you haven't figured out to have sympathy for. Of course, all the big oil guys are bad guys, which is typical hollywood - governments = good, corporations = bad. Yet, if you think about it, evil corporations kill many fewer people than evil governments and are far easier to overthrow. I don't recommend this movie - I regret renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on","review":"This movie has been referred to as being like Traffic because of the multiple plot threads. This may be, but unlike Traffic I found the effect disjointed and uninteligible. It's not that it is difficult to follow per se, the issue is that you have multiple stories that you don't care about and that have no impact on you as the viewer. Four of us watched Syriana together (so I was not alone) and not one of us understood the point of it come the end. I will not pass on the actual words used to describe it other than to say very poor would have been much kinder.One to miss"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"If you like movies like Winter's Bone, No Country for Old Men and etc, this is probably for you.

It's certainly quite a complex situation, but we seem to go about foreign policy with an ineptitude unpraralleled in the destruction it indirectly leaves behind. For the first time, the US is directly affected by the byproduct of our own machinations, Islamic Revolutionary Fundamentalism.

This had zero entertainment value to me, and I was confused about the plot...it isnt anything but political propaganda garbage with a Michael Moore type slimy feel to it.Politically, I'm all over the map; I'm an issue-voter. This film wont appeal to anyone unless they hate President George Bush and blame him for everything wrong on the planet but FFS! Cant Hollywood make a film that doesnt have politics in it? I wouldnt like this even if I did blame Bush for AIDS, canine blindness, feline diabetes, and infant spiral-notebook injuries.The last thing I want to see in a movie is someones personal political agenda. I havent been this mad since the movie JFK.I cant wait for a democrat to be elected just to get the Bush-bashing to stop so I dont have to endure garbage like this (and have to pay for it to boot).

If they want the corruption stopped due to dealing with the middle east, why don't they support drilling in America.I realize those of us who watched this are suppose to support anti-oil groups due to the corruption. Not every person dealing with oil is corrupt. Those who made this movie are the corrupt ones. They are the ones who traveled in planes. They are the ones who traveled in limos. They are the ones who used jeeps and automobiles to make the movie. Oil was required to make this movie. You in hollywood need to shut up! Why don't you in hollywood develop a business to build automobiles that do not require oil/gas? Oh yeah, you just want others to do that.

They must have paid the actors involved even more than usual to get them to participate in this film. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propogandistic fiction from Hollywood","review":"This movie got 1 star from me after watching the sanctimonious interviews in the featurettes. The viewer is urged to become politically involved about events that are entirely fictional. Oil companies killing world leaders to get contracts away from the Chinese?

Nothing new, no insights or informative portrayals. Like, all headline and no bodycopy.The writer/director's aim seems all for style's sake.

I got sick at the end of the movie but very happy because the director of the movie made me feel the \\"safe and comfort\\" with the accuracy of the missiles we throw since the Persian gulf. Don't waste your money in this movie unless you hate the mid-east world as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interview with Writer","review":"Just a bit of insight to everyone who wants to take this movie for real life. I watched an interview on my HDNET channel with the writer and he said he traveled the middle east, met with oil officials, and more but ultimately created fictional characters and circumstances to make the movie more dramatic and gripping when asked. A bit of advice, enjoy movies but don't take them for a history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of King Phillips War","review":"This tome is a first person report by someone who was there and did it. Col. Benj Church was both a colonist and arespected soul by both whites and natives alike. He was deeply respected in that he kept his word to the natives but held to the position of the incursive white settlers. Church in his dotage retells his story through this diary written and later published by his son. It is noteworthy for its historical accuracy as it is chilling in the retelling of combat with the forces of King Phillip (Metacom). This was a bloody war and costly in lives lost making it, in some estimations, the costliest war on America's shores. Good reading for the average person. Informative reading to the local historian who might know the shores and trails of Southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, just terrible.","review":"This looks like a vanity press book.

The author was obviously shooting for something, making his protagonist so obnoxious and unlikeable. Unfortunately, he's not a good enough writer to make the reader like him because of his obnoxiousness. He's not an antihero, just some guy you wish (by about page 25) had been blown to smithereens like the rest of California.Did I mention there's no sign of an editor?

The infectious tango track from the movie, (which was even used again for the title page on DVD), is conspicuously NOT there, nor any waltz, rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN SCHOOL KIDS WHO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING! Sure, the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film, but that was only about half the music in the film. And in this case, the absence of ballroom dancing tracks, for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable. There should be a disclaimer on the cover of this CD to warn away anyone looking for the great, danceable tango, waltz, etc. tracks that were in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack.

I checked out the CD music and wondered 'HEY, were we even watching the same movie'?? If all you put on the soundtrack is the hip-hop, it completely misrepresents the film -- which is about ghetto kids learning ballroom, tango and swing, y'all. I was waiting for the swing piece from the dance-school scene and that dynamite, blow-you-away tango that the teacher uses to to lure the kids into learning ballroom ... but those are nowhere to be heard. BAD IDEA! If I wanted straight hip-hop, I wouldn't have been looking for this soundtrack: I'd go straight to the source. As it is, I was looking for the **other** music used for the film. And it's not there. For that reason alone, if I could give this NO stars, I would. The producers need to get a clue here.

Truly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This book is a great guide to gardening in the Mid-Atlantic. Each featured plant has its own page, with all kinds of detailed information from when and how to plant to how to care for it. The authors also include their personal favorites. Sometimes it goes a bit overboard, like with the section on how to prepare soil -- I can't imagine anyone doing what they recommend -- but overall it's got lots of great advice for a gardener with no or some experience. It was the first book I bought for my new garden, and I've returned to it again and again. I've even brought it with me to nurseries with pages flagged for the plants I want to purchase. One time a person who worked at a nursery told me that some of the plant hybrids were a bit out of date, but that's a minor quibble."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA RP2410 CD Player is a piece of crap","review":"...

Even with the ESP off the CD playback had crackling noise which I don't understand at all. Someone at RCA needs to be fired for this, bad quality, but cool grey design. I think I might return the insides and frame the shell. Piece of!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"I bought this unit because of its cool display. And I have to give it that--it has a great display and great sound. It supports surround sound and DBBS. It can also recharge batteries. The problem is that everything else is pure garbage. You can't listen to quiet music--there is no volume setting between \\"mute\\" and \\"too loud.\\" It take about 90 second to read a disc. The hiss while jogging is pretty bad, and there isn't even a belt clip!After opening the box, it cut off at the end of the first song I played. As it started to play the next song, it froze. Yes froze, just like a Windows computer. I couldn't stop it or anything. I opened the cover, removed the CD, and it still kept spinning. I had to remove the batteries to reset it.I've been listening to it play three songs as I wrote this review, and it cut off before the end of all of them. This is going back tomorrow. Heck, this one might be going back yet tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem with RCA RP2410","review":"I bought an RCA RP2410 this week and proceeded to try it and found that it only plays pre-manufactured CDs well. Anything I've made either won't play at all, or will play a song, but then refuse to start the next track. I decided to look for reviews of this player online, and found just one here, which, by the way, says the same thing I've encountered. Haven't tried one of my own MP3 discs on it, but will make one and try, but even if it does work, I'm likely to return it, because the product still only delivers half of what it promises, that is it plays MP3s but will not play CD-Rs.

It skips, it pops, it jumps-all without external jostling, despite the claims of high skip protection. At one point I observed it listing a different song than the one playing! After a period of 'warm-up' much of this difficulty disappeared, however, these problems, coupled with the unusual power requirements (4 AA batteries or an 8-volt power adapter-this is a difficulty because car power adapters do NOT come in 8-volt, rather they jump from 7.5 to 9, following the standard 1.5v battery progression), make this a horrid purchase. Of course, the age of this model may be a factor. I hope RCA makes a new one and learns from this mistake of a model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Doesn't support disk at once! Skips like crazy on most CDR especially with mp3 data! Slight hiss in audio! display needs backlight! I tried all sorts of media to test this device on, sometimes it played ok, (by ok I mean not skipping constantly) and other times it sounded like I was holding down the >> and << at the same time. The player was very slow at starting up especially on mp3 CDR. The hiss in the audio was mainly annoying in between tracks---(a longer wait than normal)---but not as much as some i've tried. The display isn't backlit so you have to hold it just right to see what song is selected. On the good side, the anti skip feature worked well... You can shake the heck out of it and no skips especially with mp3 media, aside from the normal non-shock induced skipping that occurs on most cds that play just fine in a PC CDROM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy This!","review":"I've tried everything I know and still the same problems mentioned.It still skips several minutes aheadfor no reason when you least expect it.

My opinion is to look elsewhere for a portable MP3 solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a great cd player for the price. Good sound, and good quality. To the people that complain about this and other cd players skipping, read the packaging better. Some cd players sold still have little or no non-skip ability. If it doesn't say it on the package it doesn't have it. In addition regular, heavy duty, and some of the cheaper akaline batteries won't last long.

First problem was the first unit I brought home was defective, brand new in the package. After a swap out, I used this thing on and off until I finally got enough NiMH rechargeables to be able to swap. Now that I'm using it constantly, here's the rundown. This seems to be VERY temperature sensitive. After warming up, it seems to work reasonably well. Until then, it will skip through the first 4 or 5 songs randomly. Then, the volume control is digital, and there is DEFINITELY not enough volume for my use (in car thru cassette). The backlight problem seems trivial until you run into it. I don't believe this is a reasonable alternative to the RioVolt SP250 from what I've read lately, and the prices for all the units seemed to have dropped precipitously recently from when I purchased this. Don't compromise unless you are TRULY strapped for the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy it","review":"I have the same problems as everyone else mentioned.

I bought this because I was impressed with the screen and figured that the decoder can't be all that different from the Rio. However, all the CDs which played fine on my Rio SP100 and Memorex 8507 popped, skipped and squealed. Needless to say, I returned the unit. Now it is available with car kit included, but I wouldn't buy it until they fix all the problems.

Next is the soulful \\"Tell Me When U Need It Again\\" with a nice synth beat, followed by the rockin \\"Climbing Up The Ladder\\" which includes some electrifying lead guitar playing by Ernie, who I would rate as one of the finest axmen of all time. The beautiful \\"Voyage To Atlantis\\" proves that nobody can sing a ballad like Ronald Isley and, once again, check out Ernie's wailing guitar, as it sets the tone for this gorgeous song.

What sets this album apart is the beautiful ballards contained in this collection: \\"Footsteps in the Dark\\" and \\"Voyage to Atlantis,\\" one of the best slow jams ever. Ronnie Isley's vocals are yearning and sexy on these two classic slow jams. It is these two tunes, and the slow jams on other Isley Bros. albums of the '70's, that would set the Isley Bros. apart from their contemporaries. \\"The Pride,\\" \\"Tell Me When You Need It Again,\\" \\"Climbin' Up the Ladder\\" and \\"Livin'In the Life\\" are examples of party music at its best; driving funk that makes you move.

Then it's really a win-win situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book will cost you money. The recommended play is too loose pre-flop, and too tight/passive post-flop. For example, cards that add to 20 or 21 are recommended starting hands. The problem is that weak offsuit broadway hands are big losers in early position. Postflop, this book is too much like Lou Krieger's \\"fit or fold\\" nonsense.As a guy whose first holdem book was Ken Warren's Winners Guide to Texas Holdem, believe me when I say it took me years to unlearn some of this garbage. Warren is confused. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Ken, but the book sucks","review":"Now that online poker literally pays all my bills, I can come back to this book with a much deeper understanding of the game (and this book). Let me start off: there are much better limit hold 'em books for the beginner. The advice is weak-tight and the starting preflop hands are far from optimal (I think he recommends limping J9s in middle position and other -EV advice). Also, there is a lot of useless information for the beginner - specifically statistics. A beginner shouldn't be worrying about how many combinations of hands there are or how often we get dealt a pocket pair.. NO. they should be worried about the reasoning behind the preflop raise or why not to call a preflop raise with KJo from a tight player in early position."},{"rating":"1","title":"plenty of better poker books out there","review":"This is a terrible book. I am shocked to see the average rating of 4 stars. Even if i changed my mind and said this book is OK, why would you purchase it when you can buy GREAT poker books instead? For absolute beginners, get \\"Poker for Dummies\\". Then if you want to learn more, move on to learn Limit hold'em. I suggest Lee Jones' \\"Winning Low Limit Hold'em\\" or Ed Miller's \\"Small Stakes Hold'em\\". Then move onto No-Limit hold'em, i suggest Dan Harrington's \\"Harrington on Hold'em\\" series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned.","review":"I've just started playing Hold 'Em in big casual games. I can play competently but have no knowledge of advanced strategies and odds and everything that makes you an actual good player. So after a quick persual of the selection of books I bought this one. Within 10 minutes of reading it at home I knew I had made a mistake. The first red flag was when I was reading the author's introduction...this man has no championship credentials whatsoever. The most impressive claim they can come up with is \\"He has been asked to not play in tournaments to give other players a chance to win\\". Uhh...great.Second, the book claims to be the most comprehensive Hold 'Em book ever written, but it pays pretty much no attention to the complete begginner.Third, and most seriously, No Limit Hold 'Em is not addressed at all. This should have been much more clearly communicated on the cover.I can't speak to the validity or usefulness of the concepts in this book, just know what you are buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality pot- would not recommend","review":"Last night I used my new pot to boil water and make pasta.

So far, I've used it to roast pork and chicken and both times, the dishes turned out well. I've not used it very often since I bought it, but now it has a 2mm round chip on the inside near a handle - you can actually see the inner layer. I don't know how that happened as I take good care of my pots and pans, and have only used wooden or nylon utensils in it, and handwashed it. I've boiled water in it (Cincinnati has bad-tasting water and boiling and filtering seems to work) as far as I can remember, I've only used it in the oven twice, and to cook something soupy on the gas stove top maybe 3 times. The chip has started to rust, so it'll probably go in the trash real soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I got this to replace a soup pot that i had for years. this one seemed to look like the one i was replacing and the price was right.

Just a wish that I'd spent my time doing something else. There's nothing \\"deep\\" about this, the only \\"message\\" you could possibly derive is one you add yourself -- it's not in the film.

Put simply: bluffing only works if your enemy thinks you are NOT bluffing. And the only way to prove that you aren't bluffing is to establish a reputation for following through on your threats. If you do that consistently, then you will have created the necessary perceptual basis for effective deterrence, and you won't need to actually do more than threaten, because people will take you at your word. \\"He who would have peace, let him prepare for war.\\"Anyone having a passing familiarity with the history of the UN, U.S. foreign policy between 1993 and 2001, or family dynamics at the local Wal-Mart should have a sufficient reference context for appreciating this dynamic."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE FANTASTIC VIDEOS","review":"THIS CHIC HAS IT ALL..NOT JUST THE LOOKS...EXELLENT VIDEOS...ESPECIALLY THE VIDEO WITH SEAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album If you like that 80's style music","review":"I feel that this album takes some getting used to if you have never heard it before it may have sounded better in 1984 but with the techno stuff thats out there today it is a little weak.

We see a lot of experiments on it (Killing time, Abandonfire, I Cry for you, Masters of War) along with old style songs (Man on fire, It's an ilussion, Young Lovers, Racing in the Streets). We hear in this album a lot of electronic drums and keyboards, that even though put Roger away from his old/classical style, make a really good album as a whole.

First of all, the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. If I wanted to be bored, I would read my DSM. The bigger problem, is that the content is about obscure 80's bands and performers that no child of the eighties has heard of.

The efforts of Kerry & Fonda dragged the war on longer causing 20,000 more American boys to die. Don't believe it? Use the Internet and you will find the answers.Finally, John Kerry actually went in front of a Senate committee and essentially called American troops in Vietnam - babykillers. Kerry also lied and said American troops were murdering 200,000 Vietnamese a year.

Futhermore, if you have read other books such as Band of Brothers and Flags of Our Fathers you will know that true heroes do not brag about their war achievements. Can we stop living in the past?

Kerry's views in this book lack intellectual rigor or pith and have a pedestrian, sophomoric appeal of the commonplace. It actually put me to sleep. After having read it, I still don't have any larger insight into Kerry's political philosophy and I have the impression that I was just supposed to get into a sort of feely John Kerry state of being.

Although much of the information is potentially valuable, it is presented in a pseudo-scholarly manner that takes much of the joy away from the challenge of raising a gifted child. Like my son, I was labeled as highly gifted as a child, and after reading the book, I am grateful to be functioning and not on Prozac. A more simplistic but much more enlightening book on the subject is \\"The Survival Guide for Parents of Gifted Kids\\" by Sally Yahnke Walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"guiding the gifted child","review":"Every time I re-read this book I find it more helpful.

Santana has just emerged from the 70's fusion movement having played with some of the best jazzmen around. However, this is an unfortunate hodge-podge or rock, disco and mediocre Latin music. This is an example of Santana's penchant for cashing in on the current trends. Don't look for Tito Puente or Miles Davis here. The only thing of value here is the Brazilian-flavoured \\"Let the Children Play\\" medley. I am glad they included it on the followup live album Moonflower (a temporary return to form) and thankfully, skipped the rest of this lousy album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine Santana album","review":"'Festival' is ifcourse no Santana I,II,III, but it's a fine album on its own.The 70's sound comes thru on a few tracks, and we get a feel that Carlos is moving away from Latin rock into jazz/fusion.

When intervieved, Mr. Reich is always engaging, and is no less so in the book. He peppers each chapter with bits of humor, which add a human side to what could be an otherwise dry subject matter. He has a fine grasp of economic history, and presents it skilfully. This is a great effort, especially because Mr. Reich neither talks above or down to his readers. A excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Read It- You Won't Be Sorry","review":"Brilliantly conceived, researched and written. Wonderful new term coinage such as: \\"the age of the terrific deal\\", \\"stickiness\\", \\"geeks and shrinks\\", \\"the incredible shrinking family\\" and my favorite, \\"mass persuasion\\" (p.17). Reich devotes only a few pages to suggested solutions which are rather traditional to say the least.Why not attack the problem at the root? The author caught the idea but did not develope it. The information highway is clogged with \\"mass persuasion\\"-telling us what to think, how to act and apropos to Reich's book, what to want and what we must have.Let's curtail the mass persuaders and regain some personal, family and social autonomy and thus hopefully assure a brighter future for our success.Write again soon, Dr. Reich, and title your book, \\"Mass Persuasion: The End of an Era\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and Insightful","review":"This book can help many gain insight. As the New Economy changes our work, attitudes, and corporate culture we should attempt to fit into it as best we can. Americans get less sleep today, and are working longer hours hours than ever. Massive Suburban sprawl adds more minutes to our already lengthy commutes. Reich speaks from his experience. Is there more to life? Reich doesn't preach, he just notes that there should be more to our lives than running at break-neck speeds, myopically climbing the loose rungs of corporate ladders. We live in the most prosperous nation on Earth. It's too bad that we don't live like it.

He probably bought the rules and then skimmed through them. I gave it five stars but I am still learning the system. However, this system is thorough and from what I have seen it can use material from any other system.

Breathing requires a roll! You must make three rolls to perceive something. Walking across the room can take as many as 60 rolls!!!(and hours of dice rolling fun!)Young wrote the rules (1st edition used a three dimensional grid to acomplish simple tasks)and proved that humans deserve extintion in the process. E.R. Jones on the other hand had little to nothing to do with this books publishing/writing; but was responsible for the game concept(great idea though).Bottom line:read at your own risk. But if you want to be offended give the disclaimer a read. Young states in it that \\"polytheism is a spiritually banckrupt religiuos philosophy.\\" I AM NOT JOKING! Oh and have fun walking at flight speeds( actual body skill! The one good thing about this book is it will send you into histerical fits of laughter )"},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not hold a Charge","review":"The other reviewer is 100% correct. The iboost when charged and left unused will only last about 2 days. Then the red starts to flash and then it is out of battery. You then have to charge it again and it will last you another 2 days if not used. But if you do use it it will last a while. Like 10 hours for 1st gen and 20 for second gen. That is if you use it immedialty after it is done charging. Warning also could cause your battery to be out of sync!!!!!!I gave a 2 stars because I brought my Ipod to listen to school everyday. (I had a TA class where I listen to music and grade papers) So it worked for that becuase I consitinly charged the battery everyday.

Do not buy this product as there is no guarantee, either from Amazon or the manufacturer.

You may not prefer the more dark, country, sound of this album as opposed to the often springy 69 love songs, but i guarantee you, there is no way not to fall in love with this album. By my second listen, this album was already sacred to me, and right now it is sitting in its case after my last spurt of listenings, waiting patiently until the time is right for me to take it out again. My nightmare would be to overplay this album. Stephen Merrit's low voice will make you feel lonely as he sings of a girl's fear of trains, or a lonesome highway, but at the same time he soothes you, in making you too feel like an explorer on some vast, endless highway.

Cute and family-style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done teen comedy","review":"First of all, Sally Field was fantastic in this part - she was a surprisingly good actress and gets the maximum impact out of every line, delivering them like a pro. This is a teen comedy that stands out because of the good scripts, pleasant sarcasm in the dialogue, and acting of Sally Field and Don Porter. The series only lasted one season because its appeal never broadened past the teen audience - also, the teen world was changing rapidly in 1965-66. What was cool one week seemed like ancient history the next.

I bought the Kindle edition hoping for a great read but instead I got a 17 page description of a foot race between the author and his buddies. 17 pages describing a foot race put me in a coma for awhile. Also, murmuring sweet nothings to a shotgun named \\"sweetlips\\" and harboring a python snake under his cot seemed a little much. Then again, anyone willing to lay down in leeach filled bug infested filthy mud and water for hours on end just to kill one or two VC without ever mentioning trench foot or jungle rot once, is amazing in itself.

This romantic comedy takes place on a military base, where each character pushes on his/her own agenda: Major Renata has concocted a sinister plot to humiliate his competitors; the Colonel's wife wants to screw the gate guard; the enlisted men seek to screw the townswomen; young lovers naively yearn for each other (a nice contrast with episodes featuring more jaded players). This is Kirts' most linear plot, propelled along with increasing momentum in every chapter. The host of major and minor characters are ably juggled throughout this very satisfying and very funny tale of young love, old love, military antics and witless blundering of leaders. A real pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still available","review":"I guess Amazon's distributor doesn't stock this anymore, but you can still order it direct from the label. (EDIT 5/1/07: Back in stock!)This is awesome stuff. I've always suspected that they were one of the first bands to be influenced by Helmet. Helmet's first record was the Born Annoying 7 inch single, released in 1989. Breadwinner's debut 7 inch was released in 1990, and to me they sound similar. Similar start/stop staccato style (which was actually unique fifteen years ago when Helmet debuted but has since been imitated by countless wannabe bands in their wake) and abrasive tone. Same drum sound. But where Helmet kept things simple and were structurally \\"pop,\\" Breadwinner were more complex and progressive. Come to think of it, I guess they sound a lot more like Blind Idiot God than Helmet. You know what, forget what I said about them sounding like Helmet. I was on crack at the time. I say again: awesome stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too heavy for words.","review":"This is the best \\"math rock\\" I've ever heard.

Collaborating with a \\"bunch\\" of hip-hop stars does not necessarily translates to or guarantee hits. Next Millenium is a testament to that. Bounty seemed to struggle to stay on track and his flow does not appear to come across naturally. This will neither appeal to a hip-hop audience nor to his traditional dancehall audience. Bounty's true talent did not get a chance to shine - it was buried in the sea of hip-hop beats and big willie rap stars. The Killer is missing (assumed dead) in action on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Messy Than Regular Bar Soap. Fun To Use","review":"The idea for a foaming soap is to reduce the time it takes for washing your hands. Instead of trying to work on a lather, a foaming soap is already made up of soap suds. Foaming liquid soap is generally thinner and watery, or else it will clog the mechanism to produce suds. You can buy refills in bigger containers. Or some people are successful in mixing water and other liquid soap.Dial makes a lot of foaming soap products including Tone. A 7.5 oz bottle lasts a long time. More convenient than a regular soap for your powder room and sinks. It is also less messy than regular soaps. Generally one pump is enough to cover both hands. Just make sure that you cup your hands or the soap will spurt across the room. One wrong pump is all that it takes to learn how to use a foaming soap dispenser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as intended, just not that functional","review":"The product works as intended, so no problems there. I liked the idea of not having to take my iPod out of its case, but actually, you need to if you like to change your songs/books, frequently. For my use, I still have to pull my iPod out to change albums, playlists and books that I listen to, so because I jump around so much, I often remove it from the case. That negates the reason why I bought this item.

I was furious when I discovered that fact after buying the CD ( I got it before reading the reviews here). Yeah, yeah, some of their other nuggets like \\"Vahevala\\" are here, but messing up \\"Angry Eyes\\" totally tripped me out.

They also are great singers. If you would like an introduction to Loggins and Messina, here's the perfect place. \\"Peace of Mind\\" is a beautiful song and one of my favorites. P.S.

This is an unforgettable jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the most heart-felt music of the 70's.","review":"I can remember hearing this album (yes, vinyl!) through the wall of my bedroom while my older sister played it end to end, over and over. Just hearing the \\"Real Audio\\" samples of some of the songs brings back fond memories and I can still remember every lyric to every song as if I were singing along with them 20 years ago. Sure, it's a little dated, with some ideals and principals that were left back (with good enough reason) in the 70's, but the music itself is as timeless as any Beatle's song. Emotion runs high from start to finish. You can't lose with this record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And the attempt is... SHORT!","review":"The \\"Best of Friends\\" contains only ten tracks, and less than fourty minutes of music. That would be acceptable, except for the fact that \\"Angry Eyes\\", one of Loggins and Messina's biggest hits, has been chopped from six minutes, to 2:23. Initially, this collection may have been released on vinyl, which would explain the shortened version, but there's plenty of room on the CD for the complete version, with room to spare for more tunes! So,where's the rest of it? This is a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection, isn't it?My humble opinion? It's unfortunate that Columbia released this \\"short\\" CD, although some may think I'm nitpicking. If you never cared for the instrumental in \\"Angry Eyes\\", and you enjoy Loggins and Messina, you'll enjoy this CD. However, if you remember \\"Angry Eyes\\" in the spirit of which it was intended... Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money....","review":"L&M were so much more than what this represents....and I won't even discuss the Angry Eyes issue. L&M were also more than a pop/radio group that I have seen mentioned here. They had many songs which featured more of a jazz feel.

A greatest hits release just does not do them justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh","review":"I was lucky enough to see The Delta 72 in Harrisonburg, VA a while back - and let me tell you, their live show is something no one should miss. \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\" captures their live show as best can be done I believe. It is powerful and reckless, with great drum beats and wild but indesipherable lyrics. I recommend this album to all rock fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious pap","review":"From the album notes it's apparent Delta 72 fancy themselves as some kind of breakthrough act, returning rock to its rhythm and blues roots.

If it's white boys doing R&B you crave, check out The Contortions."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"a step backwards from \\"Cor-Crane Secret\\", this one still has the same queasy guitar sounds but few of the songs have the same quality of screwed-up melody, clever arrangements, and sheer listenability that made that album work so well. Although this album has plenty of great ideas, the combination of melody and experimentation rarely gels in a very satisfying manner. Plus, a lot of the instrumentation is extremely sloppy, like they didn't even practice before recording it. Like all their albums following \\"Cor-Crane Secret\\", this one has a couple of good songs but never really makes it far beyond mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurs...","review":"Don't by this album if you want to hear music from an accomplished band. This stuff is total poop. There's a reason why hardly anyone has heard of them. If you were hoping to hear something with unorthadox song structures, stranage rhythms or experimental tunings you'll find it here, only it sounds like it was thrown together by 12 year olds.

I had a very hard time, however, getting past the beginning when the main character was able to be fixed up in only a few short hours to go from mom/part-time writer to someone who can legitimately pose as a 20 something bachelorette. It also did not seem consistent with her character to leave her child with a babysitter for weeks while she pursued a part-time writing assignment. I can suspend some reality, but this was too hard. I am a forty something and it would take a whole lot more time to get me to look like a bachelorette and it would have been better reading to explore her transformation, rather than just gloss over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"The WORST chick lit I have read, ever! And I have read a lot of them. I thought I would be the target audience for this book, the Bachelor is my favorite TV show, and 95% of my pleasure reads are chick lit, but I could not wait to finish the book....so I could throw it out! The characters were too stereotypical to be believable and lacked depth. The author tried so hard to make Sarah's problems and inner conflicts deep that the situations were painstakingly drawn out and then resolved with a simple thought.

It makes you think twice about all those reality dating shows and what might be going on behind the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute take-off on The Bachelor","review":"After reading Insider Dating, I was left wanting more so I bought a couple of other books by Jennifer O'Connell. I read Bachelorette #1 in just a few days because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Yes, it is a take-off on The Bachelor, but with a twist. The main character, Sarah Holmes, who has a husband and toddler, is given the assignment to be one of the bachelorettes in order to write an expos�� for the magazine that employs her. The story is a bit predictable in some places; however, I was very impressed with the character development and Ms. O'Connell's attention to detail. I felt like I was watching a season of The Bachelor as a fly on the wall. The ending holds rewarding surprises for the reader.The release of this novel was timely since it draws from reality TV during its height. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a well-written, entertaining, easy to read story. Perfect for a day at the beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Tv","review":"I liked this book for being a quick read.

I wanted to know what happened to Chris...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - but a bit contrived","review":"While the first part of the book discussing the history of the Franklin Expedition was both interesting and informative, the remainder of the book seemed padded and contrived, as it dwelled too much on the modern day trials and tribulations of Beattie and his collaborators. The authors seemed to be trying too hard to build up to a climatic conclusion, and I felt that the book could have been much better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"good,but why?","review":"this was a very good book.

I miss you and all your jingle-jangly bands from Chapel Hill North Carolina, Gainsville Florida, and Athens Georgia. This is a must own for any Polvo or 90's indie rock music enthusiast. Plenty of mathy-rockin psychedelic guitar alternating with Middle Eastern-style influenced drone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shapes - misunderstood?","review":"contrary to what everyone says, I do like this album. It's no exploded drawing, but its still worth owning. Many more instrumental songs (but then again Polvo usually prefered instrumental to heavy vocal laden songs). Maybe a little more psychadelic, but definetly good. 'El Rocio' is great. Even if you don't like this one that much, its still worth owning. Its bad polvo didn't last a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polvo is a great Chapel Hill band and truly unique.","review":"I've just recently found out about Polvo from my brother. This album is definitely great for a night of friends just chillin'. They are kind of acquired taste, but if you like the Chapel Hill music scene- you'll love Polvo. Merge rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with its factional tendencies-boogie or exotica","review":"While Cor-Crane Secret is considered to be this band's \\"prettiest\\" \\"pop\\" album, it is also Polvo's most exquisitely layered, conceptually complete and satisfyingly complex album. Luckily, it was the first one I picked up as Shapes was the second. Shapes was a disappointment because of its disparate, splintered feel that seemed to foretell the band's impending breakup. The beautifully structured songs of the past seemed to disappear with the band's chemistry. I went to see Polvo on their Shapes tour and was surprised at how bad the show was. It was a sad and embarassing thing to see Ashe Bowie reluctantly partake of the other band members' plain awful boogie-woogie prog-rock tendencies partially showcased on Shapes. No wonder he opted for what I am guessing were his otherworldly introspective pieces of ephemera. Who would want to be there while the other dudes are kicking out the tired retro jams?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult school use","review":"This book is good for building basic vocabulary in German. It is basically a coloring book, but it would be nice to have a version with darker ink, so my senior students could read it better.

Still, it's a good source, where there's no over-kill in vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book. Nowhere did it say that this is a coloring book, so the title page is deceiving with its nice colors. For an older child who is crazy about coloring (because of the very busy and detailed scenes) this may be something, otherwise you can't even make out much on the black-and-white scenes. My toddler picks it up often because of the colorful title page and then is always disappointed once we open it. As a German mother, it therefore has no value for me in teaching my child German, which is too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"German picture word book","review":"I was disappointed in this book because it didn't attach the word to the picture.

I followed up the instructions and placed the main unit side by side to the external temperature sensor. The unit has an internal temperature sensor as well. The external temperature sensor showed a difference of 3 to 5 degrees with the temperature of the unit. This difference is big enough to cause trouble in my process. Besides this, the product works nice, it has a clear display and it is easy to use.

For the $25 price you can hardly go wrong. Yes, there is a glare but not enough to pass on the price. It does not have all the bells and whistles as the $50 plus stations but it does work and it works fairly well. We have 2 other models going: a really cheap one that shows it and a fairly expensive one and it has a few more bells and whistles. This is the perfect starter station for the folks who want to know about the temperatures and other stuff.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, paranoid rascism","review":"bell hooks is a sad figure, worthy of our sympathy. Her cathartic rants are evidence of how black americans are taught to wallow in their perceived state of oppression. She does not seem to realize that this self-enrolled victimization is a root cause of black americans' lack of self-sufficiency and reliance on social programs. Her hatred of whites only serves to perpetuate her and her race's misery. How unfortunate that a woman with such an incredibly negative message would be lauded as such a literary talent. It sickens me that a previous reviewer chooses to force this book on her/his students; hook's paranoid view of reality should not be mistaken by impressionable minds as the true state of affairs. The true irony of this book and bell hook's viewpoint is that the country that she loathes so vehemently is also the one that offers her unparalled freedom and opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess racism against white people is OK","review":"It wasn't long ago that I despised \\"racism\\", which I felt meant oppression, exclusion and generally dislike of peoples with different skin color attributes.It took me a while to realize that in the world of uber-Politically Correct Leftist activism, \\"racism\\" basically translates to \\"evil white people putting everyone down\\".A few days ago one of my Latino college professors referred to me as a \\"Anglo Saxon\\".

She ellicits such strong personal attacks precisely because she does not resort to coddling \\"feel-good\\" language.America prides itself on being free and democratic, but the truth is that we have not done as good a job eradicating discrimination as we want to desparately congratulate ourselves. Blatantly offensive statues and ordinances may be gone, but it is the subtle nuances that continue to permitt a divided society.Even though such a format would make it easier for the majority of society to swallow, hooks is justified for requiring the reader to perform extremely crticial self-examination while reading this book. Those who are unable to handle it are the very same indivduals who are prone to name-calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hypocrisy of political correctness","review":"When bell hooks tells her readers how she is sitting next to a white man she longs to kill, I wonder does she realize how this would have played if a white man or woman wrote the same thing about a black?

I much preferred \\"Parenting Your Internationally Adopted Child,\\" which addresses attachment and despite the title, also has helpful strategies for domestic adoptive parents where the family background is sketchy.

I opted for this machine and I'm so glad I did. I find the rebounding especially challenging. I could barely do 5 minutes without having to stop when I first got it. It works because each time you jump you have to keep the weight of your legs up in the lifted position on your own accord and that means lots of thigh and even more stomach muscles have to engage. Another advantage to owning this is that you can increase resistance (not on the rebounder of course) as you get better so this machine will give you years of workouts.

As a general rule his live performances have much more grit and energy than his slightly too slick studio albums. So to get a live album featuring no less than 6 tracks from his greatest album, and with production once more from Robbie Robertson sounded like an excellent idea. Unfortunately, whether it's in the mastering or the performances themselves, this is a very dull CD. Performances of \\"Glory Road\\" and \\"Holly Holy\\" really stand out, but that's not enough to save the album from mediocrity.When I first played this album my mother commented that she'd seen and loved the TV special when it aired all those years ago, so I suspect the fault cannot lie with Neil - hopefully we'll get to see it on DVD one of these days and find out for sure.In the meantime, if you want Neil live on CD stick with \\"Gold\\" and \\"Hot August Night\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Diamond - Love at the Greek","review":"There is no better singer/songwriter of the century than Neil Diamond.

It feels more like a desperate attempt at linking Foundation with the rest of the Asimov universe.I think the worst part is that I liked the Foundation concept as presented by Hari Seldon in the first three books. The Foundation was not perfect, but that imperfection was part of the Seldon Plan and would eventually lead to a great new galaxy, under the Foundation government. This book gave me the feeling that Seldon's Foundation lost. Not a good way to write a book. I finished the book angry at Asimov for destroying the \\"Foundation\\" concept.

Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels.

Read them all, and try to read them in chronological order."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book would be interesting only if you have read the foundation trilogy and are just dying for more.

Borr-ring.My qualm with Ibbotson is that her characters fall into only two strict polar catagories: good guys who have no faults, and bad guys who everything about them is a fault. That's that. Black and white. With no variation whatsoever.My advice: read Harry Potter, anything by Diana Wynne Jones or Lloyd Alexander.

Good price, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 6th Grade Nickname Game","review":"Don't you think it would be so cool for everyone in your school to have nicknames?In this book almost everyone does.Do you like nicknames?Jeff and Wiley sure do.Two brilliant nicknamers have nicknames for everyone.But what happens when a girl has a lot of presonality and you may have a crush on her,can you give her a nickname?Gordon Korman sure did a great job whit all the nicknames.If you get to read this awesome book you may start relating nicknames to someone,like I did.It's so abvious that I do recommend this book to all 6th graders.Especially if you like having fun,go ahead and read this awesome book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sixth grade nickname game","review":"Wiley and Jeff were bestfriend until this new girl moved in into the old Gunhold house but Jeff and Wiley was trying to come up with a nickname but Wiley falling in love with her.

The book is about two 6th grade boys, Jeff and Wiley, who have been friends for 11 years. Their hobby is giving people nicknames. They nicknamed their substitute teacher, their school, and all of their friends. They even have nicknames for themselves! They are THE NICKNAMERS.

A nice book for younger elementary students. Nice pictures. Takes place in Kenya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martini Shines Again","review":"This constitutes both my wife's and my review. First, we are prejudiced because we are big Martini fans. He always weaves a tangled web of suspense leading up to a great ending. This book is no different. Once we started it, we could not put it down. In this book (along with his others) he proves that you don't need writhing bodies every other page and that the \\"F word\\" is not an necessary part of the vocabulary of the book. There is mayhem, but it is well contained. The main character, Madriani, shows that he is human as he plows his way through many obstacles. The supporting cast, including Madriani's adversary in the form of the Prosecutor, are well developed and believeable. A great book by a master mystery writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Trial Scenes","review":"Abridged/CD: I had a bit of a problem with this audio because Joe Mantegna read it and he does the voice of the gangster on The Simpsons. It took a while to get into it because of that. I did enjoy the trial scenes.There is a midget prosecutor, who holds no punches, and goes up against our defense lawyer hero, Paul Madriani. It starts as a woman gets shot in the head twice in a military style \\"double tap\\" and her ex-military bodyguard is on trial for her murder. There were points that I felt should have been more detailed, but this was abridged. I felt the ending could have been better and it was a bit of a cop out. The big twist was kind of a yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took me so long?","review":"It has been years since I picked up a Steve Martini novel to read. After just a few pages of Double Tap I was wondering what took me so long. This is a great murder/legal thriller reminiscent of Presumed Innocent. You won't regret taking the time to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a machete","review":"This one has a simple plot like \\"True Crime\\"- but it's nothing special. Badly needs savage editing as it's at least 100 pages too long. A good editor would have given it a double tap at inception."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Martini's Best","review":"I've read all of Martini's Madriani series, and this is one of my favorites. However, I don't read other mysteries, and I suspect that whodunit fans will have little trouble guessing the ending of this one. In retrospect, it was obvious, and someone with more exposure the the genre may find the outcome too predictable. (I didn't see it coming at all, though.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"The denoeument of this promising novel is such a cop out. The compelling first few scenes resolve in an uncompelling way. Although consistent with the plot, the reader is left with such a feeling of being let down. The plot is of course tied up, but so contrived! I felt like I read the 400 plus pages only to be hung out to dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly titled, poorly written.","review":"I purchased this book due to the interesting nature of the title, and the on-line reviews.I found the opening scene interesting, but soon after became highly disenchanted with the writing. I found it bland and cliched. It reminded me of early works by Dan Brown which have been re-released due to the success of his newest title. (Hint: they were not previously succesful for a reason.)I returned this book for The Historian within one week. Unique, lush writing and a highly enjoyable read thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Tap (by Steve Martini)","review":"From the \\"blurb\\" I was expecting an exciting story with some risky adventures for the attorney trying to find the truth. But the truth is: it was just another boring courtroom book and the attorney did nothing more exciting than read a lot and the author spent more time expanding little details than I could ever have imagined was possible. It was a great disapointment as there was not one exciting event in the book. My most exciting moment was when I finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Attorney Paul Madriani is back in another legal thriller by Steve Martini. This time Paul takes on the case of Emiliano Ruiz, an ex-military man who now does security work. Unfortunately, Ruiz had the misfotunate to be doing security work for murder victim, Madelyn Chapman. Chapman ran a software company heavily involved with government contracts. Not only did Ruiz do security work for Chapman, but he also had an affair with her before she unceremoniously dumped him. Ruiz has a ready-made motive of revenge and jealousy.The book started out promising, but quickly turned disappointing. The whole middle of the story just dragged until I found myself starting to skim...not a good sign. I've never really enjoyed government corruption stories. They tend to lend themselves to cliches and this one is no exception. I do like Paul Madriani as a character and I hope the next book has a better plotline."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good read","review":"Martini does a great job of weaving an interesting story. It held my interest but it was not as deep as some others that I've read. Certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style detracts from story","review":"While the story is an intriguing one and the characters lively and well drawn, I found the book almost unreadable. Why? Because Martini uses the present tense in describing the action. For example:\\"What's that?\\", I ask....\\"Nothing,\\" he says....I give him a look....\\"Who's Walt Eagan?\\" says Harry....I suppose it is done to give the effect of immediacy - as if the action were happening RIGHT NOW. Instead, I have the feeling of crawling behind a sand crab as it meanders across a beach rather than an overview of the action and purpose of the story.I advise anyone caution in buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have used this shower gel before, after I got this one from Amazon, it appears to have been watered down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and careless","review":"This book sends hikers to at least one place where maintained trails are absent for the sake of rare species. This suggests lack of research and insensitivity behind this book's recommendations.

Fehrenbach's The Comanches is a wonderful, unflinching look at a powerful yet tragic tribe of Indians.

Rather than quoting primary sources so support his facts he seems to prefer re-interpreting them in his own bias; on occasion I happened to have read the source text and found he had grossly misrepresented it, which makes me very suspicious of the rest of his facts. The whole book is extremely biased in favour of manifest destiny - it often reads like a justification for destructions of the native peoples and their culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceived","review":"The picture of this made me feel like i was receiving a combo and that is not the case I only received one pacifier and it didn't even look like the ones in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinionated and not meticulous","review":"I reaad this in June of 1952 and commented on it as follows: \\"Of course it is a very weak book because one can't trust it. It has that about it, just like a Drew Peason (he had nothing to do with this book) column which requires that all be taken with a consideration of the source. Further, it was written in 1950 and is greatly dated. It has the style of 1932's Washinton Merry-Go-Round in an age which hasoutgrown that style and demands facts, not generalizations. All the people that are called stupid--but this book is obviously written by very stupid guys. Mind you, I agree with the political bias of the authors. It is that they wrote a poor book--hasty, superficial and unbearably loaded with blacks and whites. A tendency to sweeping over all condemnation re Congress was especially notorious. I rejected the portraits of congressman as totally lacking in the research and attention required."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"The iboost package says it will add 7 hours for video.

I ran the video as a test, and did not touch the ipod except to start the movie again. I should have the maximum time, shouldn't I? their answer is that times will vary. Hmmm.I may return mine.

Suffice it to say that I'm happy with the extra 3-4 hours that I have gotten from my Nyko.One thing that I don't like is that the Nyko seems to lose its charge after a few days. This necessitates charging it the night before you need it to ensure a full charge.At around $30 on Amazon I think the iBoost is quite good. However, I might take a look around to see if any other battery packs hold the charge better."},{"rating":"2","title":"ipod batter booster","review":"It works and arrived promptly.

It worked as advertised at first, and seemed to add approximately the amount of time (16 hours) which it claimed to.But over the past several months it seems to be steadily losing capacity. It will go from fully charged to dead after 2 - 4 hours of use. Also it seems to lose charge even when it's not in use and disconnected from the iPod (this shouldn't happen with lithium batteries).Overall, it's a decent product when it's working. I don't know if mine is defective, or if this product was just designed with an extremely finite lifespan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"I purchased my Nyko ahead of a year long trip abroad, thinking it would be a bit of time between chargings. I ended up tossing it after only a month.Simply put, even the slim design adds enough bulk to where you no longer can comfortably fit your ipod into your pocket. The unit itself adds no discernable play time and if you have it plugged in to the power unit and the ipod at the same time, the ipod will not draw power from the unit, effectively draining itself. This means I was spending twice as much time charging each unit. The same problem happens when charging - you can't charge the ipod while it is plugged into the Nyko. You have to charge each seperately.You are better off going on the internet and building a do-it-yourself battery pack. Its easier, cheaper, and will work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace is a classic.... this video not his hottest moment","review":"As a longtime KISS fan, I was excited to see this video when it came out. I was disappointed on how the band played and performed together on the video. Todd Howarth, although a fine musician/singer, doesn't seem like the right man to play alongside Ace. Ace looks old and tired, but Rocks out in an admirable fashion. The best parts of the show are the KISS staple \\"Cold Gin\\" and the track from ALIVE II \\"Rocket Ride.\\" These two tunes show Ace playing what he does best. Some of the other tunes seem like a reaction to the glam rock scene of the late 80's. I like the video as a fan of Ace. As a critic of fine music, not so much. On another note, I was a little disturbed by Ace's cowboy boots!!! This video is definitely for die-hard Ace fans. Probably not for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic version of a classic hit!","review":"Harkens back to a great era of good music written by a true song writer.

You will not be disappointed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"This has got to be the best version of Solitaire that has ever been sung. Clay brought tears to Neil Sedakas eyes the night he performed a short version on American Idol and now with this full version, he has brought the emotion to all that have heard it. Clay Aiken has a voice like no other - his range, his power is second-to-none. And to combine it with the most beautiful love song \\"The Way\\" was a masterful idea. What a hit this is.

Clay has a talent that many artists who \\"have already made it\\" can only dream of. Clay's crystal clear voice shines in all his songs and The Way and Solitaire are no exceptions. The Way is a beautiful ballad which is a personal favourite of mine in Clay's full length cd, Measure of a man. Solitaire is a brilliant and the best rendition that I have ever heard. It is haunting and so very beautiful. Clay Aiken is a talented performer that many of us have been waiting for the longest time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"I adore Clay's voice. To me, he will always be the winner of season two. And this single is his best release yet. \\"The Way\\" is a lovely, pleasant song that might not fit well in today's radio climate but still showcases a great melody and voice.However, the real reason to buy this single is \\"Solitaire\\". I was amazed by Clay's rendition on the show last year. And this version is even better. The power of this vocal is stunning. My only suggestion: the label should push \\"Solitaire\\" as the A-side. This song would probably be a much bigger hit than \\"The Way\\" - which is a bit too AC. Hopefully, radio stations will start playing \\"Solitaire\\" instead - in a recording that equals the Carpenters' great cover from the 1970s.LS"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most moving piece of music I have ever heard","review":"Yes, I am a Clay Aiken fan, so of course I knew I loved \\"The Way\\", but I had to have \\"Solitaire\\", after hearing Clay sing a short version of it on American Idol last season. After listening to it for the first time, I am completely, utterly blown away. I got chills, tears in my eyes, and even my husband seemed very moved (although he'd never admit it!) The range, power, and beauty of Clay's voice is simply unparalleled by any other \\"pop\\" star out there today. Everyone should do themselves a favor and buy this single, sit back for a listen, and prepare to be affected in a very deep and powerful way.

Not only do we have cheesy sounding computer drums here, Aikin does not even know how to pronounce the word solitaire (the \\"sol\\" in solitaire rymes with mile, not Paul, they should have named this song saulitaire lol), much less sing the song. He barely got a note of the original melody right in this monstrosity. yuck! I have a question, does anyone like Clay Aikin that didn't start liking him watching the extremely cheesy American Idol? All American Idol is is a show that proves TV executives know how to herd sheep. 90% of the people that like him will be embarrassed they ever liked him 10 years from now.

So I bought the single, and what do I get? Crap. I'm so sick of this song. It sounded good when I heard once or twice on the radio, but after listening to it, I hate the song now. I feel bad because it was a song that I liked.I don't even want to start with Solitare. So what if he can hit a friggin note? So can Celine, and Whitney, Josh Groban, Kelly Clarkson, but without over-pronouncing every freakin' syllable. That's not cool. He's a vain show off. Anyone could sing a more interesting song with better lyrics (and WITHOUT THE \\"SO CALLED\\" GLORY NOTE) and get a #1 on the charts.

I already had The Way on MOAM, and I thought Clay's performance of Solitaire on AI was good, but not enough for me to spend my money on it. Then I heard the full version of Solitaire.

The Way is a great song, but Solitaire is worth the price of the single."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the GRAMMY goes to...CLAY AIKEN!!!","review":"Words cannot describe how absolutely BEAUTIFUL Clay's version of Neil Sedaka's \\"Solitaire\\" is. I realize \\"Solitaire\\" is the \\"B\\" side of the CD, and was included as Clay's \\"gift\\" to his fans; however, the song steals the thunder away from the actual single, \\"The Way,\\" and makes me forget there is another song on the CD!Clay, THANK YOU for giving us \\"Solitaire,\\" and the gift of your phenomenal voice; you light up our lives!Hurry everyone, this will sell out fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SECOND TO NONE!!!","review":"The Way captured my heart the first time I listened to it on the Measure of a Man CD....and I am still playing it and still loving it.

Neil is right...his song is now and forever a Clay Aiken song. What an amazing interpretation...brought tears to my eyes and chills in my bones.

I have never heard anyone sing this well before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vocal","review":"Ok...first of all, I would like to tell \\"J. Frick\\" that I did not watch American Idol. In fact, I did not even know who Clay was until recently when I heard him sing The First Noel. I was absorbed by Clay's powerful voice and immediately became a fan after listening to him sing that.and by the way, J. Frick...it's pronounced SOLLA-TAIRE...check the dictionary...Solitaire is definitely an incredible song that propels Clay to a much higher level of singing than all other pop singers today. He knows how to control his voice and knows how to add that special something to attract people with his voice. I think there's a special quality in his voice that makes him special, unlike other singers. In terms of cons, I have one complaint and that is because I heard a few notes that were off-key. Well, Clay still has room for improvement and I think he will learn to master his voice continually. Clay's singing is simply divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"I liked Clay's performance of \\"Solitaire\\" on American Idol 2, but was not as blown away as a lot of other fans. But this--is stunningly beautiful!

He turns it into a powerhouse performance that eclipses all the previous renditions.

He has a long career ahead of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Clay","review":"Another incredible effort from Clay Aiken, I watched his performance of Solitaire on tv last night and was completely blown away by his vocals yet again. It seems that he has only continued to improve after American Idol, he put all the current finalists to shame and made them look ordinary.A fantastic CD that is a must have, my only grouse about Clay is that he hasn't gone on a global tour yet, so I'm stuck sitting in Asia envying all you guys who get to see him live on his national tour!Highly recommended for your CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding as usual for Clay, the best","review":"After reading other reviews, I agree with the quality,clarity and beauty of his voice. His character is so refreshing and true. I just can't get enough of him. This is the first year of the rest of his life. He will always be here for us to enjoy. He still has talent we have not seen yet.I Love Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I truly believe that Clay Aiken is destined to be the greatest singer of his generation. This is a magnificent recording.As a true Clay fan from his first note on \\"American Idol,\\" I have continued to marvel at his amazing gift. \\"The Way\\" is an expressive and beautiful song. But \\"Solitaire\\" is truly a masterpiece.I expect Mr. Aiken to have a long and productive career, and I eagerly await his next project. \\"Solitaire\\" has set the standard. And, as challenging as it may be to equal the brilliance of this record, I believe that in the future Mr. Aiken will exceed all our expectations.In addition, I highly recommend seeing and hearing him perform live in concert. His charisma, personality, and extraordinary voice make him a real showman. I would say that \\"it doesn't get any better than this,\\" but I might be wrong. I think that Mr. Aiken will continue to get better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT HOT HOT!","review":"Hot, Sexy, and the voice of an angel. What can I say other then run do not walk to buy this single. This man takes my breath away with his amazing voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words can describe!","review":"I am truly speechless over this cd. I loved The Way on Clay's Measure Of A Man cd.But Solitaire is incredible. A must have for anyone who loves this type of song. There is just no way to describe the way this song touches your soul. Like others have said. Run, don't walk to your nearest store and get this cd. My local stores are mostly sold out. You might have to order it. I am afraid that when the singles are gone, you might not be able to get this. It's not on his album. Buy this cd, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Wonderful, Clay, just wonderful.Your interpretation of the song was perfect and intensely emotional.I can't wait to hear more from you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitaire is Breathtaking","review":"I absolutely love his MOAM CD. But ever since he sang Solitaire on AI2, when Neil Sedaka was there, I have been waiting for it. He did not dissappoint. I loved this song when the Carpenters sang it and when Elvis sang it. I was a HUGE Elvis fan, as a teenager.Clay now owns this song, just like Neil Sedaka said on AI2. It is absolutley incredible. The range he shows in this song made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. He goes from the lows to the highs with no effort at all.If you are unsure about buying Clay's album, then buy this single and you will see what we are all talking about. You will wonder why you waited so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitaire","review":"I have been waiting for Solitaire to come out on CD ever since Clay blew the audience away on AI with this classic. As Neil Sedaka said, this song is CLAY'S. However, I do wish the A-side had been Invisible which I believe was the original choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Voice Continues","review":"Loved the voice when I first heard it, but it has matured in both emotion and expression in a very short period of time. Clay shows dramatic growth as a vocalist. His version of Solitaire is breath-taking and spell-binding. The Way, is also emotional and moving. You can hear in his voice the feelings of his heart. Clay has found the way to steal hearts and stay very much alive in the music industry. I am thrilled to have him in my music collection. This is a winner!Clay is giving his listeners a thrill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"It doesn't get much better than this... a great song by Neil Sedaka and a romantic ballad both sung with power and beauty by Clay Aiken.

He held this one note that impressed me so much (I was wondering how he held his breath for that long and still kept the note in tune). This song was just so beautiful and after I heard it I was going around everywhere making sure people would listen to this song. Even my friend who normally doesn't like Clay loved this song. I would definitely recommend that you buy this songle... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitaire. . . .","review":"I bought it. I listened.

Clay thanks again for an fantasic preformance!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"I, like many American Idol watchers, was thrilled and awed by Clay Aiken's performance of \\"Solitaire\\" during Neil Sedaka week on the show. When news was released that Clay was going to be recording a new full length version of the song, I knew then that whatever came out of the recording studio was going to be simply amazing. Not only is the song (I would argue) one of the most beautifully written in lyric history, but in combination with Clay's voice, it simply soars!The production and arrangement are in magnificent juxtaposition to Clay's ringing tenor voice. The last minute of the song is by far worth listening to the preceding four minutes just to be able to experience the pure skill and grace that is Clay's performance.You will not be disappointed by either the A or B side of this single! If you listen to the radio, watch MTV, or own \\"Measure of a Man,\\" you know \\"The Way.\\" Together, these two singles are well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Clay has recorded a BRILLIANT CDFirst, The Way is a beautiful song, about Love, the many different Loves in the world....very senitive and so ClaySolitare is pure perfection. His words and voice just pierce your soul and heart.A fantastic CD!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is just utterly amazing!","review":"Clay's voice is just so fluent and those high notes are to die for. I watched him sing Solitaire on American Idol 2 and loved it and I wasn't sure if he could be any better. I can't believe that he didn't put this song out as an \\"A\\" side. It could have done very well on it's own by being a separate single. What a great rendition of Neil Sedaka's \\"Solitaire\\".The Way is one of the most beautiful and touching songs that I have heard in a very long time. What a beautiful voice this man has. I have purchased Clays other cd's - Measure of a Man and his single Bridge Over Troubled Water and This is the Night. Now this is just another that I will add. If he puts out more, I will be there to buy it on the realease date. This man just can't do wrong on his song selections.

No matter how many times I listen to this song, I could never grow tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay did it again","review":"I bought the single just for SOLITAIRE, because I already bought the CD of Clay. I really believe that Clay out did himself once again. Both songs are wonderful and SOLITAIRE is haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"I have a never heard a song that was interpreted with such feeling and emotion.

Clay has a voice that is flawless. He shows his emotions through his voice and leaves you wanting more. Solitaire is powerful and Clay sings with love and passion. Clay is needed in this day of such turmoil and hatred and I believe if we recognize his integrity and love through his songs and voice we will smile and understand why he is here to sing to us. Mr Neil Sedaka should be very proud to have Clay sing his song. Thank you Mr Sedaka and a special thank you to Mr Clay Aiken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken at his best!","review":"wow!this single is a must have,Clay at his very best!The way is a great song but,Solitaire will blow you away!wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Know John Edwards Sang as Clay Aiken!","review":"John Edwards is Clay Aiken, albeit with a better suit... but I bet the lawyer sings better...Also, regarding previous reviews note: \\"Alabama\\"... 'nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay-great/Production-horrible","review":"The Way is fine, it's also on Clay's album but the fans have been waiting for the release of Solitaire for ages and Clay's voice soars but not over the grating and distracting percussion during the middle verses of Solitaire...I actually returned the CD thinking it was defective. Since that time I have listened to several copies on 3 different players and it is the production of the song that truly is awful. Clay and Neil deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solitaire","review":"to old school for me, clay has a nice voice, but nothing to write home to mom about, plus he's not on the top of the charts anymore, what's up with that, last year he was in the #1 spot every week, but not anymore..on billboard his solitaire has drop down from four last week to twenty seven this week, well maybe his time has come for him to retire, and go back to teaching...I'm sure he like's that better anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"If you want to hear a good version of \\"Solitaire\\", try the one by The Carpenters. SHE could sing. Clay, on the other hand, is okay but nothing special. I've heard students in high school musicals with better voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUUUCCCCCHHHH!!","review":"Please don't butcher an already so-so Carpenters song-- pleeease!In fairness, I have not heard \\"The Way\\"... nor do I plan to, since my eardrums are precious. \\"Solitaire\\" is plenty bad enough.This is absolutely the WORST recording I think I have ever heard. Rates right down there with William Hung (actually, he could probably sing it better).Karen Carpenter is surely rolling over in her grave right now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"way way way over rated!","review":"This is horrible! I have never heard of such an artist who has been sooooooo hugely over rated. I when to the Independent tour on April.6 and clay just bored me to death!Kelly Clarkson is way way way better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAWWWWWWNNNNNNNN!!!!!!","review":"It's too bad there isn't a rating for ZERO stars because if there were that's what he would get. The only thing worse than WATCHING this freak of nature sing is listening to his gut-wrenching, vomit inducing \\"vocals\\". There is hardly anything enviable or admirable about someone who not only sounds too much like he's shouting the whole way though, but also with the same tone of voice a cat would have while stepping (very hard) on it's tail. His voice is very weak and leaves nothing to be desired. What a waste of money. But it's okay, my friends and I used all of our Clay CD's to see just how how well that kind of metal burns. It's pretty cool! All I have to say about this sorry, lame CD is he is definately THEE worst thing to have ever come from American Idol. What a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a song and what a voice !!","review":"This has to be one of the best songs and best voices that I have ever heard !! He should be right up there with Elvis, Sinatra and Beatles !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic job, Clay!","review":"It's been a very long time since a vocalist of Clay's talent arrived on the scene, and it was worth the wait. His performances on this CD single are just stunning -- passionate, tuneful and stirring. I loved The Way on his full-length CD, and Solitaire is a special gift for his fans. I hope this is the start of a trend -- this music is such a breath of fresh air, and we need to hear more of this on the radio. Here's hoping he has a long and lucrative career; he deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to get \\"Solitaire\\"","review":"I have listened to Clay's performance in American Idol 3 of \\"Solitaire\\" and I think it's the best song I have ever heard in my whole life. It is haunting, mesmerizing!!!!I would like to buy a whole bunch of this single for me and my friends but somehow it's not available in any music stores in Toronto. I was told that it was ordered and should have arrived 2 weeks ago and there is somewhat a delay? Can someone tell me why it is not arriving in Toronto, considering this is a big city?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitaire is back and more haunting than ever","review":"The A-side to this single is The Way, a song about loving someone, but not being able to show it to their object of affection. It will be a lovely addition to many a wedding and prom this year. Vocally, there are not many male pop singers with Clay Aiken's range and he makes a rather sweet and light song sound rich and heartfelt.The gem on this single is the B-side of Neil Sedaka's Solitaire. Solitaire is showcased by the power and expression in Clay Aiken's voice, and the 15+ second glory note ain't bad either. This version of Solitaire is a highly emotional and haunting version. Be prepared to get teary-eyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thud! Thud! Thud!","review":"\\"Solitaire\\" is exquisite--beyond belief. Buy this single. It will be the best $4.49 you ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifted Vocalist Brings It!!","review":"Wow, talk about a glory note!! The B side of this single, \\"SOLITAIRE\\" is a cover that Mr. Aiken originally treated us to last year as an American Idol contestant, and the song has a glory note the makes the hair on my arms stand up, it is so breath-takingly superb.Both songs are vocally spectacular!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is amazing","review":"This latest single shows what a great singer Clay really is.

I am sure that Neil Sedaka must be very proud. Way to go Clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitaire","review":"This song is amazing when sung by Clay Aiken! I recommend it to everyone that appreciates good music and an awesome voice! Clay outdid himself on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My God.....what a voice!!!","review":"Okay, although I have been a die-hard Clay fan since he first walked on to audition for AI, he never brought me to tears until he sang Solitaire last night on AI! Even seeing him in concert didn't make me tear up...(just cheer and scream like a maniac...and I was 3 months pregnant!)I literally just sat there and wept! Man, when he hit that note and held it...I had chills!! My husband clapped at the end and said, \\"He was awesome....oh my God!\\" My aunt then called us and was crying as well. Clay, you seem to be an awesome person and have been given such a gift!thanks so much for sharing it with us!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aiken Never Disappoints","review":"This has been a favorite song of mine since the Carpenters performed it.Clay has done an outstanding job with the song.

With both his new hit \\"The Way\\" as well as the Neil Sedaka song \\"Solitaire,\\" he achieves new greatness in vocal artistry.The Way is beautifully performed and Clay gives it a soulful, emotional touch as he sings about the kind of love that is hard to explain. Clay has an expressive longing throughout the song that totally enraptures an audience.His cover of \\"Solitaire\\" is beyond belief. When he performed this on American Idol, it was perfection. Now, he adds explosive dynamics and a vocal range that astounds the listener. This is a must buy for any collector of history in the making. Clay will continue to be a shining star in the music industry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE!","review":"Clay Aiken has the most breathtaking voice. He just carried me into his soul with that voice. Thank you Clay and Neil Sedaka for this wonderful song. Recommend HIGHLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hello","review":"just want to add that this recording of Solitaire is definitely a prelude of the best of CLay AIken. he recorded it right after AMerican IDol at age 24 but sings it w/ such passion and vocal skill that only the best of singers can actually do. would love to hear Clay sing more of these type of songs. and since the demographics of his fanbase goes from 9 to 90 his next cd should really have a little bit of good stuff for everybody , and i know that Clay being the savvy guy that he is knows what to deliver this time. not only is he a great singer but what a consummate Performer. he is really one of a kind.as for people like Nortley don't waste your energy reading those hateful garbage. it's really people like him who have so much hatred and anger that makes something like 9/11 happen in our lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to convense","review":"clay sound's ok, but nothing special, now josh groben that's what you call some real talent, clay's music does'nt fit into todays genre, more like broadway..but even then I don't think he would last, his songs all sound a like, if clay was so good, then why does'nt the radio station's play him, if you like the old perry como 1950\\" then clay is for you, this is 2004 and music have changed, if he want to appeal to the masses, then he need's to come up with something other than broadway or lounge music, it put's me to sleep, his fan's..well there different, they said they would buy clays cd even if he would sing the telephone book, now does that tell you what kind of fan's he has, like no other artist's fan's..there in a class all by themselves, I think the public would like clay so much better if he did'nt have the type of fan's that fellow him, like there's no tomorrow, well all i got to say is more power to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheesy song...","review":"The song The Way is very boring and stupid and sounds like another song from the past!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, just like the rest","review":"He doesn't even get an A for effort on this album. You'll find the same lackluster tunes heard on Measure of a Man. You will understand why he should have stuck with Broadway. Don't waste your money, or your time listening to it on the radio. Clearly this is not \\"the way\\" to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Never Ceases To Amaze!!!","review":"I absolutely love The Way. This song was definitely on the top of my favorites list from Measure Of A Man, Clay's CD. Of course my favorite song on his album still changes everytime I listen to it, which is still everyday. As for Solitaire, I don't know if there are any words that can do this song justice. Solitaire is smoothe, flawless, sexy, moving, heart wrenching. This song shows all of Clay's best qualities, which is of course his unbelievable voice, brought to us with deep deep emotion, with such strength, but yet there is a softness within his voice that seems to come from his soul, piercing your heart causing you to hop up and take notice whenever you hear him. You will love this new single. It is Clay Aiken, AT HIS BEST!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 great songs","review":"My personal favorite of MOAM Clay's debut album is The Way. It has a great hook, pure beautiful vocals, and very identifiable lyrics that bring tears to my eyes. It's a main stream pop and AC beauty. Solitaire is something else. It is total classical pop. It is truly a masterpiece showcasing Clay's very unique, gorgeous, and powerful sound that was so a favorite on AI2. His voice though not enhanced with Echo (eg.Josh Groban, Celine Dion)is still magnificent. His glory notes give me chills. His lower range constitutes a Karen Carpenter rich quality. I cannot get enough of his voice. I highly recommend his debut album for it is very family-friendly, and the children especially enjoy his simple, yet very positive messages for them. His songs are easy to sing along with, and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"I have loved The Way since the first time I heard it on Clay's marvelous CD. HOWEVER - there are not enough superlatives for Solitaire - it is beyond words."},{"rating":"2","title":"NUMBER ONE DEBUT","review":"Yes, there's a reason that Clay's new single The Way/Solitaire debuted at Number One on the singles chart. No, it's not because \\"Claymates\\" went out and bought every copy they could get there hands on -- it's because it's an example of just what a PHENOMENAL voice this young man has. \\"SOLITAIRE\\" will take you to a plateau of emotion you haven't heard in, well, who knows how long? It's just mesmerizing. If you can buy The Way/Solitaire here, then you should do so, because many other outlets just can't keep it on their shelves. Clay OWNS this song -- so should you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly beautiful songs from a major talent","review":"I listened to this cd and was completely taken away by Clay Aiken's version of \\"Solitaire\\". The purity in this man's voice is unbelievable. He sings with such sincerity and emotion, and the song was simply meant to be sung by him. I literally got goosebumps listening to this song. I also love \\"The Way\\", which I have played countless times on his cd \\"Measure of a Man\\". In fact, I have played EVERY song on Measure of a Man countless times...the songs are so catchy and his voice is so beautiful. \\"The Way\\" is a song about the many inexplicable reasons that we fall in love with someone....and there is definitely something about \\"the way\\" that Clay sings that has made him my favorite recording artist. Buy The Way/Solitaire. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exquisite Work of Art","review":"From the arrangement to the vocal, this production is an exquisite work of art.

I already loved \\"The Way\\" from his \\"Measure of a Man\\" album but \\"Solitaire\\" has surpassed anything I've ever heard! Clay's range and vocal ability is out of this world and proves he is so much more than just a reality television star. If you haven't bought this CD yet, GO BUY IT! You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must for John Waters Fans!","review":"I enjoyed the JOHN WATERS: THIS FILTHY WORLD dvd. Part story telling--part stand-up comedy, Waters discuses the inspiration behind his movies, his relationship with cast members Divine and Edith Massey(among others), and why he got into film making in the first place.Funny, intelligent, and off-the-wall John Waters is as colorful as his movies and he'll keep you entertained for the 86 minutes he's on stage.For special features there's a lengthy Q&A; with the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stress Reducer","review":"I decided to watch this film on a night when I was tired and unhappy.

I am going to have to add it to a landfill and buy a new one.

I heard the stories a million times and was sure I'd never forget them, but I was surprised at how much I had forgotten. Besides my grandfather, I grew up knowing many of the other people in the book since they were my grandfather's life-long friends. The author did a wonderful job of capturing the stories these people loved to tell and the way she tells the stories reminds me of how each person told their stories.

He gravitated to the new object in his cage immediately and really seems to be enjoying it. Nothing fancy about this product, but I'd purchase again.The bones each come with one of those flexible metal holders that I immediately removed.

Some parts of the book started off very interesting and then seemed to just drag on, add to that the fact that there was nothing about Emma Bovary that I liked. She was a spoiled, self indulgent, mean person and I think if she lived today would have been diagnosed with some type of mood disorder. It always seemed like nothing was ever good enough for her and she liked to manipulate situations. I actually felt very bad for her husband, and could not understand why he loved her so much.

The book is read in a gruff, teen-speak monotone with even the most basic English words being mispronounced - not to mention horrendous versions of the most basic French vocabulary. Even the place names of Rouen and Tostes are mispronounced. Could someone not have given her some simple French pronunciation hints?

The clever design is such that it really puts physics to work for you, both in the way it grips the jar lid and the way it multiplies your force. It easily adjusts to a wide range of lid or bottle top sizes; it provides an ample handle for you to comfortably push or pull on; and the more push/pull force you exert on the handle, the tighter the device grips the lid. So far I have used it on perhaps a dozen jar or bottle tops that I could not budge by hand, and so far this device is undefeated.

We bought the deluxe version, but it's the same - thought the handle would be more sturdy.The product works pretty well. The 3 grippers are effective, if not tightened too little or too much. My main complaint is that even though you have good leverage on the lid with the tool, you still have to be able to hold the jar firmly, and this can be hard for some with a smaller jar or with smaller or weaker hands. You still have to exert considerable effort to open a very tight jar lid.I may try the wedge shaped gripper that mounts under the cabinet so that I can grip the jar myself with TWO HANDS.

I got this item delivered just in time - this one got the lid off in a matter of seconds, and I'm now eating pasta tonight!It works exactly as described -- adjusts to fit the size of your jar lid and grips securely onto the lid until you get the lid off. Far better than the Oxo jar opener, which I also have and which just managed to dig into and scratch the pasta sauce lid without opening it (and I'm a big Oxo fan -- have a lot of their products).I highly recommend this product -- this is one of those gadgets that completely wowed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kuhn Rikon Gripper Jar Opener","review":"This is a great kitchen tool for opening jars of various sizes.

Secrets first introduced in the first two books, Casting Shadows and Summoning Light, are brought to the surface and revealed; and Galen, the principal character, undergoes an unforgettable personal transformation.Character development has been one of the trademarks of the trilogy, and Invoking Darkness is no different. Not only are past questions about some of the characters answered, new ones are raised as a result, all with the ever-present Shadow war as a backdrop. For those who've read the first two books, Invoking Darkness is a sure must-read. If you're a newcomer to the Babylon 5 universe, this trilogy is an excellent starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, please!","review":"Jeanne Cavelos has written a very fine trilogy on the passing of the technomages. The characters are fleshed out and believable. The plots are interesting, well-paced, and integrated into the B5 universe. There are some moments of philosophical and even theological reflection that I very much appreciate in a sci-fi novel. I don't care for mere bang-em-up alien zapping!Some folks complain that this third novel covers too much \\"old ground\\" from the series. Bravo, I say. It takes us into some very dramatic, intense, and poignant moments from a completely new perspective. I have always loved Kosh, and I especially like Ms. Cavellos' treatment of his involvement with the technomages and other events. When a book gives me an \\"aha!\\" moment when I think about my favorite characters and episodes from TV, it's done a great job.I hope Jeanne Kavellos does a follow-up based on Galen's later adventures in \\"Crusade,\\" or perhaps turns her creativity to the time of Valen.

The majority of the piece examines what appears to be a clinically depressed Galen, his overwhelming need for revenge, and his desire for control. After so much negativity, the reader becomes accustomed to these feelings in the character. So, in the final chapter, making the rough transition to an almost spiritually fulfilled Galen seems ridiculous at best. Possibly, the author wrote herself into a corner and could not get out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for every fan","review":"As a die hard fan from B5 I find that all three trilogies (Bester, Centaury and Technomages) would deserve a set of films itself by its own merits.

Tie-ins to many events that took place along B5 series and some that make a jump point to Crusade's Gallen and his relation to Capt.Gideon.A must have for every fan but I wouldn't recommend it (the trilogy) to be read before watching the series, it could spoil some points in the main plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techno mages","review":"I like the Techno mages, and the book gripped me and I really couldn't put it Down.

It's 8:24 on Essential Classics' \\"Baroque Masterpieces\\" (B00005YQL6) & 6:58 on The Eroica Trio's \\"Baroque\\" (B00002SWU0). However, Pachelbel's \\"Canon\\" is 5:40 here, 6:29 on \\"Baroque Masterpieces,\\" and 4:28 on American Express' \\"Tranquil Seas.\\" Perhaps my favorite selection though is Bach's \\"Air\\" BWV1068 which is 4:55 here but 4:03 on volume 2 (Bach) in the Masters of Classical Music collection (B000001VU5). This is, perhaps, the favorite album in my collection. Rivalled only by EMI Classics' Baroque Telemann, Concertos & Sonatas (B000002S5Z) and The Masterpiece Collection, volume 7: Baroque.

They are five and six. I adamantly told them they could not use the set until the anchors were on. The anchors are now on (thanks, baby daddy!), and the set does not threaten to topple over.

These anchors \\"screw\\" securely into the ground to insure that the set does not topple-over when children actively swing and play roughly on it.

It's probably the type of soil that I have (which is combined sand and dirt) that I could not get these to stay in the ground. Every time I got one of the stakes into the ground, within seconds it was popping right back out. I ended up going to a chain home improvement store and purchasing another anchor set which was a more triangular stake rather than the screw type that came in this kit.

This caused numerous burned out bulbs and also fried my transformer completely on more than one occasion, which then had to be replaced.

I'll be giving my money to a more worthy author."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly disappointing","review":"i found this book very engaging because it was labeled a memoir but after the author admitted that he lied about the contents of the book, I must say that had I known that the events were made up, I would not have found them as gripping. I am also personally disappointed that he felt he had to mislabel his book. As a work of fiction, it's not very compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces of Terminal Uniqueness","review":"This book is readable, but it seemed more like an after-school special, where the poor little rich kid gets hooked on the pipe. In his quest for terminal-uniqueness, James Frey falls short in his gratitude that he's lucky to be alive. An ego-centric fella, I'm sure Mr. Frey is awaiting his Oscar nominated script and is visualizing Johnny Depp playing himself.I put this book down and I feel like it's fallen short. That I have been cheated and it just somehow doesn't ring true to me. I want to read the story of Lilly. In her brief appearance, she has struck a cord in my heart and I yearn to know her just a little bit more.This is probably the first graphical account of drug use that Oprah has ever read, and it's poor at best. I highly recommend books like \\"Permanent Midnight\\" \\"Scar Tissue\\" and \\"The Dirt\\" over this ho-hum account."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This book is amazing.

I can't believe they tried to pass this off as non-fiction. The only part I actually bought was the author's impotence; the rest of the book is macho overcompensation for this genital malfunction. Boring, with laughably bad prose and cliched characters that the author actually expects his readers to believe are based on real people, which is insulting. I can't believe this moron had the nerve to compare himself to Dave Eggers in an interview.Frey is an example of a spoiled, rich brat who used his parents' money and connections to have his crap published. See Tiffany Debartalo's 'God-Shaped Hole' for another example of a mind-bogglingly terrible novel published because the \\"writer\\" has rich parents. It's an alarming trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Lost Respect for Amazon","review":"That this book was picked by Amazon's editors as the best book of the year reveals one of two things. Either the editors are completely taken in by the marketing machine surrounding this book, or they simply don't know what good literature is. Don't believe me; read for yourself. All you have to do is get past the first sensational fifteen pages to know that this writer has a lot of problems with his prose. Repeating a word over and over again does not make for style--unless you're an undergraduate. He also rides on the back of slamming the twelve-step program, the only part of this book with any substance. The problem is, I can give you that message in three words instead of 400-plus: Do It Yourself. Wake up Amazon editors, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Dangerous Book!","review":"Very few drug addicts or alcoholics can achieve and maintain any long term sobriety without help and support and friendship found in a 12 step program like AA or NA. Although this book is riveting and an interesting read, it sends out a very dangerous message to people with the disease of addiction. I know this because I am a recovering alcoholic. Will power and sheer determination was NOT enough to keep me sober. I and many many others out there need the friendship, unconditional love and total understanding that we find at the tables of 12 step meetings to be able to maintain our sobriety and learn to live life on lifes terms without picking up a drink or a drug.This is the story of 1 man with a relatively short amount of sobriety... Keep that in mind while you are reading this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are we glorifying a guy who jumped the system?","review":"Does anyone else think it's wrong that James Frey didn't serve time for the crimes he committed before he went into rehab? His mob and judge friends got him off the hook--enabling him to serve 6 months in jail instead of several years in prison. While this book was a page turner, I find it disturbing that we're glorifying (and making rich) a guy who jumped the system. He may even have been a murderer--something he never clarifies. I would respect James had he served the consequences for what he did, and actually shown some remorse for his disgusting behavior. To me, that's as much a part of rehab as getting off the substances. Instead, he wrote 22 pages of his \\"sins\\" and then burned them--I guess that was his payment? But this is a guy who thinks he's above everything, including the rehab program he was in. He really is his own God. People like that scare me, and it scares me that our culture is so oblivious."},{"rating":"1","title":"All things being equal","review":"Fiction or non-fiction, it doesn't matter. It was a poorly-written account of addiction. Oprah originally called the book \\"riveting\\"? I'd call it boring. I mean how many times to we have to beat this dead horse? Every addict or alcoholic that I've ever spoken with comes out of rehab, sober for the moment, thinking that they can write a book. BORRRRRRIIIINNGGG! I'll give Frey two-stars for at least finishing it. That's an accomplishment. Fortunately, his career is finished as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"I was so excited to read this book after all the \\"can't put it down\\" hype. Because there was a wait list at the library I purchased the book because I couldn't wait to read it. My advice is, if you're that curious, borrow it from the library rather than wast your money. Can't put it down?! I could more than easily put it down from the first page forward. It is EXTREMELY repetitive. So he vomits AGAIN. ZZZZZzzzzzz. Quite the opposite of gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Pieces of Crap","review":"This is an amazingly bad book.Ridiculously pretentious,vain and stupid, James Frey wallows in self-pity for many pages.And his Writing Style is a satirist's dream:He thinks he's \\"Edgy\\" but He just doesn't Know how to Write.To write, in Words.How to write. Words, words, words.I'm James Frey.I'm repeating myself. Myself, myself, My Self.My Important Self.

I knew this couldn't possibly be true. It was like a ripoff of Marathon Man. At that point, I realized I'd been had and threw the book away in disgust.I acquired the book accidentally in a mistaken book club shipment and decided to give it a try. The narrator is an annoying spoiled rich kid, extremely unsympathetic. Like most junkies, he's boring. He has no interests except himself. The writing is tedious. When I caught my neighbour reading it on the subway I actually asked him in disbelief, \\"You LIKE that book?\\" (He said yes. God knows why.)Come on, no anaesthetic for a root canal? You'll need an anaesthetic..preferably some hard drugs..in order to enjoy this ridiculous, overheated, overhyped book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"I began reading this book with an open mind. I really wanted to like it, but the further I got into the story the more annoyed I became. I kept waiting for it to get better and for the plot to develop, but was disappointed on both accounts. All of the characters are too extreme and stereotypical. Because the stories are so unbelievable the author has no credibility. Even though I tried, I did not care for James and can't imagine how others could relate to him. He seems like a self-centered spoiled kid. I definitely do not recommend this book; reading it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"If the reader is forgiving and can get beyond the constant use of one vulgarity, this book is a guided tour through the sad world of substance abuse. Frequent choppy descriptions help provide smaller doses of the author's plight and occasional relief can be found in the love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I knew even before the Oprah scandal that a root canal without pain relief (solely because of a drug addiction) was unreasonable and absolutely untrue. Many forms of pain relief are non-narcotic. This book insults all recovering addicts working a 12-step program. Too bad I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"smoking gun's right...a million little lies","review":"when i first read this book i was intrigued by the things that the author had to say, proud almost of the fight that he put up to overcome his alcoholism....about two weeks ago i read the smoking gun's report on all of the discrepancies, all of the lies, all of the things that weren't 'quite right.' i still didnt believe it. but after today's viewing of oprah, i have to say that i completely change my views on the way that this author has portrayed everything in the book. i am ashamed to say that i even read it. i am going to get rid of it, i do not want something in my possession that is based on a million little lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"Although I am only on about the fourth chapter, so far, I find that the writer is quite redundant. It's obvious that he is just filling up pages. For instance, (although this is not a sentence from the actual book) here's an example of the writing; \\"I got up out of my chair, and I went to the kitchen, and I grabbed a plate, and I walked over to the table, and I sat down, and I tried to eat.\\" I find myself skipping over all the \\"ands\\" to get to the point, and do not find this read to be a \\"can't put it down,\\" but rather a \\"get to the point.\\" I plan to finish the book, of course, but I won't be any hurry to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the new addiction Bible...","review":"This entire book makes me think is that James Frey is a self-important ass, who has a very poor writing style. I work at a prominent substance abuse facility, and have been in treatment myself. It pains me that substance abuse and dependency patients are reading this and thinking that this is their rehab Bible, because if you behave the was Mr. Frey behaved you would be booted out on your ass. Withdrawals or not, physical or verbal abuse towards other patients or staff cannot be tolerated. For all these comments about how truthful and upfront this book is, you are naive if you think that this memoir is anything other than very bad fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"People believe this?","review":"The minute I hit the part about the priest in Paris, I knew something smelled funny. Well, it was a tossup between that and the conveniant suicide of Lilly, just a few hours before Frey's release. If it were just the one incident, he'd get away with it, but taken all together the book gives off the odor of trying too hard. It all reads like your basic movie-of-the-week, except with more vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Million little pieces","review":"Should have been a \\"Million Little Lies\\" James Frey.He write a fictional novel that is rejected by 17 publishing houses and then on his last attempt changes the context and make the novel a memoir. The book is filled with over exaggerated, vulgar and macho egos of the wild minded Frey.The book was very capturing as a memoir, and very disappointing as a fictional novel.He makes up a story contrived from what I can only believe as a wild imagination and over exaggerations of others lives.He gets to the heart of the reader with love, death and a against all odds of fighting addiction.He convinces true addicts that if the have the will they can conquer the demons. After finding out these memoirs were fictional I felt ripped of and betrayed by the author and his greed to deceive his readers and fellow authors as well as lead true addicts down the road to self-destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"If it were true, it would be life-changing.Since it is not true, yet referred to as a memoir, it is appalling.I don't appreciate being lied to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything About this book Rings False","review":"I suppose the manuscript was checked by facts people in the publisher's office, because the story just doesn't sound true to me, it's just way over the top.

Unfortunately, he \\"embellished\\" many key points of his so-called \\"memoir\\". Most notably, he claimed to have spent months in jail. In truth, as revealed by smokingun.com, he only spent a few hours in jail! And no, he never underwent dental surgery without painkillers. Which begs the question \\"How much of his memoir are based on actual memories?\\".

I'd suggest finding a passage, or three, and reading them. Who knows, you might find his style sufficiently engaging, creative, or novel enough to enjoy. As you can likely guess, I was not a fan.* Speaking of \\"novel,\\" your knowledge of a single critical thing about this book will forever color your perception of it: It is almost entirely false. A number of websites have touched on this issue far better than I could hope to, but just bear in mind that this book is a novel, not a memoir.* This book was written, it would appear, in an effort to make the reader cry as much as possible. Relentless attempts to make me like a character only to kill him off didn't suit my tastes, but you may find it enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Simply An Insult To Those In Recovery","review":"Regardless of how powerfully written, when packaged and sold as a \\"memoir\\" this book became an insult to anyone truly struggling with recovery. Why? Because deceit never leads the way to wellness. My mother's step grandson is currently struggling with a serious meth addiction. He is currently in his second in-patient rehab. Meth addiction is harrowing enough without any need to embelish the truth. Truth itself can be grittier than the fiction passed off as reality in this book. And to lie about one's struggle with addiction... to lie about and dramatize the recovery process... belittles all of those who are honestly struggling to salvage their lives. Shame on the author, the publisher, and Oprah for making millions from lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, Lies, Lies.","review":"I tried reading this book after my girlfriend recommended it to me. I was enthralled by it at first, because of how shocking the storyline is, but by page 50 my \\"b.s. detector\\" was ringing and by page 100 it was howling so badly that I had to throw the thing down. I just talked to a friend about it who told me that the book is in fact a bunch of lies and that I should check out the thesmokinggun.com. I cannot believe this guy didn't expect to get caught. Reading this book for me was like listening to an eight year old boy brag about his adventures as a macho dragon slayer. James Frey claims he read Don Quixote in prison, maybe what he meant to say is that he is imprisoned in Don Quixote. This guy should be seriously ashamed of himself. He's right about being a \\"Criminal,\\" (which he capitalize in such a poetic way) but not the cool type of criminal that he wants to be. He's pathetic and he owes a lot people a lot of money and an explanation.

I recommend this book to anyone who feels stuck in their life's progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Pieces","review":"I was impressed with James Frey on OPhra and very dissapointed in his book. The language was offensive to me and it distracted me from reading the book. People have commented as to how the book has helped them with their addictions and I was interested in sharing this with people that have those problems.

I would recommend this book but not to the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Million Words","review":"Thrilling is a word for James Frey's memoir A Million Little Pieces. With itemizing details and a story to keep you going, the book is a winner. Voyage with James, an alcoholic, drug addicted, substance abuser, through his three week journey of rehab. Because of the anger and rage experienced as a child James Frey started using substances at a young age. As he grew, his anger grew with him.Over his three week time in rehab he meets many interesting, touching people and has many experience even I could relate to.There were times when the book wasn't all it could have been. At times I found it hard to believe, and Frey did repeat himself often. I thought the book was a bit long, it was interesting at times and the detail was useful but sometimes it was repetative. The book was captivating and I thought the ending was entertaining, though predictable. Overall I'm glad I read the book and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't appreciate lies....","review":"Maybe this book would be better if it wasn't a pack of lies to make money.

Now I feel sucker punched. A book can't qualify as a memoir if huge chunks are a fictional re-telling of events.

Mr. Frey was brought up with a sibling in a nice house with parents who were happily married and well-traveled. Seems to me that he took advantage of them and now wants to simply whine on paper. For me, it was a waste of time and money. There's enough depressing stuff in the world. Most of Oprah's selections are worth the effort, so I stuck through this one until the end and still can't stop shaking my head. Marley and Me would have been a much better choice, Oprah. Sorry. The only thing this book did is make the author/liar, Mr. Frey, a richer man."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dissenter","review":"Okay, I'll be the dissenter.Although Frey goes through some harrowing stuff and gives some good info on addiction, the guy is so annoying. He is such a jerk to everybody that I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for him.And speaking of annoying, his writing style is just that. He repeats and repeats and repeats and the capital letters scattered throughout make me wonder if he's really a 13 year old girl posing as an adult. It would be a good 200 page book. Unfortunately it's 400+ pages. Maybe I missed something but I just couldn't get excited about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Cover!","review":"And that's about it.This criminally overated clunker is as riveting as Brock Landers' steely gaze in Boogie Nights.The \\"technique\\" of following a sentence with a fragment or two or three or four fragments, which is then followed by a single word from said fragment is a very tiresome gimmick, not a means of achieving profundity.The \\"story\\" is uncompelling and contrived: R.P. McMurphy lite (with the Tao Te Ching(!) in his back pocket) and his gaggle of cliche-aracters vs a coterie of woefully ineffectual mental health professionals. And oatmeal. And a fat otter.

And as another reader pointed out, root canals take more than one sitting. Having published twenty-five novels, I have to say this book smacked of fiction. In my opinion James Frey probably can't write grammatical sentences, which is why he resorted to this hodge-podge style.

They are more fascinating especially if you're the type drawn to scenes of car crashes and other mishaps.When the book is eclipsed by the story of the author then the book begs closer scrunity.In the naked text without the buzzing hype or the author's testerone fueled rants the story revealed itself for what it was: another story of addiction with promise which sank to the predictable.A story with a hint of substanceBut lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting a million little pieces back together","review":"This book was filled with addiction, hope, life, every day struggles, depression, courage, strength, and most importantly a profound, deep respect for James Frey.

I also hear that there is a lot of controversy about some of the incidents in the book but as far as I am concerned, the basics- the withdrawal, the feelings of the addict- were quite relevant and was the beginning of helping me to somewhat understand our situation.

And it matters to most readers too.-The book was rejected by many publishers as a work of fiction (which it apparently is, in substantial part). Only got accepted once he labelled it (falsely) non-fiction-Labelling it non-fiction was representing to the reader that \\"this actually happened\\".-Frey compounded his lies by going on Oprah and elsewhere to sell his book and discussing his \\"experiences\\"--some of which never actually happened.On Oprah (whose selection of the book sold more than a million copies) Frey talked about all his personal struggles.

I know many people do these things but that doesn't make it acceptable. In an age of false wars, Enron accounting, and fake newspaper articles, has everyone in this country completely lost their scruples? How revolting!

In any case, one has to wonder if anyone reading this book ever stopped to think. Can a guy get on a plane and fly somewhere dripping blood, with missing teeth, drunk and unable to move? Really? For all of those, like me, who have seen the true suffering the the mentally ill and the addiction; for those of us who know that, in truth, most people don't make it out when they're that deep in hell.

See, most of us addicts are mostly addicted with one thing - ourselves. Just as Frey makes himself out to be some big tough guy to make himself feel big, I can feel big about myself for smelling his BS a page into his book.The difference is I didn't con people out of their money to feed my narcissm. Frey did. He owes an apology to everyone who spent time and money on his book.

The story regarding the dentist is just absurd and so unbelievable you just have to talk to any dentist to realize that they would be medicated. The last straw for me was the Lilly scene at the end *puke*, talk about melodramatic. While Oprah does pick a quality book now and then , this is a joke. His arrogance is also dangerous for those that are seriously trying to overcome addiction. Maybe in a few years he'll write a book about how he overcame his compulsive lying disorder, at least that could really be fiction..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total and absolute crap.","review":"I read both books twice and now I want my money back.

I remember thinking at the beginning 'it's a real shame that memoirs are sometimes written by terrible writers, because it doesn't matter how stunning their story, it sometimes read like crap.' Oh, right. It is crap. I didn't buy the book direct from Random House so I won't be elligible for a refund. I might send it back to them all the same.

He's on a plane drunk, with a badly torn up face, swollen shut eyes, dripping blood, and covered in vomit and urine? No airline would let a passenger on in that condition!Also, if you've seen Frey in real life, you know he doesn't look like someone who's been through what he claims he has. He should look like a hundred miles of bad road---he doesn't.Oprah defended the book on Larry King when the author was on tonight. The problem with Oprah's defense is that since it is a work of fiction, Frey's \\"personal story\\" cannot be used as a source of inspiration to others in their struggles with addiction. His edict to \\"hold on\\" doesn't hold water when his account of what he went through was a figment of his overactive imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops the book got a little too popular...","review":"This is all Oprah's fault.

As a work of Fiction this book is a 2 on a scale of 1-10......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Morally flawed","review":"Jame's Frey's book is as much a memoir of addiction recovery as it is a celebration of his own brash and irrational rejection of authority, convention, and God. Though his testimony is courageous, it should be evident to any reader who finishes this book that his stubbornly independent recovery strategy wasn't enough to help him overcome his character flaws. Frey's writing betrays his reliance on profanity to convey emotion and his ineptitude in higher literary articulation. His sentiments betray his egotism and his disdain of religion. His relationships betray his lack of wisdom and of respect for law and morality. I highly discourage reading this book, and vehemently discourage subscribing to its philosophies. Though Frey overcame drugs, his integrity is still in shambles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Depressing......pure and simple.

I am editing this because I typed the rest of the previous thing when I just wanted to save it. Word."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Pieces","review":"Well, the book was entertaining.

I felt very connected and found myself going through all of the same feelings. I don't care if the story isn't true because it is a book and I believe it is technically classified as fiction so no one is really lying to you if it was made up. It is a good book about addiction and what it can do to lives, friends, and families. I would also have to say that I would find one disturbing thing about this book would be that it would seem to encourage addiction recovery as something that you can do alone which in most cases (if not all) is not possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Million Over Reactions","review":"I had heard all the controversy about this novel but I wanted to read it for myself. What all the controversy blocks out is how much GOOD this novel/non-fiction (who cares which it is?) can do - how it can help those who have addicts in their lives, how real it is.. how important this book is, and how important this book SHOULD be.. everyone who has any kind of addict in his or her life should read this book.. and if you are an addict you may want to read it too, to find out that you are not alone, your experiences are not as unique as you think, and that there is a possibility of hope.."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"So satisfying to have this creep exposed as a liar and plagarist. As a recovering addict myself, I felt his drug history never rang true and then the whole 'I don't need a program or support and can do this on willpower alone' flies totally in the face of conventional wisdom. It smacks the face of the over 4 million people who are recovering in the rooms of AA and NA. So happy to see the smug sh*t fumbling thru interviews today. I only wish there were negative star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good non-fiction, bad fiction","review":".When it was a 'true life' memoir I found the book to be engaging (although overwrought in some places). You could sense he exaggerated some, but such seems to be the nature of addicts. It was one of those stories which kept you thinking, \\"This would be lame if it wasn't true\\". Well, turns out it wasn't true, so in fact is totally lame.As a piece of fiction it flat out sux. The hoary cliches and steroetypical characters are the stuff one expects from a college freshman writing class.

The law enforcement personnel mentioned in this book show that there is nothing behind the author's claims. The families of the victims mentioned in this book deny any knowledge of this person. There is no historical, actual, or witnessed fact in this piece of self-pitying fiction. It surprises me how a person can degrade himself for a publisher's millions.

I couldn't believe that everything that was in the book was true as I read it because my Son had been in rehabilitation and had an addiction problem longer than the author and didn't go through anything like that nor was he treated like the author. I also didn't like the fact that he was against AA because that is a tremendous help to alcholics. My Son has helped many people through AA and people should be encouraged to use that program.

After the first 10 pages or so, \\"Million Little Pieces\\" reads like the script for a \\"Lifetime\\" or \\"Oxygen\\" channel movie. Mr Frey's \\"I'm a Victim\\" shtick may play well on Oprah, but the sympathy factor is running pretty low elsewhere.

I believe the changes that were intentional were minor and the facts that checked out as very different from Frey's recollection can certainly be attributed to his state of withdrawal, which, as we all know, would certainly skew perceptions/recollections.

It's written so different from other things that it's hard to discribe, it's gripping, honest,disgusting, scary, and the feeling of loyality and friendship are powerful. I loved it.

I could look over the fact that his grammar is like a child's if his stories were completely true. I do enjoy a good \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" story. But let's face it. His stories were mostly fabricated and his writing style is that of staccato rambling. I'm moving on to a better book already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry book by an angry man","review":"I hated this book.

The author's style of writing is terrible and I think his story could have been told just as well without the choppy sentences and probably a record number of F words in any book I have ever read. I also don't beleive the story of the dental procedures done without any novocane. Sounds like something from \\"Marathon Man\\". If he had had a ruptured appendix, would they have removed it without any anesthesia? A person can go into shock from pain and I have never heard of the use of novocane triggering any relapse in an addict.

Who knows if everything else is a lie, just to make a couple extra bucks for oprah to retire on.Though suspenseful throughout the story, you want to find out what happens to the guy. Any book that is passed as nonfiction and later revealed as fiction doesn't deserve any audience because only honest authors should accomplish anything.But as long as there is women over the age 20 with nothing else to do but clean the house and be a tired old housewifes, oprah's still gonna have an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, This Book Was Amazing","review":"I would definitely be considered a voracious reader, and I must say that A Million Little Pieces could be the best book I have ever read. I don't cry at movies, and I certainly don't cry when reading. This book made me cry tears of sorrow as well as tears of joy at least 10 times while reading. I laughed out loud several times, and I found that I peeled through this book in 2 days time. Frey really has a great way of conveying how he was feeling while at Rehab. While it may be an unorthodox prose, I can't wait to get my hands on his follow up book \\"My friend Leonard\\". READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - truth, honesty, friendship","review":"What a story. Around every turn this is intense drama reflective of the hard, intense, honest life James has lead. The first half of the book is gripping - the pain, the \\"toughness\\", the fear is very moving.

Mr. Frey's fifteen minutes of \\"fame\\" were up long ago. For those of you who bought into this \\"compelling\\" pseudomomoir, especially Oprah- you have been bamboozled. Meanwhile, Mr. Frey is laughing all the way to the bank. His genre is in keeping with our modern \\"culture\\"- vapid actors, inane movies, putrid television and now aliterate \\"literature\\".

But, now after these allegations came out and to find out that he embellished \\"parts\\" of his memoir makes me totally doubt if he even had any problems with addiction at all. Could he have gone to rehab as a writer to gather information for this book ? Might have happened. I had planned on getting this book, now I wouldn't read it if someone gave it to me. He makes a mockery out of the TRUE recovery process and the pain and suffering that we encounter. I, for one, don't believe that he was even and addict at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad indeed!","review":"I struggled through this book filled with horrific descriptions of agony and suffering, simply because I thought it was true! In fact, I frequently told myself that no one could make up something this attrocious! Essentially, it's the only way I was able to endure the entire book. As I turned the pages, I found myself wondering how he could possibly remember the details so clearly, given the fact he was out-of-his-head much of the time. Midway through the book, my husband asked if it was a good book, and I explained that if it were a fictional story, the author couldn't write himself out of a wet paper bag, so in a word, I described it as \\"sad.\\" Turns out the \\"sad\\" part is that I paid good money for this drivel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware","review":"A total \\"wannabe\\" ive been a addict for 35yrs.

Because of his lies how do we know the rest of the book even happened. I wonder if he was even an addict at all. I watched the Oprah show where people who were addicts were given advice from this guy. He knew from the beginning about the lies but wasn't man enough to step forward and change the items.

It is a book and story and should be treasured like any other.

The characters and situations seem a bit too \\"stock\\", and Frey seems to love building himself up as this tough guy whom everybody eventually fears. If Frey had cut this book down by half, I think it would have been a smoother read. The \\"love scenes\\" between Frey and Lilly bring any action in the book to a screeching halt, and the final scene between them seems to be cribbed from an 80s teen flick. What starts off as such a promising read became for me an endless one, and I had to stop halfway through because I was growing very tired of Frey. By the end of the book, I didn't even like him.

The haphazard punctuation and such is just a clever way for James Frey to dsiguise the fact that he does not know, or care to take the time to abide by, the rules of written english.

He repeats so many sentences dozens of times, as if he was trying to make a 430 page book with a 200 page story. I never write book reviews, but I felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I understand he was trying to emphasize how he (his character felt), but honestly enough with the fury fury fury fury want want want need need need.

I pined for complete sentences and more introspection from the narrator. Frey made good points about the ineffectivness of the assembly-line AA recovery system which i appreciated as a fellow recoveree (self determination is more effective than AA). Most points were lost in his adolescent ego. I tired of the defy-the-status-quo/system attitude. By the end, I didn't care whether the narrator remained sober or not. This book contributes little to the bloated glut of recovery memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"brutally honest and riveting...","review":"I found this story to be very stimulating and pure. It is very down to the bone and a true page turner. After reading this I definitely suggest, \\"My Friend Leonard.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A million Little Pieces","review":"James Frey's book is one of the most accurate accounts of recovery ever written. The emotion he conveys and the pain he endures is incredibly raw. The style in which he composes his story allows you to digest each sentence as you would a bite of a fantastic meal, taking a bite, tasting each individual flavor and digesting it slowly. He shows you the human condition at its worst, describing a world that few of us will ever experience. What the media tends to glamorize, Frey shows as the horror that any drug addict knows is the truth. Mr. Frey's triumph over his demons and what he calls The Rage are nothing short of a miracle. Read this book immediately!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I thought the book was a real page turner. I could not put it down. The author gave very good insight on what it is like to be in rehabilitation program.I would highly recommend this book to read. It is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it for what it is and you may enjoy this book more","review":"For all of you who are coming down so hard on Frey, how many of you have actually been drug addicts?? Seen, felt, or experienced what he described in his memoir?? MAYBE a fourth of you. You claim you've asked other people who supposedly know more about the circumstances than he does...What makes your source more believeable than him?? Because YOU know them?? You can't fight or condemn something when you have no personal basis to argue from. Would you have enjoyed it more and looked at it with a more open mind had it been placed in the fiction section?? Probably so.The bottom line is A Million Little Pieces is a remarkable and beautiful account of what a human being can do when they believe in themselves and believe they have something to live for, and also shows it's never too late to change and improve if you truly desire to. Fiction or non-fiction, exagerrated or straight-to-the-point, it's heart-wrenching, raw, and inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul Language","review":"I was really shocked by the language in this book.

Not only was it boring, but he doesn't know how to write. He has no soul, gives no reason to care about him and left me feeling a little nauseated. I've seen it all before, selfish people abusing people over and over again. I was hoping he would just disappear and leave everyone alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Frey A Million Little Pieces","review":"A must read for anyone who has known an addict. The book gives insight into the turmoil and self destruction of the addict/alcoholic. Even if Frey had embellished on some parts, it still sent the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"So he stretched the truth a bit - who hasn't?","review":"I think all the flap over whether Mr. Frey spent 3 hours in jail or 3 months is irrelevant. If you like the way the book is written, and you feel, as I do, that there were some worthwhile stories included in it, then the book is worth the money. Whenevr I see the word \\"memoir\\" I asume it means \\"the way I remember things\\" and not that whatever is contained is precisely the way it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Since he didn't live it, I don't have to read it to review it -- take that integrity!","review":"I'd like to tell you another true story about redemption and strife. A lofted character raised on high, teetering with excess and frailty. Unaware of his plight which caused those around him such anguish, he tipped and tilted, wobbled and spun, precariosly close to the abyss. When at last feeling vindicated and secure the impending doom befell him. Caught between heaven and hell, falling through the space of a dark abyss, drugged and screaming, he crashed.And all the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put humpty dumpty back together again."},{"rating":"2","title":"People Just Don't Get It!","review":"I just want to say...WHO CARES IF EVERY WORD IS TRUE OR NOT?

I could care less if every word is true or not - how true are our actual memories? I don't even care about the \\"message\\" of this book - I just care about reading something that provokes thinking, change, feeling...Are we now going to revisit every memoir and decide whether or not every fact is true or not - and if it's not should we put warning labels on them?

He seems to confuse masculinity with megolmania. If he was such a great writer and such a \\"man\\" why does he have to mouth off like a 17 year old High School football jock in interviews? Anyone that has confidence in the quality of their work would be fine letting the work speak for itself, but James Frey is obviously more than a little lacking in self-esteem. I have a feeling when the \\"greatest writer\\" of my generation comes around (I'm 28), he won't be announcing it over a loudspeaker in the media. He'll quietly go about creating great work, and will be rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Book...Author Another Story!","review":"No problem with the vendor, but as everyone has heard...what a con artist ol' Jimmy turned out to be!

I read this in a post-confession world and I tried to keep an open mind.The problem with this book is it all seems to be leading towards an amazing ending but in the end it simply tears down the AA and presents an near-impossible solution.I think even if the book were true it would still be dissapointing because the book is less of a memoir and more of a rant. Mediocrity struggling to make a point. I would read this if you really want to (and lets face it you will read it anyway) but keep in mind that the ending is incredibly dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drug addict wanna -be","review":"It would have been so much better if he actually told the truth if he was going to present it as truth! The reader can not help but feel frauded. I know people like the persona he made or stole for the character, and there is nothing amazing or special about being a complete waste of flesh. His character is so self absorbed he can't see how inconsequential a crack head is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Non-Fiction Book I've Read In Awhile","review":"This was an excellent book! I would recommend anyone and everyone read this book! James Frey is a great writer, and makes you realize what he went through in rehab. I enjoyed the book so much that I've already ordered his other book \\"My Friend Leonard.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Please try this book","review":"After having read James Frey's debut novel, my answer is an unequivocal and resounding yes.I cannot remember a book evoking such a wide variety of emotions from me. Horror and shock at the damage and visceral accounting of the author's self-destruction; awe at Frey's shockingly honest and unfiltered description of himself and the path which led him to his crossroads; gut wrenching sadness at the shattered lives of the characters and pride and joy at the truth that free-will, friendship, integrity and love can liberate even the most self-destructive of people.Through \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" Frey allows us to see a human being at his absolute worst and 200 pages later at his best. Driving home the themes of self-accountability, integrity, honesty, friendship, love and free will through his journey, Frey brings the reader along with electric dialog, hearty laughter and tearful moments of both pain and joy.A writer for a generation... I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very real account of addiction and recovery","review":"The author takes readers on a journey starting with the realization that he is in rehab all the way until he is completed with the process. The book is written in a very matter-of-fact way that gets inside Frey's head when he is going through a very rough time in his life. He does a great job of keeping the reader interested by telling the tale in a very vivid format. I can't even imagine going through what he did, but I respect him greatly for it and for sharing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unbelievable","review":"My 17 year old read this book first and was so shocked and sickened by this story. Well, when I read it I was shocked and sickened by the tremendous amount of fictitious bravado and crap this guy was pedaling. If you are thinking of buying this book please google \\"James Frey\\" first. I agree with other reviewers, I just can't believe Oprah,in all her infinite glory, didn't have someone do some fact checking. I am not an addict, however, I can't imagine this does anything to make an addict want to get better or help to inspire anyone. Shame on you James Frey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"OK, I will be honest. The big mess on Ophrah is what made me want to read this book. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I had no problems whatsoever that this book was not an autobiography. It was still a great read. I have been around addicts who have been to rehab, and this is an accurate account for some. The story drew me in and made me want to read,read, read! I did not want to put this one down!I was so hooked by the story, that I did not want it to end. I really felt like I was watching his world unfold right in front of me. Every character came to life.GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Pices","review":"I think this book was total bogus. maybe parts was true but this doesn't happen in the real world.It was interesting fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Lies err Maybe","review":"When I purchased the book, it was so that I could gain insight into a person's journey through addiction. I think the book is well written but should be re-classified with all the negative media surrounding the untruths stretched throughout the book. I too, have been able to lead a productive life without the 20 years of crack cocaine addiction feeding my need to 'sham' people out of anything. I would think Mr. Frey is feeling pretty low these days but the truth is what sets us all free. Good read for fiction and spiritual in strength for anyone's individual journey down the sometimes, neverending road toward recovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding dependence through the eyes of an addict","review":"My friend asked me when I was finished reading the book, \\"regardless it's fiction or memoir, would you have found the story any less interesting?\\" The answer is no. It doesn't matter if it's fact, fiction or a mixture of the two. The story is compelling.The reality of addiction as told through Frey's eyes is jarring. His writing style is fractured, yet focused - and serves as the perfect delivery given the subject matter; and, we find, a genuine reflection of the author's personality. I gleaned from this book a deeper understanding of the recovery process and the powerful internal struggle every addict must endure in order to survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"So poorly written","review":"I wanted to like this book, especially having enjoyed others in the niche. But, the writing style is so bizarre, with odd capitalisation and no use of speech marks (at all!) that one is constantly reminded one is reading a book, rather than enjoying reading a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"i read this years ago and wanted to read it again. i dont read many books more than once but i will this one. very exciting and shocking. even if it isnt a true story there is a lot to learn form this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Million Little Pieces","review":"I have always loved this book. It is real, it is honest, frank and completely removed of any fairy tale bs. I will reread this over, and over again. It is a chilling, dark and horrifying tale of an alcoholic, a drug addict, and a criminal and I completely adore James Frey for sharing these beautiful words with the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"I read the whole book only because I kept waiting to get to the good part. There is no good part. I certainly never felt that I couldn't put it down. Day after day of descriptions of him vomiting chunks didn't do it for me as a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Pieces","review":"I only read a few pages and it started out to be a very good read. I put the book down planning on reading it for the up coming rainy weekend, then the very next day it came out that the author had made up most of all the details in the book. It spoiled it for me because I thought it was a true story based on his life. I have not picked the book up since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the page turner as Oprah described","review":"Althouth I really enjoyed this book; it is not the suspensful page turner as described by Oprah. It is a very good read though and kept my interest through his painful journey through recovery.

It's like watching a train wrecks and Kobe trials on television. You just can't look away. In the tradition of Rikki Lee Travolta's \\"My Fractured Life\\" and with that same hint of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is hyper addictive reading about the ugliness of addiction that we can enjoy in safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was interested in the beginning.. badly written fiction.","review":"His intense descriptions about his addiction captured me through the first 50 pages or so and then after that, I had to MAKE myself read. I'm now on page 100 or so and this will probably be the first book I stop reading in the middle. It's extremely repetitive and horribly fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly precocious","review":"Picked up my wife's copy and started reading it. This is poetry gone wrong from an overgrown child. History will not look positively on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely engrossing and hard to put down","review":"Quite frankly, if this isn't a true story and is marketed as one, that's pretty crappy. However, this book grabbed my attention fast and didn't let go. I would read it at stoplights, on my lunch break, etc. I couldn't put it down and I read it in just a few days. In my opinion a good book is a book that holds your attention, is easy to follow, makes you laugh, makes you cry and is overall entertaining. This book did all of those things, as well as the sequel, My Friend Leonard. I LOVE both of them and would recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if he said it were fiction...","review":"[...] it's just not a quality read. The protagonist was not admirable at all to me, but seems to have been created to be sympathized with. However, his stubbornness and hostility towards well-meaning people made him as unlikeable as could be in my eyes. The style of the novel also seems to be pretentious, as if James Frey were attempting to be avant-garde in ignoring conventional punctuation and paragraph structure. His over usage of the letter \\"I\\" not only added to the selfishness of his narrator, but it also degraded the style of the novel. Though there are good points in the story and some noteworthy things that he does with the rehab experience that most people wouldn't otherwise witness, I wouldn't say this is a classic by any means. Frey has a way to go before he hits anything near that mark.But if you're all plot, then maybe this is a good read for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"Great book. Who cares that the author embelished the details of his life a little. Everyone is entitled to their own perception of their experiences. Frey is a genius! The style of writing is so different but so easy to comprehend. You really feel what he experienced. This book truly gives hope to those who feel powerless with addiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"[...] I was immersed in James Frey's portrayal of self-destructive rage.

I liked it because some of the things he went through seemed so unbelievable, but it was not a book of fiction -- that amazed me! The shocking first page -- waking up on the plane, covered in blood, no memory of what happened -- I was AMAZED! I kept thinking -- no way that could have happened -- they wouldn't let this guy on the plane, but this was a memoir!! Was the story regarding his dental work an \\"embelishment\\" or did it really happen. It was fascinating because it was true...now it's just over-the-top writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"The book holds your interest throughout and gives a very detailed daily look at an addict getting clean. It is realistic. The book makes anyone feel that they can overcome anything if they hold on and lose the fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous lies","review":"Frey has done addicts a terrible injustice. Having been to Hazelton myself, it is obvious that this is the treatment center described in the book. \\"A Million Little Pieces\\"is palmed off as an autobiography, but Frey openly lies about many aspects of Hazelton's treatment methods - such as claiming that screaming patients are held behind bars in the detox unit, or that he had to have dental surgery without anesthesia. His strange account of saving his girl friend from a crack house is clearly totally manufatured. But in the end the worst thing Frey does is to make obvious that treatment did nothing for him: he did it on his own. This supercilious finale will cause suffering drug addicts and alcoholics to believe they can do the same, which 99% cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its all a lie!","review":"He just went on Oprah Winfrey and admitted that much of the book is fabricated for shock value and to carry the story along more attractively.A million little pieces contains about the same number of lies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"I bought Frey's book in December before the story broke about the fictional aspects of his story and I have to admit that I didn't like the book and didn't bother finishing it.I got to the point of the book just after his brother visited him in the facility. I didn't find his writing style vivid or captivating. He repeated the same things over and over again, and I wanted to hear more details about his experiences. I could only read but so much of passages that say, \\"I want drugs, I want crack, I want to do a lot of it\\". Seriously, I'm surprised that people can tolerate this kind of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should I Continue Reading ???","review":"I too started this book, I have not finished it simply because I have 3 children and barely have time. Now, I am not sure whether to complete the book or not. I am so tainted by all of the controversy and wish I never saw any of it on TV until I was done reading it!! I really liked the book and feel sorry for James Frey. I think he truly regrets it. Although he never said \\"sorry\\", I don't think he has to. He has been humiliated enough and I think this may be detrimental to his recovery. I believe he was/is an addict and that is all that matters (to me). I even purchased one for my 11 year old son to read. I am totally against the graphic words and violence in the book and think my son will be exposed enough to these words in 'real life', but I was trying to show him the effects that drugs and alcohol can have on your life and just wanted to SCARE the heck out of him.....does that make me a bad Mom? If it scares my son enough, than I thank James Frey!Gina"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares if some parts are fiction","review":"Honestly, there should be no heated discussions on whether or not it is all nonfiction, or if parts are fiction. Memoirs do NOT need to be 100% real. Authors, when writing memoirs, have the right to exaggerate moments, as a memoir is what the author THINKS and VIEWS what happened in their past. Though what they may remember may be false, they can still write it, as it is their remeberance. If you hear two sides of a story between children, they will always remember things differently. This is no different from writing a memoir. I have written one, and you can remember things differently than others. Putting this in a book does not mean you are lying; you have the right and artistic liscense to do so within your own book. Get over it, and just read the book.

He rejects the concept of a Higher Power, yet has made himself the god of his own world. He illustrates the description of an alcoholic/addict as an egomaniac with an inferiority complex. I very much question most of the details of rehab as he describes them, and I speak from experience and many years of sobriety. Drinking: A Love Story is by far the best description of the mental process in addiction I have read so far,(and Dr. Henry Tiebout's pamphlet, Compliance vs. Surrender perfectly describes removal of the compulsion to drink or use) but if this book helps some people, great. I just hope readers don't unconditionally accept as truth everything in the book. It just doesn't ring true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is important... but...","review":"Regardless of whether the book was the truth or not it was good. Although, I do believe that if it had been marketed as fiction or as \\"based on a true story\\" it would have not seemed as powerful.

I liked the book and encourage others to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misled...not for a minute","review":"Having read both Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard, I have to say that I am more surprised at how many people are so shocked that he embellished many details in his book. As much as I enjoyed reading both books, it was clear to me that much of his bravado was just that...bravado. Root canals with no anesthetic...ha. Loaded unconscious and bleeding onto a plane...yeah, right. Aside from it being over the top (the not-so-true parts), I was totally immersed in reading this book from beginning to end.

Human weakness is a given, I guess, but I'm tired of these books in many ways. First, no ones seems to learn a damn lesson.

Sure, there are \\"social\\" drug users, but like \\"social\\" drinkers, they do it to fit in. They UNDERSTAND what can happen if you let it swallow you up.

I haven't found one like that since the Thornbirds so decided to buy it. Made a special trip to a bookstore about 15 miles from my home and settled in when I returned home to read this. I kept thinking it would get better and when I got to page 53 I just stopped and thought, I have had enough. When I took it to our local library this afternoon the librarian was thrilled to receive it and said they had a huge waiting list. I told her that I thought it was absolutely terrible and can't imagine anyone finishing this book. I must say that this is the only book I have ever gone to read the last page because I knew I would never finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's better if you yourself were an addict","review":"Or have someone in your life who is/was. This book has received a lot of undeserved hype. Spoiled rich kid who can't understand why his sheltered upbringing has left him unarmored and unable to understand that Life Isn't Fair. Unfortunately it's become a literary genre of sorts in the last decade. In Frey's case, the writing, such as it is, is a bit precious, as are the typographical tricks, AND YET, I can see how this book would hold your attention if your own personal circumstances aligned with his. It's just a shame that he wasn't able to reveal his insights in a somewaht more accessible fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better screenplay than a book...","review":"I'm sorry. But I ain't buying it.I believe James Frey was a hopeless addict, I believe he went to a facility like the one he described, I believe he has now kicked his addictions through sheer will power, and I admire him for it. But I don't believe one of word of the dialogue he wrote in this autobiography, the characters he describes, or the interactions he had.The people come off as archetypal. The interactions make believe. That's not to say he's not a good writer, it's just that I didn't believe what I was reading to be a factual account of what really happened.He is imaginative and should write more movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Rich Fast! Get Empathy with Lies by the author himself..","review":"Spare me. The guy was in jail for two hours but calls his book a memoir, then writes he was in prison for 87 days (far from embellishing but blatant lies). This author would've been better off categorizing his book as fictitious or ridiculous. He went as far as lying about his own girlfriend's suicide.His formulaic writing approach to tug at the heartstrings of readers everywhere for lessons he supposedly learned from all the \\"hardship\\", geez, merely displays a Poor little rich guy with a selfish little drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guy's a Fraud","review":"This shows how easily the fake can be marketed more easily than the genuine.

And Oprah is right in there: first with the marketing, then with the attack . . . laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad book on every level","review":"This prose of this book is horrid and the story is utterly cliche. As such, it was no surprise when it came out that Frey had tried for a long time to publish his book as FICTION.It was horrible fiction and the publishers knew it. But then he tried to sell it as a memoir (or publishers coaxed him into doing that) since people are suckers for survival memoirs.It is totally despicable that Frey lied. But even if he hadn't, and had published this as fiction, it would still be a bad, bad book.(People interested in a good book on addiction, read Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus' Son\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not truly recovered","review":"Sorry but anyone who has abused any substance and faced recovery would say that it isn't just quitting the use of that substance that proves you are recovered. It is the change of character, the facing down your demons and gaining victory over them. If one has to lie about one's circumstances and events surrounding one's addictions then I would seriously question their recovery. This author is not recovered, sure he isn't abusing any longer but he is still living with his demons and is using lies to keep them at bay. But with the present controversy nipping at his heals he will have to stare those demons and his obvious self loathing down. But if he just 'holds on' perhaps he'll come out better on the other side of things. After all, he is his own higher power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"Frey will shock you over the first 50 pages - no question. The rest is repetitive; more of the same discusting and wrenching prose.

The book fails because it makes dull such shocking subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Page Turner\\"","review":"A Million Little Pieces was a very inspirational novel about drug addiction and the path to recovery. James Frey is at a pivotal point in his life and is forced to finally make some better choices for himself. James comes to terms with the fact that he's a serious drug addict and alcoholic and decides to make the conscious decision to quit. A Million Little Pieces shows us some of the struggles a recovering addict has to experience, as we watch through James' eyes.Despite all the controversy, I felt that it did nothing to take away from the fact that this book was well written and had a great message. Granted, rather than call it an autobiography or memoir, he should have said, \\"based on true events;\\" but other than that, I though A Million Little Pieces was a great read and definitely worth my time and yours.Sarah Williams"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside an Addicts Head....The Fury-An INSIGHTFUL account of an ADDICT","review":"If you have ever had someone in your life who has been addicted to something or maybe you yourself has an addiction of some sorts, this book will reveal to you what you never hear about. As a girlfriend of a meth addict and going through the whole rehab process for my boyfriend, reading this book helps me to understand the powerful grip of addiction. Way to go James Frey for putting on paper what most people are not able to communicate otherwise.

As a fiction novel it is flat out horrible novel and i can see why it got rejected from 17 publishing companies before it was picked up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"I just don't buy his story, and wish I hadn't bought his book.Frey tosses in details for \\"authenticity,\\" but often they don't click. Half an hour after finding myself on the Crayola web site looking for proof that Razzle Dazzle Rose wasn't in the 64 pack in the early 90s (really, I don't care about crayons, but somehow this detail was my breaking point), I bailed on the book entirely. I can handle a little fiction in my creative nonfiction, but with the narrator going on about integrity and honor so much, I can't swallow half-truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it were an option to give zero stars I would...","review":"I began reading this book before all of the recent hype. The hype began when I was halfway through the book. I have to say that I found the book to be over the top before I found out about the lies. I found Frey's arrogance throughout the book to be a huge turn-off. Had the book been touted as a fiction I might not be as strongly against it, however, I find the lies that have been revealed completely mar the book. On top of everything else, it is the most depressing book I have read in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Million Little Pieces","review":"I have never felt the urge to write a review of a book until I finished this book.I could not put this book down - and even days after finishing it - I am still thinking about what I read and how this man managed to stay alive.I gasped when I read the last page - I have to read My Friend Leonard NowThank you so much James Frey for affecting me like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Before i bought this book i was told that i need to devote my full attention to it. No magazines and no other books that i am reading on the side, just the one book. I made sure i wrapped up everything i was doing, even the morning Metro, before i opened the book. Nothing was missed after the first page. Now after completing it, the only thing i can do is look for someone else to pass the book along to. You find yourself feeling everything and even things you couldn't relate to you understand. The fury, the fight, the family. Something just made this book connect and i only hope that when i pass this book on to the next person, it will do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly honest","review":"James Frey's account of his recovery from alcohol and drug addiction is brilliantly written. He plunges the reader - all senses flaring - into the mind of an addict. The book is intelligent, readable, hard to put down.

Thanks, James, for putting your experience in words."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Is a Fraud and So Is the Author","review":"I found the book to be unbelievable from the first page to the last. Now that it's been shown to be exactly that, I believe the author deserves neither reward or honor from his efforts. He deceived his readers for no better reason than ego. To use his ersatz tough-boy language, it's time to throw this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Reading It When I Discovered It Was Fiction","review":"I began reading the book and its appeal was in how such a traumatic series of events propelled someone downwards only to climb back up - now that this has become largely a work of fiction or faction whatever, its appeal is gone. The dishonesty of the author undermines the premise of the book - an honest account of real struggles.I admire those who truly write honest, real memoirs - now I will consign this book to the literary scrapheap and not even bother finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, is he truly redeemed if he still hasn't stopped lying?","review":"EXAMPLE:The Book Says: He hit a cop with his car, fought with the cops who came to help, and was jailed for 3 months.The Truth Is: Police found him drunk in his car and he was kept several hours at the police station.His Recent Explanation For The Discrepancy: Poor memory!Obviously, a mistake remembering might account for getting wrong the number of cops he fought with. But stretching an overnight jail stay into 90 days is not a memory error, it's a lie.Oprah says she continues to stand behind her choice because the book's message of redemption still resonates with her. But every redemption scheme, every 12-step program I've seen includes a prerequisite of honesty with one's self and with others. To still blame memory at this stage of the expose is something other than truthful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually l do get it","review":"Is this a good work of fiction? Not really. Any resonance with the characters came from their basis in reality. And let the uninformed who defend Frey take note: this is not embellishment.

I didn't get to the mid-section of this book before I put it down. It was unmitigated garbage. I just knew that the stories were not true or at the very least embellished.

Here is what I said:What the book describes is unbelivable. Whether it is true or not, is is a bad book and a chore to read.James is constantly trying to exhibit what a macho guy he is.

They deleted reviews which hadn't pointed to the URL at all.You will notice an organized, concerted effort to redeem the book by reviews that have appeared in the last several hours.

Is novacaine an addicting pain killer? I don't think so. It seems that the whole ordeal was over the top. And, why on earth would a patient in rehab be allowed to walk around in clothes that have spit, blood and vomit on them? If this rehab center is so highly acclaimed, I hardly think that this would have occurred.If Mr. Frey can explain this, I would really appreciate it.So far, the book raises more questions than it answers.

This story by James Fray is just that--a story & one deserving of poetic license to convey the tragedy he was experiencing.

The writing is very tiring, confusing, and not to mention, fabricated and egaggurated.His experiences are way over the top, and I am not even sure if he was that much of an \\"addict\\" to begin with.

I was pulling for James throughout the entire story.Best and most unforgettable book I have or ever will read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY A BOOK PEOPLE DISAGREE ABOUT","review":"Love it or hate it, it is really exciting to see people caring enough about a book to debate it. I LOVED IT. I see the arguements against it but they they weren't enough to keep me from loving the process of reading this author. Yes, he stammered....so do I when I get insane. Yes, his ego is huge (as a writer and probably a person) but that's part of having an addictive personality which added to the truthfulness of the story. I was interested enough in the character to hate him and involved enough to love him too. Either way, I am glad I read it myself and didn't hate it to be controversial or love it to be cool. I really think it is worth the time it takes to read. He is an author that, love or hate, we at least have an opinion about.. . and that has been a long time coming.\`"},{"rating":"1","title":"A million little Lies","review":"See the above title for a hilarious spoof of this previously peddled as fiction but failed to get published as such book.I seriously think the author should be forced to give all of his money to charity since what he has done constitutes fraud.Even his writing style is a rip off. See Hubert Selby's, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" to see where he got his writing style.His lies have been well documented elsewhere so there is no need to review them here. I began to get suspicious when he said that he had to have root canal work done without anesthesia. My sister was/is a junky and she has had extensive dental work done with loads of novocaine.The fallout of all of Mister Frey's lies has lead to no responsibility taking on his part.As one reviewer wrote recently,\\"Lying has now become its own literary genre\\"God bless our current administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing!","review":"Okay, admittedly, \\"nothing\\" may be a bit harsh but it isn't that far off. This book was nowhere near deserving of the hype it has received. After hearing Oprah's staff rave about it, I was expecting to have a life-altering experience. Didn't happen. Interesting? Sure. Well written? For the most part. But worthy of all the accolades it's received? Hardly. This may be my last book club read for a while. And to all those who claimed that this is the most graphic, raw and brutally honest thing they've ever read: try to get out more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people gave this 3 1/2 stars","review":"I can't believe people gave this 3 1/2 stars. The author is a total fraud. He wrote the book passing it off as a true story and lied to Oprah telling her it was true. When the book started selling, people who knew him were quick to point out that he was a total fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, I could give a crap about James Frey...","review":"... as a person. I do not know if he is a fraud, or a liar. What I do know is that this book is one fantastically, scary, riveting read about an intensely personal struggle of the main character, James. I'm a HUGE fan of Marion Keyes' book Rachel's Holiday, which is also about addiction - and though I know there is no Rachel in real life, I found her a heroine and took many valuable lessons from that book. I find myself doing the same with the character James and this book. The book hits with the force of a fist and does not let you look away. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all what it was hyped up to be...","review":"Being yet-another-person who got into the hype that Oprah made around this book, I decided to purchase it, only after a few months when I felt that my excitement for the book would die a bit so that I would have an objective look on the book. I was extremely disappointed. It was in no way a page-turner like it was all hyped up to be, nor it was in any way a well-written even.I get the concept of the book, the fact that the writer was \\"supposedly\\" in rehab for treatment against extreme drug addictions, and for that I was not expecting anything, no eloquence nor coherence even, but still, I was disappointed.Now, with James Frey being exposed as fraud, I have one recommendation for him, \\"If you plan on being a good writer, go read a few books first\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the news media, this is good.","review":"I know what all the news media is saying about the author, but this book was written to help those who really need to see a path out of their predicament.This book was interesting and held my attention.

The arrogance of the author is palpable. He portrays treatment in a awful manner. 12 step programs have saved alot of lives and he would have been thrown out of treatment, not allowed to stay taking up space, with his angry condescending attitude. Will remember his name and make sure I dont bother ever again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Telling lies does matter","review":"I was about half way through this book when I began hearing all of the \\"hoopla\\" surrounding it. At first, I was not all that interested. Then, after watching Oprah, I fully began to understand the gravity of the situation. Like Oprah and millions of other readers, I became really invested in Frey and his tales of addiction. I wanted to read this book and find out what happens...not to some fictionalized character but to James Frey, the person. If I wanted to read a fictionalized account of addiction and rehab., I would have. This was put out as a memoir and thus, should have some semblance of authenticity. It's one thing to change a few minor details to protect people, but it's another rhelm of literature all together to fabricate a story (it's called fiction). I think this is just another fine example of the dumbing down of America. We were duped again.In the end, I thrrew the book away - disguisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret buying this for my girlfriend","review":"I bought this book because my gf loves oprah and usually wants to read the books she comes out with on her book club (if she hasn't already). She found the book \\"ok\\" before the word got out about the authors lies. I read a few chapters while sitting on the can and like many others, did not understand what all the hype was about. The book is not a terrible read, but certainly not the best thing you'll ever read. I stopped reading after I found out that he lied (and in the process, make himself a multi-millionaire), and what seemed like a so-so account of drug addiction was shown to be an egocentric build up of a man who thought too much of himself. Don't support this guy, he doesn't need anymore money."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ ! JAMES FREY IS VERY TRUTHFUL AND SEEMS TO TELL ALL. I THINK IT IS GREAT THAT HE USED WHATEVER WORKED FOR HIM TO TREAT HIS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION EVEN IF IT WASN'T \\"THE TWELVE STEPS\\". WHAT WORKS FOR SOME DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK FOR EVERYBODY ALL OF THE TIME.HE WAS ABLE TO BATTLE HIS DEMONS AND LEARN NEW COPING SKILLS AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE!HE IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ HIS NEXT BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful: I'd give it a zero if I could","review":"I think James Frey needs to take some lessons in how to construct a page. He and some others think he's a brilliant writer with his non-format format. I struggled for a while to read the dense text with no paragraph breaks and no punctuation and finally gave up. It was so unpleasant to read, I simply lost interest. I also didn't buy the part of him getting on that plane in the beginning. No airline would allow anyone in his condition to board a plane. I fly a lot and I've seen people in much better shape than he was denied boarding.How do books like this get published? The redemption from drugs and alcohol is admirable, but he could've done a much better job in telling the story. People who need to read this book the most probably wouldn't be able to concentrate on the horror of its presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I read this book before all the controversy. Had I posted a review it would have been a 5 star. But in light of all the true facts that have come out about this I can't give it any more than one star. If you read this and you think it is a true or almost true memoir,I can forgive a few fudges, you are blown away at what one person could overcome. However to know major portions of the book are fabricated, unsubstantiated and just as made up as a unicorn, it's a lot more to swallow. Mr. Frey has enormous talent. They have a whole fiction side of the bookstore last I checked. This book may not have done as well being fiction but atleast then it would have been honest. I was so excited to read \\"My Friend Leonard\\" to see how this remarkable young man righted himself to were he was today but now I can't even get past the first page knowing it is all lies. Was there even a Leonard? I guess we'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair book","review":"Didn't anyone else get from the very first page that this story was partly fictionalized? Who in their right mind believed that he would've been able to board an airplane in that condition? And his friend \\"Leonard\\" seemed a little too contrived...the hard mobster with the heart of gold...come on!!! Not a great book and not a bad book. I just admire him for getting under Oprah's skin! Not an Oprah fan whatsoever! And he wrote a book and made millions--GOOD FOR HIM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...okay","review":"Man, do I get tired of these books. I get it, drugs are really bad and there is a built in plot of self desctuction and partial redemption.This books, sadly, reads no different.

The author gives us an insight into it that isn't as destructive. This can be a little depressing but reading about the actual character makes this book great.It was one of those books that you can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to read of overcomers, but did not hold interest!","review":"I read this book because Oprah recommended it and she usually has Sixth Sense when it comes to good books!I wish I had ordered Martha Stewart's new book instead.Although Frey is a good writer--even masterful in places--too much of the book was repetitious.One thing he does well is flesh out his characters so they become real, enabling his readers to sympathize with them. I felt the pain of his characters, but the joy of reading about the \\"overcomers\\" was the highlight of the book. And his dialogue seems realistic.While I think this book might benefit some people with addictive personalities--in danger of becoming addicted to alcohol and/or drugs--I could only give it a 4-star. It's not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tip","review":"Frey says that big men in white coats came with siryinges to medicate him when he got out of hand. Yeah, right. That was \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest,\\" not Hazelden. How did anyone think this book was for real?"},{"rating":"1","title":"lowest rating possible","review":"This is a sad, pathetic work of FICTION. I read it with a definite bias against the author from the beginning; it was my book club's monthly selection. I borrowed the copy I read, because I did not want to contribute in any way to the author or publisher. As I read this book, I hid it inside a magazine. I did not want anyone to see me reading this garbage and assume it's worth buying. I expected to glean some small nugget of truth regarding Frey's addiction and experience getting sober, but I was sadly mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embellished memoir! Author admitted this after I ordered the book","review":"I read this book knowing hat parts of it were \\"embellished.\\" I just could not get into this book.

As a result I did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frey's Lies into second book...","review":"It's a work of fiction, was shopped to publishers that way and finally made money as a bogus biography. What parts are true? You'll never know... so reading this as an account of his time in rehab is a complete guessing game as to what is truthful! Even worse, he leads into the continuation of this \\"story\\" in his next book \\"My Friend Leonard\\", with completely false imprisonment! His writing style and descriptions are quite well done... but of fictional events or truthful events??? You'll never find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"James Frey, A Million Little Pieces","review":"When I picked up James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces - I had no idea I would be hit so hard and feel compelled to stay up all night and finish this amazing story of addiction, love and survival.

I learned a lot from James and know that you will as well. Buy it! You will be spellbound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This is an excellent book. I really enjoyed the plot and how James Frey presented it. This is a definite read for those who enjoy a night by the fire.

I got through about 75 pages when I had to stop because I couldn't read without crying.

The prose is amateurish, with lack of editing, run-on sentences, the atrocious grammar,it's a train-wreck. What is all this non-sense? It's quite obvious that some reviewers don't have a clue:1. The publisher knew about the book, and even said that as a fiction it didn't have enough characters, Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Then they decided to pass it on as a memoir, hoping that they wouldn't get caught.2. Fiction or Non- the book is plain rubbish!3. So- now the book is what? Fiction? Please!4. So- now we have Eddie Haskell, telling us he lied!5. Lied, or not, memoir or fiction, his writing career is finished, he has no credibility.6. He'll be remembered as a disgraced author,that lied, not a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frey's fantasy, not reality!","review":"When I was reading the book, I knew it was a lie - it sounded like a man's desires to be what he is really not. If you listened to him, you will know that he is wimpy and a compulsive lier. Actually it was so fake, I read two other books between finishing this one! Anyone could make up bunch of fantasies to help addicts and it is so sad that all he wanted in the end with his publisher was to make millions for themselves and NOT help by any means someone who needed the truth to help him through. If I could return the book, I would because I do not want to contribute to any repulsive lier a penny of my HONEST earned money. Especially now that you all know it's a fake, believe me, it does not impress! Just make up your own lies - it's more fun and cheaper! Definately NOT WORTH THE READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How come I can't vote \\"No Stars.\\"","review":"I don't believe a word of it.Leaving aside the fact that this book is over 400 pages of two-dimensional characters spouting trite dialogue in contrived settings, there are too many factual inconsistencies to find this book credible.Maybe this guy did go to Hazeldon, maybe he didn't. But this book is fiction. That would be fine if it were well-written, but that's the worst of it - even if every single thing reported in these pages actually did happen, it's so badly written that I hope it's not true because it would be an insult to the people involved.I have read a number of memoirs which document battling addiction. This one...I think it's a scam to make money and not in any way an honest document. I want my money back and the 5 hours of my life I spent reading it.

It stunk. If the book had actually been true it would have been good only because it was amazing that all of that could really happen. But since I know it's all fake, I read it as a fantasy and it really stunk. Those defenders who say it doesn't matter whether it is true are speaking nonsense. There are far better and far better written works of ficiton out there that should be read before this second rate act.

Not that well written.Worse, it is intellectually dishonest.Don't buy it. Don't reward those who are dishonest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Writing Sells","review":"This was the worst-written book I have ever read. Run-on sentences, an apparent phobia of commas,a decision by a neophite published writer to not use quotation marks, apprently meaningless random capitalization. And people buy this buy the millions? I am reminded also of the terrible writing style of \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\", by Joe Connelly, and of course the legendary \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" Does anybody edit this stuff? Does anybody at the publisher talk to these \\"writers\\" and explain the basics? Or do the publishers just make a decision that if it looks like it's going to sell, anything goes, they'll publish anything to make a buck. The story of this book's bestseller status is a sad commentary on the state of publishers and so-called writers in America today.Also, anyone who has actually been through rehab and done the program can see the whole thing is made up. What a farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care if it's all true, half true or completely false...","review":"This book is AMAZING. Frey is clearly a talented writer and even if he went through only a fraction of what he writes, he should still be commended.Oprah's recent backtracking on her earlier support of the novel and of Frey is sorely disappointing. Whether or not it is all true, partially true or entirely false, should not change the initial impact she felt when reading it. It was listed as a MEMOIR, not an autobiography. There is a difference for creative license between the two. If any of it is inaccurate, it would hardly be surprising... it is amazing that Frey could remember anything at all! After years of alcohol and substance abuse, he blacked out for long stretches of time nearly every day and going through withdrawl can't be a picnic either.Truly a riveting read and anyone who picks it up can learn something about themselves, the nature of addiction and the process of healing.I can't wait to dive into My Friend Leonard."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the truth but thruth in his story","review":"I waited until finish the book to read the expose on thesmokinggun.com, and to see oprah, and to listen to the gossip. At the start of the book, ever so graphic , on the plane, a hole in his cheer and bleeding, I began to wonder how he could remember this is his 'state' was so altered and injured. I wondered this again during the dental surgery.I thoroughly enjoyed the book but I did know he attended the snot bag Hazelden rehab for frat-boys-turned-drunks. I also know that 99% of rehabs have \\"checks\\" every 15 min, in which each patient must be accounted for since they are liable. Knowing this; I wonder how James could take off with Lilly for such seemingly long amounts of time. I also wondered about the open campus rule.Over all the book was a quick read and I was definately riveted. Upon seeing him read passages on Oprah under the ruse it was real, it kinda turned me off. A book wrapped in scandle with many good point but you must use a questioning eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could he do this to us?","review":"I'm shocked. I was a fan of his literary work. I even supported him when the Smoking Gun first revealed parts of his deceit. I wanted to believe in Leonard. I wanted to believe there was some good people out there who have overcome their addictions to lead meaningful, purposeful lives. I watched his mom as she sat there on Larry King and Oprah, she looked so sincere, caring, and motherly. Meanwhile, she was protecting his lies, covering the truth all for her own greed for the money. Random house should be refunding our money although they refuse to accept responsibility for selling a book of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decadence","review":"This book is such testimonial bout his author; no truth but a pack of lies.A pathetic teenager brat, who turned into a pathetic Criminal adult, who turned into a con artist! No integrity, no personal honor, no character.A man who is so self absorbed and happy with himself that he only cares about himself.This fabricated book is not worth to be called a memoire and the publisher should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion after all of this...","review":"I read this book...before it was even an Oprah pick. I thought it was pretty interesting, kind of drawn out, the writing style though original became extremely tedious and annoying.The one thing so upsetting about the contraversy surrounding his book, is that if you are the kind of person who is inspired by other people's true life journeys, which I am, it is extremely disappointing to find out that the journey was not really as it was portrayed. The trust is lost.I really hope James doesn't decide to write ANOTHER memoir about the experience he has had being caught as a liar. He has no ethical standards, duped us all, and does not deserve to be selling anymore of these books, especially in light of the fact that he is an admitted liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lie","review":"Frey was urged by his agent from novel to non-fiction because he couldn't sell it as a work of fiction. Then it sold. Bam!So basically people are reading a fiction labeled as non-fiction, and this idiotic shadow play passes for okay. And of course Oprah (who's morally fallen flat on her face) has to enable this liar because his book \\"resonated\\" with her, never mind that the book wasn't at all true and therefore the resonance has to be false.How Alice and Wonderland-ish America has become, when fiction must be dressed up as fiction to sell. If only truth had been allowed to prevail this mess would never have occurred.Ah well, welcome to the sinking ship that is modern America. Ancient Rome in its final death throes had nothing on us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge this book by its cover","review":"The book's opening snagged me. From there it all went disappointingly down-hill. For me, there's very little new here. Frey's stream-of-conscious, run-on sentences made the physical act of reading the book very difficult. I found myself tripping up and having to re-read passages. I also had to read this book in small intervals. Frey as the main character is extremely angry, bitter, stubborn and hateful, it's hard to want to spend much time with him or any of the other people in this book. The overwhelming negativity throughout actually forced me to take twice as long to read. I would have stopped reading if I wasn't such a completist. However, kudos to one of the coolest book covers in a long time. It's quite fetching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a powerful book","review":"I don't care what people say about the accuracy of this book. I read it before the fuss, and as a recovering addict, I can say that James Frey has truthfully depicted the struggle of being addicted.I mean, c'mon. When a book opens with a guy on a plane, unaware of how he came to be there, you have to know that you're dealing with an unreliable narrator.James Frey is a Person who Understands.I recommend this book to anyone who struggles with addiction and to their family members and friends. I also recommend this book to writers everywhere, because the style of Mr. Frey's writing is so spare yet powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This was a interesting/good book, not a great book, because of the subject matter, a sad book, an inspiring book. Having never been into the drinking and drug culture, it was heavy, and sad to think about those who have lived this life. I plan on having my 15 year old son read the book to let him see where the use of drugs and alcohol can lead. If this can help even a few people avoid this spiral of life events, I believe James Frey will have done some good by sharing his life story.It was an amazing book, and a sorrowful book, to know of the millions of people living thur this. James has come such a long way, and should be proud of himself, I am proud of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"the effect still lingers","review":"I read this book in September, 2003....after picking it up in the bargain bin for $2.99 at a local bookstore, long before Oprah, long before all the \\"it's a fraud\\" controversy. What has stayed with me more than two years later is the way Frey was able to let the reader into his messed up mind and his broken soul, and how he backed the reader into a dark corner where Frey's anguish has no escape. It doesn't matter how many nights he spent (or didn't spend) in jail, whether his teeth were fixed with or without novacaine, etc..... In fact, those details I've long forgotten and are truly insignificant to the message in this book. I believe those people who rate this book 1 or 2 stars either haven't read the book or were not able to let themselves be drawn into it. Regardless of the controversy surrounding the \\"truth\\", reading this book is still a ride worth taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces of bologna","review":"C'mon - the mobster with a heart of gold? Federal Judge and mobster bonding? Even if you believe the wannabe-tough-guy author can beat addiction through sheer strength of will, you shouldn't be fooled by this fiction.

Oprah is a naive fool, as is anyone that believes this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the humanity!","review":"Frey's affected post stream-of-conscience narration style survives only because the story being told is supposed to be real.

That was before I picked up A Million Little Pieces (no pun intended).I have no words for this novel. The grammar is horrific, my 8 year old nephew has better sentence structure, and I'd be willing to bet that 20% of the book consists of Frey's repetitive phrases (\\"I was sad. I was sad. I was sad,\\" or \\"I cried. I cried. I cried,\\" etc.). It became a chore to get through this book, an experience I've only had once or twice in my lifetime as I can appreciate almost any story in some way. I thank God that I only borrowed this from the library and I didn't actually waste any money on it.

His mockery of the humility and soul searching taught at places like Hazelton doom him to reside in the bardo of dry drunkeness and its consequent misery. It is not the sellers of this misleading book who should reimburse us readers but rather James Frey himself.

Frey knew the hustle and ran a masterful con job that allowed everyone involved to go to the bank. Editor Nan Talese: \\"Oh, please, it's not like he sold weapons of mass destruction.\\" Huh? Does this ludicrous justification make Frey's despicable conductany more palatable? Or Oprah, who got taken hook, line and sinker on dry land: \\"It still resonates with me.\\" But now she's blaming the publisher for poor fact-checking. The lesson to be learned here is that reading for pleasure is a pastime that must compete with myriad other diversions, and when the publishing industry pushes lurid, over-the-top trash as fact, the industry shoots itself in the foot out of pure, naked greed. People do have choices, and reading will not be one of them for those who feel they were conned and scammed by the publishing industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah needs to know she is hurting addicts","review":"Oprah needs to realise that continued support of this man is actually HURTING addicts.

The author has made himself out to be some sort of self appointed hero. It is downright disrespectful. As non-fiction the lies are a slap in the face to anyone who understands or knows the devastation of addiction. Not to mention families who have lost children in senseless automobile accidents.

There's a million little stories like this on every sad street in America but we somehow glorify this self promoter who gets off on telling us how BAD he is. Pathetic, yes. A con man? No Doubt!

The book was shopped around as fiction (to 17 publishers), but no one was interested because it just isn't that compelling to read about a character someone made up who has survived such horrendous obstacles. Now---make that person real and whoa!---you've got a story. I believe Frey was an addict and that he did go thru rehab---that part is proven. However, I also believe that he had a perfectly mundane addiction/rehab experience that he embellished from stealing parts of other people's lives.

Many go into treatment centers with little or no life discipline and order; whether we \\"got\\" it, or were willing to work at \\"getting it\\" the first time or not, hopefully we eventually achieve sobriety by some means, if not a 12 step program, then some kind of constructive plan of sane and peaceful living. I had a problem with the way the book seems to belittle any kind of disciplined treament, the way James' hero worship of the mobster was glorified, and the general repetition.

If you want fantasy read Piers Anthony, but if you want something in a modern day setting that is total fiction then just read this.

This guy who has faced the worst that one can face comes out of the other side as a shining star and model for hardened addicts everywhere.

From someone who knows a thing or two about rehab, it certainly doesn't sound authentic. And the writing the writing the writing...Oh my God! So repetitious and oh so juvenile.

Call it fiction instead of a memoir - it was still the kind of book that kept the reader engaged for all 400+ pages. The characters were developed and interesting, his viewpoint into a rehab clinic was fascinating, and the story was worthwhile. My two cents if that it is pretty impressive for someone to go from such a low point in their life, to penning a novel.

There are many wonderful, compelling autobiographical fiction, from PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT to HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK.[...]Only he knows why. Personally, I don't think his reasons matter. He could have written this as fiction. But he told his publisher that these things happened to him, and his publisher believed him, and Oprah believed him and his readers believed him. He signed a contract with his publisher which warranted that he was acting in good faith and that he was not misrepresenting the truth (this is standard in all publishing contracts).It turns out he was lying.

The guy made the whole thing up! Injecting himself into a real tragedy just for the sympathy is not only dishonest, it is sick!

Emotional breakthroughs come as if a switch has been turned, and within minutes and with no real introspection. And the writing is repetitive, unoriginal, and annoying.

Frey's style in this book uses repetition to emphasize the feeling and emotion of his experiences throughout recovery. Don't read this expecting a good flow of plot and sentence structure.

If he lied about things that can be verified, then what else? To say it's okay to lie to help people is tantamount to saying the ends justifies the means.

I will never read anything he writes again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt cheated and lied to","review":"I began reading this text several months after Oprah had embraced it on her show, and was at first disgusted at the language and then at the graphic description of events that supposedly happened to the author. You need a strong stomach to read parts of this book! Then came the reveal that the author had embellished details of the text. I haven't opened the book since and probably won't again. I can overlook vulgar language in a text of this type, and even some of the disgustingly graphic details, but being lied to I cannot overlook.It should have been the job of the editor to verify the truth of the story being told before promoting and publishing it as non-fiction.Oprah was duped by this author -- and so were we, his readers. That, to me, is far more disgusting than vomit and snot crusted clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Frey needs to understand that \\"Non-Fiction\\" means \\"Real\\"","review":"It has come to light that portions of this book, labeled as a memoir, are untrue and never happened.

I was looking forward to a \\"can't-put-it-down\\" read, as so many had described it, including Oprah, but about four chapters into the book I couldn't bring myself to pick it back up (and this was before I knew about The Smoking Gun article). It was simply too hard for me to believe that a detoxing alcoholic / drug addict could have such vivid recollection of the gruesome details of his first few days in recovery. Addicts looking for something helpful to read would be much better off investing in the Big Book of AA or other AA and NA literature. True recovery involves honesty about one's self and one's history. This is something James Frey clearly hasn't come to yet!Simply put, labeling this book a 'memoir' is like Michael Moore labeling his movies 'documentaries'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big lie wrapped in deception covered in dishonesty","review":"Other reviewers writing that \\"true or false, it doesn't matter\\" are scary moral relativists. Their thinking is as much a product of the Age Of Bush as the Iraq war, the Medicare debacle, the Katrina response, ad nauseam. Black is white, up is down, helping means hurting, and on and on.This book is for the koolaid drinkers too silly to recognize a gutless, soulless lack of integrity when it's slapping them in the face.This is like writing rejected from a freshman creative writing class. James Frey's prose is not innovative, fresh or even clear. His use of literary devices is junior high school-level. If you've got half a brain, you'll see right through the fake \\"tough guy\\" persona. I felt mostly embarrassed for him. It's only saving grace was that it was supposed to be true, not \\"emotionally true.\\" Now that it lacks even truth, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put in Fiction!!!!","review":"Just bought the book because it was suppose to be real and now I have learned it is fiction.

I know that alcoholics and drug addicts are great con artists, but give the reader an inch of credit for being able to see through it all. There's no way, at all, most of the things he's decribing could ever happen in a well respected rehab center. Beat downs? Destroying furniture? It didn't happen. There's no way an airline would let him on a plane in his condition. That ALSO didn't happen. The dental work? Nope. Aside from the obvious fictional aspects, the writing is Annoying. What's with The randomly Capitalized letters? How many times did we really need to hear about the Green of his Eyes? And his Fury? Made me furious to read about.The author is/was a spoiled rich kid who took up drugs to get attention from his family or SOMEONE because even negative attention is attention.

Of course not. Oprah, in her desire for integrity, should rescind the award, the only way she can retain her credibility. And Frey deserves to become a pariah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this book","review":"After seeing Oprah and her staff go on and on about this book. I had to see what the big hype was all about. I bought 3 books, one for myself and 2 as gifts..big mistake. He bucked the whole treatment process so why was he there or allowed to stay? I was hoping to find some secret in recovering from an addiction but was left feeling empty at the end since he recovered by just saying \\"no\\" to his addictions. I wish willpower was that strong in everyone, then there wouldn't be addictions. I am disappointed in Oprah for endosing a book by someone that does not believe in God. I am also disappointed in Oprah for saying it was a page turner and I don't understand why anyone would stay up at night to read it, I had to make myself finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book. A little slow in places, but fascinating to say the least. I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a peek into the mind of an addict."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this book","review":"It's unfortunate that James Frey's debut novel received so much press so long before his book actually hit the shelves. Many people seem to be judging his work-or more accurately, him-based on a few interviews they've read. Why not read the book and decide for yourself? I promise you, it will be well worth your time, which is more than I can say about some of the articles written about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This is a riveting story. I found the memoir to be heartwrenching and inspirational. I don't really care if James Frey exaggerated or changed some of the details. I don't expect a memoir to be 100% accurate, and I would expect any memoir describing addict's personal struggles to have elements changed to protect their identity.I look forward to reading My Friend Leonard, and Mr. Frey's future works.I also applaud his courage for putting up with Oprah's self-serving interrogation"},{"rating":"2","title":"I greatly enjoyed this book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book even with all of the bad publicity. All I have to say is - Who the heck cares if some of it is fudged a bit?? What memoir isn't??? If they weren't they would all bore us to tears!! Good job James Frey on the story-telling of your journey, just be more up front on your credentials next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the addict's mother","review":"I am blown away, on how much i can relate in this book to my own experience.

It's a fast, gut wrenching read. However, one thing keeps nagging at me. In all my years in and around the program, I've never even HEARD of the concept of no local anesthetic (novicaine) during dental work. I'm not disputing that it actually went down that way, but please....the chemistry of it doesn't even make sense. A shot of novicaine is not addictive! And you don't get to take any home with you! This puzzled me so much, that I even went on to Hazelden's site and tried to see what the guidelines were during detox. No luck finding anything. I understand the author, James Frey, will be on Oprah this week. I am anxious to hear his inspiring story first hand and hope they address this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"what an idiot","review":"A note to anyone contemplating this read- don't bother!!Frey is unsympathetic, unlikable. Having traveled a similar road as the author, I fear the uninitiated reader will be left with the impression that Frey's mentality is indicative of ex-abusers in general. I do share Frey's weariness of coerced spirituality. Nevertheless, the reader should be aware that alcoholics and addicts come in all shapes, sizes and worldwiews. In this addicts humble estimation, most of us have outgrown the phony, adolescent bravado which he so boorishly demonstrates throughout the work. This guy sucks !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $2 I paid for my used copy","review":"Knowing the controversy surrounding this book, I bought it anyway thinking that the story might be a good one, even if it had been fabricated. I kept that attitude for about 2/3 of the book. At that point I got tired of listening to Frey, an admitted criminal, additct and all around loser, criticize those around him who had been able to do what he was incapable of--stay sober. His attitude that he was better and more sophisticated than the program he was participating in sounded like the immature rantings of an adolescent. I found it laughable that someone whose life was so obviously out of control had such a sense of superiority. I was also left wondering how he managed to maintain this sense of superiority when it was obvious that the program managed to help him, seemingly against his will. In the end, not worth the $2 I paid for my used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"this made drug addiction dull !!","review":"I couldn't force myself to finish this book. Thank God I only checked it out from the library and didn't actually spend money on it. The mark of a good book is when you can't wait to pick it up. With this one, I would see it waiting for me and turn on the television instead. There really is no more unpleasant alternative that I can think of. I expected good stuff and was bored silly !! How can you make drug addiction boring??"},{"rating":"2","title":"This hit home","review":"[...] As an addict and alcoholic I can tell you it captures what it is truly like to be there. I felt I have lived this story. James Frey has to be praised for such an articulate description of the road from hell to recovery. Diann S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, but captivating","review":"I read the book way before the smoking gun came out with their report. Needless to say, I didn't really believe the majority of what Frey wrote. Now that we know that the majority of it is fiction, i would not recommend this book to anyone who has been in rehab or is dealing with a drug and/or alcohol problem. If you would like a beach bum read, or something to keep you occupied on a rainy day then MAYBE pick it up. Honestly, there are so many other better books out there.... don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over hyped!","review":"I was really expecting much more - it was one of those books that I couldn't wait to finish and started skimming through repetitious pages towards the end. I hated all the characters whether they were addicts or reformed addicts. Sorry, unless you like to read about gross and dispicable low lifes, pick another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best book","review":"I bought this book to read on a flight - and it was one of the longest flight's I've ever taken. The writing style was difficult to get used to, but I finally did. However, his recollections were not very believable, and come to find out - they were all lies. While I appreciate this is a good story (and I emphasize story, because it's all fiction) about addiction, it is dangerous to embrace lies as \\"who cares because it's a good story about addiction.\\" It's as good a story about addiction as Bambi is a National Geographic special on deer - they're both made up and have no correlation to reality, and his story is made up - there's no reality about addiction in it. Therein lies the danger - that people will believe his story is true and act accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Immature and Ego Inflated","review":"Mr. Frey writes a typical and trite addiction/recovery book. Unfortunately his immature view of his own strength and Chinese philosophy may lead some troubled person to try what has worked (so far) for Mr. Frey instead of the methodologies that actually help with addiction recovery. Mr. Frey will probably write some excellent books when he acquires more wisdom and maturity. This book may appeal to Oprah's audience but it does not strike me as an important work."},{"rating":"1","title":"pieces of what?","review":"Since recovery is based on truth, please don't pick up this piece of crap and reccommend Frey's narcissistic rambling to someone with a drug problem. If someone wants to write seriously that takes honesty too, not to mention discipline, attention to detail, and a little humililty. It's a craft, not a freak show. If you buy that he did 10% of what he says he did, or that he is an \\"author,\\" well, I guess that's probably how we ended up in Iraq, and is a plausible reason that good portion of the country believed (and still do) that Saddam Hussein bombed the Twin Towers. Some of our citizenry are just as lazy as Frey is. We all love a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"It was a good book until the media coverage hit.

I could not bring myself to open the book and read another page after a few chapters. How can someone so far into addiction, having memory lapses and blackouts, remember those specific details he claims to have remembered? Especially what he was thinking at a given moment, and specific conversations he had?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we glamorize this?","review":"So because he chose not to use his brain or accept personal responsibility for his behavior - it's everyone's fault but his - we offer im glory in this book?

Boo-hoo....sorry, found it totally unsavory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Though","review":"Even though the author may have embellished his recovery story, his unusual writing style was fresh, honest and illuminating in a new way.Anyone who thinks they understand or knows they don't understand addiction and the toll it takes on everyone involved will gain insight and hopefully compassion from A Million Little Pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"no matter what anyone says...","review":"this is a fabulous book. bottom line, if you want to read an amazingly written book that you cannot put down, then get this book. some details might be exaggerated, but pretend it is a fiction. memoir or fiction...it is still an amazing read. and my friend leonard was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT just an exaggeration. The entire thing is a LIE!!!!","review":"People who have reviewed that the poor guy was given a bad rap because he \\"embellished\\" have not read the facts.James Frey, himself, admits the entire book is a LIE. He made up time spent in re-hab, he made up going to prison, he made up killing an officer, he made up having a drug problem!!! He was a spoiled little rich kid who drank a few beers with his fraternity brothers.It DOES make a difference that this book is a lie. 99% of why this book is inspirational is because the reader assumes it is true! Over and over in the book, he says his life is dedicated to telling the truth. Meanwhile, Frey has admitted all of it was a lie. His message was if he can do it, so can you. But in fact he never did anything! It's as inspirational as Snow White!The man should be imprisoned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the book makes Ophrah cry","review":"I was buying of this book to think it was a real hand on the cover but, I am seeing that Ophrah is crying so much becuase this is not a hand for real on the book.

I feel so deceptered, and weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah can stick it","review":"Listen people: This is a great book. It's well written, and it's affected everyone who has read it. I don't understand the controversy over whether or not it's true. It's a book. When James Frey was on Oprah the first time, he said it was based on his life. It's not supposed to be an autobiography or a news story. Whatever happened to allowing for artistic license? Who are these people going on about how it's not 100% true? This book can still save lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I wish that there was a way to indicate the level of profanity and/or vulgarity in a book before it was purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Somebody should have told James Frey that if you're going to tell a lie you're supposed to keep it simple. As I read this book I kept thinking, \\"this is just TOO much.\\" The sad thing is that people are going to question legitimate and powerful memoirs that ARE true. Unfortunately the controversy will keep the book on the bestseller list even longer as curiosity seekers check out the hoopla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the zero when you need it?","review":"The worst part of this book is that it's written as if it's happening in real time. Were it a journal - something the author contributed to on a day to day basis - it would be more honest. But as it stands it's a memoir of sorts and seems romanticized.James really pitied himself for having to go through recovery. He wanted the reader to feel how perilous his life had become while using. He wanted the reader to care that he stayed clean because if he didn't he would die. He even went so far as to write an obituary, which is more like a resume on his drug career than what would actually be printed.Also, the menial style in which the story was written was abhorrent. Maybe the chronic repetition is symptomatic of a drug abuser but it was quite annoying.Congratulations, James, you are the first author I have quit reading because I don't care to know how your story ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lies are far beyond that which has been reported","review":"I had heard much of the controversy about Frey's making up all sorts of information for this book--lies about prior arrests, jail time, his broken childhood. In reading the book, I found virtually all of his experience in alcohol/drug treatment to be fictional (he, of course, won't release the info from Hazelden). I attended treatment a long time ago, and I can assure folks--this is simply not the way it happens. It's not only fiction, it's implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mIllion little pieces by James Frey","review":"I remember reading this book a long time ago when I was still in high school and doing drugs.

In the beginning I was enjoying the book, and felt horrible for all the details that author was describing that he went through. Half way through the book, I heard that Oprah found out that this was all a lie. I forced myself to continue reading the book. I could not shake the feeling throughout the book that the author was lying about everything. I think that if the book was actually accurate and true, it would be an enjoyable read. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just do not believe it.","review":"While Frey's details of his actual addiction and the struggle within are believable, the story itself hardly is truthful.The treatment center, the characters, and the outrageous plotlines seem purely fictional. The characters, the ending and other plotlines are done too perfectly, and are written exactly as a fictional piece would be written.Was Frey an addict? - yes, probablyIs this an accurate account of his time at rehab? - most likely notThe writer should have either written the truth of his time in rehab or have the book published as fiction loosely based on his struggle with addiction. To tout this book as an autobiographical memoir, seems just wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about LILLY?","review":"As a recovering addict, I knew there would be tragedy at the end of this book. Maybe the James Frey Program worked for James but it didn't work for Lilly and probably won't work for the majority of addicts. What if \\"The Rules\\" and the 12 steps had worked for Lilly? I believe that his helping her to rebel against \\"The Program\\" and \\"The Rules\\" was completely, utterly selfish and irresponsible. The steps that he disdains might have given her tools to deal with her Grandmother's death. I am not impressed with this book at all. I hope James Frey feels some responsibility for Lilly's death.

It's OK but totally predictable and it comes off as phony and made up, which is strange for a book that purports to be so real. Also, this book aside, I think a more interesting tale would be an analysis of why Oprah consistently picks such negative, depressing books. She sees herself as the queen of positive thinking, but she urges readers to wallow around in negative novels. I don't get it.

I even was holding out when Oprah picked it as it isn't available in Australia. BUT a Friend recommended the book to me and I decided to splash out. Even with overseas mail priceing, It was the BEST book I have ever read. (Biography)Easy to read, the subejst is confronting and hard to imagine, that the author is still alive. You read his story wondering 'How did you survive?' We sit in his head as experience his rage and hate and feel his pain. You will not put the book down until the end.

And then he had the audacity to claim that the \\"essential truth\\" was intact. Unbelievable.

But I assumed that, since it was billed as non-fiction, it would be non-fiction, or as close to it as possible. But changing a few hours in prisons to months is inexcusable.The author didn't deserve to get rich off of this, and if he relapses because of the scandal, it's only what he deserves. Assuming that he actually was addicted.The tone of the book-his voice-makes it seem so real. He said \\"I tried to write an honest book.\\" What hokum.He betrayed his readers.

If the book had been listed as fiction I wouldn't have a problem with it. But lies are lies no matter how much color they add to the story.

No matter how you want to put it, the words on the pages of this were heartbreaking, meaningful and powerful to the nth degree. Frey obviously had the talent to tell the story to illicit the most of the reader's emotions. To sum it up, one of the best books I have ever read, true or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEONE PLEASE END THIS LIAR'S CAREER NOW!","review":"This book and it's contents is complete and total lies! Read \\"The Smoking Gun\\" commentary. Everything they investigated and revealed holds true. Get the facts! It's shocking this con artist has been as successful for this long, even fooling Oprah for crying out loud! I hope all of his millions dwindle quickly from lawsuits and forgery, because someone like this does not deserve the right to write BS like this when great writers wait in the wings hoping someone will read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Lies","review":"After 17 failed attempts to get this book published as fiction, James Frey switched gears and found a publisher to print it as a \\"true-story.\\" Unfortunately, the book is still mostly fiction ((...). Worse still, Frey uses his book to preach that AA's 12-Step process is not necessary for recovery -- if this hurts even one alcoholic or addict Frey should be arrested for criminal negligence.This book is a sham, a hoax, and a lie.On the bright side, he did make a fool of Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud","review":"Everything about this book is a lie and it's very dangerous to say to addicts that AA and NA are hogwash and one should just quit and follow the James Frey pathway to sobriety.If it was that easy, no one would be smoking cigarettes Frey, like you do.The topic he addresses is deadly serious.l The advice he gives is by a lying deceitful quack, himself.So, should you believe anything he says to be truthful or helpful?absolutley not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Frey Falls Flat","review":"The Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com) does an investigative story on their website that reveals Frey is a fraud and managed to dup Oprah with his \\"story\\" as well. Turns out most of the situations in his book are either flat out lies or greatly exaggerated. Read the expose on Smoking Gun to find out how he lied about being in jail, etc etc etc.I would advise you to skip this book of fantasy, as it was constructed out of false stories and claims, and misleads its audience into thinking the author is telling the truth. Frey does not deserve a penny for perpetrating fraud on his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL CON JOB ON READERS","review":"If it were possible to rate this book NO stars, I would have done so. All you need to know about this book is that its a complete FAKE that has been exposed by TheSmokingGun.com. They checked police records to verify events described in the book and discovered that Frey made them up. This fooled Oprah and millions of readers, and made the guy wealthy and famous. As TSG states, the publisher must have known this too, since the book was first submitted to them as fiction and was rejected. When re-submitted as NON-fiction, they published it. Don't waste your money on such trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"no great writer, not worth the hype","review":"i picked up this book (at the library, fortunately) to see what all the hype is about. btw, note that had this guy not been backed by oprah, not a word have been said. but i digress. i envy frey his lucrative writing career, but he is by no stretch of the imagination a great writer. it's pretty boring, actually. every day in rehab is the same. he eats, he talks with people, he argues with counselors about how he'll never get better, he berates himself for being a drug addict and criminal, he pines over a girl, he eats lunch and dinner, and then we repeat the cycle.and, pre-oprah hype, how could anyone not see the fake parts of this book? the scene in which he describes Leonard's father dying -- is so fakey and straight out of a Godfather or Goodfellas movie. uck.worth a peek if you're curious, but see if you can borrow your friend's copy. or hit the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Profanity","review":"I purchased this book over nine months ago before all the major controversy surrounding the author of this book. I thought this book was very interesting, but used a lot of profanity throughout the book. It was hard for me to imagine a person actually going through every event in this book. The book was ok for me, but I believe it would definitely touch a lot of lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face honesty and courage","review":"Not a book for the faint at heart. Very open and honest with descriptions that can cause you to wince, due to pain, disgust, and sorrow. James Frey is an extremely courageous and strong person to endure and ultimately claim victory! Addiction is a disease, yet, it is a choice. I completely agree with James. Kudos to you James for defying all of the non-believers and paving a new way to recovery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution of a person","review":"MLP is a glimpse into a person willing to walk us through a transformation in real time. Frey opens himself to tell us that he is a jerk, that he is spoiled, that he has screwed up his life, and more importantly, that he is willing to recognize it is up to him to change. While everyone seems to be looking for some sort of external self help, Frey shows us that ultimately, it is the individual's choice to make change happen. A powerful lesson vividly and honestly told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the man behind the curtain!","review":"Shouldn't this be re-classified into the fiction section?

It was an amazing story, whether or not it's true was irrevelant in my eyes. James Frey is an amazing author. Putting all the \\"drama\\" aside about everything that went on, I really and truly enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I honestly don't understand what all the hoopla is about. This is a garden-variety rehab story. I guess those who are bowled over by it probably don't get out much: tons of people either know someone who went through rehab or experienced rehab themselves. In addition, Frey's self-conscious, repetitive, and pretentious writing style prevents any chance it might have of being considered great literary drama.James Frey is very luck Oprah jumped on his bandwagon. Otherwise, this book would be a prime candidate for the remander bins at one's favorite local or online bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for All","review":"Absolutely gripping. Whether you have used, known someone that has, or simply wish to understand addiction--you must read this book. The brutal honesty with which James tells his story is so overwhelming--you feel every word that is written. It has helped me to understand better the nature of addiction and the road back to recovery. Thank you, James. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Truth","review":"I really can't say enough about this book. Talk about stripping down to the heart and soul of a horrible part of your life. I found this book to be raw, inspiring and a reality check! There is nothing you can't overcome in life and James proves that. His style of writing really pulls you in and flows so naturally until you realize you have reached the last page. Beautiful. I just received My Friend Leonard and can't wait to get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but thats about it.","review":"Ya this book is amusing, or should I say interesting, But honestly I didn\`t believe have the stuff in it, just impossible, I have seen the worst of the worst in addictions, and this just didn\`t sum up.If you want to read a book that is right on with addictions, read Lifes Trial written by Gina Henderson, its about a little girl that had to grow up with a parent on heroin, Its really Shocking, and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is he so angry?","review":"Worth reading so you can talk about the hype surrounding the book but not great literature by any stretch of the imagination.I came away just wanted to know why he is so pissed off at the world ... After all, if he is sober and happy now, why not blend some gratitude into the book, even just as a postscript?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please get over the \\"Biography\\" title of this book..","review":"I've done some investigating on this book and James Frey as an author. When he first started looking for a publisher to publish A Million Little Pieces, we titled it as a non-fiction work, and was turned down for years. He finally put the title of Biography on his book and it immediately was picked up by a publisher.All that aside whether he was right or wrong..the book is very well written. One of the best books I have read in a while. Frey is an amazing sensory writer and really lets the reader imagine the scenarios described. You can't help but feel sad for James at his lows and rejoice with him at his highs.Overall..I would recommend this book to anyone with enough time, and the stomach for some graphic stuff :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"shockingly boring","review":"I understand the desire to shock a reader to keep things interesting however, in this book Frey did not succeed. I first read this book as a senior in high school and was unimpressed. It's an easy read and is moderately interesting, enough to get through at least, but Frey's attempt at being brutal and honest comes off as unrealistic and cold. He as a main character, although fictional, is very hard to identify with let alone like. Overall I really didn't like this book because to be blunt, it sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even though not 100% true, it's still a gripping story.","review":"Even after being called out on how his story had parts that were embellished. I still thought that it was a really gripping story about addiction and becoming a functioning being. Keeping in mind that it was half in his mind, I still would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"True or not, the story works","review":"Is non- fiction ever 100 percent true? No matter. This is a good read. The story moved and kept my interest...that is enough for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MIllion Little Pieces","review":"I cannot give this book a piece of a star. The only reason there is 1 star in the box is because you wouldn't accept my review without the box marked. It is unfair of you not to put a zero in as an option for the stars.It was the poorest written piece of trash I have ever wasted money on. Not just the 'story 'line but the writing style, if you could even call it that.I am telling everyone I know not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"distracted by dishonesty","review":"The messages of the book, including the intensity of the suffering involved, touched me deeply and I found it both provocative and enlightening. The publicity about the dishonesty involved, however, affects my ability to thoroughly recommend this book to others. I would suggest that Frye still suffers from addictions of yet another sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense and fiction","review":"He claims it 's true but Frey made practically the whole thing up and it shows.He casts himself as a tough guy who goes through a rehab adventure without bothering with AA's 12 Step programme.Gives himself a cliched mobster buddy and a pretty ex-whore girlfiend( (both of which conveniently \\"die\\" after the book is finished)Then he claims its all true.Poorly written novel or bogus non-fiction?Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening, Entrancing, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!","review":"This book pulls you in from the first moment you begin. Mr. Frey's descriptive writing allows the reader to feel along with the characters. The style of writing makes you feel as though you are an actual observer on the scene. Nothing has moved me so deeply or touched me so strongly in a long time. I have a whole new understanding of the life of an addict. I have found the ability to empathize and finally have a small level of understanding. Although one of the most successful programs there are, the AA Program's success rate is weak at best. I feel that Mr. Frey has allowed another option, something else that may work for those that AA has failed. This is a must read for EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"James Frey has a writing style all his own, and it works wonderfully in this book. He describes the life of an addict, his tumultuous life on drugs and alchol, and his road to recovery in pages that seem to pass quickly. This book hooked me from the first sentence, and put a new face on the notions of drug addicts. Frey eventually decides to take on his addictions head-on by himself, which may leave others to believe they can overcome their problems without any help. Yet, that aside, this is an excellent book I would suggest you read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GREAT","review":"I HAVE TO BE HONEST THE FIRST FEW PAGES WERE INTERESTING , AFTER THAT IT JUST REPEATED ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN .

NEVER FINISHED , NOT WORTH THE TIME AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"When I read the first page, I was taken aback by his way of writing. It's definitely not conventional, and he would deserve punishment from a grammar teacher. That being said, I think his way of writing contributed to the effectiveness of this book. The fact that he could be so brutally honest, knowing that everyone in the country was going to read his story, is mind-blowing. I've already recommended this book to all of my friends, and despite other reviews that you may read that put this book down, IGNORE them. Buy it. Read it. You may even want to read it twice. It's the kind of book that's so good, you don't want it to end. Honestly, I cried more than a few times. Awesome!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Pieces","review":"I give the author credit for writing his experiences. But after reading half way through the book, I couldn't stand reading anymore about vomiting, etc. I found it depressing even though I am a nurse and know about such things. I'm glad I only paid 50 cents to get it from our library~~~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah is a hypocrite.","review":"I'm sorry I didn't say it first since another reviewer beat me to it. But I couldn't agree more. OPRAH IS A HYPOCRITE. Frey and Oprah deserve each other. Why Frey agreed to another interview with Oprah is beyond me. He already made his money selling those lies so what did he have to gain---UNLESS (God I wish Amazon would let me underscore this) UNLESS Oprah PAID FREY to be on the show as PAYBACK just so she could whoop him and save face from the Larry King fallout. Folks, it's all about ratings. Oprah is a business. She's an industry. She can't stand to see her stock fall. And she's no longer credible. She and Frey have that in common. As I say, they deserve each other.I wish I had the option of giving \\"pieces\\" no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read","review":"I read this book a few months ago long before all this crap started coming out. The thing for me is that this book drew me in and I would only put it down when I had to do something else.

This is a great book. A great story. Great writting. It might not be completely true but it comes from the source of truth and in that way I feel that it speaks the language of truth. It rings true and it inspires. James Frey-- thank you for writting this book, it has opened my mind in good ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoir or otherwise - great book!","review":"James Frey has taken a lot of heat recently over whether or not details in this book are true. Regardless, I think this was a fantastic book. It was interesting, thought provoking, intense, funny at times, and overall very entertaining. I have never suffered from an addition myself, but James' description of what it feels like to be overtaken by one seemed very real.I loved this book!

There are so many people waiting in line to get a shot at being sober and \\"humble\\". He would have been out of the rehab so fast if he carried on the way that he claims!Frey is arrogant and self praising.

At least the prose is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy fiction","review":"It would have been a compelling piece of non-fiction but as everyone knows there isn't much that is true in it. Even Oprah finally figured it out.Before I had completed it - it seemed a bit far-fetched. Mr Frey on the verge of death was able to intimidate mafia bosses and tough guys of all sorts. He was able with his iron will to rescue maidens from crack houses withstanding the temptations.So it wasn't a big suprise to read the online article that discovered that anything that could have been documented such as arrest records, didn't exist or the events were dramatically different from Mr. Frey's recollection.So I'm am unhappy to have added to Mr. Frey's wealth with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all fake!!!!","review":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!

Are you sure this wasn't an episode of \\"Touched By An Angel\\"?The writing style is really annoying. I tried to like it, and attempted to think from his point of view, but the author is so pompous.

The book wouldn't be half the size it is (382 pages) if Mr. Frey didn't repeat himself over and over and over and over and over and over and over, again and again and again and again. The characters are so obviously made up it's pathetic! I admire Mr. Frey for getting clean (if he ever was an addict?) but if your gonna write fiction don't try and pass it off as nonfiction. It's not that I don't believe fact can be stranger than fiction, I've read Augusten Burroughs' Running with Scissors and as odd as his childhood was he can PROVE every bit of it, something Mr. Frey can not do.

But does that really matter?A Million Little Pieces was, in my honest opinion the best book I've ever read. I read it last year before all this madness ensued so I had a clear-cut \\"honest\\" view of the story and not an Oprah/Letterman skewed view of it. This book is intense, riveting, and written in a poetic, artistic, and very visual way.Yes, it is a little upsetting that the story is now fiction, but a story is a story and I can't say that it has change my view on it at all.If no one anticipated embellishment, than people have to start reconsidering literature.

It leads in perfectly to My Friend Leonard and both, no matter how exaggerated or untruthful, are excellent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allegations have no bearing on quality","review":"[...] This book was excellent, though recieves only four stars because of the unecessarily excessive use of the \\"F\\" word. It is a great tale of winning the impossible struggle of man vs. himself. What is important to remember is that memoirs are not classified as non-fiction works for one very good reason: no one remembers every word or detail exactly as it was. This was a fantastic, inspiring memoir, and can be enjoyed by any adult reader (I would not recommend this to anyone who is offended by the content generally found in R rated movies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uniquely Bad","review":"The book \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is definitely unique, but that does not make it a great book; nor even a good read.The irrational use of grammar and punctuation signaled to me on the first page that the author was hiding something and fifty pages in, my suspicious were confirmed.From the characters, not real people that he writes about; to the anger that he has yet to come to grips with; it all seems that he still really misses drinking and doesn't want to admit it.An author can be one-sided as Mr. Frey is; the only thing that I got by trying to read this book is that (as Mr. Frey would say):There is only one Way to live. Everyone else is wrong. They are wrong. I am right. I talked to someone and they told me how to live. I said no that you are wrong.That is totally acceptable, but being angry at not being able to control yourself is something that he has to deal with, not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million Little Lies","review":"When i first started reading this book i liked it, but thought to myself \\"it is a bit far fetched\\". That was before I realized that it was supposed to be non-fiction. As a fictional story, this book would be entertaining. As a supposed true to life recounting of events, it is full of obvious lies. I almost can't see how anyone would believe that some of these events could happen. I have worked for the airlines for years, and let me say, without a question there is no way that any airline would ever allow a bleeding, unconscious, under the influence of drugs and alcohol passenger on board. No way. Nor do I believe that any doctor would send someone off in that condition, without first attending to their open wounds. Why wouldn't he have been hospitalized where he was? It doesnt make any sense. If Frey wanted to pass this off as truth he should have toned it down a bit. As it is now, it is an entertaining story, but almost insulting in its bending of the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to those who died!","review":"My agent sent me this book when it first came out. I read 20 pages and put it down in disgust. Frey's story is a disgrace to those addicts who've died fighting the battle. As a recovering heroin addict, 19 years, I lost 15 of my friends to the battle and James Frey's lies-- shame every single one of them. Even his recent letter is just more spin. If he truly cared about those poor souls who are struggling to free themselves of addiction-he'd immediately remove the book from print or demand the publisher call it fiction. I tell you why he will not-money! In 1996, I won the du-Pont Columbia for excellence in broadcast journalism for a HBO documentary called, \\"High on Crack Street: Lost lives in Lowell.

I've gotten serious skin infections after using the Mangroomer because it cuts the skin so readily.I don't know why they couldn't have used a more sophisticated and better-designed razor, the one that's there is extremely cheap and does a better job cutting skin than it does cutting hair.I wish Norelco would make a device like this, using the razor mechanism in their BodyGroom, that would be a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality despite good design","review":"With design similar to what one would expect from the Sharper Image, I was surpised when I opened the package to find a product of such low quality I had to ponder whether I should have purchased it at a \\"one dollar\\" store.

However, this thing is one of the most cheaply constructed, flimsy products I have ever used. The plastic is incredibly cheap and brittle and would not likely survive a 2-3 foot drop onto anything other than padded carpet. After about the 3rd or 4th time using mine, the adjuster button for the extension arm snapped off inside from simply pressing it in, so now it will no longer lock in position at the various extension intervals. Also the thing would not power on after only a few uses unless I banged on it repeatedly (I made sure good batteries were in it first). All-in all, like I said the shaver does a decent job without biting the skin but the price is outrageous for the poor quality of materials, construction and sheer lack of engineering. If I had to guess, one of these probably costs around $1.50 to make. I am currently looking for a better-made alternative to this product and I suggest others do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply-Made Product!","review":"I'm pretty bummed about buying this product, seeing how badly it works, and not being able to return it!!! The arm isn't stable in its' extended position, and almost ends up collapsing completely while it's in use. It feels cheap to the touch, and there is nothing that covers the blade to keep it from getting dull and dinged between uses. I have never had problems with Amazon before, but will make sure I check the return policy before buying something like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helps reach difficult areas, but that's about it really.","review":"This item is not very well made, does not always work to specification (especially the part that bends, which refuses to stay in the position you want it most of the time), does not cut hair very well, and it just feels cheap and flimsy. Oh, and it eats up batteries in minutes. Really not what I expected.I am lucky to be able to reach practically any part of my back with a normal, small shaver. I can understand that this item will be invaluable to anyone who cannot do that, but other than that practical point, this is really very subpar compared to any other trimmer and/or shaver. It really should have a much lower average score."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst thing I'v ever bought on Amazon.com","review":"well I used to use one of these (chargeable one) it was great I loved but somehow I lost it, so I ordered this one I thought its what I used to use it turns out it need's Batteries (not included) and you need to change them every 5 mins then the handle was lose so its hard to control( and its nonreturnable so I threw it away....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't shave close, is flimsy and poorly designed, and overpriced.","review":"It just plain doesn't work. It leaves stubble, not a smooth back. Plus it's flimsy so it doesn't stay in position, and is awkwardly designed. It seems like a good product, but it doesn't work right. The company does a good job of getting fake purchasers to spread buzz and positive reviews -- but it's just hype and clever marketing. It *might* work for a few people with a very certain hair type, very flat backs, or something...but I've tried it a few times and am very disappointed with this shaver. Don't buy it.My recommended alternative is Veet for Sensitive Skin if you want to go smooth, or just an adjustable-length beard or hair clipper to trim. Or you know...a girlfriend who's seen your hairy back but loves you anyway. Unfortunately they don't sell those on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality - not rechargeable!","review":"The plastic and construction quality of Mangroomer is poor. The packaging gives the feeling there should be an adapter for recharging the unit under the left side pocket but the system works on two AA batteries (not included).From design stand point, it is a nice concept but if you don't want to use this for shaving back there is no way to detach the extended handle or to open it all the way to be aligned with the body of the groomer.I won't expect the unit to last long. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap crap crap!!!!","review":"pulls hairs out instead of cutting!!! used it once and it hurt to use it....good idea but need to improve on it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man Eater","review":"What is really remarkable about this product is that while it's fully capable of shredding your flesh, it has a hard time cutting human hair. It's really quite a feat. I assumed that this thing would be like my small personal groomer, just on an extended handle. It's not. It seems there is too much of a gap between the cutting blades to do much. The teeth seem too tall as well, which is why it can grab so much skin, without cutting any hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful and flimsy-not at all worth it","review":"Waxing is pricey and painful and asking someone else to help shave your back is embarrassing so a product such as this one seems logical. I wasn't expecting miracles, but I wasn't expecting this to really hurt either.Firstly, this thing is so flimsy. It's made of light plastic and is hard to extend fully. If you drop it once it'll likely break in half. That aside, it scratched up my skin leaving big, pink sore patches. If I persisted it may have caused bleeding. It feels horrible and the injuries are still visible over a week later. All that and it barely works - it didn't evenly or fully remove the hair.Don't waste you time or cash on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldnt buy again","review":"This product does do the job but not very effectively. it does pull hair if it has any length so don't wait too long between uses.it is very cheaply built,the handle cracked the first time I used it so it is now taped.is fairly easy to use but for the money I think it was over priced....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is designed to do","review":"Not much else to say.

Ouch, not really that bad but not worth it to me. It's a great idea but maybe the blade is not sharp enough, not really sure but the discomfort is not worth it. I gave up after a few seconds of pain, I guess it grabs your hairs and skin a little.My Remington trimmer does a far better job, I can shave my back w/my trimmer but takes a lot of skill and patience, I'd rather have that than the dealing w/the discomfort of this mangroomer thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"Well, I paid about $40 for this shaver and it looks, feels, and performs like it should cost about $7.50.

This product sort of threw me for a loop because of all the good reviews it got.Right out of the box it felt very flimsy. Then I was surprised that it ran on two AA batteries which will not stay in place unless you put the battery cap on, and even the battery cap had to be pushed into place a few times before it barely clicked shut. When I finaly went to use it, It lasted less then 30 seconds and the blades locked onto eachother I took the blades apart, freed them up a few times , samething happens.When I went to return it I found out that it's an item that can't be returned, I guess that means I'm out the $24.97. I would think that they would tell you that it can't be returned before you buy something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I just bought this at Target today.

I took literally ten pressured swipes and it was like my back never even saw a trimmer. the only tell tale sign was the huge red welts a nd slices that appeared on my back.

It takes the hair off that it makes contact with pretty easily so keep it away from any hair you don't want removed, it will slice through it like butter.My only complaints are that the head is angled at 90 degrees while the arm only opens to about 135 degrees. It is a little awkward when you are trying to get hairs around your lower back. The head could also be a little wider. For the shaver to work effectively you need to have the entire head level on your back. Being so narrow and trying to shave with your arm behind you tends to make the head tilt. A wider head or a head that can pivot and stay on your back would be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you","review":"This is a great product that should be in the hygine aisle of every big box store.

It is also difficult to use this at the correct angle but when you do finally get it at the right angle it works fine on shorter hair.

I was very excited to put it to use when it was delivered. However, upon using it I was completely disappointed. The blades are much too wide and after following all the instructions to a \\"T\\" ended up with a bloodied, nicked and very irritated back. My advice to anyone considering purchasing the Mangroomer is to have your back waxed by a professional. If the product manufacturer replaced the blade with a foil one such as the Philips-Norelco Bodygroomer than I feel the item would work much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Design - Flimsy Construction","review":"In fairness, I have to start off by saying that I had this product for over a year and used it successfully 15-20 times. The longer I had it, the more frequently it consumed batteries. After sitting in the drawer for a few weeks, it wouldn't start when I'd turn it on. I regularly cleaned the cutters with a brush and lubed them with Tri-flow, but that didn't seem to help. Sometimes, I could get it going by push-starting the blade with a pencil or something, but mostly it wanted fresh batteries to get going.Finally, even fresh batteries couldn't get it going, so I took it apart to see what I could see. The drive motor has a plastic cam that connects to a plastic arm that moves the blade back and forth. The motor is *tiny*. I'm thinking 3/4\\" diameter and 1-1/4\\" long. It was fried, so I threw the whole thing away.Would I buy it again? Yes if it was $20. Not at $40! Come on, it is a light-duty, battery powered trimmer on a long plastic handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH","review":"This thing snapped at my skin like it was mad at me.

It does it's job of removing unwanted hair, but it also takes a lot of skin with it. Your back may look like it's had an encounter with a clawed creature, as mine did.The problem lies in the head design. It is bare metal against bare metal, like most shavers, but there is nothing preventing it from grabbing, or rubbing your skin right off your back. Since the moving blade is flush with the \\"guard\\", it just chews you right up.I cannot give this product a recommendation until the head design improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if....","review":"....you want to look like you were attacked by an angry feral cat! i found this extremely awkward to use and very uncomfortable. feels cheaply, made razor is not effective. after using this i came up with the mantra EMBRACE THE PELT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"Do not buy this product.

I go back and forth trying different angles and bupkis. Don't get me wrong, I'm no sasquach but I've got more hair than just fuzz. I was greatly dissappointed by this product.

It removed the hair and the handle was helpful.But on about my 4th time using it (after a long time just sitting there) it powered on for half a second and then died. Inserted new batteries and it didn't even turn on. Tested the batteries...they're fine. Removed batteries, reinserted a few times...same thing.

This trimmer makes it easy to get to those hard to reach places. It cuts pretty close for an electric trimmer, though it can rub your skin a bit if you trim at the wrong angle. It is an awfully light trimmer so I worry about it's long term durability. However, when you figure you spend $15 on a bottle of Nair you can use twice, you only need to use this thing a half dozen times to come out ahead. Plus no more chemical burns or funny smelling skin. All and all, it seems to be well worth the $40"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"This is probably the most cost effective, and lest painful way to get rid of back hair. Another plus is that you can do it by yourself, so you don't have to show anyone else your embarrassing hair. Just buy a small hand mirror from the dollar store, and use a bigger mirror, and you can have the hair off in a few minutes. It did scratch me a little but it went away after a day, and was still much less painful than using a depilatory cream (which burned really bad).

Both have been discontinued by F.P., which is no surprise to me. I was so impressed with the Fisher-Price Little People \\"Birthday Party Fun\\" CD (we absolutely LOVE it!) that I wanted to get some more Little People CD's for my daughter. We basically dislike all the songs on both of these two CD's. Many are completely different from the versions you are used to. While we were listening to this CD, my 13-year old said \\"Mom, this CD is depressing.\\" I really wish I hadn't wasted my money. Maybe I can sell them on Ebay....I also have \\"Baby Boogie\\", and at least it has upbeat songs, but no words, and the tunes are different than you'd expect. If you want a really wonderful, upbeat, energizing CD for your toddler / young child, hold out for the \\"Birthday Party Fun\\" CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"As always, the artistic value is great, but what happened to the story? Although I did not find The Gryphon & Alexandria as compelling as the original trilogy, it still had a decent story line to follow.I have to say that I was deeply disappointed with how the story concluded. There was no real closure, and it seemed that the ending was rushed and not really well planned out. I basically felt like this book was strictly to showcase the art rather than the text content. Such a sad thing.It had the making of being something so classical and great, but fell flat on its face. I would recommend that readers stick with the original Griffin & Sabine trilogy and stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Beautiful artwork, but after six volumes, readers of this series will find themselves sorely disappointed. What is the mysterious connection between Griffin and Sabine, Matthew and Isabella? What is the significance of the artifact in the desert? What did Matthew mean in the last book when he said, \\"They are coming--both of them\\"? Where, precisely are Griffin and Sabine trapped? What, exactly, is Minnaloushe? What is Frolatti's stake in all this? What is this store of knowledge he is trying to keep hidden? Did Matthew and Isabella's union open it? Well then, what was it? Sorry, Mt. Bantock, but a one-liner about science and art merging, or something to that effect (I'm badly misquoting), simply will not do. There was room in this story for some questions to be left unanswered, to allow the reader to ponder, but not every question. I have a genius IQ, but I didn't get it, and, judging by these reviews, neither did anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, the artwork is still beautiful. I guess.","review":"I dislike being a conformist but I have to go with the crowd here when I say \\"Huh?\\" I loved the Griffin & Sabine series but the Matthew/Isabella reprisal just left me confused and mostly dissatisfied. To give Nick Bantock credit though, the Griffin & Sabine series was more creative than anything I will ever achieve in my life, so I'll give him snaps for that and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"And The Point Was.......?","review":"When a sincere Bantock admirer, a faithful purchaser of his books, AND a fairly bright woman can't \\"get\\" it, well, something is amiss. The impact of his art remains fresh with all its texture, depth and excitement, but...ummm....what was the point? Maybe I'm overthinking the work in trying to link it to Yeat's great beast slouching toward Bethlehem, or Nostradamus' quatrains, or...for goodness sake, just the simple nod towards male/female union. But Yikes! It took six books (and years & years) to tell the tale, and I honestly don't know what the tale was. A body of work this wonderful ought not be leaving the reader feeling empty or stupid. My two-star ranking was a compromise: five stars for the art and minus three for the story. Sorry, Nick."},{"rating":"1","title":"will somebody please explain this to me?","review":"Okay- I was prepared to have to reflect, inspect, deduce, even hypothesize, but I thought Morning Star would answer at least a few of the major questions. Are the characters all the same person? What about the handwriting? Griffin and Sabine's are suddenly the same- and doesn't Isabelle's flowery scroll strangely resemble Frulotti's? I feel like I want to cheat and buy the answer booklet. Can somebody explain the ending to me? Six books later- simply frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully trite","review":"Usually, I find Nick Bantock's books enchanting and full of visual and literary surprises. Unfortunately, _The Morning Star_ cannot be counted as one of these delights. The only thing that keeps it from being a complete waste of time is all the captivating collage and mail art. The story itself wraps up the series in a very expected, ordinary manner that's not worthy of all the luscious art. Bantock has told us this story before and he's told it much better (when he gave us _The Venetian's Wife_). You won't have the sense of satisfaction that you read the final chapter of a wonderful series, you'll just feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it might have been","review":"I love Dick Francis and wanted to love Lyndon, but I gave up trying. I like the style it is written in and the basic Francis-esque scene it paints, but I was waiting and waiting and waiting some more to 'feel' something for the characters. The story was going along fine I guess, but I just felt no empathy for anyone. After 20 pages of Dick Francis I am often feeling the pain and the joy of his main character and I guess this makes it sound like I was expecting a Francis masterpiece, and this was the real cause for the let down, but I honestly think that the two dimensional characters were the back breaker for me.I will try another Lyndon Stacey, but I don't reckon I will make number three unless number two does something for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine with accurate readings","review":"This is a great machine and gives very accurate readings.

The $5.00 cost to send it in for recalibrating is no help from Afirca, and the poor baseline calibration took all the joy our of giving my patient a self empowering gift, as well as all the value.

The love/hate relationship Sister Betrille has with Carlos Ramirez (Alejandro Rey) as she tries to find new ways to make him help the convent is hilarious. Is it that the show is nostalgic that makes me like this show so much? Perhaps...it reminds me of a time when the world was not quite so hectic, and yes...even a lil more innocent!

This book is one long misguided, opinionated rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither balanced nor reasoned","review":"The value of this book lies in its thorough portrayal of the views of an antihumanist. Beyond this, the book is little more than a long, monotonous harangue. The social, economic, and environmental evils addressed have little or nothing to do with either secular or liberal humanism. The direct criticisms of humanism are pale imitations of older, more scholarly works, for example \\"The Dialectic of Enlightenment\\" by Horkheimer and Adorno."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Arrogance of Humanism","review":"The book I received was defective.

The recipes are a totally worth the effort and easily adaptable to what you actually have in your kitchen. Mr. Goldstein is a little timid in his use of herbs and none of the sauces that are just supposed to magically thicken through \\"reduction\\" actually do.

After providing a thorough introduction to wine and food combinations, Sid Goldstein discusses the characteristics of each varietal in detail. Dedicating a chapter to each of some 14 wine types, he lists the different aromas and flavors typical of that wine, suggests foods and ingredients that will best complement it, indicates the regions that produce the best examples, and discusses the different styles found. I particularly appreciate that he concentrates on wine varietals, rather than vineyards or years, as many other wine books do. He then continues with a number of mouth-watering dishes ranging from appetizers to desserts suited for the wine. I have made many of these dishes and served them alongside the wines he suggests, and each has earned rave reviews. This book is sure to please anyone who loves good wine as much as they do great food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoy this CD","review":"WE are beginners with meditation and we are able to calm ourselves down and relax with this CD.

You can make very basic gear configurations, that move, on the boards that are provided.

The simple stuff is easy to make using small gears lying flat. We tinkered together for a while to make some of the complex systems displayed on the box, but frankly, they are impossible to make. I believe another reviewer for a version of this toy said that it would require adults using superglue to hold pieces together to make the cool stuff. I agree. The pieces do not fit together in a predictable or stable way to allow gears to turn as you build a tower (well all but the simplest tower with the small gears). I'd build a tower only to have it not work, or have it fall apart because the gears would only mesh if the pieces were not firmly fit together. The brief instructions don't help. The instructions crucially lack drawings of sample set ups.

It is billed as a \\"balanced\\" review of evolution versus intelligent design concepts; in reality it is biased and full of incomplete half-baked partially scientific data. I was hoping to find some credibility in the creationist perspecitve, but after reading this book I'm not sure I can. One of the most annoying things about the book is the thinly veiled message that scientists who believe in evolution must be athiests, whereas scientists of \\"faith\\" must continue to look for new data to support the creationist perspective. Almost equally annoying is the fact that (apparently) the only world religion that has a creation story worth using to bias otherwise scientific data is that of the Judeo/Christion tradition.

Not only does the translator (anonymous) use archaic language to render in English a book that was written in modern French, but he misuses it. While one could make a case for using 'thou' when Voltaire used the informal 'tu', this translator uses it seemingly at random.

He shows nothing while telling everything. A good read for the literarily weak or inexperienced. A few hours worth of yawning for everyone else. There are novels far more deserving of the \\"Classic\\" title, if one has the guts to take an honest look and form his own opinion. But let the lemmings have their fun. Those with minds know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Philosophical Adventure","review":"I actually read this book thanks to a recommendation from Kurt Vonnegut (via \\"For the Love of Books\\"). Candide was almost like Siddartha meets Shangri La. During Candide's worldwide adventure seeking his one true love, he is regaled by the disturbing tales of many world-weary travelers and troubled by his own unfortunate circumstances. Thus, Candide's original philosophical views are challenged. When the adventures end and the characters are reunited in a sort of melancholy, the most simple outlook on life allows them to be the most content. Voltaire packs a punch in under 100 pages with a fast-paced satire-laden adventure that maintains its relevance 250 years after it was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optimism","review":"Everyone in the world should keep this book on their nightstand as a reference note on patience and faith that seasons do change and our factors of control most be loosened some to gain true happiness and that this idea has no known options.

The band had yet to add the pop and dub influences that pervade much of the last two records and some of the songs are downright unlistenable. Although the East Indian influence is detectable, Cornershop was, by and large, a rough, lo-fi indie band at the time.

This illness eventually kills her. As she is dying, Curl draws snowfish on the side of the bus that they are living in. These fish symbolize the difficulties they faced in their everyday life. Custis and Boobie are very different from each other. Custis sees the beauty in life, and Boobie likes to burn things.

Obviously Atreyu is not known for having \\"long\\" albums, but 9 tracks that are all pretty short is way worse than other two albums. They did stay true to thier sound and I suppose that some people who are just now starting to listen to them will like it, but the songs just aren't as well done as the songs on the Curse or Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses.

I love the rapport between characters. Clarke Gable is wonderful as the faithful (but almost not) husband of Myrna Loy. I was quite surprised at the nice acting performance turned out by Jean Harlow. Too bad she did not live to make more films. James Stewart is sparkling, as usual, in his small part in this film. Though labeled a comedy--there are some serious lessons here relating to ill-timed words of suspicion on the part of the mother of the Clarke Gable character. This creates havoc which is not always funny, but definately interesting. The quality of this DVD is excellent. The sound is good and the picture nice and clear.

Saints don't make for interesting lives anyway. But most of O'Brien's attacks are not substantiated; they're of the \\"this is the opinion I formed the other day while shaving\\" variety.

Instead of just giving a personal interpretation, O'Brien relies heavily on primary sources, letting the reader read what the particular person had to say instead of summarizing (or as some authors do, reinterpreting). This book is essential to understanding either Jefferson or the French Revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible field guide.","review":"This is one of the worst field guides I have ever seen.

For me the neoprene sleeves feel too delicate, easy to tear and too thin as a padding material. The sumo exterior seems to be made of a nice denier nylon seen on soft luggage and the interior made of a thick cloth similar to corduroy with about 1/4\\" of padding sandwiched between the two. I can barely squeeze in my 15\\" macbook pro but it fits albeit snugly (it's probable, given the materials used, that the sleeve will stretch a little over time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumo laptop cover","review":"This is a well-made product, and great protection for a laptop! It was not as compact as i might have hoped, but i realize that the extra padding is meant to keep the computer from being damaged. The color is great, the bag itself is attractive and nice. Overall, a good buy as long as you don't mind a cover without a carryiing handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Play turned into Worse Movie","review":"This movie started out as a play, which is rather obvious, given that it entirely takes place in one location/set: a bar where the stand-ins hang out. This movie is truly terrible. It just doesn't hold your attention and barely makes sense. I love period pieces, old Hollywood glamor, and I have actually worked as a Stand-in. None of that could save this truly abysmal piece. All of the characters are ridiculous and uninteresting. The small slivers of historical fact only serve to make you wish the story focused on any of them, rather than these ridiculous women. What's with the distracting, inaccurate, and stupid accents anyway? Save your time and money and rent something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks","review":"I had this machine for 2 years. For the first year it worked terrifically, having accuracy even the doctors were amazed at. Shortly after having it for one year, the machine broke down. Sent it to Lumiscope for repair but since it was a few months out of warranty had to pay for the repair. Think it was $20. The machine worked for a few months thereafter and then again broke. Sent it a second time to Lumiscope; again a repair charge. About 6 months later, it finally gave out and I threw it out. So the machine which cost me originally $79 plus some $40 for repair, actually cost almost $120 for less than two years of usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting overview of fossil fishes, made more than 100 years ago","review":"interesting overview of fossil fishes, made 100 years ago.

Having said that, this is a very solid work. The best cuts are If You Be Wise, Why Do People Lie, I've Got the Melody (a duet with Patti Austin), and You Don't Know Me. Loggins' rendition of I Believe in Love rivals the version of this song done by Barbra Streisand on A Star is Born.This is a great CD for just letting your mind drift & be carried away by the music and melody...or to indulge in a romantic evening with the person of your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this the only Kenny Loggins CD you have,keep it!","review":"This is Mr. Loggins first attempt at a solo career after departinghis stint with Loggins & Messina.This Cd is fresh,with an abundanceof muscial colors that would make you want to listen to the wholething from start to finish. This is the CD where Kenny was himselfand did not have to \\"change\\" to fit that musical industry standard.Each song is well put together. His ballads strike the heart, hisfaster tunes are an expression of himself that no one can expressbut him. He really tries to create this same type of feeling with hissecond CD \\"Night Watch\\", but does not even come close to this one. (Even with the duet with Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks) Yes the reviewers before be said it very well. A Suberb CD. Like I stated, if this is the only one you are getting,this is all you need.

However, I went and got the Panasonic single disk HDMI player (S52?) and all is well (except no 6 disc changer). Onkyo tech support was not much help either (They basically told me to return it). Save yourself the return shipping costs and buy the Panasonic player."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best dvd changers","review":"I purchased this item about a month ago because I wanted a 720p upconvert 6-disc changer. This dvd player looks great and comes with a good remote for a dvd player. It is easy to maneuver through the menus as well. In terms of picture, there is not any noise or strange artifacts. Overall it looks great on my Pioneer plasma. The changer is a tad slow to load, but convienetly resumes play at the same location even if you've had the player off for a day or two. I do not however, have anything to compare this player to. I may look into the Denon 1930ci just to get an idea of how it performs by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great convenience... when it worked. Infuriating inconvenience now","review":"Had planned to build an Onkyo branded complete A/V system around this changer. Those plans, and the money Onkyo might have gotten from me, are now in question. The same errors that the other 1 star posters have had are exactly what I've experienced. Bad Disk, skipping, not recognizing a disk is present, freezing, etc. Additionally, like the other posters, this started randomly and infrequently and has progressively gotten worse. It's now a paper weight and with the price of electronics I'm debating on getting it fixed (likely more than a new player). Onkyo should be contacting it's customers and replacing these defective players. Don't be fooled by a positive review. They may have just received their changer. It will get worse for them in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD/DVD player is a piece of junk","review":"1) I bought this Onkyo DVCP704 18 months ago, and it is already broken.

They gave me the name of the east coast service center in NY, and I have to pay to mail it in.4) When I call the 800 number to talk to the service center, noone answers, no voice mail, no operator. It's not exactly professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"ONKYO did a poor job on this one. Their receivers are excellent but this dvd player is just not worth the money. The picture via HDMI is excellent just as you would expect. I think most HDMI DVD player have quality picture nowadays so this should not be a selling point anymore. Also it looks pretty good.The show stopper for me is that the disc changer is just way-way too slow. For a cheaper brand, I can get pretty much the same picture quality and much faster disc changer.Save you shipping money on this one, because you are most likely not going to like it and ended up returning it. That's what happened to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate my DV-CP704","review":"I have had mine for about two years and at first it was okay. Then it started rejecting DVDs, saying that they were bad discs, but those same discs played just fine in my cheaper Sanyo player. At first it was only about 1 in 10 DVDs that were rejected but now it is more than half that it refuses to play. Even brand new, straight out of the box DVDs frequently are rejected.I can't get through on their help line to ask anyone if there is a fix for this problem. I did notice that there are other Onkyo technicians on the internet that will help but they wanted me to pay 45 bucks for their help. I said, 'no thanks'. It makes me wonder how dependable Onkyo products are if other companies can make a living by fixing them.I'm taking mine to the pawn shop and swapping it for a Sanyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this DVD player from Amazon in 2007 as a backup to a 2 year old Oppo upconverting model.

It did have a likeable main character, and a likeable secondary character (the \\"Gawgon\\".)But these qualities were not enough to redeem this book. The eccentric relatives were apparently added for comedic effect or possibly to lengthen a rather short book. But they were just WEIRD to us and left us wondering why they were even mentioned... to torment us? Yuck. We'd rather have more interaction between the main characters.For some reason, few paragraphs were more than a sentence or two long.

My internist at the time, an old guy, was fascinated by it. I'm surprised that so many people had problems with its accuracy.

This book takes the very basics of java and the very basics of XML - but if you hope to do anything further than write \\"Hello, World\\" to an XML file and then read \\"Hello, World\\" back into an object - this book is definately not for you.

His dad also tries to teach him to drive the car!!!!This books message is that nobody is perfect in this world, and that if you find someone who you think you shoudn't be associated with it is best to just back away. I know this is the message because in the story Joey's dad is someone who he thinks he shoudn't be associated with and he just decides to leave his dad.I like this book because it is a great impression of realistic fiction and looks into the life of a disabled kid, wonderfully connecting the two into a truly delightful read.

Joey wants to believe, and to trust his dad, but what happens when father doesn't always know best?This sequel focuses more on Joey's relationship with his family. He struggles to walk the line between wanting to please his father, but also do what is right for him. Though not as arresting as the previous book, we still get to see the world through Joey's eyes and a bit heartbreaking for the reader to watch him lose his hard won self control.

It was a page-turner and it was easy for me to concentrate on the book, because after I read that Joey left Pablo, his Chihuahua, in the glove box of his mom's car, I thought that it would be pretty funny. I didn't connect with any character or event in this book because I usually never do anything in my life.

Joey has a problem with being hyper, and Joey's dad flushes his medicated patches down the toilet, while he tells Joey he needs to become a \\"real man\\". This definatly does not help Joey. At least Joey is smart enough to know that he has to call his mom to pick him up, SOON, before something worse happens!I think this book is very good.

I agree with the readers who say this book is very slow paced. We get it right away that every adult in Joey's life is very, very flawed. We have that illustrated for us again and again. What, if anything, is the moral of this story? That you are better off drugged with a slightly less loser parent than not drugged with the really loser parent?

Joey has many problems with his hyperness and must go to special ed. This story is filled with excitement and fun. Joey is unaware of himself and the people around him. This gives him quite a few problems. I would not like to meet him in a crazy stage.This book was very good, but some parts were a bit too crazy.

I would be worried about the palm falling out of the case while attached to a belt clip (especially since the case does not close)In defense of the manufacturer, I did not contact them about returning the product, I'm sure they would have replaced it.

The young Puccini was much more Wagnerian in vision, but less of the master theatre man he was to be. In LeVilli and Edgar, he battles with rewards of the soul vs. those of the flesh. The music is rhapsodic, immense- inspired. If I had never had heard the name Puccini and stumbled upon this music, it would be one of handful of great works that I would turn to again and again.The libretto is no masterpiece, but it isn't as bad as some imply. The music is heroic, sublime..some of his greatest.The music is a masterpiece. Someone HAS to perform this onstage.In this live performance, Bergonzi is wonderful, despite missing one of the most intensely dramatic high C endings in opera.

From what I've seen, this thing is awesome! My friend writes 600Mb CDs in about 15-20 min! And it hardly ever gives him a \\"Buffer Underrun Error!\\" Also, he doesn't even need a separate CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive to play the games that he burns; this little guy also reads great!All in all, it's worth the buy. Of course, you probably think a little less of my opinion, since I don't own it, per say.

It is not. Getz sounds harried and uninspired on most numbers. This impression is partly produced by a very unbalanced recording: Roy Haynes, a regular in Getz' groups since 1961, is surely one of the greatest drummers in jazz history, but not necessarily the best drummer for Getz - is here miked up front in a very annoying and distracting manner.There is much better stuff by Getz to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, but concepts are still useful","review":"The problem with books that talk about specific software is that they become dated rather quickly.

I've listened to this album on occasion since it was released and I always enjoy the energy of it.

The time to read it is about as fast as you can turn the pages.Granted, some of the jokes are amusing. This book is best used as a gag gift for someone retiring.

A few things to consider:1. Externals cost significantly more than internals.2. Externals are most often larger and heavier than internal (with a few exceptions) making them actually less portable.3. With externals, you need to carry wires around. Internals use standardized wires. Every computer has an IDE cable and a power cable from the power supply. Try asking your friends if they have a spare FireWire cable and AC adapter with the right voltage to hook up your CD-Burner with.4. Externals often require drive-specific windows drivers.

While albums like \\"On the Mouth\\" and the later \\"Here's Where the Strings Come In\\" are based around the uptempo power pop they helped define, Foolish is more mid-tempo. But that doesn't mean the songs don't rock. Full of songs about unrequited or messed up love this is one of my favorites by the band.\\"Foolish\\" and \\"Driveway to Driveway\\" are great songs about realizing one's own mistakes while still being slack jawed at what happened. Just looking at the first five songs i aurally salivate (if one could call it that). I love \\"Saving My Ticket\\", \\"Why do you have to put a date\\", \\"Keeping Track\\".

This interview brought her horrific childhood more into focus. Her kindness and generosity towards her \\"mother\\" should be a lesson to us all. I for one could never forgive what was done to Meg, if I were in her place.

Unbelievable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING COURAGE","review":"While reading this book, I just couldn't put it down, it is the most compelling story I have read in a long time, I would love to go to the grave and dig up her stepfather and put my hands around his neck and squeeze the life out of him all over again, what sick person could do this to a child and for so long, where in the world was her mother, why didn't she help her daughter, was she so greedy for money and power she just turned her back and let it happen for so many years, I praise Meg for coming out and letting the world know. it will help so many others who in Meg's case were afraid, scared, and ashamed of it, we need to stand up for our rights and be heard, shout it loud and clear everyone who is abused. there is help for you. I recommend that everyone reads this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Done Better","review":"Having read this author's work in other venues, I am very disappointed in the writing and the subject matter. Any type of sensationalising of child abuse is distasteful to me. The book appeals to the prurient interests of people, but offers no education about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you REALLY Listen to Your Kids?","review":"Treehorn's parents are so wrapped up in their own problems that they don't notice Treehorn is shrinking, Neither do any of the other adults. This speaks to the sad fact that many kids feel they are invisible to grown-ups. However, the book is lighthearted and fun, with terrific illustrations. One you will remember for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie, but goodie","review":"We were thrilled to find this childhood book. My grown siblings and I had fond memories of reading it with my dad and bought it for him for Christmas. It is a hard to find book and we were surpised to find it in a new hardcover. Very intriguing pictures and story about poor Treehorn who myseriously begins shrinking. Our children range in age 1 to 13. The books is a lenghty picture book and seemed best suited for prek-2nd grade, although our 4th graders seemed to understand its humor best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious for both children and adults","review":"Having found this book on a recomendation list by a German (!) literature professor, I ordered it not knowing it is a classic. the sense of humour, though sometimes lost on younger children, is wonderful, actually reminding me of the British sense of humour. I can only advise all adults to read this book, it's an eyeopener to our communication skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy - good for folks who need to sit","review":"The movements in this DVD are very simple but helpful with those who can only do very easy yoga moves. I go back and forth with this one and a more difficult yoga DVD. There is no background music - I prefer soothing music as I do yoga. The meditation section is very helpful in envisioning health returning to the body. I recommend the DVD to anyone who needs stretching and easy movements because of pain or other challenges associated with movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good!","review":"Item is brand new and factory sealed. One day (soon) I will open it and try it out! Happy New year"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"this DVD had to many difficult moves for me - liked other people as trainers - I have to many medical conditions so this DVD was to difficult to folow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Yoga","review":"I didn't like Peggy, her earnest goody goody manner, and she talked too much at the beginning, a waste of space. I thought it would be all seated yoga, which it wasn't. The standing part introduced new moves too quickly. It is not nearly as useful as anticipated, and had I seen it before buying, I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could use this at all","review":"Yoga for the Rest of Us: Easy Yoga for Easing PaiI paid full price for this item only to find that I need to update my video card to get past the security coding. My laptop is newer, and I have never had this problem with any other DvD; surely the security is a bit overboard. Hopefully I'll be able to view this when I have more time to update my system. :PThis is an Amazon review, and the product was purchased as an Amazon Prime product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pill Timer","review":"This is a very handy gadget once you figure out how the timer works, but you have to reset it all each day. Once you have the current time entered you have to set the alarm using how much time is left before you want it to beep. You don't set the alarm like a clock. It's confusing at first, but it can work. If it's 8 am clock time and you need to take a pill at noon, you have to set the alarm to beep in 4 hours. If you also need to take one at 2pm you need to set the second alarm to beep in 6 hours and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it very much, but...","review":"I really like this product. I bought it based on the review below. There is one thing I don't understand. When setting the alarm, I need it set for every six hours, do you set it as a clock? 0600, 1200, 1800...Or set is for 0600, 0600, 0600...Or what? Mine just seems to go off at non specific times. After awhile I just gave up. I know once I fiure out how to make it go off every six hours it will be exactly what I need. Until then it is collecting dust. And yes, I did read and reread the instructions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lumiscope 1247 Electronic Pill Timer : Update","review":"This is perfect for taking meds five times a day like I do. It's easy to use, the timer is loud and it works exactly how it's advertised. I gave it 1 star because the batteries died after 10 days of use. I'm going to attempt to get this resolved and I will pass on how and if this gets resolved in another review.Amazon CS rep. was polite and efficient. She rectified the problem by sending me a new one before I sent back the old one. Unfortunately, nothing worked on the item after 10 weeks of use..put in a new battery, did no good."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],H={key:0},x={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-0d7bf410"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/33.md","filePath":"library/33.md"}'),B={name:"library/33.md"},R=Object.assign(B,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{F as __pageData,R as default};
