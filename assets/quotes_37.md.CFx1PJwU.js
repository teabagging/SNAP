I only needed it to work in the room the Mac lives in because I just use it to control the volume, pause and skip on iTunes and the DVD Player. One oddity was that I need to reboot if I remove it and plug it in again for the Mac to see it. The other thing it took me a while to notice is that it seems like the granularity of the volume control is very course (10 steps) but if you hold the volume button down at the limits it actually changes the overall volume of the system so it's more useful than it seems as long as you don't mind the largish steps. It also took me a few minutes to realize it installed an icon on top of the screen that is used to select which app it is controlling. So it's not perfect, but it does what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but is badly made","review":"I bought this at the end of Feb. 2006 for my Mac. It works well except for the fact that the device is poorly designed. The part where the USB connector is and where the device bends doesn't take the stresses of normal use well and keeps popping open. For a while I put it back together, but this last time it tore out four of the five wires that connect the USB to the rest of the device and it is kaput. The wires are thin and soldered on lightly. It is not a robust hardware design. That is too bad because except for that (serious) problem, the device worked well with iTunes, the DVD player and other software. I wrote to the tech support people at Griffin Technology and told them that they need to replace it because it broke under normal wear and tear. We'll see what happens. I will report back.

It was written by a former legal secretary who was working for the attorney that represented MJ's accuser, and I thought she would really know something about what really went on. I'm a legal secretary myself so I was interested to know what she knew. I read over half of the book and it was nothing but her opinion of how wonderful MJ was. I thought MJ was wonderful, too, but that doesn't prove anything. Most of what she said was already in Randy Taraborrelli's book about MJ, and I didn't learn anything new in her book. I didn't appreciate the religious quotes all through the book, either. I feel totally ripped off by her. Plus, I agree with another reviewer that she seemed to have despised her boss and it really came across in the book. That was pointless. I would not waste my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Subpoena?","review":"If the author really has \\"proof\\" that MJ was innocent of the 1993 charges, why hasn't she been subpoeanaed to testify on his behalf in the current case? The answer is simple: Ms. Hughes knows next to nothing about what happened in 1993, and has no evidence of guilt or innocence. She is also prohibited by law from betraying the confidences of her boss's clients - one of the most basic premises of attorney-client relations that any \\"top legal secretary\\" knows and abides by. So much for her ethics. Talk about cashing in...The Chandler family have grounds to sue Ms. Hughes, and they should.This book is filled with filler (e.g., long unecesssary quotes from the California Penal Code) and errors of law.Fans of MJ and those interested in his life who have read this book, should also read \\"All That Glitters\\" by the victim's uncle Raymond Chandler. That book contains the real \\"inside\\" story and is written by someone who did more research than typing a handful of letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind Faith is Dangerous.","review":"Hughes book is an excellent example of how blind faith works. For that reason I urge you to buy her book. Hughes twists the facts. For example, she quotes from secret tape recordings but doesn't tell her readers that she has taken sentences from several different pages of the transcript and strung them together in a single quote, thus altering their meaning. Hughes also omits key facts that she can't deal with. One example is that MJ took the Fifth Amendement in a 1994 lawsuit when asked under oath about his intimate relationships with little boys. Instead of believing the five star reviews of Hughes' book written by MJ fans, or believing the one star reveiws written by me and others, compare Hughes book with mine (also on Amazon), \\"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-up,\\" and judge for yourself. What could be fairer than that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book needs to see the light of day","review":"Michael Jackson is innocent, 1000% innocent.

I think the word should be spread in getting this book out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth","review":"This book encouraged me to question many things; mostly about the judicial system in America, and mostly the role the media played in MJ's demonisation. The writer does her best to make it clear from the beginning that she is doing her duty to report what she considered to be the truth. She has facts to back it up.It is obvious that she is not a seasoned author and neither does she wish to be. She has simply reported what she observed. The fact that she was unable to get anyone interested in what she had to say speaks volumes. This book needs to be read by those sceptics, those that are unsure and mostly by members of the media: those who once labelled him as a child molester."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption by Geraldine Hughes","review":"This book is a must read for anyone wanting to know the truth behind the child molestation allegation against Michael Jackson.

John Patrick is totally clueless concerning the mathematical probabilities which govern this game.All games that are offered by a Casino have a built-in advantage, but seldom will you find an author suggesting that you play in a way that will increase the Casino's advantage over you. This is the only thing that John Patrick does correctly. Every one of his \\"special\\" ideas about how to play this game are WRONG.If you play Blackjack the way he tells you to, you will not only throw away the money you spent to buy this book, you will also throw away the money you wager in a Casino using his \\"special\\" strategy. My only regret is that I had to choose a rating system from 1 to 5. If I could, I would have chosen -50."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book.","review":"The book, \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" written by Michael Blake is a wonderful novel. This story is about the life of one person, Lieutenant John Dunbar. He is anxious to be a good U.S.Soldier. After the Civil War, he arrives at an abandoned army post, where he finds himself alone. The author, Michael Blake,depicts Dunbar as a strong human character,who despite his surrounding circumstances, has lived productively and organized his week-days. Later he becomes friends with an Indian tribe and soon he finds his love. My favorite part of the story is the development of the main character, because the reader is gradually introduced to a dynamic, handsome individual with a strong soul. When I read this book I learned about the life and traditions of Native Americans. I like books which make me smile, laugh and sometimes want to cry. I really would recommend this book for people, who are sixteen and older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dances with Wolves, very good","review":"I requested Dances with Wolves because I wanted to see how the author originally developed the story line.

Let me tell you we still have 2 weeks before we are supposed to be done. We just got the book about 4 days ago. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, I smiled, laughed, wanted to cry...I really want people to read this book. Its great for any age after 13.

I paid for a \\"NEW\\" one and the book I received was obviously very old and had been used. The binding was creased and front and back covers were bent at the corners. The pages were yellowed and stained from age and use. There was even a partial price sticker on the front cover from where someone had tried to sell it at a store of some kind. The quality is terrible and the ONLY THING \\"NEW\\" about this book is the sticker that was placed on the back when it was shipped to me. The word \\"NEW\\" is even printed on the sticker!

The case worked fine, until I started multitasking on my phone (playing mp3 and doing any other task). The phone's response became extremely sluggish when multitasking. I thought it was my mp3 software at first. However, when I use my phone without the case, I don't have any problems.I suspect the reason for the sluggish response with the case is the overheating of the phone, which results in the processor slowing down. The plastic cover on the screen is also hard to use with the touch screen on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkwardly fits Treo's 700 p & w.","review":"The idea behind the case is great, but it isn't a great option Treo 700 (p or w) owners.I am historically rough on phones, and this case certainly has saved the phone from spills and falls. Sadly it fits awkwardly. The case is slightly too small which messes up the alignment of several key components. The left side buttons, the space bar, the top hold button, and most importantly the bottom ports for your headset, hotsync cable, and the power cable ports are not easily assessable. If you want to quickly plug your wired headset you must use both hands to expose the port then insert the headset.The Treo 700w is a great phone, a lot more handy than the Samsung i700.Take care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great case, if you drop your phone it won't get scratched.

It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits the bill","review":"The phone fits snugly and the access points for the hotsync cable, camera, buttons line up well.

It's like they sewed a little too much material, but only on that corner and the plastic makes a bump. Otherwise it's a five star concept and a great price. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Openings misaligned, customer service is a joke","review":"I got 2 Krussell cases, for myself and one as a gift. Once the initial excitment of putting the case on and feeling its tight fit was over, the reality set in -- the case openings, with exception of earphone, were all off. I thought perhaps to give it some time, to strech out. But that hasn't happenned.On the bottom, the acess to sync port, headphone and power ports -- the case cutout never lined up from day one.What's worse, the speakerphone is solidly covered, so I people can't even hear me.I contacted Krussell with detailed photos of all the numerous issues with the case. In response, Krussel, asked me to send the case in -- for them to review the issues with no indication of when I would get replacement.The expense of sending the cases to Scandinavia and most importantly the wasted time, was not worth it.Bad treo case, even worse customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treo case covers","review":"It didn't have holes for the keyboard keys.

It was full of suspense . It was almost like a horror movie. I think this book was very well written there was a lot of detail.The first chapter kept you interested. In the first chapter there is already a mystery to be solved and in order to figure it out you have to keep reading. The plot was very strong it was built at a good pace.One of the things that I really liked about the book was the characters. The characters were very realistic. It was very easy to relate to them because you got to look into their personal lives.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and mystery. Came A Spider is a very well written book that I'm sure you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"I'd been wanting to read this since I was a kid and saw my big brother reading it.

The gentle picking of \\"Bewley in White\\" comes accompanied by a twee little flute. Bibio isn't afraid to include other sources of sound, either: \\"It Was Willow\\" has some skeletal percussion; \\"I'm Rewinding It...\\" seems composed almost entirely out of feedback; and \\"Lakeside\\" has some fragmented voices that hints at its wall-of-sound ending. The dreamy reverb on \\"Wet Flakey Bark\\" seems to be a textured tone poem -- think of the images accompanying Aphex Twin's SELECTED AMBIENT WORKS, VOL. 2. Some of his compositions feel a little unfinished, however, as if he'd discovered a great riff but didn't know what else to do with it, like on the short but aborted \\"London Planes.\\" But the gentle back and forth strumming of \\"At the Chase\\" makes up for any shortcomings. Quite beguiling as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the book you need","review":"If you want to understand subversion, this book will take you through all aspects and it will give you the knowledge you need to plan your own implementation.The online version is good and for things you would like to have a better solution than what the book describes, looking them up in the current online book may show that the feature you wanted has already been implemented. However, the value of having your own paperback version cannot be overstated if you need to know the product well or you're responsible for planning an implementation of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommend not buying this book","review":"This book has been a great disappointment.

It belongs to my very favourite books as it is written in a very nice scientific way. The author,an authentic indian occultist, is very objective and knowledgable when it comes to the astral worlds. In his wonderful book he describes briefly the seven planes, the astral regions, some lower sub-planes, he talks about the diembodied souls and the astral thoughtforms. Moreover he illustrates the life of the astral inhabitants in the higher planes of existence and gives an account of the \\"astral light\\". This book is exact and to the point about all astral matters. It has an almost enchanting effect on the reader.. and its a great pity that its relatively small.Note that Swami Panchadasi does not give any astral travel techniques in this book. Possibly a wise decision, as he considers a teacher (and not a book) necessary when it comes to astral traveling in unknown planes of existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to astral plane and its phenomena.","review":"I read this book first in about 1976 and have not found a similar book as complete in it's descriptions and fascinating in it exlpanation of the phenomena beyond our five ordinary senses.

So glad to see this rare book available again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Exercises At All - Only Theory","review":"I have read every single Panchadasi book in hopes that he would finally give some exercises.It is pathetic that this author makes claims in every book that he is going to teach the \\"devout reader\\" and \\"committed student\\" all the secrets to being psychic and engaging the astral world, but never does.He NEVER GIVES ANY EXERCISES OR INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL!!!Reread that sentence.This book is all description and theory from his perspective, and in many ways he is quite off the mark with his beliefs in comparison to what the occult community in general has accumulated by now.I honestly cannot think of any reason to read this book, unless you want to read old news and learn about old progress.Also, be careful. Much of his work is laden with obscure morals that threaten you against using your \\"powers\\" for good or evil- that using your powers for anything not deemed as \\"appropriate\\" by him will make them \\"disappear\\".

If this disqualifies me from membership in the club, I'll have to just live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"The introductory chapter was a bit intriguing, but not in a totally satisfying way. And then the first few chapters just ramble on with no structure or narrative line. Maybe I need to slog through the next chunk of ten chapters, but why bother? The references to Greek and the Classics were tiresome. The only interesting excerpts were the real commentaries on The Seven Samurai, which only made me want to pick up the books about those seven samurai, not this last one. This is not my idea of a book that deserves an objective rating of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear, skip over this one","review":"This is horrible; I actually think the positive reviewers are fooling themselves if they can understand this elitist drivel.

The primary audience of this book is seminary students who are already fluent in greek, hebrew and latin.

Those are what keep the story moving along, and in this DVD you have no idea what the two lovers are saying to each other. I am very mad and upset about this. I would love to find this DVD with subtitles on EVERYTHING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TOO BAD, BUT ...","review":"i ordered this cd for a lot of money from the states (i am from germany), mainly because it was said to have lots of middle eastern percussion. well, there is a bit of middle eastern instruments, but no middle eastern style. the main influence is indian music.you can't say a thing against the capabilities of the musicians as such, but i don't like the compositions at all. i bet the the musicians had fun recording this stuff, but it's just no fun listening to this cd, more a showing off of some techniques.i listened to this cd once, and will never listen again if i won't be forced! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A children's picturebook about adjusting to the loss of a four-footed friend","review":"Written by a veterinarian and animal lover, Zoe's Good-bye is a children's picturebook about adjusting to the loss of a four-footed friend. A young girl loves her dog Zoe with all her heart, but Zoe is so old and sick she can hardly move anymore. The only thing her family can do for Zoe now is give her a powerful medicine that will help her die. The girl doesn't want to be parted from her beloved friend, and their last night together is poignant - but also wonderful, because when they step outside for a final time, a dogsled with a musher comes. At the head of the dogsled is a place for Zoe, and she can run fast and free from pain. The musher promises to take care of Zoe, and Zoe's owner knows that even though Zoe's life is ended, Zoe is happy and where she belongs to be. A heartwarming story strongly recommended for young people who are going through the loss of a beloved animal companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"This tooth and nail debut album from upside down room is one of a kind really. The guitars are simple and tuneful, the lyrics are somewhat avante garde but very listenable and poetic. I would put this in my top ten of underground albums that should be heard. I have listened to this since 96 and still enjoy it. It has not dated at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COMPILATION BUT...","review":"This is his best and almost complete retrospective so far compare to his previous compilation. It would have been complete if they included the songs \\"My Love\\" and \\"You mean more to me\\" from his debut album. But anyway, overall it's a good cd. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST Definitive","review":"For a time during the eighties few male artists, with the notable exception of Michael Jackson and maybe Prince, could claim an output as solid as that of former Commodores frontman Lionel Richie. Listening to this collection leaves little wonder as to why his popularity soared during the period, gravitating with ease between uptempo('All Night Long','Dancing On The Ceiling') and his trademark balladry('Truly','Say You, Say Me'). Granted, he wasn't without sap-induced sentiment on occasion('Hello' has always grated on me personally), but such sappiness was often outweighed by the sincerity in his performance. There are a couple of glaring ommissions('My Love' should have been included), but overall this more than makes up for the incompleteness of his two previous collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"ah, the memories!","review":"I have always enjoyed Lionel's voice.

To be bluntly honest, the truth is that most people are simply fed up with the blatant hypocrisy of the \\"Religious\\" Right, and we are especially fed up with their efforts to impose their false beliefs on all of society. In other words, rather than being afraid, we are highly offended by hypocrites who have God on their lips but not in their heart. Instead, it seems that their heart is full of self-righteousness, self-importance, arrogance and intolerance, and that results in actions that are blatantly un-Christian. Furthermore, to claim that we are \\"afraid\\" merely reveals the real agenda of the Religious Right, which is apparently to make people afraid of them. Fortunately, their quest for worldly power is backfiring on them and they will be thoroughly exposed by the Spirit of Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right wing hypocrisy...!","review":"I'm neither Demorcrat or Republican, since both in my view..

I just walked into the cd store and bought it. Belinda Carlisle & Radiator's \\"Submission\\" is a standout... as is Robbie Williams' \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\" and Dubstar's cover of Pet Shop Boys \\"Jealousy\\". There is some \\"filler\\" here, but if I knew some of these artists other works it might not seem like it (Cecil, Feline, Octopus, etc.) White Town's \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare gem","review":"radiohead fans a must. anyone else with $30 on hand, an open mind, and the ability to trust this print then get it. good luck finding this one in the stores, but you can find it at most online music retailers. Thom yorke sings some pink floyd(wish you were here) that is actually recorded over the phone from his hotel room. the results are pretty cool. the rest of the album is pretty cool too, but thommy takes me on this one. buy if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Interpretations","review":"Supposedly this album was released in America as \\"Interpretations\\" - good luck finding it. (Mainly) British EMI artists remake British EMI big hits - to wit, EMI's answer to Rubiyat. No real clunkers here, although White Town's \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" (which HAS to be a joke, although he sounds dead serious) comes close. Highlights include the Foo Fighters' \\"Baker Street\\", World Party's Xerox \\"Martha My Dear\\", and Gluebound's \\"Where Did Our Love Go?\\" Some songs you'd think would never work actually do - Belinda Carlisle teaming up with Radiator to take on the Sex Pistols' \\"Submission\\", and an a capella/operatic take on \\"Doo Wah Diddy Diddy\\" by Murray Lachlan Young. The world didn't really need another version of \\"When You're in Love With a Beautiful Woman\\", but Cecil seems to be having a good time, so I'll let them get away with it. Good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designs from the last 10 years","review":"This book shows designs from films that were made in the last ten years. Each designer talks about how they got the idea for the costume and working with the actor who wore it.

Anyway,I give this tape a 10 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and repetitive","review":"Our study group chose this book as a source to learn more about comtemplative meditation. I am very disappointed in the book. Kelsey repeats himself over and over again. He makes statements that have no legs to stand on - and without giving them any - it seems that he assumes everyone accepts his pronouncements as truth.The short (of the long and the short) is that the book is poorly written and very confusing. It lacks clarity on every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"This whole CD is GREAT! Look for greater things!","review":"Radford's new cd is one of the best cd's that i've ever purchased! It blends great slow acoustic songs like FLY, Where do you go, and How does it feel...with great pop/rock songs like Don't Stop, Come on, over you, and several others. The whole cd is awesome! Buy this cd! I can gurantee you that you will not be disappointed! Radford should get really big with this release, if not...it is because our culture is so obsessed with boy bands and pretty little girls with no talent. Radford will have you singing their songs in the shower, in the car, and wherever you may be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old tired sound","review":"The people that wrote the previous reviews must be groupies.

She has shared deeply with the reader the emotional maze she wondered while growing up and has allowed us to see deeply into her confusion, pain, joy, and resurrection.

Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Stripped Down Metal at it's Best!","review":"This album is a time trip back to the early 80's music scene. No \\"Glam\\" here. Just a raw power trio cranked up and smokin'. I've had this album in my collection for over 15 years now and I'm glad they are reissuing it, since my copy is worn out! Not perfect, but a fun record. The sometimes muddy mix loses the lyrics and the lead guitar work on occasion. The lyrics can get a bit tedious since they verge on the death metal side every now and then, but if you want a hard CD that will help you stay awake and drive cross country, this will. Not for the faint hearted. Track nine is possibly the ultimate \\"Telling Off Your ExGirlfriend Tune.\\" The title track will have the guy in the next lane glaring at you if you crank it up with the windows down, but ignore him and just floor it when the light changes. The Rods are real memory lane nasty school boy stuff like old AC/DC and Judas Priest, just pared down to the basic elements. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rods Rock!","review":"This is good, old-school, head-banging, fist-pounding metal. Nothing too complicated here, but it doesn't have to be. If you wanna rock like it's 1984, then this is a great place to start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And something like air I love you Marina\\"","review":"When one takes the time to read Koch's poetry in depth, it is an incomparable experience. The first time I read \\"To Marina\\", which is arguably my favorite of all poems, I was drawn in. I can read it again and again, constantly analyzing but at the same time feeling (and feeling deeply) the poem. Despite the number of times I have read \\"To Marina\\" each reading touches me anew and at times can move me to tears.While one cannot put limits on creative expression, I was a bit put off by the fact that many of Koch's poems are several pages long and often his imagery strikes me as repetitive (although, in fairness, it is used differently)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less than words can say","review":"Koch, when at his best, is simply too large and various to be adequately accounted for in this space. In the wasteland of contemporary poetry, those unfamiliar with Koch's genius may think he is exactly the kind of poet he so brilliantly parodies. For serious readers saddened by the predominant makeup of contemporary poetic demeanor, Koch is the perfect remedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This looks to be a really beautiful book. But if you are intending to try and make the really nice looking swirly candle o nthe front cover in the centre, you will be very disappointed. The cover of this book is very deceiving. It shows how to make most of the ones advertised on the front, but not the real pretty which is only in the book for display purposes only. I find that highly deceitful to print pictures on a book of how to make candles."},{"rating":"1","title":"vile, hateful smear campaign","review":"Filled with errors and cliches born of fear and hate, this book is disgusting. It will only appeal to those nut-job creationists who have already made their mind up about same-sex marriage. What is is about the idea of 2 men or 2 women raising children in a loving environment that offends these people so much? If you want what is truly best for the children, let them be raised by people who love them, not a family filled with hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, as you might expect","review":"I read this book in the library. I found it to be the usual bigotry masked as Christianity. There is no balanced look at the issue and gay people are dealt with in what I think of as a distinctly un-Christian way that does not look at their essential humanity but only as abstract faulty products. If you want more right wing fake religiousity then read it. If you'd like to really understand the issue get out in the commmunity and meet divorced people and gay people and try to figure out the real problems with marriage in our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A close-minded unsupported book of right wing propaganda","review":"I believe my title says all you need to know. The ideas being expressed here are bigoted and should be reserved for much less developed nations with much less tolerant worldviews. Twenty years from now the people writing such nonsense will be put on a level with white supremacy groups and Nazis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical fail","review":"This book is written at a third grade level and shows an obvious lack of understanding concerning both the Judeo-Christian bible and basic human psychology. The \\"facts\\" presented in this book are nothing more than wishful thinking and based purely off emotions and not evidence. The book goes to great lengths to cite the bible as the \\"backbone\\" of these beliefs. The author obviously hasn't read the bible. These verses in particular seem to conflict with the book (Genesis 16, Deuteronomy 22:28-29, Numbers 31:1-18, Deuteronomy 21:11-14, Exodus 21:4, Genesis 38: 6-10). Other historical biblical figures are poorly represented or not mentioned at all, such as Abraham, Gideon, Nahor, Jacob, Manassah, Caleb, Solomon, Belshazzar, Abijah and many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"There is nothing new in this book. It was written to \\"preach to the choir\\", to cement pre-existing opinion rather than to present evidence and change minds. Researched with a \\"have a theory, we'll find facts to support this theory\\" rather then any real scientific method. Claims that God's marriage plan of one man, one woman was set in stone from the beginning of time, yet ignores that polygamy and use of concubines was God's rule of the day in the Old Testament. Even if it were not poorly written, the thought process investing in this book is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quest?","review":"Why was \\"The Quest\\" left off this CD?

With the wealth of tools available to restore old films and bring this type of vintage material \\"up-to-date\\" these videos are a big disappointment. The glossy 4-color package doesn't make up for the many glaring flaws on the films which could have been digitally \\"cleaned-up\\" but its obvious not much money was involved in the production of these videos. Astro Boy, the first ever regular TV anime by the great Tezuka deserves better than this. This caliber product wouldn't not even be offered for sale in Japan where high quality standards are the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly common sense","review":"I realize that 'common sense' is a risky term, but for myself and most people I know, that's what a lot of this is. Most of the 'Toxic Ideas' that the authors debunk are not (in my experience) commonly held ideas. They do an expert job of explaining how and why the ideas are indeed toxic, and what ideas would be healthier and more accurate. But when you don't hold any of the ideas to begin with, it's a pretty silly read (some examples of the 'toxic ideas': 'Ultimatums Settle Disputes', and 'Problems Go Away If You Ignore Them'). I give it two stars because the authors do what they claim to do in the book, and I'm sure there are people out there who will find it immensely helpful. But as far as usefulness to a person of average intelligence, experience, self-awareness, and, yes, common sense... well, it's just unnecessary. Not worth the money; I'll be donating it to my local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was okay","review":"the book was a little slow and confusing, maybe it was me but I just really never figured parts of it out.. as for the other parts it was okay.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clea by lawrence durrell","review":"heey, this is CLEA.

On the good side, it DID help me see why my husband acts the way he does. That is the end of the good.For some reason the authors found it necessary to blame all marital problems on women. Now, men are the way they are and we have to adapt to them. WHAT? What about compromise? Give and take? Why should we be so accepting and conforming to their behaviors? They chose to leave out the part where sometimes he has to bend a little as well. For example- the book says you should always have your home spic and span when your husband arrives from work and make love to him like a godess every time he bats his eyelashes. Excuse me. I have 2 children, one of who is under the age of two. Enough said.I would not recommend this book due to the lack of ability to take both sexes into consideration. It's a man's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Highly Recommended","review":"This book is invaluable.I learned more about myself from this book than any other book I have ever read.

The focus of this book seems to leave this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the \\"good wife\\"","review":"I am sure there are women who will appreciate this book but it just wasn't for me. I found it difficult to swallow some of the advice such as, if you have stopped cooking dinner for your husband then get back in the kitchen. I think you have to be in the right mindset for this book as it is entirely focused on what you need to do differently as the wife.

It is not just for Christian Contemporary listeners--it is for everybody, and yes, it is sure to inspire many. Steve Stilletta is a great singer/songwriter, whose vocals are always captivating, and whose material always inspires. There are hints of influences of other, mainstream bands, such as Pearl Jam, but the performance is all their own. From the irresistable \\"It's A Beautiful Day Jerome,\\" the anthemic \\"Open House,\\" the acoustic ballad \\"Three-Fold Chord,\\" \\"Drive,\\" \\"Boy,\\" and the ska-flavored \\"Wings To Fly,\\" the album is a must own. My favorite cut (if I have to choose just one!) would have to be \\"Open House.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage Rock that focuses on the soul.","review":"Plankeye's breakout album is full good-old guitar driven power pop.

Come on! These guys aren't in the same zip code as Pearl Jam! They're not really even the same style. But i digress.Plankeye is good, driving guitar rock. This album remains my favorite because it feels like it's from their gut.

I am glad I did. This is definitely a book that I will keep on my nightstand for reference. Had I read it at any other time in my life, this book would not have resonated as much as now so perhaps I was also in the right frame of mind to absord this book. The concepts are simple and the fable-like manner in which the book is written made it easier for me to appreciate the concepts. Overall, one of the best lessons/themes that I took away from the book, is that the genius of life is being your own anthropologist and finding out what you love to do and to simply do it. As an afterthought, the money will follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"My life has changed completely believe me It really works!","review":"I had heard about goals. Read several books about it. Mark Fisher has given us a golden tool in a very simple way. You can glide throughout the book and you have to read it again and again. Each time you will discover a new thing, a new strategy, a new hint or rediscover something you knew about previously.This book is a must at your bedside table.\\"The Instant Millionnaire\\" is a written proof that the pen is mightier than the SWORD.

I listened to the audio book, and over 2 hours later, the only significant message to be peeled from the slow-moving, over-dramatized story was simply : set goals for yourself, and believe in your ability to achieve them. That's got to be the most common advice in every self-help, wealth-building, and children's book out there. Sure, it's good advice, but do we need yet another book to tell us that? There was absolutely no tangible, ready-to-apply financial advice in the book. In the end, the old millionaire simply gives the young, struggling, wealth-seeking man $25,000 to start his own endeavor. So it would seem that the way to become an \\"instant millionaire\\" is to simply ask an existing millionaire for money. If you really want to become a millionaire, don't expect this book to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"more crap","review":"Don't buy any of his books. I wasted my money and time reading this.

Skills are also needed to be successful. I have seen many who are successful with the desires and skills.

It is not a secret of happiness, it is a recipe to be a mad man."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a commercial in a book, mostly spam!","review":"This is my first book review. I wrote it because of how disgusted I was at this book. This book is nothing but a stoooopid story about a man who is poor and fed up with his job that wants to be a millionaire. As a multimillionaire myself (self-made, I worked for it), I thought this book would be amusing. The book is about this poor fellow going to see a 70 year old man who is only called the \\"Instant Millionaire\\" in the book. The \\"Instant Millionaire\\" has nothing to say about making money, and it's obviously a load of hogwash. It sounds like one of those infomercials on TV talking about how to get wealthy by doing \\"1 hour of work a week\\".The book is full of total trash and nonsense. ...Do yourself a favor and buy a real book, something that will teach you something. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with good advice but..","review":"Good book with good advice found in other get rich books but I must caution the reader that the language that it is written in is simple and uninspiring.

Read it and touch the soul of the Vietnamese who lost their country and gained their humanity. Read it and savor language at its finest, writing that is poetic and powerful, spare and wispy.All of the stories are masterful. Some are great ... stories that will offer more light and more meaning with every visit. This is one of the best books of the Vietnam experience -- a literary gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Pulitzer Prize","review":"A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain is a wonderful study of the life of Vietnamese people after the fall of South Vietnam. Many of the stories in this collection take place in the United States, especially in Louisiana. What captivates the reader in these stories is the fact that, while placing these stories within the Vietnamese community, Butler is able to discuss universal themes of jealousy, discrimination, alienation, and many others. The stories are in easily accessible prose and have meanings that challenge our self-understandings. On another level, Butler allows the reader a glimpse into the Vietnamese worldview - one that is very different from the American way of looking at life. This book is well worth picking up and savoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insight Into a Different Culture","review":"I probably would not have selected this book to read on my own since I don't usually read short stories, but I am glad that it was required reading for a leisure learning class I took. Butler really opens ones eyes to the Vietnamese people and their culture here in Louisiana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This is highly sentimental writing that bored me to the core.

I enjoyed some of the stories and I admire Butler for stepping out of himself and writing about a culture that isn't his own. It is a bold move and I think he does it well enough... However, I just can't rank it that high, I mean five stars! I can name a dozen other books that really rocked my world and made me think about things differently or contain certain phrases and scenes I still think about!

Not only were the stories uninteresting, but they had no noticeable point. These stories were also politically correct. I have not read one piece of politically correct literature that I liked. Maybe the author did successfully capture the psyche of a Vietnamese person, but it was still boring. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY AN INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE VIETNAM WAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting in storytelling, with an amazing sense of actuality","review":"I was browsing through Pulitzer Prize winning books when I came upon this book. Admittedly, being a Vietnamese immigrant, I was very skeptical that a white man can ever capture the true experiences of the hardships of coming to America. I was quickly stunned at how some of the stories jumped right out of the pages and poured back into the back of my memories. It didn't seem like I was reading a fictional account of Vietnamese assimilation; it was more than that, it was as if I was reading into the history of my time in America. Most notably of all the stories in the collection is the story of the American soldier trying furiously to bring his Vietnamese wife and daughter to America. As you read through his letters and realize his intentions, you can't help but feel frustrated for this man. It is no surprise that this book was a Pulitzer winner. It is that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain","review":"I am a Vietnamese and I have been shocked when reading this book. The author described the Vietnamese characters so gloomily. They are very strange. I have never met someone similar to one of them in my whole life, and I am 54 years old. I see that the author has too much imagination about Vietnamese people. He put the traits of the characters in William Faulkner's books into the Vietnamese characters in his book. (By the way, I don't like Faulkner's writings). It looks like they are backward kinds of people, who are incoherent in their thinking, crazy in their behaviors, superstitious in their beliefs, and sad in their moods. I wish these kinds of books would not appear in the world's literature. Those books make the stereotype about Vietnamese people in the mind of Americans becomes stronger. It's not surprising that the book got the Pulitzer prize: because the judges for the prize were not Vietnamese. If they were, the book would not have gotten the prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have this one!","review":"If you ever owned, rode-in, worked-on, loved or wanted a real HOT ROD then this is your book.

Part One is a thorough but easily-followed analysis of the Cambodian system of writing. Part Two is a programmed text so well thought-out that one cannot help but quickly grasp the material. Part Three is a beginning reader. What Mary Haas did for a generation of students of Thai script, Franklin E.

What a terrible book. I expected it to be an autobiography of Brodeur, stretching his entire life. Instead, it focused mostly on the 2005-06 seaon, and talked mostly about events relating to hockey, with little personal information. Nearly everything written could have easily been found online or in newspapers. I was also disgusted by several factual errors (I counted at least 3 glaring errors, and that was without looking for them; I'm sure there were more).

I have read so many books aimed at my age group where the main characters prattle on about their designer clothes and posh lifestyles and don't endear themselves to you at all but Kelly Harte has managed to find a main character who is loveable and (more importantly) believable.

An impressive accomplishment, documenting not only his survival, but especially his amazing ability and drive to write while being hammered through the slime of the California Prison System. I couldn't put it down. Capturing the 40's and 50's of a long-gone LA (especially Hollywood) with his particular perspective was most illuminating. Reminded me of the works of John Fante. The 'inside' picture of the movie business was particularly facinating. The amazing contrast between opposite poles, wealth, power & glamor, and the tough streets of those surviving on the edge is particularly effecting. This is straight talk. He talks to you and you're there. The great satisfaction of enjoying his ultimate success and recognition make this book especially commendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunker is still ripping people off","review":"I have read many prison memoirs from Caryl Chessman's work to Ed Sanders jail-house poetry. There is something compelling about how we survive when kept locked up in a cage.

So it was with Bunker's Education of a Felon, until the realization comes that this guy is making up stuff as he goes along. I could not finish this book after reading for the 20th time his unbelievable total recall of conversations that happened 40 and 50 years ago. Give us a break Bunker. It is too bad you didn't break out before this book was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe-inspiring","review":"I could not put this book down! Unlike many of the other biographical accounts of felons out there, this one has few pretentions. There are no attempts to tug at your heart strings and force you to sympathize with the \\"well intentioned\\", but criminal, author. Bunker writes his story almost as objectively as a true stranger... he presents his life in a way that makes you sympathize with his struggles, but respect the true ferocity of his nature. I commend Bunker on this most engaging and educaional narrative of his journey through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works!!!!!!!!","review":"This shelf is the bomb and really lives up to its claims.

This book is a detailed historical study of various aspects of papal governance. Acting on the principle \\"Ecclesia semper reformanda\\" Quinn advocates changes in areas of church administration where change is truly required and NO doctrinal barriers exist for effecting such change. The outcome of such change, in my view, would be a purer and more effecacious proclamation of the Gospel, not a diminishment of the Catholic Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prelates who live in glass houses...","review":"Some good insights into true reform.

My daughter, age 6 and a first grader, actually asked me if there might be something wrong with Junie B Jones. \\"Mama, why does Junie B Jones do things a little baby might do like cut off all her hair?

But I don't know a single first grader who still says, \\"I throwed him under the bed with my slippers\\" or \\"I hanged my head real gloomy\\", (both extracted from \\"Junie B. Jones Is a Beauty Shop Guy\\"). This is 4-year-old preschooler language! To teach kindergarteners and first graders to speak this way by having them subjected to it through books they really like, and a character they may wish to emulate, is inexcusable.

For example, No one ever referred to Triumphs and BSA's as \\"Lime Juicers\\" as Scalzo maintains. He has also peppered the book with photos taken after the true \\"Grand National\\" period was over. I suppose using photos from modern day flat tracking was easier for him but I think he should have taken the extra time and effort and come up with photos strictly from the period he was supposedly documenting. Even the cover photo was taken long after the \\"Grand National\\" period was over.

Neither I nor anyone I know in the sport of motorcycle racing has ever heard the term \\"lime juicers\\"- Scalzo must have simply made this up. The story line jumps around and is hard to follow chronologically and the part about the Honda RS750 is simply completely wrong. I'm glad I bought the book for the pictures and because there is so little in print on the subject, but there are so many mistakes in grammar, spelling and historical accurracy that I could not in good conscience use this book as a source for any other article or book. Still, if you are 8 years old, the pictures are cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have missed that....","review":"This book was very disappointing. The authors use of nicknames and other jargon is completely overdone. He spends more time trying to convince you that he was part of a privileged circle. He also focuses on a small handful of factory riders when racing was made up of many stellar privateers. But the beauty of the racing in that era was that all of the riders supported each other, partied together, traveled together and had a very close camaraderie that does not exist in racing today. It did not matter if you rode for H-D or BSA or Triumph or were a privateer - you were friends and stuck together. This author unfortunately does not capture the true essence of that era in racing. Read Gerald Foster's book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroys Toilets","review":"After using these for just over 3 years the inside of my toilets was shot.

Me -- the family 'plumber' -- I hate it with a passion. It literally causes the flapper valve to fall apart, which at first just causes the toilet to leak constantly. You'll notice the sound of the water turning on when nobody has flushed the toilet. This is because the tank is slowly draining into the bowl. Every once in a while, the float drops to the point where the supply valve opens and the tank refills. If you care about water conservation (or maybe just your water bill), don't use these tablets.

Only on rare occasions when a toilet hasn't been used in a while is any bleach odor noticeable. I've noticed no apparent ill effects on my toilet hardware or seals and I suspect the cautions about tablets harming these are overstated. That said, the new cartridge system cleaners look easy to use and the cartridges would be nicer to handle than the tablets are. They also aren't much more expensive and may be worth it for your peace of mind if you are concerned about the toilet seals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Strong!","review":"While I am sure the product is doing a great job of sanitizing your toilet bowl, the pungent smell (which I suppose proves it is indeed working well) is really way too overbearing!I love the smell of clean, but these tabs are seriously strong! The biggest problem though, is that the strong odor these tabs give off is not a fresh, touch of bleach scent. The smell these tabs emit reminds me of public bathrooms at swimming pools.

My only criticism is that the examples are mostly from couples who are dating or other short term relationships. I would like to see Mr. Wetzler do a second book dealing with the dynamics of a long term marriage, layered with the stresses of raising children and the family dynamic that results. It would deal with deeper and more complex issues. Still, the concepts presented in this book were so right on, that I was very surprised. It has helped me redefine a lot of elements of my life -- past, present, and future. I have given copies to my adult children and they are appreciating the explanations of mom and dad, as well as cautions for their own lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"yea but who does it help","review":"I'd think about buying this book for some personal issues but all I read about in reviews is how it helps women deal with pa men/husband/bosses, etal.It might even help the pa male recognize himself. But if it even does accomplish that does it help him work through them or just make him feel worse for his efforts to understand himself?Pls don't forget; the pa was a victim (imposed on by others)of his OWN pa for years before you were the \\"incidental victim\\". He/She has had to struggle with not only his/her own internal problems but with the world he neither understands nor where he is understood.I can find NOTHING for men OR women who want to work through some pa tendencies (not necessarily full-blown papd).

I'm a Petty fan from way back (I saw him live in Austin on the \\"Damn The Torpedos\\" tour in '79) and I'm a \\"can't do anything wrong\\" fan. Having said that, this one just rubs me the wrong way. The title cut and \\"Kid Goes Bad\\" are vintage Petty. The rest is average stuff at best. I'm reminded of Zappa's \\"Joe's Garage\\". I get the message, but the music is just not getting me.I've seen him do most of the record live and unfortunately, it fails live as well.Look, I am an ultimate Petty fan. But we'd have to go a long way back to find an effort so disappointing. It's time for some kind of mix of r and r classics and acoustic Petty orgiginals.The Compaq Arena (Houston) was half empty this past weekend.\\"The Last DJ\\" may well be the \\"last stand\\"'.

After their somewhat dissappointing album \\"Echo\\" the Heartbreakers have recaptured what made them click on Petty's solo album \\"Wildflowers\\". Much of what makes up \\"The Last DJ\\" could just as easily be found on \\"Wildflowers\\". If you liked that album as much as I did you owe it to yourself to buy this one. I also recommend the DVD that comes with the special edition CD. It has an interview with Petty and some video of the band recording some of the songs in the studio. Worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Hope This Slump Doesn't Last","review":"THE LAST DJ only gets 2 stars because the lyrics are so depressing. Petty's previous slingshots at the music industry (a line in the title song from INTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN, for instance) seemed to convey a sense of defiant independence, but here, Petty just seems to sound cynical and nasty, without any idea of a remedy for the problem of music-biz greed and corruption. The previous inspirational lyrics (\\"Refugee\\" and \\"Even The Losers\\" from DAMN THE TORPEDOES and \\"I Won't Back Down\\" from FULL MOON FEVER are wondrous examples) have, sadly, been replaced by mean-spirited hopelessness that cannot be mitigated by his advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in the wake of that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction against a young Australian tourist. It turns out that Petty is releasing a new album at the end of this year or the beginning of next, so let's hope it's less cynical and more hopeful than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Petty's best","review":"Simply put, Tom needs to get back to spending some more time with regular \\"Joe's\\" or something. I've been a Petty fan since about 1979 and have found his records to be spotty...couple of great songs, with some ok ones and maybe a little filler. The exceptions to me would be Damn the Torpedoes, Full Moon Fever, Wildflowers and Long After Dark, which are all grade A from start to finish. This is one of the first Petty records that doesn't even have one classic song on it....I wouldn't care if I ever heard any of these songs again. Musically, they're all fine. Lyrically, I can't relate to a guy who has made his living from the music industry (and a pretty good living at that) making a record bemoaning the current state of affairs with it. I mean, if he wants to moan in private, fine, but why not counter the lame music industry with a great album? This one doesn't do it for me. Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, other than the song: \\"The Last DJ\\", this album is bad","review":"This album is soooooo boring! There are maybe 2 songs worth listening to. I just bought the CD about 2 hours ago and just listed it on Amazon Marketplace to get rid of it. It is just NOT a good album. I usually like Tom Petty's stuff and I think he is an amazing musician, but maybe he should stick to solo stuff or more rock and roll songs. He is great live, but this album is just not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"I was really up for this album but it's one decent song and the rest are filler. Not a hummable song in the lot. Considering Tom is the master of the 3 chord hook, this is the blandest bunch of songs he's ever put out. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"subpar","review":"I have to agree that this is a sub-par performance from Tom, which is a pity given the cynical subject matter. The tunes are simply not memorable, especially the ballads. Surely the best revenge against the peurile \\"tastemakers\\" is to make and be successful with really great music, instead of this mediocre collection. ...- so to cry about the proliferation of pop junk is spearing a well-worn paper tiger. Maybe it's to cover Tom's lack of inspiration....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good In His Old Age","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD before I listened to it for the first time. Tom's last couple of outings haven't had many feel good tunes like those found on Wildflowers and Full Moon Fever. Personally, I think Tom does upbeat better than angry rocker, but damn if he didn't come through on this one. Yes, he's full of rage as is obvious on most of these tracks, but he can still write serene nuggets (Dreamville, You and Me) that give the quieter moments on Wildflowers a run for their money. It took me several listens to finally appreciate what Tom and the Heartbreakers have done here, which is create an album that stands as an anthem to everyone who is disillusioned and PO'ed with corporate America. The lyrics are brutally honest and the music is some of his best in nearly a decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different from TP","review":"Tom petty has taken his usual country style and interwoven new themes to create a truly magnificent rock album.Fans of prog rock will recognise echoes of some of the great concept albums, represented here in the subtle use of orchestration and keyboards, which has created a wave on which bleeding guitars and gritty vocals send a shiver down your spine.Each track stands alone but it is best listened to end to end as the story unfolds the tale of a man with heart and soul is slowly ground away by the corporate machine. There are some comedy moments and at the end, the journey tends to uplift you rather than depress.Artistically, this CD deserves a place alongside acclaimed albums by The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd Definitely more prog than raw rock, but with shorter tracks and less orchestration.Pour yourself a large drink and listen to this one with the lights down low. It is not like his earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last DJ is a great album","review":"This album is probably one of my favorites next to Damn The Torpedos.That was a huge break through for TP with Refugee and Here comes my girl and of course Don't Do me like that.This one has memorable songs too,such as the title track and Like a diamond,Lost children You and Me and the weird Joe track.No matter what others say Tom Petty never slows down and isn't affraid to express himself.He's a great song writer and you wont't find that in todays market.Lyrics like madmen crawl across the wall,knight gets away kings all fall queens chase men saints all sin and good things all must end. Thats taken from like a diamond track. Hey Einemen or however its spelled you should take note on song writing who has been around for awhile.Tom doesn't need to rap and where baggy pants and grabbing his crotch,he knows its still there.I know I got off the path but what we need is more great musicians not artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"\\"Echo\\" was a very good collection of songs by Tom Petty, but I feel the \\"The Last DJ\\" surpasses it. It is an album with depth. Personally, I really enjoy 10 of the 12 tracks, while the other two are not bad or anything. Songs like \\"You and Me\\" and \\"Like a Diamond\\" will remind listeners of the softer side of \\"Echo\\". But, the theme of the album is selling out as evident in \\"Money Becomes King\\" and the title track. This album has struggled to find radio play, as do other newer works by greats such as Bob Dylan and Aerosmith. However, the lack of pop recognition is not indicative of the quality of the album. \\"The Last DJ\\" will be a record that you will find yourself humming in the car and in the shower. Now, if it could only fins its way to radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIce and tight","review":"Tom sounds simply brilliant on this OUTSTANDING look at the dredges of corporate greed and materialism.

Many people were expecting some sort of psychedelic release from Bob that went beyond Blonde on Blonde, and would be his answer to Sgt. Pepper, Satanic Majesties, Mr. Fantasy, Are You Experienced? etc. As usual, he fooled them all. Instead, he reverted to his roots, and became Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, and Hank Williams with a good deal of Biblical storytelling. \\"John Wesley Harding\\" is a great recording. However, if Dylan had done what people were expecting him to do, or if Bob had teamed with the \\"Beatles\\" and created an recording it would have sounded something like \\"The Last DJ!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cynical CD","review":"This is really a cynical album. \\"The music business sucks\\" is hardly a compelling theme for a rock n' roll album. Who wants to crank up their stereo to the sound of Petty's whining? What's sad is that this is the same guy who once gave us songs like \\"Won't Back Down\\" and \\"Runnin Down a Dream\\" and \\"Out in the Cold.\\" Why is Tom so angry now? The music business has treated him royally. It must be that Hollywood liberal guilt getting to him.

Petty sounds like he's a grumpy old man mumbling nonsense instead of an angry rock n roller. Songs like \\"The Last DJ\\", \\"Joe\\", and perhaps the worst song of his career, \\"Money Becomes King\\" show just how terrible it is as a subject to sing about.The good news: he doesn't stick to the concept for long. The second half of the album is much better, staying away from all that dj crap. Songs like \\"Blue Sunday\\", \\"You and Me\\", and the fun \\"The Man Who Loves Women\\" show that he's still in top form, as long as he's not writing about something stupid. I look forward to his next album, where he won't focus on a topic as dumb as radio and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSURD","review":"How a modern \\"Textual Scholar\\" can write a book promoting a theory that was MADE UP by Westcot and Hort, without a shred of evidence, but instead, to help their theories, that were groundless, is beyond understanding. The Critical Text position is factually wrong, and unhistorical. The idea that the churches of Jesus Christ LOST THE TRUE NT TEXT FOR OVER 1500 YEARS, until two apostate Protestant scholars, united with concealed Papists and Unitarians gave it back to us is demented. Only a \\"scholar\\" could be so easily deceived, but not a Bible-believing, Spirit led Christian interested in facts and the Providence of God. The Textus Receptus IS the RECEIVED Text, and THE TEXT of the church since the Apostolic days. Facts and Faith in God's Providential dealings lead us there.

The sensor doesn't look exactly like the OEM one but it works and fits like the original one. The size of the wrench needed to remove the sensor is 22 mm. It installs easily and the electrical connector is the same.It comes with anti seize compound on the threads. Be careful not to get the compound on the open ports of the sensor as it may affect its performance. The sensor appears to be working as it should. The service engine soon light has not come back on since I installed the new sensor and the gas mileage has even improved!

I was excited to get this because in the other reviews it says that it's loud enough, but the only draw back is the small blinking light. I received it, and immediately started to practice, and I wasn't even on a grand piano but my large upright totally drowned out the clicks, it was just way too quiet and there's no volume control volume so I was stuck with it. the light is also small, but not impossible to follow, the only problem with light is that it usually makes you delay just a little bit. So, yes, this metronome would be good if you have a digital keyboard, or perhaps a quieter instrument like acoustic guitar but to all the pianists, violinists, wind players, you will not be able to hear anything out of this metronome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for a good price","review":"It works well...we've had it for about a year with no problems...it definitely helps my kids with rhythm while learning piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought 2 of them they both broke in less than a week","review":"bought one of them and it was defective.

One thing I like about it are the \\"complete\\" myths. Many versions of the stories exist, and often they differ from one another. In this volume, all the existing stories are combined to form one story. But it's impossible to say how complete they actually are as there could still be other versions yet undiscovered.The size is also nice. A lot of my Egyptian reference books are large and heavy which makes them hard to read in bed. For its size, this book has a lot of information which keeps me from having to lug out the big guns all the time.I must say though, considering Amazon's $42.83 price tag for a new copy I was expecting a lot more. I bought a good used copy for $12 and I'm glad that's all I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and insightful book","review":"This is a very insightful and well-written book.

Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn more about the Prophet Muhammad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"This is a superb book...for junior high or high school students. Yes, it is easy to read, but I found the highlighted words in the text (to indicate they are in the glossary) to be a nuisance. The authors over-simplify everything and attempt to encompass too many areas of the broad field, so it will only be of use to readers who have never seen CSI or know absolutely nothing about forensic science. Saferstein's introductory book on forensic science would be a better choice for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific saw","review":"This saw is one of the better products I have purchased lately.

Be aware though, if you need a saw that will give you a nice smooth cut, this probably isn't the right saw for you.

She couldn't even accept the fact that she was gay. Everything the subject came up she blamed on Paris. And the scene with the mother... GIVE ME A BREAK and some reality. I didn't have a problem with the sex scene (I have seen and read worst), I did have a problem with the fact that Nicole had this power over two people and I can't see why. In my eyes, she was waek. She was so eager to explore this other side but she couldn't handle all that went with it.This book was poor and a waste of my time and money. I finished in a day and a half.

Eric's written is beautiful as usual with no disappointment in his story line. No-name (very clever), Ayanna, and Nicole is a love triangle that you'll grow to understand, yes you will feel confusion, love, hate, and passion between these three but it was so worth at the end.

The actual story line itself was great( I thought) but the characters were very weak. The male character was so LAME! I have never encountered a man who would deal with a woman with selfish and immature ways. The fact that she was bisexual was ok with me, but her selfishness and her overly dramatic reactions were absurd. I will continue to support my man EJD, I would just pefer he stick with his orginal style of writing. The details of all the running these two characters did was ridiculous, I wish he would have added that much more detail into the plot and the ending of the book. Once I start a book I have to finish it, but this one I really procrasinated on. Better luck next time Eric!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Best Seller","review":"Eric has done it again with this new novel. I read this book in one day. The characters were very interesting, one couldn't help but think if the male character was the author himself. This is a very good book, the ending will surprise everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creativity is Better Than A Contract","review":"I was so disappointed in this book that I put it down half way through. Most vulgar, was the scene between the three lovers in the bed. If Mr. Dickey wants to continue in literature, certainly, he must use his creativity in the same way that he did with Milk In My Coffee and Cheaters. I was disappointed with Liar's Game, but decided to give Mr. Dickey another chance. If he keeps this up, I will not purchase anymore of his books. Is a mega contract worth losing his creativity? I don't think so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin plot","review":"I finished this novel in a day. Not because I liked it so much, but because I could not wait to get free from the torture of reading it. It was bad. This is EJD's poorest novel yet. The plot was thin, and the characters unrealistic. Compared to Dickey's others, this novel is sub par. The novel takes place in the span of a few short days. I felt that there were myriad unresolved issues and many others were left unaddressed. I can't find enough ways to express my disappointment. Short of pointing to specific scenes and giving away the plot, I can't give examples so I will stop here. This novel was a waste of money. I don't say that lightly b/c EJD is one of my favorite authors and I have always had great respect for his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric Jerome WHO?","review":"I guess I should wait until I'm FINISHED reading the book before reviewing it, but I just couldn't hold it in any longer. WHAT THE #$%! IS THIS? It's like i'm reading something with EJD's name on it, but written by someone else. The writing style was TOTALLY different from his previous works,and it didn't work for me OR HIM. I think the characters thus far (I'm 3/4 of the way through the book) are under-developed and shallow, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that they won't be developed any further in the last quarter of the book if they aren't by now. The story focuses so much on sex between the three that it takes away from whatever else was supposed to be there. And what's up with Nicole and her DENIAL? She keeps blaming the narrator for her current lifestyle - WEAK! This book is just not working for me, but I'm going to finish it because I bought it and i'm 3/4 of the way through it. EJD please go back to the way you were writing before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very believable.","review":"I found myself frustrated while reading this book. It took me a little longer than usual to finish this book because I got tired of it. I don't konw whether or not it is unrealistic, but I had a hard time believing the strong feeling held by the characters. Therefore I thought that the things that they put themselves through was ridiculous. I've liked all of the other EJD books except this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE TIME READING THIS BOOK","review":"This book was horrible the plot is disgusting and weird and my sister and I both read this book and was very angry at the work from Mr. Dickey we expected more. At then at the end of the book if you don't stop in the middle cause it's so bad that you can't go on reading the book yyoure thinking i know i didn't just read this book for this to happen. I guess it just wasn't my type of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down on This One!","review":"Up to this point I have really enjoyed Erics books, but not this one! The characters were not fully developed and there was no plot to speak of !The book just went on and on about sex! I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much explicit sex","review":"The book contained way too much explicit sex that was not necessary to the plot of the story. The story itself was good, but the sex and the description of the landscape was just filler. I've read Eric Jerome Dickey before and liked all his previous books. I was very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use your imagination","review":"The story was moving, but seemed to stay too focused on the sexuality, and not the emotional side of love. We needed more depth explored about Nicole to help us understand her. I liked the narrative effect of the male character. The ability to know what he was thinking, but would not say provided a nice touch. The ending seemed rushed but definitely unpredictable. I would add this to my collection, but just not right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip.....","review":"This book was a total trip to me. In the past I have not like Eric's work, but every now and then I buy one, just to give the brotha another chance. I must say I enjoyed this one, not overwhelmingly but enjoyed nonetheless. I understand this book's style is different fron his previous style, maybe that is why I liked it.It's such a shocker, you won't be able to put it down, anxious to see what could possibly happen next. READ THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again","review":"Between Lovers, is not like the books before, it has a different style but the same rhythm. You get to know the characters, pick your favorite, get mad with the characters, wonder what the heck is wrong with them cause there is no way you would go out like that, and then cry in the end cause things turned out for the good. I picked it up and couldn't put it down.

If you're looking for romance stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Loyal EJD Fan","review":"I've been keeping up with EJD books and Between Lovers is such a disappointment. Though I knew the subject matter, I expected EJD to be simply detailing an alternative lifestyle - since everyone has a place in society. Instead, the book is about a selfish woman out to fulfill her sexual wants (not needs). The sex is explicit, the characters are shallow, and story line typical when there's shallow characters. This story would have been more appropriate in a short anthology book - not big novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY IMPRESSIVE READ!","review":"I've enjoyed EJD's other books, but I LOVED this one! He's really maturing as an author and I applaud his willingness to challenge our deepest beliefs, assumptions and prejudices about monogamy and sexuality to examine the complexities, contradictions and ultimate lessons of LOVE.The characters were captivating, the emotional and erotic tension was delicious, and the end was both unpredictable and satisfying. You'll either love it or hate it, but you won't forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it!","review":"\\"Between Lovers educates the reader about the odds and ends about the sexual lives that we lead. This novel also reveals certain parts of us which most are afraid to explore. The sexual content is so vivid, so intense, makes me feel as though I\\"m in the room with the characters. I felt all the feeling the charcters were feeling as if I knew them. Eric Jerome's writing style will make any good reader become addicted to his books.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"He has done much better","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I love all of EJD's other novels, but this one totally let me down. I don't feel like the characters were developed very well, and it read like a sex novel. I still remain a great fan of EJD. I just feel that he missed the mark with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"YSAMYCHGO","review":"Just finished reading \\"Between Lovers.\\" Bougth it back in July, but wanted to save it awhile to build up my own anticipation.

The love triangle between the narrator, Nicole and Ayana was unrealistic.Nicole, an extremely selfish woman wants to have it all. She has no consideration of Ayana and the narrator. Ayana and the narrator are also weak characters, giving into so call Nicole's spell.Eventhough the book explored other themes(spiritual, mother-daughter relationships etc), it concentrated mostly on explicit sex (x-rated) scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I did not enjoy this book, it's bordering on soft porn.

No challenge to their integrity or values. NO growth.And was it me or were the two pursurers bordering on obsessive about Nicole?

Call me closed-minded, but this book has so much explicit sex and vulgarity, I had to speed read. There were times when I wanted to just rip this pages and throw the book away, but I had to give the writer the benefit of the doubt and hope there was some light at the end of the tunnel.I have read all of E.

But still loves you? Would you compromise? BETWEEN LOVERS capitalizes on the fact that we as humans need to be satisfied in ways that sometimes one person can't always do. There are moments where we grow from certain experiences, and although many may see those changes as rebellious or sinful, we are, in fact, simply discovering ourselves. Just when you think that compromising in a twisted love triangle would do the trick, it doesn't. Or does it? Will family and/or society influence their bizarre behaviors on what step they'll take next? Or will it be another twisted ending, leaving you [asking] for more?

I was so dissapointed to a point where I stated wondering if this is the same person who wrote \\"Cheaters, Liars Game ect..)The book did not doing anythig for me or my friends who read it.

Ownster"},{"rating":"2","title":"NAME THAT CHARACTER!","review":"Even though he chose not to give his central character a name, Eric Jerome Dickey has spun a fascinating tale with BETWEEN LOVERS. This novel is funny, poignant, creative, and thought provoking. It also explores a new level of sexual identity that is not examined even in the works of E. Lynn Harris.If you're a fan of this author, then you should add BETWEEN LOVERS to your collection. If you're not a fan, then you'll soon become one after reading this enjoyable romp through the lives of its often confused and always candid characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Up With This!","review":"I love Eric's writing, but this was not his best work. The writing was like putting something together fast, without a mode. The narrator was a whimp and out of character for a real man. A real man will not share his woman with another woman. With all the mess going on, who loves anyone more than life itself. You know what's going on and having a relationship without protection, be for real. Eric show me the old Eric, and he is an excellent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Anyway!","review":"Ejd this book brought on great frustration or let's say the narrator. He loved her greatly or did he? Maybe he was like Ayanna infatuated with her. Well Nicole wasn't all that and never will be. To me she was very selfish, she made her decision and she should have lived with it. Does this really happen with guys? Women will move mountains I guess some men will too Huh.

I had to fan myself with it a few times. I even questioned a few people on the realness of the descriptions. Nicole, Ayanna and the narrator were truly deep.

I skipped a few pages with the anticipation of a good ending. But give me a break. The protagonist was a selfish bitch and didn't deserve the back and forth love she received from her lesbian lover and her ex-fiance.The idea was interesting but the words just didn't move me.

It was so slow at the beginning, and it just didnt keep my interest.

I know it started off to be kind of slow, but wasn't the first couple of pages full of very detailed sex scenes? I can't really remember I gave it to someone to read. It was good and well written, I just had a difficult time getting use to EJD'S new style of writting. It was different, to say the least. You know I didn't even realize the narrator was nameless until I read some of the reviews, funny huh? Is that a bad thing?I thought the narrator was about a fool. What man or woman would put up with self-centered Nicole? I don't know of one. She was a ridiculous character and so shallow. Tried to justify her selfish behavior by telling both her lovers how confused she was 'Please feel sorry for me'! Oh Paleeez! Ayanna's character was cool with me at the beginning, she wasn't puttin' up with nameless at all. Then she got dumb on us.Although the characters all drove me to drink, I couldn't put it down.

While having real world examples of the lessons are obviously beneficial for the reader, they are so frequent, and so frequently based around the author's own successes, that it takes away from the lessons themselves and the book ends up being a big pat on the back for the author instead of a helpful guide for the reader. It comes off narcissistic and a \\"look how much I am paid for how little work and how much expertise I have\\" kind of thing.... which quickly became very irritating to me.

I'll never buy another disc from Passport again, in fact I should send this back to them.If that wasn't enough, they screwed up the programming on this disc too- several times it goes back to the main menu then you have to search back to where you were, and selecting individual commercials from the menu sometimes brings you to the wrong part! Several things are misspelled too.

This otherwise acceptable DVD is marred by a bug at the top right corner of the screen, reminding you of what you're watching. To a video purist like myself, I can't stop staring at it. \\"Something Weird Video\\" has this same habit of putting these bugs on their DVDs. Needless to say, I never buy Something Weird Videos as a result (in fact, I returned the first one I bought after seeing it). People buy DVDs to get pristeen copies of whatever they want, and putting a bug on the screen just shows the disregard Passport video has for their customers.

There are a lot of books about intuition out there yet, but my own intuition hasn't been much help in finding a satisfactory one. This book asks some important questions, such as how can you distinguish your intuitive voice from other inner voices (i.e. how do you know when to believe your hunches and when to regard them with skepticism), but I don't think she goes far enough in answering them. The book is only about 25,000 words, which is about one-third of a book by most publishing standards, and reads as if it was written in a week. Also, there is a tendency in new-age self-help books to write for an audience of would-be entrepreneurs or creative artists, which is of little usefulness to many potential readers, who might be able to use their intuition to deal with truly difficult situations (\\"you should see a therapist\\" is her advice to those with problems...).

I have had some absolutely amazing insights and strokes of intuition that generally come out of the blue. I wanted to learn how to be able to recreate these epiphanies, but even though the author promises greater insight into intuition, what she wrote I already knew. The book is very basic and seemingly hurriedly put together, more geared up toward readers that are broaching the subject for the first time, so not a book that was of any help to me. In comparison Penney Peirce' s \\"The Intutive Way\\" is a far superior book that is equally fascinating to a first time reader on the subject or someone that uses their intuition but wants to gain greater mastery of it. It is a shame that so few truly exquisite books are written on such a fascinating subject as intuition"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Vortex","review":"Great book that I would highly recommend to anyone that is interested in vortexes, vortex energy, portals, time travel, and the Bermuda Traingle.

There are references aplenty to some wonderful music by the Beatles and XTC, to name but two, but instead of a sly homage, several snippets can be found tone for tone on those artists' songs.

While I have read many books by Jane Yolen, I can honestly say this is one of my favorite Yolen books with a poem as text. The poetry is intricate yet appears simple. This is a story that must be read aloud, simply to delight in the rhythm and the story. The illustrations are stunning, accentuating an already wonderful story. I strongly recommend this book for children, particularly in a read aloud setting.

One must open the blade to use any of the tools, which also releases it from the key chain. I would much prefer that it stay on my key chain. Also, to pull the blade open, one's fingers have to get right next to the sharp blade. The risk of cutting oneself is probably very low, but it doesn't feel right. Bad feng shui or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1.5 months","review":"I purchased this item a little over a month ago and liked it for the most part. I liked having an accesible knife on my key ring. The bottle opener doesn't work well--slips easily which is scary with an open blade on the other end. Regardless, it broke--the metal actually snapped right behind the screwdriver where the bottle opener is. I think this was due to the stress of opening bottles although it was in my pocket when it actually broke. I was very lucky I didn't cut myself when I reached for my keys because the knife was exposed as a result of it breaking. Also, I never used this product in any particularly stressful way--just opening boxes and bottles. I could never recomend this product as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"My first attempt using this was to open an external HDD enclosure.

This wasn't a difficult (read: really tight) screw to remove--it's something that you can remove a micro screwdriver that you would use to fix glasses.Again, this was the first time I used it and it was already broken!

Philips screwdriver...useful, Sawtooth blade...useful, straight blade...useful.The flat head and eyeglass flathead are in places that have no reach, and the eyeglass flathead seems to be machined to thick for eyeglass screws. The flat head would have been better positioned at the end of the straight blade. The bottle opener is in such a place, that if your hand slips, you could possibly slice yourself on the blade that you use as a fulcrum when opening the bottle.There is also no place to thread a key ring, which means when you use two hands to release this tool from your keys, your keys fall to the ground.One more thing about the key novelty of this item- don't forget to remove the tool from your keys before you waltz through airport security. If you can't bring nail clippers, I'm pretty sure this will be a red flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I have used other Swisstech key chain tools and have been very happy, but this one is I am not impressed with at all. I bought this because I wanted a small blade with me to quickly open boxes and packages. First, it is not that quick to get out. Second, it is difficult to hold and use (I have cut myself three times already). Anyone who is thinking of using the other features might want to first consider that you will be holding onto the blade in order to use them. The only good things are that it is small (a little longer than a key) and the blade is sharp (good for cutting through flesh while you try to unscrew something).In short pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Little Gadget - Just watch your fingers","review":"Got this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and was pretty impressed with it.It takes a little practice to open the tool, and if you're not careful, you could easily cut your fingers. The blade is very sharp, and it would probably be a good idea for the company to include a little protector sleeve. It works well for opening letters, packages, etc. The two screwdrivers look like they would work well in a pinch, but are quite small. The bottle opener looks like it work well, also.All in all, the quality seems pretty good, and it's ultra portable and is bound to come in handy.

I purchased it primarily for the bottle opener in a pocketable, inconspicuous configuration. However, after attempting to open 3 bottles and cutting myself on each attempt, I am fed up. I do not believe there is a way to use this product safely. On top of that, it is rather difficult to open (not to mention getting it out of the package).

More bang for my buck, if you will.Unfortunately the bottle opener is placed in a really strange place which makes it hard to use, the knife is only really good for opening envelopes (I tried to use it to cut the tape off of a package I got in the mail and had a surprisingly rough time...something tells me a regular key would have worked better.) Also, although I have not used them yet, two of the three screwdrivers are placed in such a way that makes me quite sure that they will be just as hard to use as the bottle opener.I wish I'd gotten the one I looked at initially (Church Key Bottle Opener), but I really can't justify buying two keychains in a month.

It takes both hands to open and both hands to close this tool. Any other way and you'll have no luck or cut yourself.Every time my son gets a new toy in one of those extra-annoying plastic clamshell packages, this tool shines.

This is an inexpensive pocket tool, and I would like to think I got my monies worth out of it, but there are so many other pocket tools out there of better quality that this one is not a must have.

I work 5 days a week in a warehouse and do not like to carry around large knives or multi-tools. I have enough stuff to carry without the weight of a extra tool.

I would say that on average I use it 2-3 times per week and for a $5-6 value, that is great. It is no bigger than any other key on my ring and it has many useful functions. The only downside is that it can be hard to handle at times when you need torque due to its slim nature and design. Outside of that though it works great and has never fallen off my keys.

It has a nice compact size, but that is the only thing nice I have to say about the design. Any time you need to use one of the tools you have to completely remove it from your key chain which increases the odds of it getting lost. I thought the bottle opener would be the tool that would get the most use, but as you can see from the picture that requires you holding onto the serrated blade to get leverage. This can't be the best key chain tool for the price. After saying all of this I'm sure I will get stranded in the wilderness and this thing may save my life.

The key opens up 180 degrees, and locks at BOTH 90 and 180 degrees. So, if you want to use it as a saw/pocket knife, it will lock out straight. It you want to use the screwdriver, it will lock at 90 degrees so you'll have a sturdy handle.

It's compact, non threatening, and can be used extensively without wear. I just ordered this new one in after I lost my old tool, and opening and closing this new one seems to be much harder than the last one, this might be due to me having to break it in, and after a quick spray of WD-40 it seemed to be more easy, however it still took plenty force to open and close. This could be a problem since you might possibly hold it at the blade's edge, and cause injury, so be sure to use the tips of the tool when opening and closing it.

The main problem is that the bottle-opener functionality is backwards and misshapen. Because it's backwards, you don't get any leverage when you're trying to open a bottle and the point of the knife end can dig into your hand.

Musically it's awesome, especally the vocals, and lyrically it's great, especally \\"At the moment\\" which is a worship band, this is great CD to add to your collection. If you ever get the oppurtunity to meet Mark Saloman, he is one the nicest, humblest guys you'll ever met, in my opinion he is the godfather of Christian punk/hardcore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent disc","review":"The first two times I listened to this CD it didn't quite open to me.

Since numerous studies have implicated inflammation in serious disease, any product that has been shown to decrease inflammation should be considered by those who take supplements. The kicker here is a report that Zyflamend used in a Columbia University study seems to lower the number of, or eliminate, the precancerous (PIN) cells that occur in prostate disease that can lead to prostate cancer.My understanding is that Zyflamend is already the number one \\"alternative\\" anti-inflammatory supplement in the US.As such, its safety is apparently well-documented.SO, a pill that may lower the (inflammatory) cause of serious disease AND alter prostate disease progression for the better .... what's the downside to THAT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Zyflamend Liquid - Promotes A Healthy Inflammation Response, 2 oz., (New Chapter)This was the nastiest (sorry, but it fits) tasting liquid I have ever tasted.

This story could have been told in a novel half the size. It was drawn out with meaningless dialogue. I've never seen a hero and heroine with less chemistry than the two in this book.What exactly was the point of the heroine having sex with a man who contributed nothing to the story line? He and his son came in and out of the story without a purpose. If there was a purpose then Ms. Taylor Quinn failed to deliver it.Ms. Taylor Quinn should stick to writing for Harlequin Superromance.

Also, be careful, because the air filled bags they pack into the box transfer ink to the mats if the mat is slightly wet and it doesn't come out.

The only good cut on the entire CD is \\"Deception\\" by the Cruxshadows, which mixes lovely Goth/synth beats with the beautiful music of the band's equally beautiful violinist. Other bands featured are Beborn Beton, Wench, Bella Morte, and Neuroactive, though this matters little as their songs aren't worth listening to. \\"Prey\\" by Seraphim Shock is decent enough, but the band is really no more creative than any of the other talentless artists they share CD space with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as promised.","review":"Disc was listed \\"like new\\" condition but had some discoloration/heat damage on information side upon arrival.

They're mainly fast-paced with a couple of slower ones.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that the pieces seemed to be very stylistically the same.

Relaxing, interesting, magnificent; the skill is mind blowing. How anyone could manipulate these sounds out of a guitar is beyond me - superlatives don't do justice to an artist like Pepe Romero; but more, the songs are intensely enjoyable to listen to, and easy to appreciate.

Actually you can track: it goes - package input to system, package picked up, package given to USPS for delivery - then all info goes dark for a few days. Sellers; put a stinkin' stamp on the box and ship it yourself, it will get there faster.

Everyone suspects she's a lesbian because she \\"looks like one.\\" Truth be told, she's not sure herself because she's never been anything... no relationships, no attractions, just the Marines. Reese meets Dr. Tory King, the only doctor in town, while investigating a break-in a the local clinic. There is an immediate attraction. However, Reese doesn't understand her new feelings and Tory is scared to express her own. Radclyffe has hit another home run with this incredible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to get lost in Rome","review":"This Rome Walking Guide included an eclectic mix of sites to visit, and the walks were comprehensive. However, it omitted precise directions to and from each attraction. Addresses for most sites were omitted, as were many street names. The included maps were not very detailed and ended up confusing us more than helping. We found ourselves frustrated and lost more times than not. The compact size of the guide made it easy to carry around, but it was lacking in historical background. A bit more information on the attractions would have enhanced the experience of each walk. Overall, the guide lacked clarity, detailed directions, instructions and background -- all crucial for a special experience. I would not recommend this guidebook for first time visitors to Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource with unique info","review":"This guide provided unique and interesting details to sites in the different districts of Rome. The information about St. Peters, Vatican Square and the diagram of the Sistene Chapel was fabulous. We were able to visit several out-of-the-tourist-path restaurants and found friendly locals eating inside, which provided a true taste of Rome and Roman culture. Bring a map if you want detailed directions, as this provides general directions, but it fully achieves its goal of great walking tours and fabulous information. It really made our trip to Rome special and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for applying self regulation in several areas of real life","review":"Self Regulation had been studied profoundly by educators, eventhoug the concept is useful in so many areas of human behavior.

I would recommend this for people that do not have thick hair. It keeps my hair in whatever direction that is needed. It's more of a light-medium hold though. What I like best about it is the smell (which I get compliments on) and that you can run your hands through your hair and it doesn't feel like you have gel or hairspray in your hair. I get best results when drying my hair completely and then applying a small amount throughout my hair. If you put it in while your hair is damp, it will not hold your hair well.

I ended up being surprised twice: (i) Wayne Dyer is not a co-author, but simply a reviewer; (ii) (the best surprise) Richard Carlson has done a great job explaining simple and down-to-earth situations in life that cause problems in the lives and relationships of so many of us, yet these are all problems that can be easily avoided by just keeping one's flow of thoughts in check.

Therapy, group workshops, cognitive therapy and all the endless self-help books on relationships and divorce have really only helped me to \\"survive\\" my current seperation/ divorce and a long history of depression. This book immediately changed my perspective and day to day functioning so much that people have commented independently in every facet of my life.

Literally, this book has changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on taking care of your mental health","review":"I was traveling and bought this book to have something to read and bought it because it had a foreward from Wayne Dyer.

Sure I might know these when he points them out but the way he explains them is great. It is simple, easy to read and if you do what he says they work. I have been impressed with the results of the book. Great read with impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"I've listened to about half of the audiobook on CD and it does absolutely nothing for me. Very general information. Too much focus is on the \\"what\\" to do, but not on \\"how\\" to do it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - male / female, young / old, etc. There are much better books and audiobooks out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everybody","review":"This book isn't for everybody; it certainly wasn't for me. Granted, I was so unimpressed that I didn't finish it, so take that as you see fit. This book reads like a college essay, covering the same points over and over and over and using exaggerated and sometimes unrealistic examples. The book talks about how thoughts aren't reality and how everyone's perspectives are different - common sense things like that.This book mainly brings people back from the edge to an equilibrium state by pounding some basic principles into their minds. I feel I'm already at the state he tries to bring you to, and his suggestions won't make a person like me happier.If you're looking for common sense and equilibrium, I recommend this book, but if you're looking for something more, I'd say to move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much b.s.","review":"The chapter on thinking was intriguing, even though there was a taste of b.s. I looked forward to it getting better, or at least providing some additional help. Instead, it went rapidly downhill, talking about \\"moods\\" as if they came out of the blue -- and it actually got worse, because it was like someone flogging an already dead horse (his point) to prove he can resurrect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be a putz, buy the book.","review":"Great book for those of us who occasionally have to pull our head out!

When this came out, very few punk bands demonstrated the technical skill they seemed to throw around so casually. MxPx, apparently considered by some to be a superior band, were still floundering with their first two releases, and even with Life In General still did not reach the level of musicianship that Ghoti Hook nailed their first shot.These guys comprise one of the best bands to come down the pike in the last 10 years. This album is great fun, both lyrically and instrumentally. Still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Punk?","review":"Let me start by saying one thing- CHRISTIANITY AND PUNK DO NOT MIX! Punk is, at its core, motivated by challenging mainstream morality, values, politics, and aesthetics that drive pop-culture. Creating fast and hard music does not make something \\"punk,\\" anymore than simply rhyming to a beat make something hip-hop. There is a culture involved and this music simply cannot conform to that culture because it is, by necessity, conforming to mainstream culture (now with that said, I have heard some anarcho-Christian punk that I have to admit is punk). Yet, despite my frustration with diluting the meaning of \\"punk,\\" I have to admit that this is a fine album. Although many of the songs are simply too silly to even comment on, the complexity and texture of songs like \\"South Capitol Street\\" and \\"Scared Am I\\" are too good to be dismissed simply because of my frustration. I don't know if it's punk, but that doesn't mean it is bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from European point of view","review":"Intellectual property is now very different from 1997, when the comparable work of the eminent Paul Godstein was published.The present work is a service for European lawyers, who must know rather much about the American legal tradition and be able to discern the similarities behind different concepts and the differences where one would not expect to find them.The book is written in a lucid way avoiding extreme \\"legalese\\" and avoiding partisan tones.

When I looked for another, I chose this one, read by Colleen Dewhurst, because I have always admired her work in film. Well, it was all I could do to make it through Babette's Feast, and I will pass on trying to listen to Sorrow Acre.

I say series lightly because this book should not be included as part part of the Clare Fergusson/ Russ Van Alstyne mysteries. I am fairly new to the series and this was a huge disappointment since the characters I know and care about rarely appear. This book is peppered with minor characters and often less than plausible story lines.I am sad to say I put this was down. Ms. Spencer-Fleming's fascination with deer hunting and subesquent deer skining was very off putting. It's a shame she feels she has to resort to this type of false sensationalism after a noteworthy first novel.To Darkness And To Death lacked both style and substance and is a world away from what I grew to know and love in the first few books.

The two leading characters were flat, with the action happening all around them but no real sense of their personalities. The plot points relating to the kidnapping and to environmental concerns did not play out as really fitting together. I also thought that the author's dialogue was stilted and unbelievable.Maybe it was unwise to choose this as the first one of the series to read but it seems to me that each book should be a stand-alone good read.

The rest of them, well, we're better off without them. The one error I would point out for the sake of verisimilitude regards the Prius auto mentioned. It doesn't use keys, neither for the door nor for the ignition. Well, mine is a 2004. Perhaps the older models use keys. Maybe Julie needs to check some of this type of stuff out before writing.

I found the book for the most part to be a long read. I have also found my patience with the relationship between Rev. Fergusson and Russ Van Alstyne at an end. Her character is always jumping in without thinking or thinking her way is best in police investigations where she has little experience. He finds her frustrating but, he's in love. We are to believe she is sincere in her vows with her church and yet she continues to have a relationship with a married man.

This book is excellent for helping others, men and women, to learn how to get past the spin and the reactionary smokescreens in order to get down to the heart of the matter...Wendy debates with men and women on volatile issues every week. She is experienced and knowledgeable, as well as highly respected by both sides of the gender debates. These qualities shine through in this book and make it a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logic for women","review":"There are plenty of books out there on logic and reason. So why should women get a book of their own? Because women have been granted a special place in society, where we are \\"supposed to be\\" irrational, emotional, and intuitive. Wendy McElroy (a role model of mine) has expanded not only on the principles of reason, but also on the special challenges women have in a world where we are frequently put down, abused, and raised to be non-thinkers.McElroy herself was a teen-runaway, who later married an abusive man. She is an inspiration that she could break away from those patterns and lead a successful, independent life of her own.In this book, McElroy gives us permission -- then the instructions -- on how to be rational in an irrational world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Keeper","review":"Wendy McElroy has written the book I have been looking for--a sensible self-help guide for anyone desiring to boost her/his intellectual prowess. Overlook the author's bias against feminism and her sometimes too personal or irrelevant anecdotes, and you have a very usable schema for developing your personal intellectual strategy. I am buying copies for my daughter and sister too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The only reason I ordered this book was because a person from one of my LinkedIn groups recommended it. I'm guessing I gleaned about 10% of it as intellectual, reasonable information; otherwise, it was a waste of time. In one of the other reviews, the person writes of plagiarism. In her defense, Wendy cites many other authors and a wealth of resources along with numerous footnotes that I wouldn't agree with his assertion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for both hands-on experiences and knowledge.","review":"The book illustrates the fundamental theory and the state of art technologies in network and communication area. The most attractive is that it provides thoughtfully designed laboratory projects which are very useful to get hands-on experiences.

What to be learned from this book can be utilized in a real world environment easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I have ever used!","review":"The book does not have enough solved problems (only a few but do not have any good explanation anyway).

Andy is a very underrated guitarist.This CD is the least interesting of Andy's works. It is very uneven in quality and worse yet, the production thins out Andy's normally rich tonality.

These 21 individuals all started from scratch and are now doing what they love to do. They are no longer working at a job that they can lose.The first story deals with a woman who worked in coorporations. After she lost one coorporate job, she decided not to go back. She didn't want to have a job that could be taken away from her so easily. So she started her own business: selling hard-to-find shoes from Italy. She used her home as her place of business, then finally found a place closer to town.I especially like the author's HUNT method. Here's what HUNT means:Harness what you have.Underestimate your obstacles.Notice your network.Take the first step.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is sick of their job and want to do what they love.Brandon Simpson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously shallow","review":"Frankly, this is NOT a book. It is a collection of nonsense by a young man apparently aspiring to be a public speaker. To get more jobs and to raise your fees, to have a published book obviously helps. I am sure this nonsense will help the author. But if you are a person who is looking for some serious insight into entrepreneurial process skip this book under all circumstances. In fact don't even consider reading a single page.

I would reccomend this book to anyone who has an interest in Vietnam's people and their way of life. Coffey's account of her trip with her husband is so amazingly well written that the reader really gets to take the trip with her. Three Moons in Vietnam is a book you will laugh and cry with but most of all it will give you a new perspective of a country and the lifestyle of it's people that is misunderstood by many."},{"rating":"1","title":"A naiive and annoying book: read at your own risk","review":"I've just read this very naiive book on Vietnam by a Canadian couple who tried to travel around Vietnam in the mid '90s, without proper permits or planning, on boats. With typical Western arrogance, the couple showed complete disregard, ignorance and disrespect for the laws and customs of the country they were visiting and, as you would expect, got nowhere and ended up bussing and cycling most of the way from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The book is an interesting insight into the \\"backpacker\\" psyche but very annoying as they put lots of people at risk helping them and getting them out of the messes they got themselve into, and they come across as incredibly stupid and naiive. The book's called \\"Three Moons in Vietnam\\", read it if you get the chance but on no account buy it, it wouldn't do to encourage these people financially in their stupid pursuits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Nice Tribute","review":"This is one of the most original tributes or publications on Pope John XXIII I have ever seen. It contains four lovely little hardcover books with the following titles:FaithEulogiesWisdomWitThe four books are enclosed in their own little slipcase.

They are very fun little books to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on an older RS114 model","review":"I never liked the remotes that originally came with our RS114 remote starter. So when I saw this I knew I wanted to try it. As another person had commented, these remotes work perfectly with the older unit. Programming was very easy. On the RS114 you hold the brake through the whole process and just hold the start button on a working remote until you hear the parking lights flash once. Then push the stop button on the new remote. If it worked the parking lights flash 3 times which you'll hear from the relay clicking. Let off the brake and you're done. I like the rubberized finish on these remotes and they're easy to hold. My only real complaint would be the size of the unlock button which is really small and hard to push."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent range; 400 - 500ft","review":"Its been a year this product is with me and its still works wonder.

The author gives us a wonderful premise - a talented artist has somehow created a musical conduit between the real and the realm of the Sidhe when she paints, and then goes absolutely nowhere.Perhaps I should have been forewarned when the author wrote in his acknowledgments (\\"Author's Note) that \\"Despite the title, there is little actual music in this book.\\" What you've got is a soupcon on Celtic fairy overlaid on a fairly average romance - of the Harlequin variety. The author should have also noted that \\"Despite the presence of fairies, there is very little magic in this book.\\"Not particularly well written or particularly poorly written, just average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Zipper Pulls - Broken Handle","review":"This bag has protected my 17\\" laptop very well (so far). The telescoping handle is nicely designed. The shoulder strap is very comfortable. Plenty of room. On one flight I used the plane-side check-in, when the bag was returned the rubber handle was broken (the bag wasn't overly heavy, I am amazed that it could be broken). So the broken handle joined virtually all of the zipper pulls which have broken over time. I suppose I will have to buy something to replace the pulls, and maybe there is an adhesive stronger that the original rubber in the handle (doubt it), but for the price of the bag it has not faired well over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensale Information.","review":"Many collectors and enthusiasts are reluctant to \\"waste\\" money on books.

Then, he thought it was neat that he could write, then erase want he just wrote & he viewed it as a \\"big-boy\\" toy. Shortly after he turned 4 years old is when he picked it back up & really started using it. He is 4 1/2 now & knows the alphabet to letter N, with the help of this toy-- but it's really more than a toy; it's a teacher also. The voice is very clear to understand. My son is rough on his toys & this one still works great after 1 year, so yes, it's durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"My 2 year-old LOVES this toy! He's too young to write the letters, but he is learning to spell and knows the alphabet VERY well and I think this toy is part of the reason. I find it pretty loud and the repetitive phrases are annoying, but I think that it's because he plays with it so much. I would not have expected him to love this toy so much at this age, but he has really enjoyed all of his Leap Frog toys, so I'm sold on them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, just one little problem.","review":"I bought this for my daughter last christmas. (She was five). She loves playing with it my only complaint is that if she is having problems finding a letter or writing it correctly the machine gives one or two prompts then begins shutting off which got a little frusturating even for me. Other then that I feel it is a very useful tool. Very educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son's Favorite Toy","review":"I let my son play with this by himself and now he recognizes ALL of his letters by site, can write most of them and is so proud of himself. He even knows the sounds they make and can spell at least 10 three letter words. My son just turned 4. We are amazed and wanted to recommend this toy to other parents.The only improvement I think should happen is the writing area should be larger and more durable. Currently it is too small for little hands and scratches very easily.Overall this is a great learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but could be made better","review":"The concept of this toy is a great idea for children not only learning their letters, but also learning to write their letters. However we were disappointed because this toy broke twice! Finally had to throw it out. The slider to clear the written letters broke first but my husband was able to fix it. Eventually, the whole slider broke again and the writing of letters was useless. Then the letters start not to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good phonic Toy to learn your abc's","review":"I liked this phonic toy, Great for learing the alphabet. The only thing i didn't like is having the child write the letter on the screen and then push leap frog and hear \\"Great job\\" when the toy don't know if the child wrote the right letter. THE voice on the toy is great and very clear, it a good toys for beginers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great learning fun","review":"i bought this toy about two years ago and I still haven't had to change the batteries! my three year old son LOVES to play with this and spends a lot of time practicing his letters. well worth the money. very durable and i too love that there are no pieces to lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Children one Leap writing pad.","review":"My husband brought this toy for my two year old stepson almost five years ago and he loved it. He the moved in with his mom and it was than passed on to my first child at the age of two and she then passed it on to her younger sister and both of them can write and spot lots of three letter words. I RECOMMEND this product to all parents for thier child it is fun and last a very long time. My only problem was that the two girls fought over it all time. It is easy for children to handle and play with alone. If you want extra quiet time buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"Both of my sons love this but only my older son learn from this. My younger son was too little (only 2 1/2 year) to get anything out of this toy. So the child has to be at least 4 to 5 to learn from this toy. The writing area is very fragile so be careful with that or the pigment will not show up once it's destroy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational toy!","review":"I like this toy because it teaches children how to write the letters. It has a screen that they write the letter on and then you use a lever to erase that letter so you can begin to write the next. It also encourages learning how to spell words. Great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son loves this toy...","review":"We bought the phonics writing desk for our son (then 4 yrs old) a year ago and he still loves it today. He takes it to bed with him every night to use between bedtime and \\"lights out\\" time. It is fun, educational, and very durable. I operate a home daycare and this toy is used all day. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for under 3","review":"I bought this toy at a garage sale thinking it was too advanced for my 22 month old twins. I thought it might get them a little more familiarized with their ABC's. To my surprise, one of my girls had her ABC's learned in no time. She spent days on end playing with it. One day while coloring I starting writing letters, and she was naming them all. My other daughter has a short attention spane and she has even picked up on several of the letters. It will certaily grow with them. I'll probably purchase a new one soon, as the writing area has seen better days. Other than that, it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC's, Phonics, Writing...it covers them all","review":"This is one of the best phonics learning toys I've seen to date. It has different levels that allows the Phonics Writing Desk to 'grow' with a child. It's helped my 4-year-old son identify letters (upper and lower case), associate them with their sounds, it demonstrated the 'blending technique' that allowed him to sound letters out to make short, three-letter words. There is a quiz section, and an opportunity for him to combine his choice of letters to make words. The LCD display actually shows the letter as it is being electronically 'printed', so it was easy for him to follow and print it on the magnetic writing window.After about 2.5 years of almost daily use, the writing window does show a bit of normal ware, but it has proven to be a very durable, well-made product. It has become my gift of choice for 3 to 5-year-olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A++ for learning ABC's","review":"I purchased this toy for my four year-old and it is her favorite over the Barbie dolls or other non educational toys. This phonics writing desk teaches you upper and lower case letters of the alphabet, the phonic sounds, a spot to write the letters and even start writing three letter words as its highest level. The writing desk also quizzes your child and if she gets stuck, the help button gives her a hint. Best yet, there is a volume control button on the back! It has pleasant sounds for correct answers and silly, razzing sounds for incorrect ones. It's the best purchase I made for my child and she has so much fun without realizing that she is being taught. Best 30 dollars I ever spent. My next purchase will be Leap Frog's electronic reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAP FROG UNRELIABLE IN MANY WAYS","review":"I am here to let all you moms know..if you buy a leap frog toy and it does not work..DO NOT SHIP IT OUT OR HAVE THEM SEND YOU A NEW ONE..I SENT OUT MY 4 YR OLD SONS PHONICS DESK and i never got it back untill i called corporate and they are sending it back next day air.Leap Frog will never see my business again..PLEASE BE AWARE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't rec'd. item","review":"I've been waiting for this item for almost one month.

This toy is wonderful because my son is hearing the letter (in a very clear, easy to understand voice) as he presses the letter shape on the leapfrog desktop. The toy then displays the upper case and lower case versions of the letter he just pressed in the small screen. After that the small screen demonstrates how to make the lower case version of the letter. The toy has a writing window with an attached \\"pen\\" so my son is able to write the letters (or words for the more advanced levels of games) which is great \\"hands on\\" practice for what he is seeing and hearing. The higher levels of this toy work on letter sounds and spelling short 3 letter words. We're going to buy him his own this weekend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring to a Five-year-old","review":"Because it's marked \\"3-7 years\\" and becasue the other reviews sounded good, we bought this for our five year old. Mistake! Our child was not interested. The toy is really geared to much younger children (maybe ages 3 or early 4?). Our child was bored with it right out of the package, and it was way less than educational for this age group. We tried to give it away, but the other kids we knew didn't like it, either. (They were all older 4s and younger 5s.) Warning: This is a waste of money for 5 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devin's mom","review":"My son recieved this toy for his 5th birthday and simply won't put it down. He practices his letters, spells his three letter words and phonics. I can honestly say it has motivated him in a way I couldnt to get him to read. It even has a section for him to practice writing three letter words. Its a great toy and is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"My son is 2 1/2 and he may be a little young for the Writing Desk. He seems to lose interest pretty quickly but I can see that it's going to be useful to him as he gets older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful For learning to write","review":"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old as she has learned to write most of the letters in upper case. This toy helps her learn to write lower case and even start writing short words with phonics. The toy is very helpful because it shows the child exactly how to write the letter and then lets them try. It also has an erase button that actually erases the whole screen, not like some that leave the screen darker. Highly recommened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is great and super educational","review":"My 3 year old twins received this for Christmas and they love it.

They both absolutely LOVE this toy. The 3 year old, who was already good with her alphabet, has been spelling three letter words on it, and even the 1 1/2 year old just loves playing with it. However, although my kids (especially the young one) beat up on their toys (whose kids don't???), the frog, which erases the magnetic screen, broke within the first two weeks, and now after another month and a half, it's starting to make static noises every so often. Still, though, I am buying another one, which should be a testament to how great I think this toy is for both of my kids. It's also teaching me a lesson in the value of disciplining my children when they start throwing toys..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some drawbacks","review":"Just a couple of drawbacks with this toy. First, in the spelling game, it's more fun for a child to pick the wrong answers because the toy makes a large variety of very funny sounds whenever the child chooses the wrong letter. If the child chooses the right letter, the toy's response is a very boring, \\"That's right,\\" or something like that. Secondly, and not so serious, there's no option to just hear the sound of each letter. With every single letter the toy asks the child to write the letter. In the phonics portion of the toy it would be more appropriate to state a word or two that begin with the letter rather than ask the child to spell the letter. The toy doesn't state any words at all in the phonics part. It is rated as suited for children 3 and over and I would agree--it is not suitable for a 2-year-old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanny's Opinion","review":"Gave this to my four year old granddaughter. I watched her for a while and saw it really was not what I was looking for since the writing area was too small for beginning writers. Also it takes too long a time to go from step to step. My granddaughter liked to hear the sounds of the letters, but did not like writing them on a very small space and this was discouraging to her. I would make it more a writing toy by writing on a larger area and leave off some of the sounds. My experience is all of my six grandchildren enjoy more learning toys with actual hands on and less having to listen to the toy for \\"instructions, correct and incorrect\\" and also trying to figure out what the toy \\"said\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great potential but one major complaint","review":"My son just received this toy for his third birthday. We were amazed to find him sitting at the table, pen in hand, following the toys directions for writing letters. What a great tool! He also repeated the letter sounds and had fun with the toy.I have a major complaint though. My son found the game that tests letter recognition. The problem is that it makes very silly sounds when he gets a wrong answer and barely congratulates a right answer. The result is that he's virtually lost all interest in anything but that letter recognition game so he can AVOID the right letter and listen to all the silly sounds. I'm very disappointed in this so far but hope that the novelty wears off and he again decides to use the toy for its intended purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational tool for younger ages (3-5yrs)","review":"My son received this as a gift and I found it great!

Very clear.","review":"Aquinas is one of those figures who I know that I should know something about, but his writings are (far too) long and complicated. This book provides an excellent and serious introduction to Aquinas's thought--and one that is also very funny. The book covers topics like Aquinas' views on God, abortion, sex, and war, and it shows how Aquinas shaped our current attitudes.

Under 2 year warrantry delivered on Poulon's instructions to local repair shop. Got a call after 3 weeks - engine seized and useless - oil problem - not covered by warrantry. Explained that I only used Poulon two stroke oil - repairer said he had known of machines seizing even with correct oil/gas mix and that he would contact Poulon.

It seems the gasoline intake tube is now only 1/2 inch long. Why? because the rest of the tube has been eaten away into a semi congealed mass of goo from sitting in the gas/oil mix.

Would run slower at no choke.Whenever the weather got cool. I am guessing around 50 degrees or lower, the pull cord return would not work properly. As it got colder, the return was less. That left me to try to start it with a partial pull.Last week, I witnessed what several other people have with this model. It started as usual. Ran for a while and quit without warning. I checked the gas and it was OK. Haven't been able to start is since. No sign of life at all.

I purchased one from Lowe's and the cord would not retract so I took it back. Lowe's exchanged it and I was able to get the second one started, but discovered several flaws. It blows CO2 exhaust directly into your face when used to suck up leaves. The nozzle always gets jammed with leaves due to the cone design. I bought it because of the advertised 460cfm power but it does not seem to have much power. It is so heavy when used to suck up leaves, it made my back hurt. The back design vents up not horizontal, so leaves tend to jam, and you have to have a screwdriver to remove the blade cover once you remove the nozzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a couple years","review":"Like many others here mine worked fine for about 2 years.

After using it an hour or so,I went to refill the gas again but it would not stay running when I pressed the throttle. I fought and fought with it but could not keep it running. I happened to look down at my coat and realized the blowervac had burnt a hole about 4 inched in diameter in my coat and melted the gloves and ear plugs that were in the pocket!!!! I am taking this peice of junk back,calling to company to make a claim for reimbursement of my coat and will never buy a Puolan Pro again. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent for 2 yrs, then DOA.","review":"Liked just about everything about this blower for 2 seasons, (with the exception of the stupid 40:1 gas:oil ratio that means you have to keep yet _another_ gas can of 2-stroke around as opposed to using the more normal 50:1). Yes, was definitely loud, and vibrated a decent bit, but most importantly, it did a great job of moving those leaves!Unfortunately, here we are in Yr 3, and after only 2 seasons of what I would consider very light use, (i.e. perhaps 2 days @ 3-4 hrs / day / yr - so a grand total of 16 hrs of usage) it's entirely dead, and not worth investing the money in to get it working again.Since I'm sure I can do better than spending $50/yr, will _not_ be purchasing this unit again, (heck, I can hire a guy to come and do it for me for cheaper than that!) and would suggest you look elsewhere, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is the first time I've ever taken the time to write a review online so please take note.

I always insured that the oil mixture was 40:1 or better. So I didn't fear the piston seized, unfortunately it did. So I started shopping for it's replacement here on Amazon and read the poor reviews about this blower. Figuring I had nothing to lose, I removed the sparkplug and sprayed a lot of WD40 into the cylinder. I let it sit overnight and I still could get the engine to turn over by pulling the rope starter. As a last resort I stuck a long screwdriver into the spark plug hole and tapped the piston with a hammer. It worked! The engine fired right up. It smoked badly for a few minutes while burning off the WD40, but it runs great.

I used it about 15 minutes a week from April-October which works out to about 8-10 hours/year. I bought it because I really liked the vacuum feature and although it does not mulch as well as advertised, it worked great for my needs for the first year. The second year the carburetor & fuel lines became loose and leaked fuel which was a recurring problem. The third year the cylinder block cracked. The cost for parts/repair was greater than a replacement (and I wasn't going to buy another), so it ended up in the garbage after approximately 25-30 hours of use.

My wife couldn't start this thing even after I had it running, no way, no chance. Now in its third year the sucker is done and done. It began losing power and quickly declined until the motor gummed up. I have fixed up a gummed up motor on an old Saab and Yamaha boat engine, and I know not to even bother with this thing, not worth the time, money, or efforts to fix it...this puppy is shot. No doubt it is built for a planned death after x number of hours. That is what you get these days, a cheap price, and a machine you'll replace in 3 years.

She makes it sound like non-Christians cannot have morals or look beyond people's surfaces.As an agnostic, I can safely say that this is not true... in one of these books, Caitlin needs to learn the social lesson that all people are basically the same, with feelings, thoughts, and morals, even if they are different than hers. She needs to grow up. She's 17, for Zeus's sake!(This book is just so... urgh. )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"This is the second book in one of my favorite serises. Caitlin is a real girl who with real problems. I did think that the author talked about dating a little to much. She made it sound like dating or liking a boy was a sin against God.

This was still a very good book and I am looking forward to reading the nest one in the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It is so good! It is about a teen named Catlin and her friends and the problems they encounter. yeah, that doesn't sound different from other books but it is.

I went through highschool as an athlete so I never thought twice about working out. When I graduated I put on about 15lbs and finally I got the tapes I had heard about in one of my college classes. I was amazed I thought nothing could make me sweat as much as my highschool coach but boy was I tired, and that was after the introductory work out!! I have been doing this everyday for approx 2wks and I feel much better, I have not lost any weight but I know I look better already and cannot wait until I get the other video's, trust me on this one thing : YOU WILL FEEL BETTER AFTER THE VERY FIRST WORKOUT!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energizing!!!","review":"I can't wait to get home to start my workout.

I have been using it now for about 2 weeks and I cannot begin to describe the feeling of empowerment. When Billy Blanks says \\"Be Strong\\" it just makes me work harder. Its a fast and intense workout and not for everyone. But for someone like myself who likes working out hard and fast its great. I have noticed a real change in my body. Also I now can throw a punch, left and right hook like a man! And that alone was worth theprice of the video. Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard for most !!!!","review":"The exercises are a bit hard to do even for an exercise buff like me. It demands that we have a very flexible body.

It is the first workout tape I've ever gotten that I have actually used more than just a couple of times. I look forward to doing it because it makes me feel so good. I have lost weight and my clothes fit better, plus I feel energized and powerful. It's fun to pretend I'm bashing out all my aggressions when I'm doing the boxing moves.

The warm-up neck exercises doesn't feel safe at all, the workout is definitively not easy on your back, and after the most intense routine of the basic workout, he drastically tries to bring you to a cool-down; and to top it all, the music (! ) is B-A-D. This is just a well-advertised, potencially harmful workout. The idea seemed good, but the reality isn't. I don't know Billy's credentials, but it really looks like he believes that because he can do some Tae Kwon Do, he is qualified to design a workout. Well, seems like he's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Kudos!","review":"Billy Blanks seems like a sincere and likeable guy, but he still has a lot to learn about delivery and cueing.

The advanced workout is really great and takes some willpower to keep going.

I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's changed my life","review":"The tapes are fantastic. Billy gives you the challenge and when you take it, you find out it's not hard at all. The movements are simple and it's a great workout. I use the 8 minute video before and/or after work and feel like I've spent 1 hour in the gym. You really can't go wrong buying these tapes. It's addictive....but it's a good addiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent motivational workout!!!","review":"Billy Blanks is awesome!! I have tried alot of different aerobic workouts, but this is the most intense workout I've done. If you order the tapes from the infomercial, you also receive a 55 minute advanced workout, which I highly recommend! I think it is money well spent! Try it and you will be amazed. I heard that Taebo burns 700 calories an hour! I believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy them from the infomercial.","review":"Tae-bo is as addicting as everyone says, however, here you only get the basic workout. You must order the set from TV to get the ADVANCED tape! As far as I know you have to buy the tapes as a set, so if you buy these tapes(without the advanced tape)there is no way to get the advanced tape. This is important because the basic tape is a good workout, but the advanced tape is where the real magic takes place. The advanced tape makes the basic tape seem likes childs play, so if you want great, not merely good results, spring for the 4 tape set on the tv ads with the advanced tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The work out is not long enough","review":"I was extremely dissapointed in the Billy Blanks Tae Bo video set. The cardio section of the work out is not long enough for a good heart rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected. Prepare to be let down.","review":"I eagerly anticipated receiving my Tae Bo video and popped it in as soon as I got it. I don't see where it is anything special. I had a hard time following it, and I guess I was expecting more. Not only was I somewhat let down, I also am experiencing extreme neck and shoulder pain which I attribute to this workout. I followed the instructions as closely as possible, paced myself,and did the warm up and cool downs. Unfortunately, something went wrong because I just returned from my doctor where I needed to get some muscle relaxers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype, this is overrated.","review":"Although fun and fast-paced, this workout video is not based on sound fitness moves and may cause injury to joints and muscles, especially knees.

I do agree that 17 minutes is a short workout and I would like to try the advanced workout. However, through Amazon, and other retailers, you can only get the instructional, basic and 8 minute workouts. Hopefully soon the advanced workout will be available because the basic isn't enough anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tae Bo is better by another instructor.","review":"I have seen three of Billy Blanks' tapes. The Instructional video should simply be included on the Basic tape. Billy should also invest in a professional DJ for his staff. The workout class needs to go through the routine more than once before they tape it, Billy needs to speak up and Billy should also think about doing the routine, instead of going around the class.I really like Tae Bo, however it is a lot more productive when working with another instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I bought this video casstte because of the informerical I saw on TV. Yeah, it looked pretty cool and seeing the \\"stars\\" doing Tae-Bo, that motivated me in trying out this tape. The thing that disappoints me the most was the corny music. The music sucks. Here's what I do to escape this torture. I turn off the volume and put on my own music (usually techno and hip hop). After that, then the whole workout is ace! This is one of the best workout videos that I have and hopefully someday, I will actually do the workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think of quiting, you'll think again!!!!!!!","review":"If your looking for a new, great, fun, and different way to work out I definetly would recommend Tae Bo. It isn't like anything I have ever heard of before. While doing the video, your so excited that the blood rushing throughout your body doesn't alow you to stop. Something inside of you makes you want to finish the whole video. The steps are fun and easy to follow, so give it a try because it's the new way to a fit body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do it for fun","review":"I am only 16 years old . I am not trying to lose weight or get in shape. My friends and I do the tae-bo video together every weekend .

It is a good way for us to spend our time together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super work-out. Burns the fat.","review":"Billy Blanks has nailed the workout crowd with this fun and motivational session. Yes, the music leaves a lot to be desired, but it's the results I like.

Send us more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good work out tape","review":"I remember seeing Tae Bo infocomercials on late night t.v. and thinking I would never do that.. But my friend Jen really wanted to do it.. So we bought the first two tapes.. And the tapes were really good and the thing I liked about it was that they make it easy to catch on quickly.. But the first time we did Tae Bo, we must of kicked each other soo many times! lol but you do get the hang of it, and it was fun too. It's a good work out.. but if you really want to benefit from it.. it's good to be by yourself.. because it's really easier to concentrate more.. But it's fun when you have a friend, because when you make mistakes.. you can just laugh about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"I was an exercise-hater until a friend told me to try this. Without going into a long story - I've lost over 50 pounds, and I give a lot of the credit to the video since it got me moving. I never even did the instructional video since I borrowed the tape, and it was still easy. At first I did everything really low-impact, and as I got stronger, I picked up the pace. The video grew with me, so to speak.No, the set and the music and the video quality aren't up there with Kathy Smith or others, but Blanks is a good instructor and isn't intimidating to someone who has logged a lot of couch time (i.e., myself)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I bought the first two Tae-Bo tapes after seeing several Tae-Bo infomercials, and I am soooo disappointed! The people on the infomercials make it sound like the best workout ever, and maybe it is for some people, but I didn't like it at all. The movements were awkward, done too fast, and done too many times in my opinion. Not only do they move too fast to begin with, but there are several spots in the second tape where Billy Blanks yells \\"Double-Time, go!\\" and they move at fast-forward speed. How can that be safe? After doing Tae-Bo, I felt the soreness in my back and knees, NOT in my muscles. Tae-Bo might be great for somebody who is buff like Billy Blanks, but I think I'll stick with aerobics and yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"I wanted a different way to do cardio instead of the standard aerobics. This video is not alot of jumping around but using other methods to get your heart rate up like kicking your legs and punching which really works up a sweat! Personally, I don't like alot of jumping in my exercise which is why it works for me and will probably work for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE BILLY!...","review":"I adore these workouts!! I just started and within 2 weeks saw and felt a HUGE difference. I had a baby a year ago and had a little trouble getting off this extra 10, but now.....wooooo hoooooo.

We started with the Instructional then the 8-minute one, then the basic ,then the advanced. The advanced is so much fun! It goes so fast and I can even keep up with it!

Before Billy, I would work out at the gym about three times per week and that was just not getting the job done. I ordered Billy Blanks from the infomercial (by the way, now just go to Target, they are carring the tapes that way you don't have to wait 4 weeks for them). I started doing the workouts early in the morning before the whole work-school routine. And WOW! Let me say that in the three weeks that I have been doing his tapes I have more energy, I feel stronger and I am seeing results! This video has given me the modivation and self-confidence that had been lacking due to a hectic schedule. Use Billy Blanks and you will see the results.

I was wrong. Even aftertaking it slow and carefully practicing the moves for 4 sessions, I ended up getting a pretty severe hip injury. The super-fast mode that he jumps into on the kicks is nuts! It's not something that should be recommended for any beginners. Throughout the videos there is little advice on safety, form, and injury-avoidance. And I just didn't find him that \\"inspirational.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Some safety concerns","review":"I have been doing Tae Bo for several months, and I find it to be very effective, and much more fun to do in the morning than a run. However, I would like to pass on some concerns. People should be very careful when doing the neck stretches shown in the beginning. Please bring your head to the neutral position in between side to side or back to front moves. Don't go straight from one side to the other without pausing in the middle- you could cause injury to your neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit whining and do it!","review":"Most of the people saying they don't like the video, are those who aren't motivated enough to do it. Only you can do the workout, it's only a video. I personally enjoyed it. As for the knee problems, both of mine have been previously injured, and I have no problems even though I am overweight by 75 pounds. Those who are having problems are not doing it correctly or have no business doing high impact workouts. Anyone with a set of lungs and a healthy body can do it! The rest are excuses not to workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT GETS THIS SLUG BUG MOVING!!!!!","review":"Thanks to Billy Blanks I am no longer a slug bug, I started tae-bo in february a little more than a month ago and I have gotten more compliments on my body toning, starting after the first week!...I used to sit around all day and watch TV about at least eight hours straight in one day, I popped in the tape saw billy and the crew do the moves and I was like \\"That looks easy,\\" I tried it, I am addicted to getting in shape the tae-bo way, and it's not too fast or too slow...it's given me energy and sometimes on impulse I find myself throwing out a right hook...I'm telling you people...it is well worth money and with the eight minute work out tape well worth the time...GET IT! I am not in any way getting paid for this I am just a regular person living a normal lifestyle, and now thanks to Billy, I am more energized...and to those who thinks Tae-Bo is overrated...I challenge you to put your fitness where your mouth is and TRY IT!!!

I was extremely dissappointed. First of all, it is supposed to be \\"Basic\\". If that was \\"Basic\\", then I really would hate to see what is considered \\"Advanced\\". It wasn't that the moves were too hard, but it was higher intensity than other \\"Basic\\" tapes I have followed. Secondly, the workout was incomplete.

I can't kick as high as the girls on this tape and it is still hard to finish the tapes, but that okay because Billy Blanks says go at your own pace. His constant reminder on how to hold your stomach in and how to hold your body is needed to feel the burn. I've been using these videos for a month and I just added the 8-minute video to my daily routine. I have lost 6 pounds all ready without major changes in my diet. I love these videos and I know you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the tapes -- Tae Bo is a Great Workout","review":"Being a guy, I never really felt comfortable doing aerobics, although these tapes are different. There are poblems with the set, the music, and Blanks often makes you do more sets on one side than the other because he's always talking. However, the workout you get is extremely fun and you will sweat like never before. After switching to the advanced tapes, I became instantly aware of muscles I did not know existed before. If you follow the instructional tapes, you will not get hurt, and if you can stomach the bad music and even worse set, you will definitely lose weight and inches off your waist. I have been doing the workouts 3-4 times a week now for three months, and have lost 25 lbs. and 4 inches off my waist. I am now just slightly above my ideal weight, and owe much of it to these videos.

I took to doing everyday, and it was rather tough getting through it because of the music. To me, music just makes or breaks the workout, but honestly I caution everyone that if you have had back injuries, or if you are not well coodinated then please find another workout -- a safer workout. I ruptured a disc in my back over 9 months ago during this Tae Bo advanced workout, and the road to recovery has been long. I don't know that I will ever be the same after this injury. I caution everyone to think twice about this tape. The speeds are much too fast, and the neck movements are really dangerous too -- if you don't rupture a disc, I guarantee you will end up breaking your neck. What was Billy thinking? He had the right approach in mind, but honestly, he shouldn't have made claims that he couldn't follow through with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tae-Bo is all Hype","review":"THIS WORKOUT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! I REPEAT, THIS WORKOUT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! I have trained in kickboxing and sparred. I bought the Tae-Bo tape to compliment my endurance and training. I used it twice. This work-out is extremely bad for the lower back. The speed combined with the number of repititions of some of the kicks are both hazdouse and would NEVER be used in kickboxing,BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE INJURY. The neck exercises are dangerous and the short warm up and cool down do not stretch the necessary areas to help prevent injury. I cannot urge you enough to disregard all the hype this video has created and find another kickboxing video for your use.

They are disappointing. The music is awful, Billy is almost impossible to hear, and the set is LOW budget. The TAEBO workout is fun, but there is very little variety in the moves provided on the Basic tape, which quickly becomes routine. As someone has already mentioned in the reviews, the instructional tape is a waste, in that you will watch it once, maybe twice, and never again. I am hoping that when the \\"bonus\\" 8 minute workout arrives, it will be an improvement. From the infomercials it looks like Billy has a fun and challenging class but it does not translate to these videos. I wish he would have just taped one of those classes and saved all of us a couple of bucks off this overpriced set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Time!","review":"Billy Blanks is a total freak! He says that this is a breakthrough in fitness and losing weight. It is more like a breakthrough in learning how to be bored. The music is awful-- garbage, if I must. He says that you'll feel better and stronger. The truth is, he starts sweating by just stretching his neck! The camera work is terrible. The moves are unclear. If you want to lose weight, scientific proof shows that by just smelling a green apple or banana works. I say it works a lot better than Tae Bo."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those with no martial arts experience, it's good.","review":"Maybe it's because I took martial arts in the past, but I was greatly dissapointed with the Tae Bo tapes I tried with friends. If you've taken martial arts before and you know how to execute the basic necessities, then the presentation of these punches, kicks, etc. leaves a lot to be desired. The basic video is an okay workout, but expects a lot of a person by way of standing kicks and doesn't have as much full body workout as I wanted. There were also one or two moves that were used in the basic video that weren't presented in the instructional video, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sick of seeing this infomercial","review":"If you want a good workout, don't fork over your money to buy this rip off of a video tape. Work out the old fashioned way: jog, lift weights, do pushups. You will get in much better shape doing that than Mr. Blanks might have you suspect doing his idiotic system of kicks and jumps. People are so gullible to spend their money on this rip off. No wonder that Mr. Blanks has to do his business out in California. After all, that's where all the phony weirdos live anyway, who are stupid enough to sign up for his classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as easy as they say","review":"I got the video and I will tell you, it takes some days to get use to the steps, I am thinking about shipping it back. First of all, I think it's because I am not really coordinated and it takes me a while to catch on. I feel like these are dance steps. Also you have to be very careful with this video, because you can really hurt yourself if you don't watch out, esp. your knee or foot. I think's its a bit too much for a novice. On tv it looks good and the steps flow so easy but for me this just wasn't the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am still fat","review":"I have been doing this video for a week now and I am still fat. This is not the miracle everyone is making it out to be. I guess I am just going to have to be happy with the body God gave me and stop complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I liked the tape for the first few days, but this low budget overpriced film left me wishing I'd put the 40 bucks towards a membership at the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I started exercising for the first time 15 mths after my first baby. This is not for beginners! I could hear my joints screaming in pain with every kick or punch. Eventually I stopped all together. I didn't think he did great at motivation either...he came off as cocky to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, now I really AM annoyed!","review":"Apparently Billy is leading these people to believe they can use this video to learn how to defend themselves! THIS IS NOT TRUE! To learn to defend yourself you need to learn proper scientific application, not just jumping around with flailing arms and legs! This is spaghetti! You are better off just taking a martial art! I mean, realisitically, if I want to practice punches and kicks to music while getting a good workout at the same time I do not need a tape to do it! That is if you know how to do them. I'll stick with Taiji(REAL Taiji, not that David Carradine stuff!). I think it ultimately will do a lot more good for you in a lot more ways than Tae Bo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I'm a second degree black belt in Taekwon-Do and I decided to try out Tae Bo and I didn't think it's that great. It's just like any other aerobics workout, but you need to know some basic skills that aren't really covered to get maximum efficeincy out of it. Also, it leads people into a false sense of security that they know how to defend themselves adequately when all they know is a few kicks. Tae Bo is just another fad, and if you want a real workout and learn how to truely defend yourself, try the more traditional martial arts like Taekwon-Do, Kung-Fu, Aikido, or whatever else is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decided not to buy the video!","review":"Thanks to all the REAL work-out pros, I have decided NOT to buy the Tae*Bo tapes. Seems the video is poorly made with bad audio, cheesy music, the workout is too short with not enough warm up/down, and Billy doesn't even do the work out himself, which is what I would want to see, or at least more full body shots of the movements, not of sweaty faces. So I thank all of you who were honest in your reviews. I will stick to my current FREE routine of weight training, push-ups and my BRISK daily 3 mile walk! I am happy to save the money and will spend it on a new work-out outfit instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Join the group!","review":"Billy Blanks is a rather militant and profitable venture that the Church of Scientology has undergone. I suggest that everyone buys this video, so as to escalate the profits of the Church's work, so that upon there ammassment of a substantial portion of global GDP, we can finally see a product of L. Ron Hubbards thought. Enough already with the 'Look Who's Talking' sequels. Someone please buy this book, or else the series will never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected!","review":"I see that there is potential for this work out. I'm in good shape and was looking for another type of work out. I just get warmed up and the tape ends. I don't think it lives up to its billing. If you're just getting started this may be a good start. Otherwise don't spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The power of infomercial","review":"Give me my money back Mr. Blanks. After seeing your infomercial on late night TV, I wanted to know more. Well, don't go any further. Record the infomercial , play it in loop and you will save $40"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't meet expectations","review":"I watched his infomercial, I read the reviews on this page, I checked out Mr Blanks' tae-bo web page and I bought the tapes. I'm not pleased with the product. Another reviewer mentioned the \\"his left/your right\\" error. This can be very frustrating initially. I imagine the actual class with Mr Blanks is great, but the tapes are over-priced and over-hyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have used Tae-bo and it is all a bunch of hype.","review":"I can not get over how stupid this whole Tae-bo thing really is. I have been using this workout for over 5 weeks now and I have noticed no changes whatsoever. I feel totally ripped off and have asked for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't shipped what I paid for","review":"I purchased the Tae-Bo workout Instructional and Basic VHS tapes and only received one tape in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not advanced enough if you're already in shape.","review":"I have had the tapes for a few months now. It is quite fun to do, but for someone who has been working out for years, even the advanced tape is not difficult enough. For beginners, the tape may be harmful if the moves are not performed properly. The tapes are far too short, also. Basically, I have given up on the tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Basic Vid is too basic, more punching upper body needed","review":"I am disapointed in this video, I thought I could really get a good sweat. I cant even hear his instrucitons on the video, the tapes are poor quality and he doesnt explain all the moves properly. Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but very short","review":"I recently started using the Tae-Bo tapes, but I am disappointed with the tapes. The instructional video is used ONCE, unless you forget how to do a move and refer to it; however, you won't forget a move if you use the work-out tape daily. The work-out tape is long enough to make you break a sweat and then it's time to cool down. You have to do the work-out tape TWICE if you want to see results. The work-out, as short as it may be, is a good one. However, it is worth it to go and buy a non-Billy Blanks Tae-Bo tape to get a longer work-out that is worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic","review":"After all the hype I heard about this video, I was extremely dissapointed. The actual workout video is only 30 minutes and very basic. I expected more for the amount of money I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout, but way too short!","review":"Tae Bo is not what I was expecting. The workout is good, but a little repetitive. The biggest downfall though, is it's total length, including warm up and cool down, is 25 minutes. Actual time for the aerobic workout is 17 minutes. Just when my heart is pumping and I'm sweating, it's over! I find that the Richard Simmons \\"Sweating to the Oldies 3\\" gives a better sustained workout. However, if it's one of those days when I don't have an hour to spare, it at least gets me moving! I suggest renting it first, to see if it's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please be careful","review":"I have trained in Martial Arts for 7+ years but have been out of training for about 5. I thought this would be a fun workout with a martial arts touch and it is. But if you have never had any training, please be careful. I spent years perfecting the kicks that TaeBo teaches in 30 seconds. I know how to move my feet to protect my knees. I also know that when the tape tells you to move in double-time, there is no way to have good form and move that fast - you could hurt yourself. I just keep moving the original speed. This goes for the punches and the kicks. If you have not previously trained in martial arts, go slow, listen to your body, and be careful. If your schedule permits, look for a good, traditional martial arts school - talk about a workout! Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun but beginning tape could be a little longer...","review":"For the most part, this workout video is awesome. It's easy to follow and really makes you sweat! However, the first tape seems a little short with only 18 minutes of actual aerobics. Although I haven't done the more advanced workout, I have viewed it and am definitely not ready for that intensity. Something in between would be nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's energizing and up-lifting.","review":"Billy Blanks Tae-Bo workout is the best video for the young and old.

It makes exercising fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Physical Education classes work & sweat to Tae Bo!!","review":"100 students in a middle school are working out and sweating to the Billy Blanks video on a huge projection video display on the gymnasium wall!! They love the workout, Billy is ,motivating and it helps to teach them about the components of health related fitness. We tie in heart rate monitoring and muscular labeling to make the students more health literate. It has been a great addition to my Physical Education classes. I'd be glad to give you more details of how we organize the class. We have a leadership program and other pointers to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, enjoyable workout that shows results!!!","review":"Tae-Bo is a great workout. Not only that, it is fun, enjoyable, and it shows you how to defend yourself. The only drawback is that it seems to really concentrate mostly on your legs and abs. It does work with the arms but mostly for your legs, abs, and buttocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only work out tape I will put in the VCR!","review":"I've tried the Denise Austin workout and the Buns of Steel Series and they don't even compare to Billy Blanks' Tae Bo. I look forward to the workout as does my husband. These tapes have even caught the interest of my friends and In-laws. I just wish you could buy the Advanced workout retail."},{"rating":"2","title":"TaeBo is the best! It is fun and energy packed!","review":"I have been a cheerleader and a dancer for a long time and I have done many aerobic and weight training programs but TaeBo is the best yet! It gives me tons of energy and leaves me feeling like I have really accomplished something. Billy Blanks really pushes you to the limits but makes it fun at the same time. TaeBo makes me feel confident and strong. The 8-minute workout is perfect for my busy schedule. It leaves me no room for excuses or procrastination. TaeBo is wonderful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Tae Bo!","review":"I have been doing Tae Bo now for 5 months. I have seen some differences in my body. Mostly just my waist I have tightened and toned. But regardless of the time it takes to get results I will keep doing it because you can't get something for nothing and getting in really good shape takes time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the most challenging but easy to follow video ever!","review":"I just received my tapes a few weeks ago and have found it to be the best workout video ever. It is very easy to follow but also an intense and challenging workout. I highly recommend everyone to try it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Beginner","review":"I bought my tapes from the TV ad, which include the Instructional, Basic, Advanced and 8-Minute workouts. I was a real couch potato looking for motivation. Billy pulled me right off the couch and onto my feet. It took me months just to get through the basic workout without wheezing. The set offered here are the instructional and basic. They're great for someone like me who exercised rarely or never because the pace allows you to advance your fitness level as you are able. I read some of the other reviews that think the workout isn't long enough or fast paced enough. They would be more satisfied with the Advanced, 57 minute workout. The Advanced video's toned athletes are sweating buckets and sometimes can't keep up! Unfortunately, it does not seem to be avaiable separately yet. However, if you need a slow buildup and a great motivator, Billy is your guy! By the way, I've progressed after four months to the advanced tape and I feel great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Workout","review":"Overall, I think Billy Blanks is great! However, I think he needs to get somebody else to produce his videos. The film quality is not very good. I agree with the reviewer who said the camera didn't focus on the moves enough (Basic video). The music is irritating, and more instruction needs to be given on knee and foot positions. I haven't been able to finish the instructional video because my feet keep hurting, but I don't know the correct positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too difficult - unless you're a pro kickboxer","review":"I was really excited about buying this tape and did it as soon as I got home! I am in pretty good shape and have to say that this tape is way too hard for the average person. The people are kicking way too high (we ARE supposed to follow them) and the rhythm is so fast that it's easy to pull a muscle or lose your balance. I suppose I burned calories because my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest. I think it's a pretty dangerous tape that gives far-too-little instruction for a far-too-advanced activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO said Tae-bo isn't so great!?","review":"The reviewer that complained of the basic Tae-bo not being so great for her must not have read the word BASIC on the tape. It's not supposed to be the heart-pounding, can't-catch-your-breath workout that Advanced workouts are. Billy's Instructional tape provides much-needed information, then on to the Basic workout, which is simply for STARTING a Tae-bo routine. I used Basic tape until I felt I could handle the Advanced, which I then moved on to. And, what a workout! Once you try the Advanced workout, you can't ever get enough of an advanced Tae-bo workout. The buns workout at the end of the Advanced tape is a killer (even the rest of the class is screaming)...I get bored very easily with workouts, and Billy Blanks' motivational comments and energetic personality keep me buying more (I said I get bored...) You can't lose with these workouts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Workout","review":"I'm certainly not a fitness maniac or terribly in shape, but this video barely gets my blood pumping. I think it is seriously overpriced for the content ( barely 20 mins of aerobic activity ) and is only beneficial to me when I'm not up for a real workout with one of my Kathy Smith step aerobic tapes. The movements are repetitive, and boring and he fails to inspire me at all. My boyfriend likes this video better than the step tapes because it is easier for him to keep up with and he doesn't feel \\"sissified\\" doing this tape. I think perhaps that the target audience would be the uncoordinated and the severly out of shape person who needs someone to show them basic moves to get them reintroduced to physical activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I started doing the basic Tae-Bo last March and since then have lost 56 lbs. and I have much more energy and basically just feel good. I think the money I spent on his tapes were well worth every cent. I have just started doing to advanced this week and I love it! I only have sore muscles and Tae-Bo is so much more fun than other workouts! If you do the exercises correctly, you shouldn't have a sore back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout, not so great tape quality.","review":"Effective and motivating..Billy Blanks has hit on something big.

To date, I have lost 15 lbs including many inches. I went from a size 8 to 4. This is the best workout I have ever done. I do belong to a gym, but have lost interest, all I have to do is hear the taebo music and I am ready to go. I am very dedicated to the program, I do the advanced tape 6 out of 7 days a week. If I could bottle my self discipline and determination and sell it, I would be rich. I am a 46 year old grandmother, thank you Billy Blanks, I have not looked this good since I was 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun!!","review":"I really enjoyed this work-out. I do however feel a bit mis-led with the two tapes. I think that the \\"instruction/practice\\" tape should have been combined with the actual \\"work-out\\" tape. Which would then only be one tape, maybe lowering the price. Which of course would not benefit Billy, but might make more people buy the tape...making it beneficial for everybody in the long run. I did the workout last night (with my family) and had a great time. It is very different than what I am used to. I plan to make it part of my regular exercise routine, combining with Jazzercise which is also very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the rest?","review":"I liked it a lot, however, how does one get hold of the advanced tape.

I was in better shape and more toned than I even had been in school. I recommend this to people all the time. It is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invigorating!","review":"I never thought that I would be interested in something like Tae Bo. I'm not one for watching the same work out tape over and over, but I truly feel like I get something out of the tapes each time I do it. Definately give this a chance, it was not easy at first, but if you stick with it, you'll feel great. I would advise not to do the Instructional tape any more than 3 times, it gets frustrating because you do not feel like you are doing it correctly. Learn how to do the moves safely and then jump into the actual work out.

It was fun and a good workout-- but for the wrong reasons. I found my heart pounding and my muscles aching as I laughed hysterically at Billy Blanks' antics. He would teach everyone how to do a move or two, do the moves for a few beats, then tell us to keep going as he would start groping the on-screen female participants while describing their muscles. I did not find it \\"inspiring\\" to watch Billy tell us to keep doing exercises while he stopped and took a moment to molest the on-screen women. And don't even get me started on the \\"double-time\\" sequences... I had no desire to frantically flail my legs and arms around in a frenzy while Billy shouted slogans at me. I'd like to keep my joints in their sockets for now, thanks. Skip these horrible videos and get yourselves to a gym!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this thing off the market!","review":"I found this video to be extremely boring...

Rent a Martin Scorsese movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so cheesy","review":"Dissapointing. Not a very good workout, and I just could not get pass how cheesy the whole thing was. The stage looked like it was slapped together real quick with bad lighting, women with lots of make up and bad workout gear, and Mr. Billy Blanks topped it all off with very 80s leotard/legwarmers that made it hard not to cringe. His interaction with the camera and with the women on stage, compounded with the bad music, was horrible. If it was a really good workout, maybe I could just ignore all these wierd elements, but it wasn't agood workout. Not at all. And I've had m share of kick boxing. Oh well. No more Billy Blanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"used more than once","review":"when reviewing the site it appeared the tapes had only been used once so I was expecting them to be in pretty good shape...they were obviously bought at a garage sale for 2.99 and sold to me at a much higher price.

What a great big disappointment! First of all, he is very uncoordinated and it's very difficult to keep up with him and all throughout the workout he tells you to exercise on the right side when he means left side and so forth. It is fine for the first couple of times, but after a while it gets to be very annoying, and if you're not paying attention you could get confused. This makes the moves quite difficult to follow. And half of the time I couldn't even understand what he was saying.

The basic workout is good for someone who is just getting into working out, because it is short and reasonably intense. I agree with other reviewers that the production quality and music could be improved!I have some comments in response to some of the other posts:1. Regarding the length of the basic workout -- if it isn't long enough, use the time function on your VCR, rewind it and do it again.2. So what if Billy doesn't mirror your moves? If you have trouble keeping the left-right instructions straight, start with one side then switch. Each set is separated with marching, and he consistently alternates sides. I really don't understand the big deal about this.One of the things I really like about this tape is that Billy shows the viewer how to modify the moves to suit someone who is just starting out. Between that and some common sense, I think most people can develop an exercise routine that fits their needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Sweat This One!","review":"This is a fast-paced, highly motivating video which demands you to take charge of your body by becoming aware of every muscle you own!

I was never a real exercise buff, but I needed to get into better shape, so I borrowed it from a friend, and now I'm hooked. I get mad if I can't to it that day. All you have to do is try it, learn the moves, and you'll get it. The advanced is tough, but it is for experienced people. I have tried it and I am working my way through it, a couple more minutes each time. I enjoy punching out all of my aggressions. It is also a great stress releiver, to punch, kick and yell really helps! I enjoy it soo much!

I love it. I have seen results in just that small amount of time. Billy makes it fun and do-able. Just remember that you need to keep it up. You will not achieve if you don't believe. If you are like me, you can and will think of any reason why you don't need to do this workout, but give yourself a chance to improve you body and mind. Thanks Billy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start!","review":"This is a great place to start. For someone who was used to being in great shape and then let children interfere with keeping myself in shape, this tape has brought me back off the couch. It could use more strength training, but everyone should know that one workout cannot possibly do everything you need. It is the first tape I have ever seen that has convinced me to do it everyday. As my fitness gets back to where it should be, the advanced workout will be a supplement. For those of you who complain about still being fat after a week of hard work, think about how long it took you to get fat!

Many may complain that it is only a 27 min workout, but hey we just rewind it and start over. I think it has increased the idea of excercising in the dorms throughout our college. Which I think is the number one reason of this videos popularity. The camera man focused too much on people's faces than on the bodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Tae'bo was really cool the first day. Now a month later it is sitting on my video shelf collecting dust. There are no quick fixes. If you hate exercise this will NOT cure you. It is still exercise. For those looking for a new routine it's fine, but it eventually turns into its very own routine. Be wary of the hype. Try before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couch Potato Glory","review":"Just another craze. It'll end up in the closet next to your Thigh Master and Buns of Steel tapes. If you want to get in shape take a real Kung Fu class and learn something useful while developing power, strength and discipline. Tae-Bo, what a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a fan of this video","review":"Although I have a large video workout library that's in regular use, I had never done kickboxing before and was curious to try it. I did the instructional video first, then the basic video. During the basic workout, Billy tells us not to attempt to kick too high if we can't do it, but I'm in decent shape and I *could* do it (not incredibly high, but about waist high). I even kept up with all of the \\"double time\\" segments and was moving right along with the umpteenth set of roundhouse kicks until I heard a loud *POP* coming from my right upper leg/glute area, followed by pain and swelling of the joint in that region. I'm healing quickly, but I will not be doing anymore Tae-Bo (luckily, it was just a rental). Instead, I purchased Kathy Smith's kickboxing video which, in my opinion, is a far superior (and MUCH safer) intro to the kickboxing workout. I gave the Tae-Bo video two stars only because of the good-sore feeling I had in my upper back muscles the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't WasteYour Money!!!","review":"I have an extensive home library of workout videos..I bought this because of all the \\"hype\\"...I hated the workout and i use the term 'workout' very loosely...billy blanks - motivational - not quite!! I could barely understand him, never mind get motivated by him. Skip these videos and try a \\"Firm\\" tape instead, then you'll see real results without the risk of throwing out your back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst aerobic workout Ive ever experienced","review":"I can honestly say that Tae Bo is the worst aerobic workout Ive ever had. I am used to doing high intensity step-aerobics and to move on to Tae Bo was to put it bluntly, a dissapointment. If you are even remotely at the advanced level, this tape, which is only 27 minutes long, will hardly put sweat on your brow. My recomendation, save your money on this rip-off and write off Billy Blanks and his poor instruction, terrible set, too low audio, and shiny spandex jump-suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for most people","review":"While this tape (basic) can make someone sweat there is too much potential for harm. I have been training in a martial art for seven years (I hold a brown belt) and I cannot believe that someone without any formal training could possibly do these moves correctly without an instructor present to help them. Repeated attempts at doing these movements can and will injure many people's knees, ankles, and lower backs. Tae-bo will NOT teach anyone self defense, it will merely teach you enough to get yourself into trouble. If it's defense you want to learn, sign up for a real martial arts class. If you know some martial arts and how to do the stances already, but need someone to suggest which moves to do in reps, ask your sensei."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like to have a nickel for every tape they have sold.","review":"I can't believe all the 5 and 4 star ratings. Obviously the people who love this tape have not seen any exercise vidoes in the last decade. There is no warm up to speak of, improper and poor cueing, poor choice of music that drowns out the audio and boy do they sweat. I feel taken. I have been doing exercise videos for the last 5 years and seen quite a difference in styles and production quality. This one has to be one of the worst. The workout may be fun but it is short and not the safest - especially for someone who is out of shape. I don't like to endorse major corporations but Billy needs some lessons from the people who produce professionals like Gin Miller. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are an avid exerciser, don't bother","review":"I've been exercising at home for over 10 years and was excited to add another tape to my collection. (I am a FIRM believer). The tapes were poorly choreographed and the music was lousy. The camera person focused way too much on Billy yammering about making it through the workout rather than focusing on the class. The warm-up was minimal yet all of the students were dripping in sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"There needs to be more.","review":"I attend a kick boxing class at my college gym so I bought the tapes to keep up with it over spring break. While the tape is very helpful at explaining techniques, it does not provide a workout that will make you sweat enough. The tape is very short, the music is terrible, and the pace needs to be picked up. For forty dollars, I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$$, good beginner workout","review":"I am a faithful \\"Firm\\" believer. I guess I must be in better shape than I thought because I found this workout to be too easy and too short. I agree with other commentators that there's not much for the money here. Try a Firm workout if you want to get in terrific shape. They are great for folks who have a hard time moving their arms and legs at the same time (like me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four and five stars? This is truly amazing!","review":"First of all true determination is not a fad, it is a way of life.It is something that has to come from within yourself. This workout is acombination of aerobics moves from 20 years ago, to advanced and carelessly executed Martial Art kicks. To me, that says let's go from one extreme to the other, with absolutely ZERO balance. BALANCE is what is needed to conduct a safe, effective, FUN and dynamic cardio class to the general public.

I am looking forward to including it in my work-out schedule. My only negative comment is the music - this is a fast paced positive work-out, could we not have some music that goes with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Video is fast-paced but too short in workout duration.","review":"Once the basic steps are learned from the instructional video, you'll never need it again. The workout video is to short in duration for those with an average or better fitness level. The set should include the advanced workout in a three tape set for a better value. Billy Blanks is a very motivational and talented instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll see results quickly! Really!","review":"I know the music is a little cheesy, but I hardly notice it because I'm too busy concentrating on perfecting my punches and kicks! I also usually do some extra warmups prior to beginning the tape, but I have to say that my waist and thighs are smaller after having used the tapes 3 times a week for about a month. It's a great way to supplement your other workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Couples Workout","review":"This is the first exercise or home workout program that my wife and I (both in early 50's) can do together, which really helps with the motivation.

It gives me a great 57 min workout. Although, the warm up is very short, but I've started warming up on my own and skipping his.

You end up actually sticking with it because you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"When I heard Billy Blanks say that Tae Bo made you want to do it because it was so fun, I thought it was another gimmick. Well, I do it every morning at 5:30 am before school and it is a great way to get the day started. I'm not sick of it yet and I'm definatly getting the advanced video! To any unsure person, let me say that you can feel the strength in your arms legs and abs. It's definatly worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I have been doing the basic and 8 minute tape for about 6 weeks now and I definitely see results. I am starting to get back into my old jeans again. I have to agree with others that the basic tape is just not long enough to get a good cardio workout so I do basic and 8 minute together which gives you about a 26 minute work out. I have reviewed the advanced tape and I still don't think that I am ready for that yet (too fast), but I am sure in a couple more weeks I will be ready. I was reading a writeup on Billy Blanks and it said that he is working on 16 new video tapes...I am really looking forward to trying some of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy, fun, and not time consuming","review":"I find this workout to be extremely energizing after a long day of work.

I believe there aren't adequate instructions on the specific moves. I have actually injured my hip during the legkicks.

I've seen lots of changes in my body ----- especially in my hips and thighs. I have moved onto the advanced tape which works more of your hips, your stomach, and makes you sweat like crazy. I think the instructional tape should be FREE! I watched it once and moved on. Thanks Billy! I feel great about myself again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tae-bo kicks it up!","review":"I recently purchased this video set because I've heard of all the hype it's been getting in the media.

This past semester they used this text for their introduction to biology course. The book is horrible compared to all the of the previous texts the school used: and that's not just my opion, the biology professors I talked to agreed. There are fewer images and diagrams than the other biology texts used over the years, and there are even missing or bearly convered key concepts.

Open it, and you can see where the pad that they cushion the tools with, had fallen off and they reglued it on, but in a different spot. So there's a strip of glue running down the lid. So far chisels seem ok for the price, but could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Set","review":"This 8-piece set of Benjamin's Best lathe Chisels is a great set for the beginning turner.The assortment is excellent. The heads are broad and the handles long. Each tool is well balanced.I find them very comfortable to use.While some experienced turners prefer Henry Taylor or Sorby chisels, for the beginner or casual turner, 40.00+ for a single tool is a lot to spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set for a beginner","review":"I am a beginner at woodturning and needed a moderately priced chisel set that I could learn with. This set meets my needs very well. I have used five of the eight chisels so far. They hold an edge reasonably well and I have been able to do some good turning with these tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Case","review":"I just received my tools today. When I opened the box I couldn't get it out in one piece because the case was falling apart! I had to laugh out loud. Now the tools look nice to me, but I am a rookie turner. They look real \\"Beefy\\" and are labled nicely with M2 HSS and the size in fractional inches. The edges look great and I can hardly wait to try them. (My lathe is on order)Right now the case is clamped and the glue is drying. It is a pretty nice case, just comes as a \\"kit\\". But I would have bought the tools without the case, so big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good after sharpening","review":"This set is nice and heavy, seems like a good deal, but make sure you sharpen the edges straight out of the box. I'm new to turning so at first I didn't know anything was wrong, except that people on TV seemed to cut through stock like butter, and I was struggling to round-out a square blank. I honed the blades a little with an eze lap paddle, and wow, the difference was like night and day. I don't know how long these chisels will hold an edge, but they are capable of very nice cuts. Also, there is some kind of coating on the steel that I removed with fine sandpaper before honing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The handle has bent.","review":"The handle has bent.The handle loosened and fell out.Since it is cheap, is it unavoidable?It was very regrettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"The only complaint I have is that they don't hold their edge as well as others I've used.

I think I'll give him another chance, but not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"it ain't shakespeare","review":"I was going to trash this book, but I've changed my mind. John Saul writes books that fall into that elusive category, the good bad novel. I mean, by halfway through this thing, I recognized that it was bad on a cosmic scale. It has plot holes you could drive a semi through, and dialogue that seems to have been written by pre-schoolers who'd been dosed on acid and forced to read \\"Sweet Valley High\\" novels. But I still finished the damn thing. Hell, I even read another John Saul novel before I finally learned my lesson. Be warned, this guy makes Stephen King sound like Shakespeare. But he will entertain you, at least until you have time to realize what you've been reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Saul's Tale of Terror","review":"I have been a longtime fan of John Saul's work.\\"CREATURE\\" is a edge of your seat classic.A must have for any book collector.I would like to see this one made into a movie.A good, scary roller coaster ride into terror!It takes the \\"Spirit\\"of the game of football to next level,and kicks the thrill level up 10 notches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont pick it up...","review":"In my opinion, Creature, was not a very interesting read. The title itself is plain enough to make you turn your head the other way, but I sampled the novel anyway. It was okay..for the first 50 or so pages but began to drag. If you make it past page 150, its an accomplishment! If you want a good book to start, try one of John Saul's earlier writings, \\"Nathaniel\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"left me cold","review":"As with some of the others who reviewed this book, i really liked it for the first 100 pages or so. Then it just sort of quit. The dialogue was boring, the characters were wooden and unbelievable, the ending just plain sucked. And i'm a fan of Saul! I also agree that at times it felt like a young adult mystery, nothing very challenging to think about. I finished it just because it was so light, and i feel that i should always finish a book after i've started. I kept waiting for something rational to happen, i mean a town with only health food and citizens who are ALL football fans, come on now! Plus the parents seem oblivious to the fact that their children are becoming mindless aggressive apes. In the end i didn't even really care about what happened, but then again that's just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my FAVORITE!!","review":"I have read everything John Saul has written and I still reminisce about \\"Creature\\". Everything that makes John Saul so wonderful at what he does is embodied in this book. I say that it might be my favorite. But some of his others rank right up there. (e.g. GodPlayer, Brainchild, Shadows) He creates such a unique atmosphere and makes you feel apart of the story. I read \\"Creature\\" when it first came out and poured through it quickly as if from starvation. I will definately read it again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Saul","review":"I was looking through the local library and stumbled across this and being a person who loves a good horror/mystery grabbed it right up. I loved this book and had a hard time putting it down. Of course with all that's going on these days with steroids and HGH it's hard to believe this book was written nearly 20 years ago and is still relevant. The story grabbed me right away with the small kid who wants to be bigger, and the classic athletic father who wants his boy to live up to his expectations of being the star of the local football team. The ending kind of bothered me, it left alot of questions and to what happened and what will happen but overall it was good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in Hell is heaven","review":"Year after year, this remains my favorite calendar, because it makes me laugh every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I have two Yorkies and I just recetly purchased this item.

The 3 wheel design was especially interesting, because I wanted to use the stroller at festivals, etc...over differing terrains. I almost bought this one when I read that back wheels have a tendency to bend or even fall off when loaded with a dog even 15 lbs, which is a huge concern for the animal's safety and wouldn't work for me since my dog is nearing that weight. I opted instead for the Pet Gear \\"Sportster\\", where I'm able to transport 2 dogs weighing a total of 27 lbs and numerous camera gear in the basket below and have logged around 60 miles or so without a problem. I would give it 2 stars on concept alone, as this stroller may work fine for a single tiny dog or cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Try & Cry Hangman","review":"I purchased a copy of Hangman #2 from a local store and to my dismay this particular copy doesn't scratch off. I used a dime and scratched a hole in the page. I then used a nickel but that just made the gray dots, shining silver dots. I finally moved on to a pencil eraser which did work but one puzzle used the entire eraser and it took quite a bit of elbow grease to even get that to work. My daughter was very frustrated to say the least. From other reviews it appears that others have had a good experience with some of these books. Could the problem be that these books are printed in China? Perhaps the gray dots on some copies are actually lead based paint dots rather than the usual latex ink! What gives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy mega garbage","review":"I have megan \\"32\\" way \\"adjustable\\" on my s2000 and they are the CRAPPIEST COIL OVERS IN THE WORLD! 32 way \\"adjustable\\" claim made by megan is a JOKE! setting 1 feels the same as setting 32 ( ROC HARD)my guess is the knobs do NOTHING, just to make you think these crap suspension is worth something.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE MEGAN COIL OVER SUSPENSIONS. they are GARBAGE!I have owned JIC MAGIC 2, TEINS, H&R;, TOKICO .

I've counted so many, that I am marking them as I go with a Postit pad so I can let everyone know about each one I have found. The tests are pretty good though. I like knowing after every question whether or not I was correct. The only problem is that some of the questions makes references to pages in the book that do not explain the answer to the question. Overall, I would not recommend using this as you only study source. Make sure you check the Braindump sites and any other Proxy info you can find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall is good","review":"This book can give you a full picture of the exam. Even, it contains a certain no. of pages talking about TCP/IP basics and IIS to help the beginners, if you know about these items, you may find it boring. I haven't read a training guide that shows the steps, such as installation, configuration etc. so clearly - One illustration for one step. Almost you need not open the software while you are studying. I would also appreciate the lab practice; and questions in the CD-ROM. However, I am very disappointed is that quite many errors in the book. If I can, I would give 3.5 stars instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! Not a plug and play experience for me.","review":"I bought one and it never worked.

Maybe if I got another one it would work but who wants to take that chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Laurel & Hardy","review":"For anyone who does not know the comedy of Laurel and Hardy well, The Music Box is a perfect introduction. The Music Box begins this collection; anyone who cannot laugh hysterically at the antics of this hapless pair of piano movers should certainly check his pulse. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable hero","review":"While this is a very well written book about an interesting period of time, it was totally spoiled for me by the \\"hero\\" of the book.SPOILER ALERTThis \\"gentlemen\\" brutally rapes a 15 year old virgin, who subsequently goes mad, blackmails the heroine into an unwanted betrothal while meanwhile impregnating her maid, then kills the heroine's husband. If this is not enough, he mistreats and abuses the heroines 2 year old son. I can only say, this thoroughly spoiled the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With Sills","review":"Fleming may sing \\"pretty\\" and believe her own \\"beautiful voice\\" hype but for commitment to the character of Thais stick with EMI's recording with Beverly Sills. Yes, the recording would have been better had Sills recorded the role a few years earlier, yet she sings beautifully and with dramatic insight. She gets inside the character of Thais while Fleming pecks at the surface.Hampson and Sabbatini are no match for Milnes and Gedda either.Then there is Abel's indulgent conducting (at least where Fleming is concerned).The new recording also has problems with balances and some abrupt transition/splice breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and juiceless","review":"The tempi used in the recording are very slow, draining whatever life this rather tedious work with one melody has. Fleming's voice is beautiful but her singing her is full of a diva's indulgence. Hampson is in poor voice and Sabatinni is as provincial sounding a tenor as there can be. For this Fleming fan, this recording is major dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massenet - Thas / Fleming, Hampson, Sabbatini, Shkosa, Vidal, Devellereau, Cals, Yves Abel","review":"Massenet - Thas / Fleming, Hampson, Sabbatini, Shkosa, Vidal, Devellereau, Cals, Yves Abel is a 1998 Decca release starring Renée Fleming in the role of Thais. Yves Abel leads the national orchestra of Bordeaux. The booklet contains well-written music notes as well as all the lyrics. Listening to Massenet one can definitely hear elements from Richard Wagner. Truly a magnificent recording starring the amazing Renée Fleming. Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Being an Earth Science major in school, I found this book helpful for most general Earth Science terms, but when it gets down to the more advanced terms (ie for mineralogy, petrography, etc), this book is somewhat lacking.

When they get there they meet a guy named Mr. Crepsley and Madame Octa, Mr. Crepsley is the other main character in the story. Darren Shan stole Madame Octa and a tragic event happened with Steve that was life changing, something also happened that changed Darren Shan's life forever also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Amazing Book!","review":"A Living Nightmare is the first book in the Cirque du Freak series, written by Darren Shan. The book tells of a spider-loving kid named Darren who, with his friend Steve, goes to see a freak show. Unfortunately Steve recognizes one of the performers: Mr. Crepsley is a vampire.After the show Steve visits Mr. Crepsley and begs him to transform Steve himself into one. Mr. Crepsley refuses, and says Steve has evil blood. Steve gets furious and leaves. Soon another unfortunate event occurs involving Mr. Crepsley. Darren steals the vampire's giant venomous spider, Madam Octa. When Steve visits Darren's house, the spider fataly bites him. The only chance to rescue his best friend is for Darren to beg Mr. Crepsley for the antidote...So Darren becomes Mr. Crepsley's assistant as a half-vampire for the antidote, and Darren's adventures begin here, continuing in the other books from the Cirque du Freak series...

The writing style is juvenile, yet the content isn't very appropriate for younger children. The summary on the back of the book dares compare the story to Anne Rice, but it doesn't even come close, not even in the gore factor. If you're a young adult with mature taste, then I suggest reading something more \\"mature\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 story","review":"This book was the best book I have ever read.

I often have troubles getting some of my\\"to cool for school\\" students to read. When this occurs, I hand them my copy of Cirque Du Freak. Along with my avid readers, these students devour this series. Having read the books myself and loved them, I get to share in meaningful conversations with my students concerning Darren Shan and his plight.I also reccomend Darren Shan's series Demonata. It is a little more intense than Cirque Du Freak, but equally entertaining.Both series receive 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care much for it","review":"I read the book after seeing the movie. I really hoped to like it but the writing style was just so-so. I actually stopped reading and picked it back up in spurts.

I say eleven purposefully because had he left the series unfinished I would feel more closure than I do having read the entire thing.Do not pick up this book, if you do you will be enticed to read the entire series at the end of which you will find out the whole thing is akin to a dream sequence and not only that but Darren O'Shaughnessy (I refuse to acknowledge the arrogance associated with using his pseudonym as the protagonist) uses the most base and sophomoric writing tricks.If Darren O'Shaughnessy has any self respect he will scrap the last two books and rewrite the ending to something that makes a modicum of sense. Let me offer him a start to this new ending, something happened somebody died or somebody lived and who that somebody might have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is not worth the trouble!!!!!!!","review":"First, I have read the whole D.S. series getting many books from amazon.uk. The frist book was great I must admit. By book 9 you are totaly let down. The end of the series is very week!!!! The author is in love with himself and you can defiantely find many many more books and series more worthy of your time. Please take my advice and reda another series.

J.K.

Yet, I was still curious and grabbed it.I could hardly get through it. The book, to me, was so boring. The plot was silly. The main character wasn't too bright. I guess you should just go and check it out for yourself seeing that many people enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great book.

Well this is the book for you. Cirque Du Freak is my favorite book, because it's interesting to see and feel the main character's perspective. Like when he goes into the strange Cirque Du Freak, he explains how it feels to walk down a long hallway to meat a big man named Mr.Tall. I also love this book because the characters are interesting. Like Sam, he is interesting because he is violent, he loves bloody, scary, horror books, and he has a bad attitude. Alan, a soccer player who plays like a champ. Darren Shan, our main character and our author. He has a normal life until he goes to the Cirque Du Freak with his best friend Sam. Suddenly Sam becomes very nervous when he sees a performing spider, and suddenly Darren's life changes forever!

After the show the main character decides to kidnap it and become a spider charmer himself.

Another friend brings a flier advertising Cirque du Freak, a freak show. Steve sneaks out to buy tickets for him and 3 friends but the ticket salesman only sells 2 tickets per flier. Only 2 can go, and 2 will be left behind. This book takes place in several cities in present-day.This book was for entertainment. This is a great book. I would recommend you to read this book and the whole Cirque du Freak series. The reason this is a good book is it has great characters and it leaves you wondering what's going to happen in the next chapter so you keep reading. That is why I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Me Loving This","review":"I saw the movie based on this series of books and decided to read one of them. Now I am ordering all of them. Finish one, order another. I know these are for pre teen and early teen kids. Yet here I am, at 62, enjoying them. They are quite hair raising. I would have trouble letting a pre teen read them. I would have had nightmares. Of course, I come from a more innocent (media-wise) era. I like the grammar mistakes in the stories, made by the boy telling the story. His attitude seems perfect for his age and what he is going through. All in all, a story well told. I will read the rest of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for very young readers","review":"Cirque du Freak: A Living Nightmare is the first in another young adult horror series that has been gaining popularity lately. While I typically enjoy young adult fiction, Cirque du Freak is a much younger YA book than I typically read, and I had to stop and remind myself to consider the intended audience very frequently.The story line is slow to build, with most of the action and suspense saved for the end. The writing itself felt a bit clumsy, but once again this could be a product of authorial intention (writing for a young audience). I would certainly recommend the Cirque du Freak series for young readers (age nine or so), but I don't think I'll continue the series myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"wiggle giggle","review":"ROARI absolutely loved this book. Between all the freaks in the show to the vampires and spiders. And I don't even like spiders but Madam Octa was awesome. And when Daren sacrificed his self to save his friend Steve, I think that had to be the most scariest moment, having his neck broken. So if I were you I would totally read this book. I think if you like a good mistory and a scary book you'd love Cirque Du Freak."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonting to be a vampire","review":"It is a good book. If you like thinks about vampires.

It is a story about a kid named Darren Shan and his friends finding a flyer to a freak show. Darren has always been fascinated in spiders, and the flyer mentioned a spider, and Darren was determined to go. From here, everything goes wrong. Darren and his friend, Steve, go to the freak show and are absolutely amazed at what they see. Steve thinks he knows a little too much about one paticular act, and Darren eavesdrop on their conversation and is amazed. From this point on the book is filled with exciting moments after another, and will keep you going.

One of the friends got bit by a vampire, and the boy must do the vampire's evil deeds, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it.

The main characters in this book are Daren, Allen, Steve, Mr.Crepsley, and Madam Octa. The main characters in the story came across many problems in the book. One problem was when Steve and Daren went to the freak show. After the freak show, Steve stole a spider named Madam Octa. While at Daren's house, Daren's sister came into his room and screamed which made Madam Octa bite Steve. There were many adventures in the story. One adventure was they had to \\"borrow\\" money from Steve's mom in order to go to the freak show. After they \\"borrowed\\" the money Steve snuck out to go get the tickets to the freak show.

I'm going to have to echo what all of the other one star reviewers have said. The writing style is terrible, the characters are one dimensional and boring, and I did not find one iota of this story to be \\"creepy\\" or \\"terrifying\\" as other reviewers assured it would be. Every other sentence ended in an exclamation point, most often quite unnecessarily. This book tries so desperately to sound shocking and scary, that it forgets to actually BE shocking or scary.

And, while I never ended up seeing the movie, I'm glad I picked up this series. I bought the first three books and a week later, had to go back and pick up the rest. These books are a nice quick read and flow really well from one book to the next.After finishing them and having my sister read them, I took the series into my classroom as the start of my classroom library. Getting middle schoolers to read has always been a problem, except with this series. A few of my students had already started the series and were waiting for the library to have the next one in. They were really excited when I brought the books to school.

I haven't read any of the other books by this author, but I still enjoyed this book.

But this book wasn't at all what I expected. It was alright, nothing really to write home about. He proposes some interesting thoughts and observations on death but none of it really appeared plausible. It really hurts me to not give it a higher rating because I really wanted to like it. But for the life of me I couldn't find anything that really stuck out in my mind. Plus a lot of it wasn't even written by Leary and most of the things in it have already been published. It almost appears to be a horrible attempt to cash in on the his death and just through a bunch of stuff from his prior publishings together.

If you're used to new ZAO you'll have to let this one grow on you, but for fans of strongarm, overcome, and innermeans this is for you. I recommend it. I loved it. It was amazing.

Many of my friends hated the music that I listened to, but now when I put Zao in, the lights are turned down and a prayer circle is formed.

The reviewer that said \\"mostly fluff\\" was right on the money, except that he still gave it 3 stars. I bought this book mainly because I was looking for another poker book and I had always wanted to read Sun Tzu's Art of War. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. If interested in \\"The Art of War\\", buy that instead; If you are interested in a good poker book, buy one of Slanksy's or Harrington's. This book is littered with insights like (to paraphrase) \\"when your opponent is weaker than you, attack and accumulate his chips; when he is stronger than you, retreat and conserve your chips\\". Wow, would never have thought of that.

The answers that are written in this book are very practical and realistic.The author takes you on an unforgetable juorney through pain's roads, teaches you how to negotiate life's bad turns, highways and byways and offers divine answers to the actual question of 'why there is pain?' and how to get a breakthrough in the thickets of its clutches. I highly recomend this book, take it to someone who is trying to make ends meet but feels like God is movinmg the ends whenever they try to move them. Give it to someone who feels God is making bitter the life they are trying to make better. 'DISAPPOINTED BY GOD'is a book of its own kind!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Book about a Planetary Probe","review":"It is refreshing to see a book about one of NASA's unmanned successes. No wonder why the public is unaware of the JPL. This books gives a glimpse into the many obstacles Pathfinder had even before it left Earth. Muirhead tells the story in a very down-to-earth style. I was a bit disappointed in the frequent references into business applications on the \\"cheaper, better & faster\\" approach. At times it disrupted the flow of the book and gave an informercial taste to this book. I would also have liked a closing chpater on some of the scientific results of the little rover that gave us a very memorable Fourth of July in 1997. Overall, I recommend this tale of scientific exploration just because it gives the public information on space exploration that it wouldn't find elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best mxpx or 90 pound could ever do","review":"the awsomest sounding christain punk i ever heard!!! the mixture of mxpxs' smooth sound and 90 puonds' thrash punk sound is just the best album any punk could buy. mike, tom, dale, and steve or awsome!!punx not ded!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MIXES OF 2 BANDS!","review":"this is great! i urge u 2 buy this cd,GO BUY IT! i love the subject of (blank) it's funny how they wrote a song about them writing a song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good CD for your punk needs from the local guys!","review":"If you need a little bit more speed than mxpx or maybe a not so hardcore punk as 90lb wuss this is the disc for you!

So, being at the HG Fest, I decided to pick up a copy from Yob. When I got home I was so excited, I popped the CD in and had a listen. It reminded me a lot like those special $1.99 chips that you can buy at the grocery store. When you first open the bag you'r like \\"Yes!\\" and you savor every single bite, as you git about half way through the bag, you're starting to feel a little sick so you offer some to your friends, but they don't want any. So you decide to be a man and finish off the bag. By the end you throw up all over the place and regret every buying those chips. That is how I felt when I bought this album! I hated it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time to listen","review":"I had recently rediscovered the church with \\"Uninvited like the Clouds\\", a pretty good CD in my opinion. Next I picked up \\"AENT\\" and I really liked it. Now I couldn't get enough so I picked up \\"Forget Yourself\\". After one listen, I thought it rather uninspired. After 2 listens, a couple of songs caught my attention and I noticed how the whole thing kind of flowed. After several more listens I've decided that this is a really, really good CD. There is alot of good music here and the tracks just flow from one to the next. Laid back songs like June, Telepath, Appalatia stand out. Some of the the 'louder' tracks like, Lay Low, nothing seeker and song in space also really grew on me. If you're looking for something to close your eyes to, this is probably not it, otherwise I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Cricket player to warrior","review":"Brazen Chariots provides an up-close view of warfare in the desert in 1941. Robert Crisp, a South African Cricket star, commanded a tank section during several major engagements in an attempt to stop the Rommel's Deutsche Afrikakorps (DAK). His account is gritty and unassuming, never taking more credit than is due him, and often underplaying his own bravery. Although the focus is on Crisp's experiences in tanks, this book also provides insight into the effects of poor communications on a battle plan as the opposing forces collide - or totally miss each other. There is also some information about the harsh life, and often quick death suffered by infantrymen, artillerymen, and anti-tank gunners. For a close up look at the desert war from a man that is not intent on glorifying his own part, or glorifying war overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in a Tank","review":"I recently finshed reading this book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It provides a gripping, first hand account of just what it was like to be a member of a tank crew, during the early, confusing, and often deadly battles of the war in North Africa.

The only thing on her that grows is her weave. This album is disrespectful to the R&B community. I am sick of looks overriding talent. What ever happened to singers like Chaka, Patti and Anita?

I actually used to think she could sing..well..erm..a least a lil bit..I will admit that her first single off CR \\"Only U\\" is amazing...but the beat .the music makes the song amazing..her vocals leave something to be desired. She cannot sing.. point blank...she has no talent. The world is obviously coming to an end because the girl actually has a fan base of brain washed children that feed into her garbage..Ashanti is a has been that never should have been that never will be...and I will never ever miss her once she dissapears for good. If you are looking for good music..please save your money and buy Beyonce's (Dangerously In Love) Brandy's(Afrodisiac) or Aaliyah's (Aaliyah)...and if you actually are an Ashanti fan..I suggest you go see a shrink to try and make sense of your screwed up marbles..Have a wonderful day!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album","review":"Ashanti's first album, \\"Ashanti\\", was great, one of those albums where I could actually enjoy every song and not have to skip tracks.

I got the CD and I really liked her music, her style and that incredible voice she has...I don't know her other CD's, but I liked this one a lot: I think almost all the songs are very good, but I just didn't like the skits, I've never liked skits, but I do have some favorite songs: \\"Only You\\", \\"Don't Let Them\\" and \\"Touch My Body\\". The other songs aren't bad at all, but these are my favorites. I repeat, before this artist I used to hear Avril Lavigne and U2 so, so much, and I had never gotten into R&B, but now I like it a lot, so I highly recommend it. You won't get dissapointed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet....","review":"Ashanti has finally proved herself with this album. First of all, the album title is all worth the hype and describes her fully. The album is full of mid-tempo grooves, hip-hop beats and a few ballads. However, the uptempos are Ashanti's trademark and 'Only U' has one of the tightest rifts in it since who knows when. Still Down and Focus are nice jams. 'Love Again' has one of the sickest beats in a while, should have an instrumental. 'Don't Let Them' and 'So HOt' are my fave jams on the cd though. they are nice smooth jams that Ashanti actually sounds nice on. Ive heard all of her joints and they have progressively gotten better and this is her gem right now. The one song she could have gone without is 'Turn it up', yeah she coulda let that one go. 'Don't leave me alone' sounds like somethin off MAry's Joint 'My Life' and thats saying alot. The songs stay with you and you can actually bear listening to her.

But my all time favorite songs on this cd are Focus, U, and Freedom because i think many people can relate to what she's saying in those 3 songs.You can dance to alot of the songs and she sounds incredible in this cd.So great job Ashanti and i'm looking foward to your next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong voice does not make a great singer","review":"A strong voice don't make a great singer but Ashanti's voice just sucks! It's many singers that have limited range but still understands how to put soul in their songs. Ashanti just don't get it. She needs a little training from Tammi Terrell and Diana Ross. Billie Holiday is a perfect person of having a very limited range but she was able to put every ounce of her soul into the music. Ashanti has always have had a problem with it. She is much better suited as singing the hooks to rap songs and that just about it.She's a beautiful girl but she needs to put a little bit more soul into these releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM DONE!!!!!","review":"I GAVE THIS CD 1 STAR BECAUSE I ONLY LIKE TWO SONGS ON THE WHOLE CD. I CANT EVEN GET INTO THE REST OF THE CD. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I LISTEN TO THE CD I JUST DONT LIKE IT. I ONLY ENJOY THE FIRST TWO SONGS NOT INCLUDING KELLY SONG. I AM SO GLAD SOMEONE DOWN LOADED THIS FOR ME FOR FREE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO UPSET IF I PAID FOR THIS CD. ASHANTI PLEASE GIVE IT UP. SHE IS A VERY PRETTY WOMAN WHO WOULD DO BETTER HOSTING SOMETHING ON TV (NO, NOT ACTING)JUST HOSTING. I WISH SHE COULD HAVE DELIVERED BETTER. MAYBE SHE IS WORKING WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE.

WHY? simply because she is beautiful, she is pretty, and she is gorgeous. Unfortunatly, they forgot about talent. Ashanti carries no ability to prove she can be around for years to come.Every Ashanti album thus far has a good single but a terrible album and the same goes for \\"concrete rose\\". \\"Only U\\" was probably the best pick possible for a first single off this album. It is catchy and on the edge of a rock style. But where are the vocals? When will Ashanti prove she can sing?She is a lost hope. People wanted to believe she was worthy of her grammy. People wanted to believe she deserved the millions in sales. But there is no diva here. not even in training.**didnt mean to sound so mean, but let the people with talent shine in this industry please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Rose","review":"Ashanti's latest album was beautiful to me.

ONLY U is a highly produced ready for the radio that shows nothin' new, FOCUS is a horrible retro track, and the rest a pure boring ballads. And by the way YES! we are treatesd again with the anoying interludes, we don't buy the record to hear ASHANTI'S sister brag about her sister records...A WELL DESERVE NO NO NO NO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concrete Rose","review":"Concrete Rose is Ashanti's third main release in which she unleashes a completely different side of her talent. This is clear through the first single \\"Only U\\", which showcases Ashanti's ability to make a very catchy song. The album consists of many songs that have new feel to them. Not every song has the potential to be a hit like \\"Only U\\" but the album as a whole is a very enjoyable one to listen to. In the intro to the album Ashanti explains the title of the album and how it reveals her music as being hip-hop and R&B. If you buy the album you will get exactly that, nothing less but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Fan Anymore After This Album","review":"I loved Ashanti's vocals and lyrics on her first album. Then I get Chapter II and things seemed to start to go downhill from there. The cd was very generic. When I heard her single \\"Only U\\" on her third album \\"Concrete Rose\\" it was great because of the rock-infused sound and unusual beat of the song. Unfortunately, that's the only decent song on the album other than \\"Focus\\" which is the track following \\"Only U\\". I honestly have only listened to the first half of the album because I can't get through it-it's so bad. She sounds different than her first album-like she's straining her voice on her songs now. 2 stars are actually generous for this review-download \\"Only U\\" & \\"Focus\\" and save your money. I know I won't buy another one of her albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concrete Rose has lost its petals","review":"Now to be honest, I've never been a big Ashanti fan but I believe in being open minded and will listen to an artist I'm not thrilled with, because I know for some over the course of time, they can gain strength and become a bit more polished. I don't think Ashanti's time has come yet.From this Concrete Rose CD, I can say that there are 3 songs that I liked. (1.)DON'T LET THEM, (2.) SO HOT, (3.)WONDERFUL. I'm not really feeling the rest of it. True, she is an attractive young lady with a nice shape and as we all know, looks sell. The sad part is that there should be more than looks when it comes to selling records, talent! This music reminds me of someone who is just starting out and hasn't quite found their niche."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"ashanti is the type of flimsy singer that you understand why she became popular (because of teenage,and prepubecent girls).as a matter of fact i lost a friend because me and the girls would redicule her for liking her music.other things added to the dissolvant of the friendship but thats off topic.i doubt anybody over the age of 21 could get into this album.i listened to it cause i thought she would show growth but she doesn't.but her song writting is still childish and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happend?","review":"What happend to the Ashanti that was \\"Always on Time\\" and asked us all \\"Whats Love\\"? Now Ashanti my girl but this cd could have been way way more better. There are only a few songs on here that are actually good. The single\\"Only You\\" was totally hot but the rest of the cd is not. The Best Songs On Here Are: Don't Leave Me Alone & Freedom. People say that she can't sing well she does pretty well because we all bought her cd. I personally wished it was more r&b like the first cd she had. I just think she got a little too comfortable in her own skin not saying that you shouldn't but come on ths cd makes no sence at all. I give it 2 stars she has three songs I like but thats me and my opinion. If you ask me the 1st 2 cd's are way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Better...","review":"Ashanti's CD is not bad. I honestly didn't know how well I would like this CD but I keep listening to it and it is growing on me. I would not say it is the best CD made I prefer Ciara over Ashanti, but the more I give this CD a try the better it is. I especially like it on mellow days when you want a nice beat but don't want the yelling and screaming that goes with it. This CD has some dance songs but the rest are ballads with a bit of funk. It is growing on me. I will take it in the car every so often on my way to work and if I make it through the CD it is getting better. And I can now make it through the CD. I would say keep trying it took me a while to like it too, but I am getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Ashanti","review":"This album is just vintage Ashanti...I mean people hate on her for whatever reasons, yet she makes another album full of songs that are hot as hell.

It is definitely a step up from Chapter II. Her lyrics are really catchy and I can relate to her emotions on all of the tracks. I also love the production, she has some hot tracks on this album. I listened to the whole album all day on MTV's The Leak and loved it. I think this album is one that you can listen to straight through and I commend her for her efforts. If only she would stop singing with her sister a cappela because it is not a secret that she is not the best vocalist but she is clever and I like the fact that she is smart enough to write real lyrics and lace them with a hot beat to make hot tracks. Keep it coming Shani. Some of my favorite tracks are Only U, Focus, Don't let Them, Don't Leave Me Alone, Take Me Tonight, Love Again, Freedom, So Hot, Still Down, ok that is pretty much the whole album. It is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!!!..","review":"ok there are alot of singers out that don't have good vocals,but have good songs she has neither.I want her to project her voice more and stop giving us this laa dee dah crap.She actually has some potential,but she needs to work on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL!!!","review":"Ashanti is just another fake @ss Aaliyah wanna-be. However, she really needs to be stopped because she is nowhere near the real \\"Princess of Hip Hop & R&B\\". I don't get it! Ashanti can't dance, she can't sing, and she's not that great of an entertainer, but she still manages to stay in our faces. Irv Gotti or Ja Rule should also tell her to quit biting Beyonce' Knowles too because she really walking a fine line at that. Especially, in that \\"Only U\\" video. Which is the best song on this CD might I add. Quite frankly, if I was given this CD. I would be highly pissed for wasting my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Nails It","review":"This slim book says so much about what it means to be human; to find one's self with a certain skin color, appearance and sex within our particular culture with it's values and expectations fueled by aggressive marketing.

My 23 year old daughter insisted I read this and I would heartily recommend this book to ANYone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read.","review":"Cornel West's Race Matters is not only speakly directly to the truth, but takes it to the level of understanding hard to reach in other works.

I recommend this book to any and everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivy League Charlatan","review":"Cornell West is a charlatan and this book, like all the rest of his work, is little more than a collection of biased opinions unsupported by logic or information. While most blacks have achieved middle class status in the past 30 years, West sees only those who are mired in poverty and crime. And those, he thinks, are pure victims of \\"racism\\". It does not occur to West that a person with a criminal record, a bad attitude, and a poor education - is unlikely to succeed regardless of his color. If America were really as racist as West imagines, how does he explain his own amazing success - for surely his success is amazing. How many men get paid the money that Cornell West is paid - and that for \\"mouthing off\\" about his favorite hobby-horses? Larry Summers chided West for his total lack of scholarship. This book proves that Summers was absolutely right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvard produced this!","review":"Logic-chopping aside, this book leaves the impression that Cornel West loves himself as much as he hates America.

It may be have some value for those interested in blackism and black rights activism, but not as a serious book on the study of race and racial differences, it is simply worthless. I find it worthless. Especially when compared with other book of the issue of race: Darwin's The Descent of Man; Levin's Why Race Matters; Rushton's Race, EVolution and Behaviour; Duke's My Awakening... To name just a few of the scientific books that have been written on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSATIFACTORY CONDITION","review":"THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I HAVE TRIED TO REPORT THAT THIS BOOK HAS SO MANY MARKS, UNDERLINES, HIGHLIGHTS, NOTES I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO READ IT.

For this reason, I think he must have had a ghostwriter for this book. He tries to convince weak-minded readers that the in-your-face sexuality of some blacks is a thing to be praised, while free-thinking black conservatives are low-lifes. I would have given the book no stars if it weren't so funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Race Matters, but only one side","review":"I suggest you read this book to be remind why people especially in West's position should be more even handed and critical of their own views. He is a \\"University Professor\\" at Harvard but in this book of short sighted commentary he is nothing but a ringmaster for the white guilt circus. African Americans deserve better than this because so many look to him for expertise in the area of race, instead they find themselves being sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes more than one side to fix things","review":"I think someone made a good point by referencing a Malcolm X quote: \\"You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress.\\" However, was Malcolm X not simply holding the knife in place when he argued for separatism? Sure, his \\"radical transformation\\" at the end of his life saw him reverse his attitudes, but others continue with the belief that the white community is saddled with an enormous guilt and sole responsibility for the current state of affairs. Off the subject somewhat, there is another book regarding race in schools, where the author comments on the fact that it is good to see minorities form groups to foster identity-formation. In my and any other pragmatist's opinion, though, this merely perpetuates the fracturing of the human community."},{"rating":"2","title":"West always shoots straight down the middle .","review":"Cornel West always shoots straight down the middle for all races.

He does not propose easy, narrow or chauvenist black nationalist solutions to issues such as black people's place in politics, the economy or society, but suggest progressive solutions to a problem that plaques us at the beginning of the 21st century. It is an easy, accessible read on a complex issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Follow","review":"I found this book hard to follow. His arguments weren't always clear and, honestly, I felt like he was using \\"big words\\" to impress his readers.I'll give him one thing: passion. I could feel how passionate he was about his topic, but all in all a hard-to-read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, brief overview of why race matters","review":"Cornel West's early 90s book still can be read today with great profit. He discusses the problems of racial injustice in vivid, succinct detail, and illustrates the failures of both liberals and conservative in response to the problems facing the black community (most immediately). He indicates that the \\"Prophetic perspective\\" would be better, but might have made fuller description of what the perspective entails, and what solutions to real and nagging problems we might find. He justifiably exalts Malcolm X, but too much so at the expense of Martin Luther King Jr. Overall, however, a well-written and illuminating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of unsupported assertions","review":"So I finally got around to reading this after watching West on the Jon Stewart show a few times and liking his fearless attitude and demeanor. I was interested and even eager to like this book, but to be honest it was sloppy work. There are TONS of assertions in here that West doesn't bother trying to support with even a rudimentary statistic or poll. What's worse is he then builds his case on these premises. That's all fine if you already agree with him, but it's hardly convincing.This book needs to be at least 1/3 longer and cite some reason for me to accept everything he bases his arguments on. He doesn't get a pass because Fox News is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A polysyllabic vocabulary does not a philosopher make.","review":"West completely and conspicuously evades the obvious fact that American Indians - who on average are considerably more impoverished and isolated from mainstream US culture - achieve higher test scores than blacks.

Mostly he's managed to explain the various changes of leadership (not for nothing does byzantine now mean fiendishly complicated) without losing his story. Always he focuses on the narrative, the ebb and flow of emperors, battles and the empire.It might take a companion volume to focus on the cultural contribution to the world.

From the energy packed intro to Wham to the rocking version of Memphis, Lonnie Mack and his Flying V guitar brought a whole new sound to the mid 60's guitar table, just as Clapton would later do with Bluesbreakers.One of the most under rated, unknown guitarists, Mack played a unique style using a Gibson Flying V and a capo. His organ vibrato amp added to the mysterious but driving blues sound coming off of this album.I listened to it day and night, up and down inside and out. It was the bible as far as I was concerned and it helped lead the way to where I am today as a player.By all means, get this historic album and discover a guitarist who we all idolized on the south side of Chicago in the early 60's.

We first used this product per a vet recommendation and it ended up irritating her ears (making them more red and itchy). So, the vet suggested Virbac Epi-Otic and that seems to make Jasper much happier. Some other reviewers suggest soaking a cotton ball and squeezing the solution out into the ear canal as more tolerable for the dog than squeezing it into her ear canal--I'm going to try that out because Jasper definitely doesn't like having the bottle squeezed anywhere near her ear. My vet also recommended that you don't have to worry about putting a decent quantity into the ear canal and then you should massage the ear to give the solution a chance to break up the debris in the ear before you let the dog shake it out or if you wipe out the ear canal with a paper towel (big dogs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dog ear cleanser ever!","review":"I have a dachshund with chronic ear issues.

There are moments that will cause tears to stream down you face from laughter, and moments that will cause you to set the book down while you feel a helpless heartache. The stories she tells are priceless, and regardless of whether they make you laugh or cry, you end up wishing you have been there as Zippy's running buddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, funny and thoughtful","review":"I love Kimmel's subtle style. She easily could have whacked readers over the head with the drama of her family life, but doesn't.

It also could have devolved into a \\"woe-is-me-and-my-terrible-childhood\\", but Kimmel never sinks to playing on her readers' pity.I was a bit thrown by the lack of continuity.

You must circle the buttons rather than tap them. The game, however, is quite fun for about 20 minutes. It's interesting how it is very hard to see a very obvious change in two pictures. The presentation is well done and the artwork is good, if not overly cute and anime.If it was a free game on the internet, I would have played it the same amount of time as I did when it was in my DS. I can't recommend this unless you have several kids, each of which will get an hour out of it in the car on vacation.Pros: Good presentation and art. Interesting concept for a game.Cons: Lack of depth. Irritating menu activation through circling buttons. Cute anime art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for kids and adults alike","review":"On the surface this is a very simplistic game of spot the differences.

Upon completion of the entire game a whole other set of levels and games gets unlocked. So you can play even more.The Japanese graphics are amusing and different.My 4.5 year old, my 6.5 year old and I all can play the same game cartridge and enjoy it equally."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"As a future daddy, I was looking for some words of advice and tips as to how I can support my wife during her pregnancy. I chose this book for two reasons. One, It was written by one I respect as a better than your average actor. Two, it was new on the market and there were no reviews for it. I was disappointed in the book. It seemed a little tacky and a few punch lines were added for humor. The book sits on my bookshelf ready for the next garage sale.

The plot is crisp and deceiving. Every time you think the author is slipping into one of the many high fantasy plot ruts, he offers a surprise.More importantly, the surprises make sense. In fact the entire world is internally consistent and believable.Leading all of these strengths are the characters who are powerful, three dimensional and very real. Also, Craddock's female characters are strong without being cliched (something sadly still lacking in many high fantasy novels).Strongly recommended for most ages, although the darker aspects of the plot may be a bit much for those under thirteen or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"I rate Sparrow's Flight highly, for the simple reason that the book captures the reader's imagination and attention (and free time) from the very first page. I place it in the rare category of 'books you cannot put down.'The characters have a refreshing depth to them, drawing the reader along with their plight as they struggle to understand that a hero is not measured by how perfect they are, but rather by the hope they give others. As Sparrow and Kishatet grow and overcome themselves and their adversaries, there are many peices of each one to identify with. This made it easy to care about the characters, providing an enthralling read and an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on fox society","review":"I read this book while raising a litter of foxes, the author's insights into fox society was very helpful.

But recently, while looking for ways to sharpen my descriptive writing for my fiction, I came across a mention of Bender's mentioned in another book. I borrowed it through inter-library loan and before I was halfway through the borrowed copy, I'd ordered a used one through Amazon.

Every starting fiction (or creative nonfiction) writer should read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps useless for most people","review":"The journal samples chosen are so dry and uninteresting. The author tries to teach the obvious which an average educated adult reader would know. This is kind of book you pick up in a bookstore and read 5 minutes or 10 you would put down and move to the next.

This book was no doubt a great controversy in her homeland of Egypt and quite possibly still is. The autobiographical tones are apparent which makes it an ever sadder tale. Freedom as she argues should exist for all--both men and women. The way her upbringing taught her to feel ashamed and inferior is horrible. But it is equally inspiring that she had the courage and fortitude to triumph over these overwhelming odds. Occasionally humanity does rise above the ugliness. This is one such triumph. It is poigant but also a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"the new mediumship","review":"it's a very short book that seems to make for more of an article than a book. The topic coverage is stilted and very basic - too general to be adequate for a serious study of the topic. This book was required reading for a course I am taking and the only reason I bought it was that I could not locate it anywhere else for free. I would refer anyone else making a study of mediumship to other authors, such as Elizabeth Owens; particularly, How to Communicate With Spirits. A book called Mediumship Explained is also good. I think it is by Harry Edwards (amazing books by him on spiritual healing, by the way). Another very thorough book on mediumship is A Guide to Mediumship and Psychical Development by E.W.

I was almost to the point of buying a brand new camcorder, until I found a solution that some were doing on youtube where they glue a 34mm/37mm converter ring to the front. Sure enough, that worked perfectly! Used automotive adhesive/sealant for extra strength.After adding this lens, it makes a world of difference! I no longer have to stand further away, and lean backwards in closed spaces just to get the shot. Looks great in optical zoom (totally zero distortion), and I can get a much bigger viewing angle in digital zoom (slight distortion along edges, but not much).The only negative is the lens cap is terrible.

For example, it establishes a probable direct link between Campion and Shakespeare. However, the conclusions it draws about some of the plays are among the worst drivel ever turned out about Shakespeare. Not only are the author's insights stretched to the point of being ridiculous, he does not attempt to connect them to the larger themes of the plays. In discussing Macbeth, for example, he claims that Shakespeare uses the witches' patter to project an image of anti-Catholicism, but does not try to tie this in with the larger theme of excessive ambition. For analysis of the plays, try Frank Kermode, A.L. Rowse, Goddard or Harold Bloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about and for stupid women","review":"From the minute I opened this book I was annoyed. Angie, the lead character, is self-involved, obsessed with clothes and spending money, and seems to think a 'relationship' is where she sits around her boyfriend's apartment waiting to have sex with him.An aspiring 'actress', she doesn't do anything about her career, has idiot friends, a clueless boyfriend and, she's not funny. Why anyone would waste time reading this book unless, as I'm guessing, it's written for stupid women, then I'm sure they find Angie funny. Me? Like another Amazon reader, I stopped reading it two thirds the way through.

By far one of the best books I have read thus far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, for what it was","review":"This was another in the long line of chick-lit books, and it wasn't that bad. It was quite readable, funny at times, and followed the life of Angie and her quest for love and mariage. The title and the back cover are a bit misleading - this book is not really about a woman and all her ex-boyfriends. I thought it would be, so I was surpised by that. Instead, the book is about Angie and her romantic life with her boyfriend Kirk, and how her past relationships (and his) may affect thier future. The end is very easy to figure out by the third chapter, but the getting there was half the fun I guess. This is a recommended book for light reading and lazy days."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!","review":"As a recovering individual who has struggled with anorexia, bulimia, and compuslive overeating over the past 12 years, I found this book to be the best investment I've ever made. It gave me insights and challenged me in ways that years of continuous therapy has failed to do.

Like 12-steppers say, take what you need and leave the rest. As a food addict, carrying a bag of food around with me and filling my cabinets with binge food is not a good idea -- for me. However, I have stopped dieting, and I'm learning to eat and exercise like a real human being who is living a real life instead of SOMEONE WHO MUST BE THIN BY NEXT THURSDAY.

It is a lie. This book confronts dieting and tells us its not working and is not a logical long term solution. Can we as readers really hear this?

It should be interesting and informative, however, the findings are presented in such a dry non-narrative fashion it reads as technical survey after survey after survey.

I will definetly be returning this and I don't think you should buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"When it happens, will you know?","review":"I loved this book. It was delightful and fun. I loved Sara and how she is so focused and she pays attention to Dave who is popular and she thinks he is someone that she has been looking for. However there is another guy who is also focused on music and Sara and his name is Tobey. Despite what is going on with Dave and Sara. Tobey and Sara are meant to be together. They have hardly anything in common but maybe a few things but they go so well together. It was fun seeing there romance come together, even though friends and influences were trying to keep it from happening. When it happens is a self explanatory title about when it happens you will know and it may be with the person that you least expect. Susane delivers that message loud and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Characters and the Storytelling.","review":"What a satisfying read! I felt like the characters were real - not perfect, but flawed and realistic. I really wanted to know what was going to happen between Sara and Tobey, and I loved reading both perspectives. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF THE HOOK","review":"I now found a new favorite book! This was an amazing read. I love the way the author strucutured the book, I got to understand each character's perspective and was torn as the plot unfolded. The author tells the story with serious skills. This is a funny, real-life book that will keep you wanting more. I felt as if I knew the characters, and was sad when I finished reading the book--since I felt like I was saying goodbye to some new best friends. So, my question is: is there a sequel in the works? or a movie? I would love that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Are teens really this obsessed with sex and relationships? A very sexualized account of teen high school romances. The plot was completely predictable, no surprises. The most disappointing thing is how casually sex is treated, no encouragement toward abstention, the author promotes the idea that high school girls will have sex, so just accept it and keep condoms handy. The author promotes the idea, \\"Who wants to be a virgin?\\". Being a virgin is so uncool. Save your time, there are many, much better books out there to read for teens and adults who like the YA genre. This is just a book full of predictable teenage high school drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book Eva!","review":"This is an awesome book!!!!!!!!! Recommend this book to older teens tho.

READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and Shallow","review":"This book was a pretty big waste of time. It revolved way too much around teenage boy horniness (the main character, musician Toby, constantly envisions Sarah in rather explicit and degrading ways) and had very little context of what real human beings with substantial emotions include. These characters were shallow and ignorant, and the main conflict was extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend this as a good teen read by any means. Choose something more realistic and valuable to enjoy, such as any of Sarah Dessen's young adult novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is TERRIBLE!!!!","review":"I am very disappointed and cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would like it. The language is awful. I am half way through the book and am litteraly ready to throw it in the garbage(which I never do) because I can't stand the characters saying that something is \\"mad wrong\\" or \\"like\\" totally this or that even one more time. The funny part is that these characters are supposed to be intellegent! Intellegent teenagers DO NOT say \\"like\\" before every other word and DO NOT use the term \\"mad wrong\\" or \\"mad\\" anything!!! I am disgusted with this book and author and would not recomend this to any teenager. Lets show children and teens how to speak well and not dumb them down and make them think that it's ok to speak so poorly. I have read plenty of wonderful YA novels, but this one falls very short. Complete waste of money. Sorry about the rant, but it was that bad and I feel duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired of the same old story.","review":"This book was boring for a while. I think it didn't get interesting until halfway through it. There was a lot of language which was boring. I could relate a little to the book since I too grew up in NJ and fell in love in high school. At the same time I really am tired with reading about people having sex, but at least this one made it more realistic of how a girl would feel if her boyfriend has already been with someone else and you are a virgin. I just really think it isn't worth reading since there is nothing that truly stands out about it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny and Predictable","review":"I knew from the reviews that this book was about a high school relationship so I had my doubts. I guess I just didn't expect it to be so predictable. I was irritated by how corny and one dimensional everything was.Girl dates popular jock; realizes that he is an egotistical jerk with jerk friends; girl dumps him for misfit boy who has been trying to work his way into girl's heart; everything is wonderful and dandy; big secret comes out and crumbles the happy couple; they make up and live happily ever after.It was an alright book but was too typical and superficial for me. Nothing different or excited happened. It wasn't a unique teen relationship story but rather a safe, ho-hum one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun read..","review":"This was a very fun, light read, with great characters. I very much enjoyed this sweet, young love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teen Read","review":"I absolutely loves this book and couldn't put it down!! I loved the way Colasanti did the alternating view points so that you can read it not only from Saras viewpoint, but Tobey's also. I was rooting for Tobey the whole way!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"The writing in this book is very thin -- as are the characters, the dialogue, and the plot. I found it boring and a bad read. Instead, I would recommend Sarah Dessen's books. Dessen's books don't feel like a waste of time, which this one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read","review":"My friend gave me this book, and i finshed it in one day. I love this book because Sara and Tobey act the same way that real teenagers would in this situation. I'm glad that Sara and Tobey got together, even though they were total opposites. The yin-yang symbol was great, i'm glad she used it in the book because it shows how people can be different when you first look at them, but they actually fit together nicely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When Sex Happens","review":"The writing style of this author is not particularly good. The plot line is not at all creative. However, I'll give the author credit: her writing does create a strong sensory appeal, by using descriptions of sounds and sights and smells.The subject matter of this book concerns me. The whole focus in the second half of the book is sex--will they have sex? Or won't they? The book gets very lusty. I don't care if you're an adult or a teen; should sex be the central focus of a romantic relationship? Aside from physical attraction, the two main characters have a relationship based on things like enjoying the same music and liking mustard on their burgers. That's deep. I wonder what the title is referring to--when what happens? A good relationship? Or sex? Sex might be a valid topic for teens, so maybe the sex subject isn't what bothered me so much. Sensuality combined with shallowness is what got to me. Yuck.I wouldn't offer this book to my kids as a reading option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't they offer FIFTEEN stars?","review":"Part of what made this book so amazing for me is that I could relate so well. I couldn't go a full page without reading something so perfectly put into words that made me laugh out loud, cry, or jump up and down. One of the many super cool things about it was how it went back and forth between Tobey and Sara. You get to see a few scenes from each of their points of view. I love the language and music references, because they are exactly how my friends and I talk.... which makes sense, because the author is a high school teacher. All in all, it was a phenomenal book, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought me back to those tenuous years of teen age romance","review":"I thought the author's ability to take me into the hearts and minds of the characters was wonderful. When I put the book down they stayed in my head and my understanding of their different needs and challenges continued to develop. Her ability to communicate the reality of the trials of sexual tension that occur in the hormonally challenged life of a teenager was insightful. It brought me back to the 'way back when of adolescence'.I think it was a remarkable book for a first novel and I can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply captivating!","review":"this books keeps you begging for more tobey and sara. the chemistry between them makes it difficult to put down and upsetting to finish. susane colasanti is outstanding! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bright & brilliant book","review":"Susane Colasanti's novel is a brilliant, sensuous trip through the psyches of its characters. I read it on the train and I was sorry when I reached my stop with a few chapters to go. The dual first-person narrative generates great empathy for the protagonists. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book was in the library window at my school, so I thought it would be good.

The main character in the movie is Pauline, a teenager, vacationing at the beach with her older cousin. The older cousin is married, but not happily married. During their vacation, they meet some men, have conversations about life, and love. We see relationships develop, others fall apart, some tell the truth, and others lie. What this film illustrates, in such a subtle way, is the people who are honest are the ones who are the most happy. Those who lie to others, or to themselves, seem stuck in a melancholic exsistance. By the end of the movie, it turns out the teenage girl is the one who is the wisest of them all.The DVD has good picture quality, as good as from any movie made in the 1980's I have seen. You can turn the subtitles on or off, unlike some DVDs that burn the subtitles into the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The read that inspires men's souls.","review":"I read this book prior to going on my sixth grade trip to Monticello, Jamestown, Yorktown, and Williamsburg, Virginia.

It is a great book to share with friends. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So, Nothing Special","review":"This book is just a little bit better than Visual Basic Design Patterns.

And they did not disappoint. MAGIC ROOSTER BLUES, COLD BOY SMILE, DARLING OF THE UNDERGROUND PRESS are rare and unreleased songs that make thier debut here. My only compliant is that the dvd has like 6 or 7 more songs, very sad that they couldn't have included more tunes on here that are on the dvd like MY HEARTS KILLING ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite unplugged.","review":"With the brothers cooperating enough to make music, things always cook. I was expecting something more stripped down, there are backing singers and some very electric sounds, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a fresh look at Crows music. If your a fan this will be enjoyable, if you're not, its still a well done disc of live music by the brothers Robinson.Id still like to hear Chris and Rich with folk guitars on a quiet sound stage alone, but this will suffice for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robinsons still capable of surprises!","review":"Birds of a feather gets better with every listening. Chris Robinson's vocals can often verge on being irritating but when he gets it right they soar with a gritty, soulful resonance - reminding me of early Steve Marriott. Rich Robinson's guitar playing is both effective and accomplished, without ever being overly flamboyant. The songs are the strongest aspect of the album. Both the originals and covers work really well together - with the exception of John Martyn's \\"Over the hill', which is a pale shadow of the original. Overall, an excellent live CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Box Set, but...","review":"...if you are going to be spending this hefty chunk of change on an authentic instruments performance of Mozart's Symphonies, you might as well spend a little more and get the Hogwood/AAM set.

The plots were not a gripping as other books Diana Wynne Jones has written. The wonderful unexpected endings, and plot twists in most of her other books simply are not there. I also think that the characters are much harder to relate to. All of the stories would have been better if they were developed more. I would recommend not spending money on this book and buying \\"The Chronicles of Chrestomanci- Volume 1,\\" or \\"The Chronicles of Chrestomanci- Volume 2.\\" Unlike this one, these books are better the second, third, or forth time. If your library has this book, don't spend the money. If not, it is good enough to buy just to read once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, Beautiful Puzzle!","review":"My 3-year-old has a great time with this puzzle.

I recently re-read it after many years and it carries a freshness that many of today's books could do well to emulate. Although it can't be expected to compete with the contemporary classics such as \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years\\" by Richard G.

If you haven't already read it, you are in for a rare treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychology of religion","review":"This is one of the more challenging books I've ever read.

How does Jamie Luner's character, Naomi, manage to spend so much time with the escaped con, Tyler Pierce (played in lacklustre-style by Michael Madsen) when her other half has threatened to kill Pierce and has seen Pierce and Naomi plotting behind his back?

This is one movie you can most defiantly avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"COULDN'T GET PAST THE FIRST STUPID HORRIFIC SCENE. WHAT A WASTE!ANGELA SAID: THIS KIND OF MOVIE MAKES THE WORLD WORSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW MOVING AND PREDICTABLE","review":"SACRIFICE is another entry in the cache of director Mark L. Lester. Michael Madsen once again tries his Bruce Willis imitation, and although he's a little more effective than usual, his weak performance drags the film down a good bit. Bokeem Woodbine offers little in his role as the frustrated FBI agent; Jamie Luner is luminous but does some pretty stupid things in the movie; Deborah Shelton (Body Double, Dallas) portrays Masden's ex-wife and though I've always enjoyed both her beauty and skill, neither is evident in this whiny role. The movie is slow moving and little suspense is introduced or maintained. It could have a lot more impact with better performances and direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent don't buy. Movie about an anti-abortion serial killer","review":"Jamie Luner sublimely transcends another bad movie. Otherwise,there's nothing to recommend it. Summaries you may read areinaccurate. For example: \\"The daughter of an ex-conbecomes the latest victim to a serial killer eluding the FBI. Herfather and boyfriend join together to track the killer.\\" Wrong,the boyfriend is hardly involved.The story takes place entirely against the backgroundof abortion. There's some bad acting (the drug dealer inparticular) and characters act in unlikely ways. Why doesn'tNaomi yell out when she has the chance? Why does Namoi have so much free time?Also, abortion clinics are usually very careful whom theyemploy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless without the text","review":"The works in this album have little or no music at all, they are basically in the Singspiel style. Only a short summary is presented in the notes, and the German text is nowhere to be found in the internet. If you can't follow the dialogues - one of them in Bavarian dialect -, this album amounts to A very frustrating two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the wrong cd listed!","review":"I made the mistake of ordering this title several times before realizing that the listing is incorrect. Apparently, the reference number for Limited Brazen Sound matches up with something entirely different. So, if you order it, you will receive something else! Be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching for the Best Sunscreen","review":"We ordered this sunscreen after reading the Consumer Reports review which rated this product as one of the few that are very good at blocking UVA. It was almost impossible to squeeze out the product from the bottles and when it did come out it was extremely clumpy and did not spread easily. My husband contacted the manufacturer and received a reply that they had an issue with one of the batches. So they sent us two bottles to replace the ones we had received, except they sent us the kid's version. The new bottles were better but still had small clumps that were very difficult to spread out. It took a lot rubbing to get it to look decent (i.e. not all white and clumpy sitting on top of skin.) We will continue our search and try the next two items on the Consumer Report list... Banana Boat Sport Performance Active Dry Protection Spray and Coppertone Sport High Performance Ultra Sweatproof."},{"rating":"2","title":"NATURAL AND WORKS WELL","review":"I only gave this 4 stars because of having to wait 30mins for it to dry before going into the pool. I really like that is Oxybenzone-free, paraben-free, fragrance-free; Safe for sensitive skin. I use it on my 4yr old as well. It does work well in the texas sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"So lumpy it wouldn't come out of the tube","review":"I also bought this based upon the excellent rating by Consumer Reports. I should have read the amazon reviews, but didn't even look at them or how many stars reviewers gave it because of the CR rating. The first few squeezes were difficult and there were lumps of sunscreen on my grandson. Then after awhile, I couldn't squeeze out any more sunscreen. Requested and received a refund. From now on, I'll always check amazon reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as others","review":"Bought this at Sprouts today based on EWG review and sure enough a major ingredient is oxybenzone.

Back to Sprouts tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Oxybenzone Free\\" or not?","review":"The title and picture say natural or \\"Oxybenzone Free\\". Description says Oxybenzone (6%). Which is it?I cancelled my order once I noticed the discrepency.Apearently I need to use more words to qualify for Amazon's posting of my review.I've noticed more and more often that the pricture and descriptions don't match on Amazon.\\"Oxybenzone Free\\" is one of the reasons I wished to purchase this sunscren. The \\"Oxybenzone Free\\" product is also nano free. I have no idea if the non- \\"Oxybenzone Free\\" product uses nano-particles or not.The plan was to buy this as a test of the product. It turns out that I can buy it locally for the same price at a store I already frequent.I'll post later on how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains oxybenzone and octinoxate! DO NOT BUY!","review":"I ordered this sunscreen because it was rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group. When I received it, I was horrified to find that it contains 6% oxybenzone AND octinoxate 7.2%. EWG lists both of these ingredients as hazardous. For some reason, these ingredients are not listed on the EWG web page, but they are listed as active ingredients on tube. If EWG knew of these ingredients, I don't think the sunscreen would receive the safe rating they give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oxybenzone","review":"I also bought this product based upon the EWG rating and, having just received it today, was likewise horrified to find that it contains oxybenzone, vitamin A, as well as a litany of other ingredients which I was specifically trying to avoid, especially when paying a premium price. Obviously, they changed their formulation since EWG purchased theirs. There are better options, like Vanicream and Purple Prairie, which I also ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sunscreen","review":"I was really excited when this sunscreen arrived, I had been searching for one with the supposedly safer zinc oxide. First off the bottle is poorly designed, it becomes very hard to squeeze the sunscreen out. I had to unscrew the cap and widen the hole with a tool! Then applying it is not fun at all, it doesn't spread easily and has a weird texture. Lastly, this is a terrible sunscreen for workouts. It basically blocks your pores so your skin can't breathe properly. As soon as you start to exercise, every place you've applied the sunscreen will start dripping with sweat and then your skin will look milky white. This happens even before you begin to exercise rigorously. I definitely do NOT recommend this sunscreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for!","review":"I bought this Sunscreen lotion on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. I took it on a recent cruise and found that it was so thick, it was difficult spreading it over my skin. This might be a good product as far as sun protection, but if you can't run it in, then it's no good to me at all. Will toss this in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Thick","review":"This was highly rated by Consumer Report for UVA and UVB protection. The major problem is that it is very difficult to spread evenly. It has somewhat of a thick course texture. I went back to NO-AD 45 SUNBLOCK which is rated just as high. The NO-AD is also very easy to spread and a less expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sunscreen for swimmers I have found","review":"My son swims on a club team 23 hours a week and has always resisted sunscreen other than the stick for his fact, but he loves this and USES it! After the first bottle, I went back to Amazon and bought two more and will continue to buy them. It seems to last his entire practice and since the coach doesn't let them get out to reapply, that is very important. And it's only a 3 on EWG safe score, which is the lowest I can find for one that works that effectively for swimmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ingredient list, terrible product","review":"I purchased this sunscreen, like many others, because it looked to be about the best value among the sunscreens that are considered to be the safest from an ingredients list standpoint. This sunscreen passes muster on the ingredient list but the practical application just plain stinks. The product is impossible to evenly apply leaving white clumps with every application. Considering that there are many, many products that have just as safe a rating, you should avoid this one until they can improve their formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"All terrain AquaSport SPF30 Natural Sunscreen Lotion","review":"I was looking forward to trying it because Consumers Reports rated it very high. The product must have been expired because it had lumps and was a dry pasty texture. I had to cut off the top of the tube just to get any lotion from the tube. I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I bought this product after a favorable review in Consumers Reports. At first the product was thick and hard to apply. Then after a couple of uses the lotion wouldn't come out of the tube at all. The bottom split out of the tube in trying to get out. Maybe the supplier sold me an outdated product?"},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE SUN BLOCK FOR CHILDREN","review":"I purchased this product for my 4 year old great nephew who has a very fair complexion. We have used it on him one time so far while he was at the beach and he did not burn at all. It has somewhat of a sticky feel when applying it (he didn't mind) but that is why it has the great protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age adventure at Brittany's Beaches...","review":"During the late 50s Frédérique and Sophie, two sisters 13 and eight years old, are sent with a governess to spend their summer in Brittany.

It displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes! Did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars? (Yes, the cigarettes and the smoke were real, not CG.) I think they should have omitted such scenes from the script, because it displays a behavior that's not only illegal in several countries, but also threatening to both society and childhood. No matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie, I give it a disgusting 1, and this is the last movie I ever watch that depicts smoking children. To those that haven't yet watched this movie, please DON'T WATCH IT, unless you want cancer to win the health wars.And here I hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker: if you want to depict smoking children, use COMPUTER GRAPHICS instead of the REAL THING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I tried it with my DIRECTV HR20 and my Samsung Blu-ray player. Neither worked either together or with the other unplugged from the switch. The remote did not work either. Maybe it was the battery, but since the unit didn't work, I didn't bother trying a different one. No instructions except on the back of the box. No support number and no troubleshooting hints or website. Even for $47 you would expect it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I rcv'd one of these little units from the seller and could not get it to work - These things happen occasionally. Called seller and they sent me another one ( the seller has been very helpful with my problem ). Got new unit and while I at least had video this time, there was no audio - the switch is a dud. Seller is taking both units back and giving me a refund. By the way this little switch is being sold under several names by different sellers - be carefull what you are buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, my ears...","review":"I must admit I was extremely disappointed with this CD. The music is cringe-inducing and discordant, and the lyrics (when you can make them out) don't make a stitch of sense. It also doesn't help that the lead singer seems to slur all the words together. One track in particular, which had two female vocalists whose voices clashed horribly, drove me close to insanity. Towards the end of another track, the song breaks out into thirty seconds of nonstop noise. This is not my own interpretation of noise, it is literally in every sense of the word, meaningless noise. For a while I was almost convinced that I had a defective CD. Unfortunately I didn't. Needless to say I ended up throwing the CD out, because everyone I tried to give it to didn't want it. Believe me, listening to this CD is marginally less fun than eating a jar of rancid mayonnaise."},{"rating":"2","title":"an oldie but still a top fav","review":"I remember listening to this on long car rides so long ago. A great album featuring three different female vocalists. Morella's Forest singer, Sydney Rentz, Tess Wiley, and His Name is Alive singer, Karen Oliver. Each song is a dreamy mix bound to make you smile. I only wish Trey Many kept making albums like this. Tooth and Nail doesn't make them like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a find!","review":"I was lucky enough to find this used, already having \\"Fall Sounds\\" and \\"Songs from the Rainwater EP\\". I must say this one blows the other two away! The mix is really impressive; lush and full, but very substantial. The singing is terrific, too. As a His Name Is Alive fan, Karin Oliver's voice is always a treat to hear! \\"Bittersweet\\" has an electronic backing track with melodic intertwining guitars for a unique and beautiful sound. \\"Pressed Flower\\" has the mesmerizing juxtaposition of Karin's soothing vocals with heavy guitar distortion. \\"Under Heaven\\", \\"Tumble\\", and \\"Monochrome\\" are also incredible. Don't miss this if you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording quality leaves much to be desired...","review":"I bought \\"Of Color Bright\\" because I had heard, and enjoyed, one of the songs from the album. The music on this album isn't bad; in fact it's rather nice, relaxing and flows well. Unfortunately, the recording quality of the lyrics is abysmal. It sounds as though the lead singer was recorded from three rooms away through a tin can. This results in the lyrics being slurred and almost indecipherable and ends up sounding like the lead singer has a speech impediment. If you can get over the quality of the recorded lyrics, you might find an enjoyable listen. For me though, it was a bit too aggravating to bother. In any case, make sure you check the preview clips before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!!!","review":"Where do I begin to find the words to describe the glorious work of Musica Antiqua Koln led by Reinhard Goebel. He changed the way I listen to Bach. The recordings in this collection are extraordinary.So why only four stars? This is because I believe there are much better recordings out there of the Brandenburg Concertos...the real treasures here are the works for Violin and Harpsichord and the works for Flute and Harpsichord. Simply unsurpassed!!!For the Brandenburgs I recommend eitherBach: The Brandenburg Concertos,Bach: Brandenburg Concertos BWV 1046-1051 /New London Consort * Pickett,Bach - Brandenburg Concertos / Rousset, AAM, HogwoodorJ.S.

There is much to laugh about while listening to this collection and one can only hope that more recordings of this wordsmith will be forthcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection, but live performance better","review":"We bought this collection of Billy Collins' poems shortly after being introduced to him by friends who lent us the CD of Billy Collins' live performance at Peter Norton Hall (with the intro by Bill Murray). This collection has a few of the same poems as the other, but not enough duplication to make this an unwise choice. I enjoy listening to this collection, but get a little more enjoyment from the lively and responsive atmosphere that the audience gives the uninterrrupted live performance. Still, I haven't heard any other of his readings, so this is a very small sample to be judging from. In the end, I don't think you can go wrong with either CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD of poetry I can listen to repeatedly","review":"That's rare! If you have ever been in a poetry workshop, you must hear his \\"Workshop\\" poem. It's almost a stand up comedy piece, but don't trivialize these poems by concentrating on the humor. There is much seriousness & beauty here too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marta's Opinion","review":"The title enticed me to buy this book, but the actual scripts from various women didn't impart as much wisdom as I'd hoped.

He can develop atmosphere, characters and plot quickly and believably with incredible imagination. The short story, The Engineer, is no exception, and is my favorite Asher work. However, I was quite disappointed that this release of short stories, The Engineer Reconditioned, is nothing more than an update of the The Engineer published under a different label in 1998. I was expecting a full novel continuing the premise of the earlier work. Instead I received the same short story under a new name with some slight revisions.

It may be as fun as some people claim, I don't know. I couldn't get past the first scene. I would walk a few steps, and then my computer would crash. Over and over again.

This game wouldn't even load and kept crashing the system, even to the \\"blue screen\\" of dumping physical memory. I ran all patches, changed video modes, changed compatibility modes and nothing would work. If that's any indication of what's left for problems if it ever runs, check out the other reviews of those who actually got it to work...lots of problems.

Sure, the scenery graphics look great, but don't be fooled...just wait until you have to navigate the screens - You will think you are a beta-tester at a video game company...in the EARLY stages of development.Most games have at least one saving grace that makes me glad I experienced them, but not this one. ugh! I may have to just chuck it out with the garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I just finished playing this game last night. It was the worse adventure game I've ever played. The dialogue is inane. The voice acting is horrible. The body language is goofy. The navigation is a painful exercise in frustration. The puzzles and tasks are either pointless or impossibly difficult or both. I had to consult two different walkthroughs just to get through some of the puzzles.It's really too bad because the visuals are stunning. The graphics and colors are very good and the cutscenes are especially nice. But these things are not enough to save this game from being truly awful to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished, Unprofessional, Unplayable","review":"This is junk. The \\"designers\\" have incorporated some of the worst game design mistakes in the past ten years, all in a single package. Poor voice acting, terrible pathfinding, dull art and little music or ambient noise. Worst of all, utterly broken puzzles, with no clues, no feedback, just random clicking on pylons or items scattered randomly over the landscape. This is a disaster -- did these people not do ANY playtesting??? Have they never played a game before themselves???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not buy unless you love torture!","review":"I recently purchased Journey to the center of the earth. It is an inventory based game that I bought because of the promised beautiful graphics. This is a beautiful looking game that is extremely hard because it is extremely linear; if you forget to look at something or if you didn't do something in the exact order, you will not find your way to other screens. This game will be great for people who love inventory, who love to click on every single inch of the screen to find something, or find a way out of the screen. I feel the game play is outdated and the acting is babyish and the story and persons in it, illogical. The story would have made a lot of sense if she was in a coma or dreaming. I needed a walk through and the directions on the walk through were still wrong. If you like to pull your hair out and get a headache, get this game. I gave up half way because I was not enjoying the beautiful graphics. This was not fun at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst zeppelin film ever","review":"THis so could movie was outragoisly boring....They talked about''Jeff Beck more than they do Robert Plant and all it is old english guys talkiin about crap, Sure it gives the story of zeppelin but there is no music by zeppelin , no live fotage but just pictures.

And of course, we can't forget foremothers such as the Schoolgirls, Runaways and Suzi Quatro. These gals cover a lot of familiar territory, with plenty of jailbait-y pouting and lyrical snarls, but they do hit some solid grooves, and do dip back into the fuzz-drenched 'Sixties grab-bag for a tune or two.

Sparkling white, no sediment of any sort. A great product that I recommend wholeheartedly. It even smells nice (unless you let it sit a long time -- then the chlorine comes through).OK, so then, why the low starrage? 'cause it's sold in the drugstore for three sixty-nine a bottle, that's why -- and that's why you should buy it THERE, not here.

The bleach smell was overwhelming, even with the windows open and a fan going.I decided to try it on some outdoor furniture that was dirty. It didn't really do much except for killing some mossy growth in the corner of one of the chairs. It didn't make much of a difference on the dirt, even with scrubbing. I sprayed the product on the chairs and let them sit for 10 or 15 minutes and tried again. Still didn't touch it.So then I mixed up someChurch & Dwight Co 51516 Oxi Clean Versatile Stain Removeraccording to directions, and applied it with a rag and let that sit for 10 minutes on both the outdoor furniture and shower floor.

The Gospels are immediate because you are there, you are taking part, you are the one Jesus is talking to. I have never felt \\"a part of the Gospel\\". In fact, the readings were always very distant and disconnected from my life.

I read the original, but found it dense and difficult to follow. Dr. McCormick has done a masterful job of translating Franklin's language while still retaining the underlying meaning.The stories Franklin tells are fantastic, it is almost a primer on how to be successful in business. Many of the pitfalls he encounters are the same as what someone today would run into.

Something that struck me immediately when I first did this workout was the music. I love studio dance classes with live African drumming, and although the drum music Jennifer uses in the warm up does not appear to be live, it certainly has that feel. For me, music is much more motivating than \\"encouraging words\\" from the the instructor, and that music component is often missing in exercise DVDs. Often, the music is too quiet to be motivating, even if good selections were made. The production on this DVD is perfect as far as the sound goes. The music is loud enough, yet we can still hear Jennifer perfectly well. Yeah! The workout works the legs particularly well and has a nice cool down stretch at the end.

The Micro original is super small and pocket sized, however the screw driver features are clumsy and fat, making them limited to very few screws, and not even that great at unscrewing/screwing (good luck getting a solid lock!). The plier function is also poor- the teeth are glossed over, making the 'bite' poor and slippery- this is not helped by the device being so small that you can't get enough leverage to do whatever you wanted to do.The Micro-Max for a few dollars more doesn't address any of the issues above, however it at least comes with a few more features that aren't half bad, and it isn't much larger as well.Swiss Tech has some really innovative designs, but the way they execute them is quite disappointing.

I bought this chain leash, and it works great. Sometimes she'll still chew it a bit, but it won't damage the leash in any way. I thought 4 feet sounded short for a leash (my nylon leash was a little longer), but 4 feet is actually a great length for a puppy. It lets her roam around a bit, but ultimately keeps her close to my side (and away from danger). The nylon loop lets me hold onto the leash comfortably without trying to grab onto a chain.I'm glad I bought this product, and if I ever get another puppy, I would order another one of these leashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD for the Martial Artist","review":"Great CD for learning terminology of the Martial Arts.

Instead, these stories were all disappointing.The four by Twain and the two by Crane were interesting, but the endings were so anti-climactic that I was left wondering, \\"is that it?!\\" In particular The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County left me scratching my head at how such a pointless story became so famous. The two stories by Bierce were difficult for me to follow, and at the end I really didn't even know what they were about. The two stories by London were, not surprisingly, about men alone in the frozen northern wilderness. One barely makes it out alive and one freezes to death; not exactly my choice of entertaining and captivating reading.In spite of the big name authors, these stories are insipid yawners."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"Although the short tales are written using a well crafted English they do not say anything. English is my second language and I was hoping to learn more about classic american literature. I was disappointed because there is not a single good story in all the classics. It's just well detailed descriptions of mundane tales. For example mark twain talks about a tax guy who moved to a new town and end up auditing the narrator, or Jack London going on and on about a guy trying to build a fire in a freezing cold area. If you are looking for highly predictable stories with no surprises and complex English you will like it.

It literally put me to sleep, like anaesthesia. The beginning is interesting--discussing the early bands Smile and Ibex that eventually became QUEEN thanks to the force of Nature Freddie Mercury. Ironically, Freddie Mercury's bio is cursory, despite him being the front man. There's more emphasis on Roger Taylor and Brian May. Freddie Mercury becomes a cameo in his life story. The beginning is gradual, but by the time it gets to QUEEN--it moves way to fast. Suddenly, QUEEN is doing music forIron Eagle--butFlash Gordon (Saviour Of The Universe Edition)is omitted. It goes so fast that it seems their career last 5 minutes before Mercury passes away from AIDS.\\"Becoming Queen\\" could've been as flamboyant and fun as QUEEN's rock operatic music... instead it's a sleeper. It's a good cure for insomnia. We will, we will, bore you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst queen documentary ever","review":"I cannot understand why some of the other reviewers gave more than 1 star to that crappy documentary.

But instead, over half deals with Mitchell's experience as an astronaut and his personal life. Mitchell claims to have a magic recipe - a \\"dyadic model\\", which is the thoughtful merger of science and spirituality. I thought it would make an adequate inclusion of spirituality, but instead, the author examines certain mystical phenomena and promptly claims to take the truth from each...in his own fashion, and then retorts that such and such people's view about the event...many of its interpretations, were wrong. This is not a merger of science and spirituality, it is taking all the meat from a spiritual body and just leaving the bones. This debases and is insulting to many spiritual and cultural traditions throughout the world. This is just a propaganda for Mitchell's own particular, quasi atheist view of reality, and one that serves to finance his institute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music - it's the total package","review":"Susan Rhea sings this music straight from the heart.

Specifically, the pages are so crammed full of text and colors that it is often difficult to quickly find specific information. Much of the text and many of the examples fail to adequately prepare the student for the exercise sets. Additionally, the accompanying solution manual, which helped me immensely, has numerous typos and is missing several pages of solutions. I wish I were alone in my opinion, but the overwhelming majority of my class felt about the same. Even our professor was less than impressed.

But if you have had any lingering doubts about the worthlessness of his writings, try absorbing this pompous and meaningless volume. Eisenman's usual tactic is to overlay a verbal or diagrammatic complexity on his subject matter; real or more pragmatic issues are ignored in favor of highly improbable theoretical assumptions. Eisenman indulges himself with meandering arguments that evidently seem impressive to him, but do not withstand critical analysis of any worthwhile sort. That there is a complete lack of clarity in Eisenman's thinking has always been the case. The \\"Blurred\\" of the title says it all. Don't be taken in by the con."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Blather","review":"From the pretentious title to the closing endpaper this book is jammed with the now hackneyed archi-speak that Eisenman et al impress themselves with. But mostly its the same old abstract blather. Whatever happened to the good-old days when young architects sought to be socially and artistically responsible, and were willing to learn how to craft a building through an understanding of construction and detail? Pied Piper Eisenman (via Benjamin and the other gooks) shows there is another, cruder, more ignorant path that can be taken much more easily. Take it at your peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"Strictly for the pretentious student, 'Blurred Zones'is a veritable catalog of every half-baked, poorly considered jargonisticly-driven notion that made so much of 1990's architecture the wrong-headed foolishness it was.

An authentic pre-Civil War expression of pro-slavery sentiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"The range of issues covered by Jane Smiley in her last three works is extensive. She has gone from family relationships (A Thousand Acres) to academic institutions (Moo) to a much larger palette in this novel with her snapshot of Kansas in 1855. Although I found the first half of the novel at times tedious (possibly a reflection on the New England characters that frequent it?), the second half (where Lidie is on her own) is compeling. It is a fascinating study of her emerging self-awareness and self-worth. She learns in the process that life's situations are not black or white but most often gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my interest after awhile...","review":"This was a very absorbing book at the beginning. But by the middle I was bored. The characters were no longer interesting at all. Even Lidie who was, after all, the focus of the story and, thus, the most well-developed character became frustrating to me. I was no longer rooting for her, even though I wanted to. The beginning of the book was great; maybe that's why I expected more out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding & entertaining!","review":"This was the first Jane Smiley book I had ever read.

I never could get into the book...it took me almost 2 months to finish. I never got a handle on Thomas: why he married Lidie, was he wise or weak, etc. Despite being written in the 1st person as Lidie, I never understood her either.

The dense political commentary is clearly and vividly read and may actually be more interesting than in text form.While I, too, got ansy to get back to the story of Liddie and Thomas, I was also gratified to receive an education on the tangled history of Kansas/Missouri relations. I had no idea that this was part of our country's history.Liddie's narrative was so genuine (and obviously well-researched)that I often forgot it was fiction. The details of homesteading, steamboat travel, and pioneer life are outstanding. The only reason for not awarding 5 stars is the proponderence of political detail, which was a bit of overkill. Still, historical fiction readers will not want to miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine brisk read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. To me, it didn't drag at all, in fact I found it brisk. Every detail seemed relevant, and just the type of thing a person like Lidie would actually write about. I have to chuckle at the reviewers who say Smiley is too wordy and descriptive in this book. As a reader of Charles Dickens, I found that this book positively clips along by comparison. I wouldn't change a word of it (nor of Dickens).

Offers a very clever variation on the Uncle Tom's Cabin flight. I still grin to think of her actually being abducted by the slave. This book served Jane Smiley well as her foray into this genre.

This book is in line with the God of more than enough, the God of Love, the God of Salvation...If you have been in a church that is more concerned with legalism that scripture, I would highly recommend this book. The limits placed on God by various religions is wrong and serves only to further the church's power and not God's Holy word.Rick Godwin of Summit Christian Center in San Antonio had quoted from this book at a men's conference.

When I got mine, though, I was disappointed. There was a small plastic floater inside the glass bottle, and try as I may, I couldn't get it out. I know people who buy glass bottles typically do so because animals will chew on them and that can be bad for their health, however, the toxins in plastic can leech out into water, so having any plastic prolonged direct contact with water is a bad idea. Most people probably aren't worried about one tiny floater, and because this is only my rabbits travel bottle I'm not too concerned.

Thermoelectric (Peltier Effect) coolers are great when they work but they tend to gradually decrease in performance as condensation causes corrosion between the junctions that ends up resulting in a short which blows the fuse in the power supply.This unit isn't very well made and as you can tell from MANY MANY negative reviews will sadly fail despite it's great looks.I may repair mine once more and then switch to a compressor model because I don't have the time or patience to repair it every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift.

Paid $155 at Lowe's 15 months ago. I thought at first it should be getting cool faster, but must be the technology used. For white wine, must be set on maximum cool, which means the fans never stop running, and are not that quiet. Month 15, noticed my wine was warm. Found lower inside fan encased in ice behind the panel. Removed the panel, thawed the ice, and let dry. Surprising, the fan still works, but I have been running it for two days and can't get it below 50 degrees. Would like 40, but would settle for low 40's.

We were out of town when it happened and figured that the person watching the house had left the door slightly open and the motors overheated. Then we saw the reviews online and it confirmed the problem.This item is great to look at and the perfect height to set next to most bar settings in your home, but its not worth 200, which we paid, if you KNOW its going to break down after a year. I mean there isnt even any surprise at this point, if you buy one its going to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 4 months","review":"This thing worked well until it broke 4 months later. I didn't stress it by putting it on a cold setting, it just quit. No power is getting to the unit, and the light won't even turn on. Shipping on the warranty is cost prohibitive, better to just buy a more reputable wine cooler. Furthermore, if you live in a southern state, you should avoid thermoelectric based coolers in general. They are cheap, and use less electricity, and are do not result in wide swings in temperature as compared to compressor based units. However, in order to avoid stressing them they have to be within a nice mild ambient temperature range. In the summer I program my thermostat to go up during the day while I'm away from home. This raises the temperature to an unacceptable level and a thermoelectric will not be able to keep up. If you live in the south, and don't crank up the a/c during the summer, avoid a thermoelectric."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor product","review":"We purchased one of these wine coolers in October of 2007.

That seemed to work but after putting all the bottles back, (and they were all cold since we put them in the refrigerator) they just got warm again. All the lights and fan still work, just doesn't stay cold. Called the Haier number, they said there is no repair for not cooling and they would send a new one. You have to send them the serial tags, receipt, 8-in of the power cord and check for $14.99 for \\"partial\\" shipping charges. They will send one FEDEX.

It teaches you to write stand-alone assembly programs in DOS AND Windows. The book is full of examples which are explained in detail.

So read the book and with the information it profides you must try to make your own programs in order to check if you really understand it.But I must make clear that this book ONLY teaches you to WRITE programs in assembly. If you need basic information about the architecture of the 8086/8088 family (how memory and processor works etc.) this is not a good book to begin with.

The only con I can come up with on this necklace is that the outer dragon whisker is sharp, so I wouldn't wear this while getting rowdy or playing sports, otherwise you'll end up with a slashed up chest.

I'm not sure why it gets the bad reputation. Yes, it is salty, intense and concentrated. So you're supposed to use it sparingly! It adds richness and a flavor punch to toast and sandwiches. It's really good on buttered toast with mashed avocado--perfect balance of fat and salt. There's a bit of a tang to it. It's also great in a grilled cheese. Hell, I lick the spoon after I use it...

I can accept the lack of notes. But I can not accept translations of Aristophanes that cut some of his funniest scenes!For instance, in the translation of Thesmophoriazusae, the unmasking of Mnesilochus (line 600 and after) is gutted. Lines 610-617 are gone (Mnesilochus' urination excuse), but more importantly, the whole climax of the scene -- the hilarious physical comedy where he tries to maintain his female disguise (lines 643-649) -- is nowhere to be seen.It's hard to imagine that an editor would allow 19th century prudery to ruin a 20th century edition of Aristophanes, but there you are.Despite the cheap price, this book is no bargain.

The language of the present translations, on the other hand, is stiff, obscure and scarcely readable. The publisher has done us a great service by compiling all of the Aristophanes plays into a single volume, but should reissue the collection in a better, more modern translation, one which does justice to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn from my mistake","review":"You may look at the Bantam Classics edition of Aristophanes and think \\"Wow, what a deal!

As with all Splinter Group releases, the sound is excellent, both in a technical and artistic sense. This band is doing a great job of exploring a kind of light acoustic blues-rock, somewhat like John Mayall's \\"The Turning Point\\". Green's guitar is as good as it ever was.

There's not a need to make more garbage movies, even if it's done by Christians. This is what \\"Unidentifed\\" is, all's the pity, because the concept had potential.UFO things always sell. And there's a strong belief in the Christian community about a UFO-demonic connection. So we make a movie about it.What you ultimately get, however, is a lot of dangling plot lines that are never resolved, wooden characters, wooden dialogue, illogical conclusions, and ham-fisted proselitzing. This sort of work does more damage to those it's seeking to win over.They get the stars for the effort, not the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"I'm glad ,that many people liked it, they didn't lose their time and money.

I originally heard their post-punk masterpiece 'The Dawning of this Night Divine' on Song..Penalty Box and loved it, so I borrowed the album. Wow, was I in for a shock. From the masterful power (music and lyrics) of Backwards Thinking to the pop-punk-hardcore of Broken Circles, the strange sounds of Queen Maggot and Blank Stare to the straight up punk of Heresy and Sick And You're Wrong. One Track Mind has some awesome riffs, and track 7 has some of the strangest guitars known to man. A great experimental album, full of angst and vigor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest disappointment of my music listening life","review":"I bought this CD without listening (HUGE mistake!) hoping for the intense, fun-loving, wrap-your-self-in-the-microphone-cord, roll-about-on-the-floor-as-if-in-a-seizure thrashing punk I have grown to know and love from the first album and shows.

I wouldnt buy it for any other reason because I'm really not feeling it. Not that it's bad music... it's just a little too juvenile for me. BTW, I didnt mean anything by the 1 star review.

Filled with sweet harmony, bangin dance tracks, and heartfelt ballads, B5 makes a notable debut with their self-titled album. They have carved out a sound that is uniquely their own and the album is filled with tracks that are as exciting to listen to as their stage show is to watch. They start off with a cover of \\"Let It Be\\" which features lead vocals by youngest brother Bryan. There's a little something for everyone - tracks like \\"Dance 4 U\\" and \\"U Got Me\\" are perfect for fans who love to dance; tracks like \\"Teacher's Pet\\" and the J5 cover \\"All I Do\\" satisfy your craving for ballads, and the boys shine on mid-tempo tracks like \\"Heartbreak\\" (which has a bit of a reggae feel to it), and \\"No More Games\\".

Her genius has unfortunately shut her off from the world around her, which she finds both tawdry and boring. In an effort to get her interacting with the people around her, her therapist encourages her to: 1. List 10 things she loves, 2. Join a club, 3. Go on a date, 4. Tell someone she cares, and 5. Celebrate New Year's. As Carrie plods along through these requirements, she discovers the world around her is more interesting than she thought, and that most people are better than she had given them credit for. In the end, a whole new world has opened up before her, and we see Carrie as a young woman with her path set before her. A truly funny, inspirational book; one that I had not read growing up, but wish that I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read - more suited to adults than teens","review":"Although this is a Harlequin Teen book, I think the sophisticated themes in the book make \\"Carrie Pilby\\" more suited to adults than young teens. Not that there is inappropriate content, but it's not the typical young adult novel.\\"Carrie Pilby\\" wasn't what I expected from a Harlequin Teen novel, and maybe that's why it took me a while to get into the book. However, once I got used to the style of the book, I did find myself rooting for Carrie, who felt she didn't fit in anywhere, to find her identity and start enjoying life. I think most of us can relate to this in some degree and her struggles were realistic.This was an unusual, unique coming of age book that will appeal to college-age and other adult readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, funny book","review":"Carry Pilby is an unusual book. If you crave action and plot, this book isn't for you. But it is a great character-driven book. While the reviews call it hilarious, I think that is a bit misleading. I didn't laugh out loud at all, but I did find it to be very amusing. Carrie is a genius, and the way her mind works will make you chuckle, or at least smile. For the author to have written this character, she must be very smart herself.Skipping three grades kept Carrie from being bored and under-challenged in school, but at the same time, it seriously damaged her social skills. She sees a therapist who gives her a to-do list with simple things most people take for granted, like go on a date and join an organization.The plot of the book, if any, is Carrie trying to fulfill the list. By the end she begins to loosen up and realize some things really are shades of gray, not black or white as she always thought.I recommend this for all smart girls who love to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"carrie pilby .. an awesome read :)","review":"this is the absolute best book i have read, and i read a lot!the character carrie pilby is a hoot, and you want to know everything about her , what she is thinking, what she feels.i hope the author continues to write about her in other books!this is an absolute must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Glamour magazine readers","review":"This is the story of a gifted young woman who has nothing to do. She sleeps, mostly, and once a week pulls herself out of bed to visit her therapist. We know she gifted because she tells us so, ad nauseum, but there is little evidence of her giftedness in her thought processes. She is really quite dull. So, she follows her therapist's 5-point-plan to enhance her social life and it more or less works, and she ends up in bed with exactly the man we knew she would from the beginning. Not recommended.I feel this author has promise and can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Just Drags On","review":"I was very much lookng foward to reading this book because of its rave reviews here on Amazon, but once I had it I just couldn't stay with it. As much as I wanted to like Carrie, I just couldn't. There wasn't really much of a plot either. While I did make myself finish it, it never redeemed itself and I was just happy to be finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, Carrie!","review":"I really, really liked this novel. It had all the elements of a good read. I liked how Carrie was a unique character with endearing struggles. She is someone who still holds on to her high moral principles and doesn't sell out her high intelligence in a society where that's all too common, particularly in young women.

Dare I say boring? Yes, I dare. Boring. But there is a reason for everything in this world, and so I tried to figure out what was so boring about this book. The characters are indeed flawed, and the plot about rural New York seems more or less original (or as original as \\"Rural Town dies out because of modern world\\"). Ultimately the problem was that the novel itself lacked heart. This novel didn't care about the characters, didn't care for their troubles and their problems. Just presented them cold. Here's Character A, she's got problem C and now let us see her try to resolve it. Good writing, but without a soul. One star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a great independent movie","review":"Something about this book really got to me. I completely fell for the characters, their lives and the mistakes they make.

He goes from stealing a clean pair of socks in the gym, to finding these moments of unexpected grace.If you liked the movie \\"You Can Count On Me\\" or \\"In the Bedroom\\" you'll love this book. It's all about relationships and moments when characters find themselves doing the unthinkable and perhaps never quite admitting it to themselves. Subtle and remarkable, the prose is deceptively minimal, unlike so many of these other \\"big\\" novels nowadays. This is a real find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Training","review":"Maybe it is because I have spent much of my working life training people to work using a computer that I dislike this package so much.

They are missing out on some of the most wonderful films ever made. The Last Command is a spectacular film with such emotional impact. Emil Jannings had such talent. It amazes me how well he plays a Russian general suffering from such shock after the revolution.

But Bayba goes through with the operation and decides to enter a contest for b...h of the year.To win the contest Bayba must satisfy more man in twenty-four hours than the previous winner. She will need to handle 110 men. That's just thirteen minutes each. But with regular cigarette breaks and handling more than one at a time on occasion, it looks like Bayba will be able to succeed.This is a strange and kinky tale with Bayba performing very uninhibited acts with all manner of men. The artist seems to be making a statement about the sort of men Bayba encounters as all of them are drawn with pig faces (if you can see their faces). But this is no ordinary dirty book as it dares to venture into areas most will not. The art is clear and in full color.

Flare and coma were much smaller in the Kenko SGT-20Hi. Looking at Jupiter at night, the Kenko was able to resolve one of Jupiter's moons to a pixel, while with the Sony the moon appeared only sporadically. Chromatic aberration was a bit less in the Kenko. The vignetting that all the telephoto lenses have when the camcorder is in its wide angle zoom was slightly greater on the Kenko.With a Sony CCD-TR500 camcorder, some telephoto lenses have a problem of being \\"near sighted\\"---unable to focus beyond about 50 feet when the camera is zoomed. This problem occurs with the Sunpak CAL-1160 and Kenko SGT-20 lenses, but is not a problem with Kenko SGT-20Hi or the Sony VCL-R2037 lenses, which have enough leeway in the focus to even accommodate far-spectrum red lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Snobbery, Neurosis, and Intolerance\\"","review":"I was excited to read this book after reading the glowing reviews and after starting it, found myself hooked immediately. However, it soon became obvious that this was a rambling mess and ultimately I put it down and will not pick it up again. The narrator is a neurotic woman who seems to intensely dislike meat-eaters, poor people, and - most importantly - herself. She uses so many affectations in the book that it quickly becomes annoying and distracting. Referring to 9-11 as the \\"event of September\\" and not giving the boy a name. How aggravating. She is repulsed by people who are not skinny, rich, and vegan. What I want to say to this woman is \\"get over yourself.\\"The story seems to have no flow, no plot, no point.

The tragedy of the boy's story, her outsider status and her own fanciful version of who the boy was, and all the things she couldn't know about the boy because she only knew what he told her made this book more profound and less intentionally frivolous than the stories.It's ineresting ot read a novel written by someone I know for her stories.

She is constantly citing and referencing other books and movies throughout the text (almost called it a novel), as if we've all read/seen them, or even care to. Well done, Julie: describe your feelings by referencing something that most of the time will have no meaning to the reader, rather than actually WRITING PROSE!

I almost never completely lose interest in a novel, especially one that is so promising to begin with, but this novel was dreadful.

One thing I was very annoyed with was the extreme need the author had to keep inanely repeating himself. Once he explained the when, how's and why's Gerry Gallego had changed his name to Steven Feil..there was no need to keep referring to Gerry Gallego EVERY time as \\"Gerry Gallego aka Steven Feil...\\" I think after all that overly detailed description of how he assumed that name, the reader is smart enough to figure out who the writer is referring to.

This isn't to say I would not have as soon grabbed it as a library or whatever else, it's just amazon's 'oneclick' thing. Anyway, I read the book, and it was one of the poorest examples of true crime writing that I've read. The book is *very* short, repetitive in terms of language, has a couple of spelling errors... You keep hoping it will get better or more compelling (one would think the nature of the crimes and criminal team in this book would make the story interesting to read) and it just reads incredibly flatly. If you read about the first few victims, which are presented in the first fifth of the book, you have basically read the entire book; other than a light summary of the trial and some changed-around names, this reads like a tenth grade essay of stretching poorly understood material into however many pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Where to begin.....first of all the print is large and there are a lot of chapters so there are a lot of blank pages. Must have been the publishers way of making the book apprear to be longer than it is. Secondly the author repeats himself, well, repeatedly. He uses the same phrases over and over. Again a ploy to make the book longer. If the editor and publisher had done their jobs this book would have been only half as long. Also, the writing is dry and unimaginative. This story could have been much more interesting if he had taken the time to flesh out (pardon the pun) the characters, their deeds and the storyline itself.

And then the screw split the wood on the shelf below. Not too noticeable, but irritating and makes the table less sturdy and subject to further breakdown.

From walking spirits to haunted landmarks, the novel details the exciting myths and facts of San Antonio without trying to solve the mystery behind the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and very interesting","review":"Living in Texas made this book much more exciting for me, however, I think it will interest others outside of the Lone Star State as well. The book gives as much detail as possible, while telling the stories that were told to the author. There are some pictures, and those in the San Antonio area should be able to locate many of the locations with just the information in the book. The historical information, including the information about who the ghosts are believed to be at each location, add even more excitement to this already mysterious and intriguing topic. Do I believe in ghosts? I don't think so, but it's still fun to read about others imagination - or maybe their experiences ---- how would I know? Nevertheless, give it a try - especially if you are in Texas - and most definitely if you are in or near San Antonio!

Also, they are so long, little hands can pry the cabinet open far enough to get inside unless you put the catch so far back inside that then it's in the way of whatever you have inside the cabinet.

I recognized this music instantly upon sampling it on Amazon as works that a favorite yoga teacher of mine has used in the past. Each piece is very distinctive which is why I recognized it.I like many things about this album. First, the pieces are generally long, particularly the first piece. This is nice when meditating or doing flow yoga. Secondly, while they do mesmerize and have a low bass beat, there are transitions within each song that are so brilliantly and seamlessly done that it is almost like having two or three melodies in one piece along with different soothing chanting. As a result, the pieces do not ramble given their length; rather, they lengthen out, change, and evolve while still keeping a steady recognizable beat.A great album for chilling out, doing yoga, yin or flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"surreal","review":"Jai Uttal along with Krishna Das present music to balance the world.Any person remotely aligned with world peace / yoga or betterment of the world will relate to the mystical chants and attitude expressed here.This album should be compulsory for all liked minds.Wonderful !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for the Soul","review":"I love this CD!

She was kind-hearted, understanding, loyal and tried not to resort to force if she could help it, choosing to reason with those causing the problems.

The reviews I read led me to believe it would be pretty fun, but, I have to say, not so much. The story was hard to follow, as frequently the author would refer back to details that had never been presented, or characters that hadn't been introduced.I have to say, though, that I was most put off by the characters. It felt like the author was trying for a gritty, film noir kind of theme, but I think he fell short of the mark. The male characters were either swaggering jerks, or distracted,\\"mad-scientist\\" types, and the female characters were all selfish, spoiled, and not terribly bright. I get that that kind of film noir genre has its character archetypes, and that I'm a product of a post-women's lib society, but really, I think it went too far.

This three-volume set illuminated many of the details of the Eastern Empire with it's oriental influences and often dysfunctional theocracy. It is, however, a survey, and leaves one wanting the details which such an ambitious work cannot possible contain. I highly recommend it though and think it would be one way to discover that atrocities were not committed only by the Christians of history as we often hear nowadays. If Americans were as obsessed with medieval history as Muslims are, we would certainly teach our children about the Muslim hoards (the Ottomans) that took Byzantium in a bloodbath, slaughtered and enslaved it's people, and turned it's churches into Mosques.

Do NOT purchase this if you are looking to cure something on top of a nail as this does not do that; it just cures the skin and surrounding areas. Look at what is quoted on the back of the box in the picture: \\"This product is not effective on scalp or nails\\".So, it would be very helpful if they mentioned that in the description or at least changed the title... or BOTH! I'm severely put-out by this and will return this item asap. *NOTE* Thursday Plantation does actually make a product that cures fungus on top of a nail, and it is not this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product pictured","review":"Nor was it what I wanted.

The anticipation level is very high with expectation for seeing something always there. Plus the use of mediums present an interesting sidenote for the authenticity of the locations.

Apart from the great locations, I really was mesmerized by the \\"readings\\" of Derek Acorah. Much to my chagrin, I have now discovered that Acorah has been discredited based upon fake readings and has been dropped from the show. Based upon that, I would caution potential buyers of this product to stay away if they are expecting anything more than theatrics,bumps, bangs, screams and bleeped out profanity. Acorah was the core of the show and there really is little left to enjoy now that he's been discredited.

Then howl with laughter or pity poor Diana Rigg..maybe it was the director's fault, but really, Diana, did you even read the play or understand Ibsen(?). Out of their depth in every way.

You see nothing else. And I get subtle humour, but this just fell flat. The acting was really horrible. The blonde store owner I thought was the only one that was somewhat beleivable.

The series strength lies in the use of detailed, insightful psychological analysis conducted by the real life Dr. W. H. R. Rivers and the inter-relation between the various patents and Rivers' own mental states. Particularly moving and prominent in this book, is Rivers' fight against barbaric methods of treatment popular at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In many ways the most interesting volume in the trilogy","review":"This middle book in Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy tends to get ignored in favour of the other two. Undeservedly so. It at first appears to go off at a tangent from the first book, developing established characters in a way that can be shocking. Yet its vivid descriptions of personal encounters involving Lt Prior, his doctor, his old and new friends, his parents and his lover are riveting, resulting in an overall impression that grips the imagination. I actually find it the most interesting of the three books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an interesting book","review":"A poor book.

The 1st album consists of ballads with muzaky piano playing, that sounds too sickeningly easy listening(considering he was once a boogie woogie great in the 1940's). These albums sound like they were desperatley trying for a hit. The 1st albumn at least has several uptempo numbers taht might have been pretty cool, if they weren't weighed down by obviously white, non-swingign backup singers. The 2nd album is even worst, if that's possible, Joe sings some old gems but the arrangements are so corny and filled with a chior backing him up, that it sounds SO DATED!

It is an excellent mic with very solid construction. Only negative thing (although very minor) I wish I had know that I could have gotten a standard mic stand for it instead of the \\"fancy\\" \\"spider\\" or \\"cage\\" design advertised with it (you really don't need that).

Was able to record directly into GarageBand without a hitch and am very pleased with the results. This microphone has a nice rich sound with very good bass response and pick-up for voice-over recordings. Would definitely recommend a stand and a pop filter though.

Quality recording andediting is about the only good thing I can say about it.The tracks of people laughing sound forced and artificial; thespirits sound like a couple of junior-high schoolers.The tracks of screams are just screams, without any force orfear in them.The vast majority of the tracks are very short, even less than 5 seconds, don't offer anything especially spooky, and the CD is virtually useless to play for trick-or-treaters on Halloween. It would have been far better if the creators used their talents to make several collages of scary sounds grouped according to various themes.

It is not designed to be played in its entirety for trick-or-treaters. Rather, you should use it to record individual tracks for other uses. When used in this manner, it is an excellent CD. The tracks are seperated by blank space so it is easy to select individual sounds. There is a good range of sounds, from spoken words (\\"Welcome to my house\\"), to classic Halloween sounds, to futuristic sounds.I use this in my front yard by recording individual sounds on a cassette tape, seperated by 30 seconds of silence. Walk through my yard and you will hear a witch cackle, wolf howl, and evil laughs every so often.It's true that some of the sound effects are not realistic or scary (wolves howling, spirits moaning). They are more 'theatrical' than realistic.

If you are a single christian, this is a MUST READ. Loved it!! This book is humorous, yet real. Will take your breath away, while encouraging your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking a stand...","review":"Journee Carter, a young, single female, wants nothing more than to become the new head pastor of New Faith Baptist Church. After several intense meetings with the governing board of the church, her dream is finally realized. Journee's tenure is not without opposition; not only must she face ridicule and criticism from several members of her church, but also from the one person she least expects. Will Journee stand strong in her faith, or will she let opposition and temptation deter her from what she believes she was called to do?SOUL JOURNEY was a wonderful, inspirational read. Although the storyline contradicts my beliefs, I was able to get beyond that and see the real message - standing strong for what you believe in. I commend Jacquelin Thomas for tackling a very controversial subject. She did so in a manner that had me cheering for Journee and wanting to strangle those who dared stand in her way.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"rating":"2","title":"preacher's kid","review":"i would like to applaud the author of this book for bringing such a controversial subject to light. Being the daughter of a dynamic and anointed female pastor, I found this book to be very interesting. The story reveals the struggle , streotypes and lack of support many female ministers encounter as they move into ministry. It clearly reveals that God will use whom ever He chooses to deliver His Word, whether they are male, female, boy or girl. To all the aspiring future female ministers and to those who are on the battlefield for the Lord, Keep preaching the Word and Be encouraged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good fit and soft...but the band doesn't breathe!","review":"Everything about this is great (sizing, softness, holds up well in the wash)...except the band feels sweaty!

The acting is very poor, and other than the character being named \\"Jordan\\", there is no real connection to the original series.I did end up watching the entire movie, though at 2x speed to get through this travesty.To quote Don Knotts in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, \\"The horribleness and the awfulness of it will never actually be forgotten.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"If you are a most haunted fan as I am and have the complete series collection DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD.

Each chapter studies a particular prayer from his letters, exploring what Paul prays for and why. For example-in his analysis of 2 Thessalonians 1:3-12, Dr. Carson illustrates how Paul's anticipation of Jesus' return shapes what he prays for the people.This book was inspirational to me in at least two ways: I find I am praying for people and needs in a more Christ-centered way. I have also grown in my understanding of what it means to pray to a sovereign God.The reflection questions at the end of each chapter help to make this a very practical book. It would work well for individual or group study, taking one chapter at a time and steadily putting the new insights into practice. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book!

Well, this was not the case at all! There was so little in this book, that I decided to return it because it was such a disappointment. The book shows three views of the same few dresses, one view per page, and a tiny bit of the jewelry, with many big blank pages spread out in between, as if they had to get this done in a hurry and had to fill up a certain amount of pages by press time, so it would look like it was \\"designed\\".

The text is mediocre and the photos are terrible. The general visual quality of the book is absolutely reprehensible.The dresses are all reproduced in a poor quality \\"Liz Taylor in the White Diamonds commercial\\" fake fuzzy lens. There is not one really great photo of an actual garment in this entire book. As someone who saw the actual exhibit the book is based on, I feel the Metropolitan really missed on this one. The exhibit itself was magnificent, this poorly concieved book is a complete dud.

So I was curious to hear what they were like. So, I heard it, and...WOW! It was the greatest Christian hard-core/punk compilation I ever heard! So, I thought, if this is a Volume 2, there's gotta be a Volume 1. So the search was on. I went to every Christian bookstore within 15 miles, and finally, at the last bookstore, the had it in the computer. I ordered it. When I got it, I was blown away, yet again, by another great Christian hard-core/punk compilation! I couldn't believe that there were so many great Christian hard-core and punk artists!

Since it was in a different series than the ones she normally writes, I was a bit skeptical, but I read it anyway. Kellen Tavadon is the cliche kind of kid, and I could barely supress a groan when I found out he was the son of the \\"arch-mage\\" of the city.It goes on with some interesting plot twists and a good story development that kept me reading the entire way through. It was a great book, and the only down side was that often times Kellen's thoughts went off in a repitional (is that even a word) tangent that often lasted for several pages. He was not the brightest character in the story.I would definitely recommend this as a book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Start to the series","review":"This book was a great start to the series, it gripped me into the story at the beginning. Looking forward to the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent entertaining novel","review":"I have always been a fan of Mercedes Lackey and this book was no dissapointment. It is similar to many of her other books but it is a pleasant change from Vlademer. I won't go into details about the plot because many other reviews here have them but I will say that although it starts out slow it gets much better as the story progresses. All in all, I would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys high fantasy. I read one review that said something to the effect of Mercedes Lackey is an untalented writer; that is anything but true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The begining of excellence","review":"For all those interested in a well written, descriptive novel, this is it! But to be fair I almost gave up on it. Normally I'm the kind of person that if I can't get into a book by the third or fourth chapter, that's it and I won't touch it. The first book of the Obsidion Trilogy is Slow. It took till around a hundred and twenty pages to start thriving for more. All in all I'm really glad I did because the Authors' description of environments and characters is like putting you in the book. Compasion, Fighting, Magic, Mythical Creatures, and Epic Quests await all those who read. And Book 2 and 3 continue the story for hours of page by page enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book in the Trilogy","review":"The first novel in The Obsidian Trilogy is surely the best. The events are all well paced, the writing fluid, and the characters interesting. This book opens the reader's mind to many great and fantastic elements. Where the next two books become muddled and focus on military events, this book follows the story of young Kellen and his trials and tribulations. Even the final segment of the book involves a small group of heroes.This is a great novel, and well worth the read even if the next two books fail to live up to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"First book of trilogy.Reading it again for the gazzillionth time.It's still just as good.Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never let down by this aurthor","review":"I have been reading books by this aurthor for many years, this book has the \\"taint\\" of Mercedes Lackey!I have had over the years problems obtaining books by the aurthor in Australia, so I am estatic that this book has not let me down at all. Loved it from the begging to end. Thank you Mercedes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition","review":"While I thought that this book had an interesting story, and agree in part with many of the other reviews, there is one overall reason that I gave such a low rating. Kellen, one of the main characters of this book is an endearing young man, with many questions and outlooks upon his life in general. Throughout the novel, Kellen comes upon his realizations and revelations on the blink of an eye, going back and forth from one view to another, doubting just about everything there is to doubt. This is a book of adventure and far off lands, but this feeling of excitement at untold journeys is somewhat put off by the fact that you know the main character will always find the answer when he needs it, at the snao of your fingers. If it wasn't for this, the book would have been, in my opinion, far more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe it's the familiarity that makes it enjoyable","review":"Though I would agree with reviewers who found this series to sound very familiar, I consider it a good thing. That's why we read fantasy - elves, goblins, dragons...These books are quite captivating and hold your interest. While it would have been good to incorporate more adult themes, The Outstretched Shadow was an excellent break from Jordan and Goodkind for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun and food!","review":"My kids have always loved this book.

It is all perfect English and written just as any other modern touring reference book. The tourist reference reviews details about historical architecture and sites of interest, its concise history and current events within a vast array of towns within the 4 provinces of Le Marches. I read this book often and refer to its pages for detailed information about the towns I visit on a yearly basis.If you ever visit this beautiful region of Le Marche which possesses more dramatic variations of countryside than the crowded and overrated region of Tuscany, then you will enjoy what it has to offer for an aspiring traveler seeking Italy's more quietly kept secrets and less tourist overrun regions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!!","review":"I saw this movie at my Dad's house it is really funny if you get a chance check this movie out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works!","review":"This product is great.

The only thing I would point out is that much of it centers around the fact that the author feels it necessary for one to leave their present life, and basically go into solitude to truely progress on their spiritual journey. While this may or may not be the case, many of us are unwilling to do so. For those people, I suggest Thich Nhat Hanh's writings, as they are geared toward people in all circumstances. This is not to say that this book is not of value, it certainly is! It is really quite wonderful and has many great treasures contained within.

However, gory is an understatement, so be advised.Pulse, one of the earlier films by the esteemed Kiyoshi Kurosawa (not related to the famous Akira Kurosawa), is a needed change of pace. Not gory at all, but there is definitely a sense of a slow, creeping threat. As always Kurosawa explores deep themes of psychology.Unfortunately, I think the slowness of pulse meant it should be watched before the crazy, sick, heart-thumping terror of Sick Nurses. I watched sick nurses first, and couldn't concentrate too well on pulse, thus the film ended up being a little confusing. I would have to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this product, and it is better than any sunless tanning product I have ever purchased.

The readers' star rating of this book is also strange, given how badly it is designed!This paperback edition may be the problem, but I haven't seen the other (non-Canadian published) editions, so I can't be sure. The font selection is just awful, with an extremely light typeface used for the recipe preparation sections (the ingredients' font is ok), thus making the book almost impossible to read in most kitchens. Then there is the issue of the thickness of this cookbook (it's thick), vis a vis it's outside dimensions.

This book and CD are beautiful, hauntingly so. It is dark, yet able to make its own light in the power struggle of a human life. I applaud his ability to transcend race. Many get so caught up in the past that there simply is no future, but Williams crosses this line and opens up his poetry like a creaking door, behind which, music plays. His topic is love and hate, sex and loneliness, but not your typical angst-filled drivel that so haunts the poetic world today. If I had to draw comparisons, I would say Langston Hughes. Quite simply, poetry. Even if poetry leaves you dry, his ability to take poetry back to its oral roots makes music of breaths. Buy this book and CD set.

I have to say I was disappointed. Looking through the other comments, I have to agree with the reviewer that referred to it as an 'overblown production'.I love costuming and the 18th century is my favourite period, but from the reviews I was expecting something a little more flashy.If you've never had any exposure to 18th century clothing and furnishings before then I could see how this could be a revelation, but to a serious costumer, it's a bit average to say the least.I think boobs and debauchery on stiff looking models would have to be a better title - these have to be the worst costume models I've ever seen.It's hard to see details in the gowns, the lighting and photograpy are poor, the paintings are ok, but seem to revolve more around sex then clothing and the whole thing is just lacking in presentation in my opinion.Not sure whether to cut this up for reference or donate it to the library.Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful costumes","review":"This book is a great resource for the Rococo period.

They do cover a large area but sometimes they would actually get in her way when trying to eat because they are so wide. They don't do any good because the neck holes are so wide that they don't protect her clothing. They don't snap or velcro, so I have to pull them off over her head, which ends up being more messy than it's worth. Don't waste your money.

I don't have a huge amount of world coins, but I was able to find only a little over half of my coins in this book.With so many different countries' coins listed, this book can't contain very many grades of each coin.If there is a particular foreign country that you are interested in collecting its coins, you'll want to go elsewhere for a more specific reference. This is not the book for specifics.However, there are a few handy essays at the beginning of the book on how to buy coins, spot a bad deal, and so on.

While it sounds like it could be distracting and pretentious, it works, and it gives the narrative a continuous, dreamy quality. The story itself is a very entertaining journey of self-revelation and culture shock, and an exploration of the relationship between two women. Ultimately, the \\"big secret\\" does not seem as shocking as it is played up to be compared with things that seen and done along the way, and the significance of the ending is difficult to grasp. But overall it is a very worthwhile read -- its emotional portrayal of a journey started by ambition, followed by shock, loneliness, work, and culminating personal growth will leave you thinking for some time. It would be nice to see more books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I first picked up this book 4 years ago at a library and soon after, bought my own copy.

I found McCloy's descriptions of the NYC lesbian scene to be inane. I'm not from NYC but I am a lesbian, and it was completely unrealistic. Backstage with Betty -- give me a break! And frankly, having a conversation with a gay man is just not the wildly risque experience the author makes it out to be. Her characters left me cold; I didn't care WHAT happened, I was just wishing something interesting and/or halfway believable would. I have no clue what the reviewers are talking about, calling McCloy a great stylist. She is not nearly good enough to disdain the use of quotation marks. Not even worth 1 star, in my opinion.

I am a male from the Southeast, but I am not a stranger to New York. The main female character is quite appealing, the descriptions were quite hypopnotic in some places, truly making the reader feel involved and erotically interested. Though disappointing in some places, the overall effect of the book was quite satisfying and made me want to get on a plane and look for the main character and Jade. Essentially a female version of Bright Lights, Big City, in a different decade, and maybe not quite so original and well written, but THIS IS A GOOD BOOK.

Only three outstanding aces are mentionedby name (Bong,Zempke. ) and only Bong (top ace with 40 ) is mentioned in any detail. P-38s shot downYamamoto's plane,but if that was mentioned, I missed it. Some lack of combat action was probably dueto the design of the P-38 as a high altitude interceptor (and subsequent use as a ground attack plane).I did like the description of its development,and the details about the main designer Kelly Johnsonwho was born near where I live.

Ozick is a interesting writer with a unique style which I liked but the story was incredible depressing. This idealistic lawyer (Ruth Puttermesser) is put through so much disappointment and misery,(to what end I can not fathom), it seems she is attacked at every turn. Even her dreams/fantasies destoy her. It was that ending that took this book from 4 or 5 stars to 2. I really don't need books to have happy endings but Ozick truly but Ruth through Hell. I don't think it was fitting and it damaged the whole story for me. Let hope Ozick life is better than Ruth's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Puttermesser Papers","review":"First, I cannot believe that this book is a finalist for a National Book Award. I have usually agreed with all their choices, but I was surprised at this one. It's not just the negativity and self absorption of the character herself and the story that was at issue here for me, but I never cared for Ruth Puttermesser as a person. It seemed to me (excepting her violent end of course) that she deserved everything she got. Seemingly, she is a strong character with all of her intellect and education, but she does nothing with them. She lives in squalor, complains about everything, and does nothing to lift herself out of those surroundings. Some losers you come to like or accept, but with Ruth Puttermesser I did not even feel a twitch of sympathy. It is obvious that the author is very intelligent herself and well read; however, all that does not necessarily make for an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else","review":"This book represents one of modern, unnecessary, and vague works of our time.

If there were no trends in gambling results then there would be no point to gambling in the first place. You can use all kinds of mathematics if you want to disprove this but if you are going to gamble then you better believe in them!

At a time when pedophilia is responsible for destroying thousands of young lives, I believe that it is very wrong to seemingly approve of such an abomination, whether the molestor is a vampire or not. Besides this, the descriptions were interesting, if a bit dragged-out. And there were many anomalies - now Armand didn't order Claudia's death?

I found myself unable to relate to Armand and didn't really care what happened to him, since I had already thought him dead at the end of Memnoch the Devil. As usual, Anne Rice's imagery and descriptiveness are excellent as she shows the luxury of Venice, and the cold, hard Russian steppes, but I found myself trying to read this as quickly as possible just so it could be over and I could move on.

They have believed in god and seen the devil, Lestat was even human again. In Armand you see why he is the vampire he is. His life as a human was centered around religion and although he may be 500 years old, he is a BOY, for eternity, much like cluadia. I do feel that this book lead to an ever present question of will Lestat be back. I think that the music played by Sybelle has awakened Lestat much like he once did for the Queen of the Damned. This book was a wonderful filler of things missed or misunderstood in the previous books. It also stood very well on its own and could be enjoyable to someone who has not read the previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycle Bin","review":"Don't waste your time on this one.

She concentrates on child molestation for the first half of the book, which is not only offensive, but adds nothing to the story. The only thing horrifying here is her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever purchased!","review":"If you enjoy homosexual love affairs and the molesting of young boys then this is the book for you.

I am 18, female, and have read the preceeding Vampire chronicles. This one, however, is truly beautiful. It is so vivid and wrenching, yet enthralling to read. Anne Rice is the only author which I read every novel that is written. I impatiently anticipate her next novel whenever I finish her latest. She is such an inventor of a character's pasts and presents that it is impossible to pull away from the world she creates. I noticed her writing opened even more so to the art world than the days of the first Vampire Chronicles. The Vampire Armand itself is a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Rice Classic","review":"To understand a character, you must know his/her history.

Much of \\"Armand\\" is a repeat of all we've read before, except for it's continuous, voluminous and tedious referrals to religion and the constant homosexual encounters of the vampires and mortals. These episodes are not even erotic though exceedingly graphic. Religion and gay sex just seem compromised under the same covers. This once avid fan will probably avoid these endless, rambling tomes in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak,not the quality of her earlier books,I was dissapointed","review":"Weak, certainly not the quality of her earlier books, as an avid Rice fan -- I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"One quickly gets bogged down in this latest installment of her vampire series. There is more vampire \\"angst\\" in this novel than in all of Ms. Rice's other books. Ms. Rice seems to get carried away with her descriptions of landscape and cathederals while the plot plods on endlessly. The next installment of this series, which I will most assuredly get at the local library, needs to have more action and less \\"poor me\\" yak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I've read EVERYTHING (except Violin & Pandora) that Anne Rice has written.

As a novel in general, It didn't go anywhere, and in the process offered little or nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"This book was a disappointment. Couldn't help feeling Ms. Rice had a deadline to meet. I found little character develpment, even less exploration of the \\"world of vampires\\" Anne Rice created with such richness with her previous Chronicles...I found the (seemingly) preoccupation with homosexual sex both mechanically written and generally uninterestingly, adding nothing but \\"filler\\".After the richness of \\"Pandora,\\" this was one paultry sequel...Morgan"},{"rating":"1","title":"A massively problematic work","review":"Through most of this novel, I figured on my review being two stars. It wasn't abysmally bad, but rather failed to justify its own existence - it didn't tell anything worth saying. Rice fails to find an original or compelling voice for Armand, and the plot is largely dull repitition of what we learned in The Vampire Lestat. It was the Claudia sequence which initially made me go down to one star. It was stupid, pointless, and incredibly ill-advised. It warps out of nowhere, unwelcome, and leaves without even being satisfying! What was Rice thinking? That he readers wanted to learn that garbage? The ending third of the book, although Sybelle and Benji are dull characters, was better handled since it provided Armand an interesting dilemma, so it's two stars overall. But still, a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautifully written book, but...where's the story?","review":"Is it me, or is there no story? Some other reviewers have said it's flat, and I found it to be exactly that. Others have said the inaccuracies drove them nuts; I swallowed them and gave them up to poetic license. The sex I could deal with. The Frankenstein experiment I could not. I eventually started reading this as a poem, and found myself enjoying the beauty of the language, as opposed to looking for a story. The ending made me throw the book down in frustration, and the word \\"hack\\" came to mind. I'm sick to death with the continuous \\"love or lack thereof\\" theme that these creatures keep searching for. Again, it's pretty prose, and that's about all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic is gone","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Vampire Armand\\" and I find myself asking the same question I've asked at the end of the last three or four Anne Rice books. That question is, \\"What has happened to quality of Anne Rice's books.\\" I've read all of her books to date and enjoyed many of her early Vampire novels. However, the most recent ones have just been bad. Sure, they are light reading. You can finish them in about six hours. They all have bright moments. But are they satisfying? No. Perhaps she is turning them out too fast.

I was as bored reading this book as poor Armand must have been having to play the part. Anne Rice needs to move on to different subject matter. Her prose has become weak, anemic over the years. Her once lush descriptions and characterizations have lapsed into lazy writing where each character talks like the next and they all to seem to whine and complain about EVERYTHING. Boring. Interview, Lestat, and Body Thief are the only enjoyable books in this series. Rice is so concerned now with exploring new philosphical and spiritual territory that she's forgotten that what we want is a...

I thought this one was one of the worst vampire books I've read.

And when Armand just walks into the sun left me confused. She can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book is childish nonsense. Not only does it have no meaning, but it is boring. Save your time and money for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too descriptive, poor narrator","review":"I didn't enjoy this book on tape. There was too little action and interaction among the characters. In this book Rice describes everything in excruciating, unnecessary, and unending detail. Jonathan Marosz was a poor choice of narrator. Different character's voices were sometimes hard to distinguish. He just didn't bring them to life as others have (Frank Muller)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Vampire Chronicles.

I think it is obvious that Anne Rice has run out of plots to tell about the Vampire Chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the Real Anne Rice Please Start Writing?","review":"What was that? It bore no resemblance to the first four Vampire Chronicles, and was bogged down in Ms. Rice's obvious struggles with her Catholic upbringing. Spare us. Since \\"Memnoch,\\" a thoroughly loathesome tale, Ms. Rice has forgotten how to tell a story and spends too much time indulging herself at the expense of her characters. What were once richly-drawn characters full of lively interest, are now whiny, wandering, bores.I'm not reading another of her novels until she returns Lestat to himself. What did he ever do to her to deserve such treatment?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre...very disappointed.","review":"There was too much reference to the other books.

And the problem is that it keeps repeating itself, and I still won't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the blood is running thin","review":"Alas, the recycling of a clutch of familiar characters, settings, and sexualsituations does not a novel make. But the series has longsince lost its oomph,in this reader's opinion, and only those motivated by nostalgia for previousthrills will find this book a rewarding read. Too bad; there's an awful lot ofjunk out there with \\"vampire\\" in the title, but once upon a time this authorproduced novels about the breed that were bombshells of strong writing andemotional effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another in depth look at another Vampire","review":"Ann Rice has done it again. This book covers the life of the Vampire Armand. Armands story touchs on all of the other books Vampires we have been introduced to in the previous 5 books. And intergrates them well. The book starts off strong and ends weak. You will not want to put this book down for the first two-thirds. I espically love the parts when we follows Armands life as a Vampire in Venice. And we follow him to Rome where we learn how he becomes the master of the Paris Coven. After this there is long jumps in history. Of course, it leaves us needing more books....for the story is obviously not over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your into gay porn, don't skip the first half!","review":"Having read several of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, I found myself re-evaluating the entire series after finishing THE VAMPIRE ARAMAND. The two main vampires, or rather \\"vamps\\" in this case, have been reduced to nothing more than a couple of sniveling fops! Having bathed in the lake of immortality seems to have produced a ravenous appetite for nothing more than rabid homosexual lust, sacchrine laced proclamations of love and commitment, and fawning over the latest fashions. Marius and Armand, former icons and pillars of strength within the 'chronicles, have been transformed into a pair of Harliquin Romance candymen. Once beyond the vacuous relationship of these immortal lovers, Rice regains some of the pacing that made her other works classics. Unfortuneately, the nose dive is recovered too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much atmosphere, not eneough plot","review":"Rice's latest installment in the Vampire Chronicles is long on atmosphere, but short on plot. She is great at setting moods (I've always thought that reading Rice is a little like being on drugs), and describing historical settings, but she needs to get back to some good old fashioned storytelling! Although this book fleshes out Armand's already known story, its only real storyline is what happened to him after his apparent immolation after viewing Veronica's Veil. This plot could be summarized in a sentence or two. The storylines of two of her recent books, \\"Memnoch the Devil\\", and \\"Servant of the Bones\\" are much more compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad dialog","review":"I wonder if Ms Rice is teaching freshman composition at UNO these days. If so, it would explain where she gets the inspiration for dialog such as this:\\"All my companions are of the best blood.\\" \\"You're telling me,\\" said my Master.and another:\\"Damned of he isn't dead,\\" said the gray-haired man. He kicked the body of Francisco on the floor. \\"Martini, I'm out of here.\\"And that's about where I am too with Anne Rice...I'm outta here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow down and think of an interesting STORY!!","review":"What a shame. The first 3 vamp books were among my favorite by any author in any genre. But Anne is slipping badly here.

I labored through this book and was so relieved to finish and start something fresh, with interesting plot turns, real humor and pathos, etc. Anne, who have got to stop writing this historys. They are BORING!! Take Marius into unchartered territory. Or the TWINS!!Something! Anything!

I love Anne's earlier works - Interview and Lestat still rank as two of my all time favorites. But she RUINED both Armand and Marius! Both were strong, unique, and interesting characters in past books. Now they will forever be sniveling, weak, and supid, all because of this book! Anne's writing style was not flowery or insightful (Not like Memnoch, which WAS enthralling) - it was monotonous and boring. That alone would be enough to pan the book.

Having read the first half of the book I am suspect; the book is so poor, and the dialogue so awkward and cloying, that I truly can't believe that this was really written by Anne Rice herself. Perhaps ghostwritten? It doesn't seem possible that the same woman who wove such detailed, succulent tapestries of words in the other VC books could have produced this Harlequin romance-level bilge. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God, Not Armand!!!","review":"If I had to sum this book up in one word it would be...HORRIBLE (or any of it's synonyms!). After reading Queen of the Damned, which was Anne Rice's best book ever, then being majorly dissapointed by TOTBT & MTD, I thought she could redeem herself with Armand. He was such a great character in the other books...that devilish, detached boy who was the perfect balance for Lestat's constant whining. But she ruined him! She made him like Lestat, and worse, if possible. She also ruined Marius, and seems to just have cut Daniel out of the picture. This book seems just an excuse for Rice to write some more homoerotica (vampyrical homoerotica, nonetheless!), and pages and pages of pointless descriptions. Armand was such a great character...poor him. Poor anyone that reads this...stick with the ensemble thing you had going on in QOTD, Rice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rices worst ever","review":"Having finished Memnoch I waited with anticipation for another great story by Ms. Rice. Sorrowfully Anne rice doesn't seem to be as hungry as when she wrote the Witch Chronicles or the beginning of the Vampire series. The Vampire Armand could be compared to hospital food. I doubt I will ever buy another Anne Rice book. Her fans needed a good read after Servant of The Bones which started out well enough and then slowly lost its intrigue til it fell into the abyss and I for one was glad to get to the last page and end the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Sample of Anne Rice's Work","review":"I agree with the majority of the other reviewers. I have tried to read this book twice, and have never gotten more than half way through it. I found Anne Rice's book very engaging, but I was seriously disappointed with this book. I chose not to purchase her latest book, because I found the Vampire Armand so lacking in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it minus stars, I would","review":"I thought that the first 3 \\"Vampire Chronicles\\" were marvellous - original, exciting and totally absorbing. Then came \\"Body Thief\\", and I began to think that Anne Rice was all written-out. The mind-bogglingly dire \\"Memnoch\\" confirmed it (it's got to be just about the most boring and ridiculous book anyone has ever got published), so I decided not to bother with any more of her books. However, Armand is my favourite vampire creation of any writer and I had to read his story. I shouldn't have bothered. How could Mrs Rice make so little of such a fascinating character? I so wish she'd concentrated on Armand when she could still write, way back in the early '90s (his should really have been the 3rd \\"Chronicle\\"). If you loved the early vampire novels re-read them and steer well clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting gay porn","review":"The first half of the book is little more than gay porn. The second half of the book never gets interesting. This book really does little to continue the story of Lestat, although it teases you that it will at some point. Lestat is placed in almost as an afterthought to try to tie it to the recent occurrences in the series. I give it one star only because I can't give it less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great imagery, bad plot.","review":"I personally found this book to be scraping the bottom of the vampire barrel, there was nearly no plot, and it left me so confused at times that I just wanted to rip it from it's bindings.

If you like your vampires the way they are, leave this book lay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!!!","review":"I could not believe Anne Rice was the author!!

Maybe why Vampires hate living is because after two books your story will go nowhere. This isn't the mysterious Armand we wonder about. Not the pain seeker who lets Lestat and Louis treat him like a weakling. In my opinion, Armand could of killed Lestat in Paris but instead chose to let Lestat beat him. I believe Armand wouldn't be in the whole child thing either (i.e. Bengi etc.). Why? Because Armand always wants to be the dependent.

I must confess that I'm a devote fan of Anne Rice and have continued to read her books in hope of discovering the once fantastic tales she once produced. But not since the Witching Hour, (clearly her best work), have I ever been rewarded.

This is a charming, intelligent, witty, and amusing writer who used to be able to translate these qualities to her fiction. This is a knack she appears to have lost or, inexplicably, abandoned. \\"The Vampire Armand\\" is preciously written, far too exquisite to bear. The complaint is not about the notion of homsexual vampires, but about the effeteness of the language which Rice employs. Where once her idiom was overripe and naughty (particularly in her \\"Beauty\\" series), now it is simply rancid and distasteful.One good thing to be said about the book: it's her best work since \\"Lasher\\". And that is very, very sad. Rice used to be great fun, even dirty fun: now she is simply churning out the perfumed prose as fast and as prolifically as her sense-dead zealots will snort it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words; not enough action.","review":"I am a fan of Ms. Rice's earlier books, but lately it seems everything she writes is more like a textbook history lesson done with purple prose. I found Armand to be an interesting idea and a good set up for a good story, but it somehow failed. I don't want to read four pages of prose about what color a satin pillow is. Usually, I forgive the purple prose in her vampire books because I figure the vampire sees the world through different, more sensitive eyes and they are poetic, gothy, angst ridden creatures anyway, but her last few books have been almost unbearable. I barely got through Armand. His relationship with Marius seemed very contrived and didn't have much of a point to it other than to showcase the sensuality of the vampires. I am now solid on never buying an Anne Rice Book again, unless I hear that she has quit with the 4000 word descriptions of trivial things. It is too bad because I enjoy her earlier work greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this is like being Pooped on by a Flock of Pigeons","review":"This book transcends bad. What can I say, it [was very weak]. The writing is dismal. There is no character development - there is character regression. The once great, engaging, tortured Armand is now a twerp.... And Marius, who used to be ruthless, powerful and subtle, is now a child-molesting Whiner. I remember while reading Interview for the first time some fifteen years ago imagining that I was interviewing Louie, and wondering how I'd react if I were in the presence of Lestat or Louie. Now, I know exactly what I'd do if I were in the presence of Marius and Armand. I'd slap Marius upside the head and make Armand finish the dishes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect cure for insomnia","review":"I was very disappointed by this book, not to mention bored out of my skull. I have been a Rice fan for over a decade and I used to run to the store to buy her latest books. I am not even sure if I will even get to the store at all for her next novel. If you are not familiar with Rice, please start with her earlier work. Nothing new in this one...endless descriptions that do not bring anything to the story. However, if you have problems sleeping, this should help cure your insomnia in a snap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Ego needs her editor","review":"I have always been a huge Anne Rice fan, but The Vampire Armand has convinced me that she needs the guidance of an editor. It's no small coincidence that her finest book is the one that employed the additional eye of an editor. There has, at least in my opinion, been a gradual decline in the quality of the books since Interview with the Vampire. Her ego is impeeding her work. A writer is not an editor. Love of their work will not give them the impartial view necessary to remove or modify those parts that just don't work. That's the problem with The Vampire Armand. Large parts of it just don't work. There's also a nagging tendency for the book to repeat itself over and over again. A very poor outing in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the plot got lost","review":"Perhaps one of the most enigmatic of Anne Rice's vampire community I was so looking forward to reading about Armand. Her characters have a way of being wholly believable and it was with great enthusiasm that I began this book, after all her makebelieve world is usually so vivd and consumes you so entirely.I was sorely disappointed with this book, although Anne Rice is known for her purple prose this book takes it to new heights of tedium. So consumed is she with the power of the pen the story gets lost and left behind early on in the book. This book is an exercise in endurance, you really don't care about the story after the first 50 or so pages you just become determined to see it through to the end.For any \\"fan\\" of the vampire chronicles it is a must read book, but it isn't a good book and definitely not one to return to again and again like an old and welcome friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"armand- what happened?","review":"I really did not like this novel, because it seemed too mass produced. i loved anne rice books before i read this one, she was my favorite author. from what i could gather from interviews with her and comments she made on her web page, (about her writing)it seems to me she is no longer writing from the heart. i love the earlier books but not this one. i thought it had no story to it except to give readers a lesson on material culture of the era. when armand or other charachters did get speckled into the chapter they were too worried about who was having sex with the other. why? what did that have to do with the cronicles as a whole? personally i thought this book was a real let down to the anne rice fan and to the series. although i did give two stars instead of one beacuse i did learn a little about history that i hadn't known before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice Does It Again","review":"In yet another intense tale of the supernatural Anne Rice brings you to feel both sympathy and love for this beautiful and lonely monster...Read It..It is well worth the time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I won't read this one (yet)","review":"Violin was HORRIBLE.

Oh, yes, and that revisionism (Armand didn't order Claudia killed, you see, but he did do icky experiments on her). I gave up trying to read the whole crap and just skimmed through it.

Queen of the damned was junk but enjoyable.After that Rice's books were throw away novels that were a waste of time and I felt did not show us any new philosophies or ideas. Armand though takes us back to a richly described Renaissance Italy. This book delves into religious concepts for vampires that I felt were never elaborated on in her previous books. Armand also is a very compelling creature whose struggle between the good and the evil is perfectly put on the page. I highly reccomend Armand to anyone who loved her early books but felt the sequels were not up to scratch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the chronicles best. I have just started reading this book I am half way thru and i just cant seem to put it down. It is the most interesting book. I finally get to know more about Armand. He has always been the most mysterious one. You hardly ever know anything more than when Lestat or when Louis are with him. The begining chapter captures your attention and then when Armand begins to tell his tale it literally transports your mind and your vision to a poor little Russian boy from Kiev. He is described to have the face of a Boticelli Angel with dark curly,long ,and auburn hair. He has brown eyes. He is unfortunately kidnapped and forced to travel to find his master which eventually becomes his saviour Marius. Marius saves Armand and introduces him into a life of luxury which Armand has never known. He is refined and educated with Marius.

It finally satisfies a need for Armand's origins and his creation by Marius (perhaps Rice is trying to remind us that Armand was never a fortysomething Spaniard); this portion is erotic and enchanting. the rest merely seems a soliloquy inviting Lestat back to the stage, created from the same theophilosophical thread as Memnoch, which was more thought-provoking. The two most interesting questions are never answered: Is Bianca a vampire, and more important, why did Marius never seek Armand after his \\"century-long convalescence?\\" In any case, Lestat is up from the cathedral floor, which seems to have been the purpose of the book anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara Cartland would be embarrassed!","review":"Go straight to Chapter 8. Chapters 1 throuh 7 were pure trash. Pedophelia may be part of the world, and it may have been an integral part of the development of Armand's character, but this is pathetic. I thought Violin put an end to Anne Rice's self-indulgence, but the first seven chapters read like a 13 year old boy's wet dream! The relationship between Armand and Marius is without depth, dimension and eroticism. At its best, it is petulant. The remainder of the story is interesting, but not up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand.","review":"What has happened to my queen? With the frist three Chronicles I was in complete awe of her storytelling talent, but in her last three novels she seems to ramble on and has trouble creating and sticking to a plot. I just hope she regains her wits and focuses more on publishing quality work rather than qauntity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greates Biography ever written (that includes Lestats)","review":"I was miserable when i thought that Armand had perished in 'Memnoch' but joy of joys he is alive, well and dark and brooding as always. Armand is my favourite Vampire from the chronicles therefore i maybe a little biased but there is no doubt in my mind that this is the greatest book since 'The queen of the Damned'. There are so many highlights that it's hard to pick out just one or two things that i particularly enjoy, but the recollection of Armands mortal (and vampire) life with Marius is both breathtaking and mind blowing. I was glad to find my favourite Vampire still kicking ass, and he writes of antics that even the great Lestat would be proud of. A truly amazing read that is a feast for all the senses"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish the Book","review":"Remember when Rice used to publish her porn under a pen name? Ahh, the good old days, when you knew the name Anne Rice would mean a really good book. I had such high hopes. I was always intrigued by Armand and looked forward to getting a tale similar to Lestat's history. Instead I read scene after scene of licking and kissing and ripping off clothes. Since I'm neither a gay male or a porn reader, I got very tired of this and gave up about 1/3 of the way through. Rice's books were so good in the past -- she was a great storyteller. Now her writing seems self-indulgent...although I can't imagine what would draw a female writer toward gay porn. I hope she writes a good book again someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite so far","review":"This is my favorite of the chronicals so far. It is a lush, detailed, rich decent into the beauty and horror of history and the sensuality and erotica of the living and the dead. Everything is touched upon from religion, the meaning of life the worth of the soul, art, beauty, transendence. I could say more but read the book instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let yourself be taken captive","review":"In This spellbinding book.

This book has all the makings of a classic. Armand's story is one that needs to be told. His love of God, subsequent nihilism, and then his transformation at the end of \\"Memnoch\\" will play a big part in this book. Armand is a vampire who loves God and wants to find goodness, but his life is haunted by tragedy and nightmare. Here, in the sequel to \\"Memnoch the Devil\\", Armand will confront the vampire Marius, and begin the most important quest of all, the search for Truth. I don't know what willl happen in this book, but rest assured, \\"The Vampire Armand\\", like Memnoch the Devil, will be one of those books that changes your outlook on life. An absolute must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away SCREAMING...but not in a good way.","review":"How Barnes and Noble had the nerve to publish this mish-mash plotless wonder is truly beyond me. My theory is that Louis actually wrote the first book, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and Anne Rice has since just tried to make do without him. Incredibly boring; filled with homoerotic but juvenile sex fantasties, listless meandering plot (what there was of one), wretchedly inept descriptions of a rich historical era and, incomplete resolutions...doesn't Anne Rice have a conscience (or an editor?). To unleash this immature half-baked work on unsuspecting fans is craftily criminal. SKIP THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear, more of Rice's pale-skinned pederasts...","review":"Anne Rice has outdone herself this time. Her unique style of formulaic decadence and prissy pornography has never been done in as overblown and pompous a manner as here in \\"The Vampire Armand\\".Everything is swamped in turgid and repetitive descriptions of \\"sumptuous velvet\\", \\"dark curls\\", preternaturally pale skin, angelic boys, and of course mature vampires sodomizing youths. I actually believe that Rice has some form of pathological predilection for this paedophile filth. This book is even worse than her \\"beauty\\" series, and that is no mean feat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money I paid for it","review":"As an avid reader of the Chronicles, I expected an upswing after Violin (another disapointment), but was let down again....

She weaves history and facts with her fictional story so that the lines blur. One of the best books I've read this year. I'm a fan of the paranormal/supernatural in fiction and this is one of the best offerings right now. I also recommend in a somewhat similar yet very different vein, Robert Doherty's Area 51 series-- current paranormal in a complex and alarming story of things that border on the supernatural in 1998 America.

Lestat is amazing, and I'm hooked. However, I was very disappointed by this book. Personally, I'm biased. =) Lestat is my favorite, and I guess no other vampires measure up to him. That was my problem with Armand. I put the book down after reading half of it months ago, and I'm having the hardest time going to pick it up again. Being pleasured by little boys completely grossed me out, but I'm not leery to pick up another book if Lestat is the main character. Maybe I'll get into it again, maybe not. I can't wait to pick up Merrick, and I would gladly re-read previous books in the vampire chronicles. Anne Rice has never let me down with descriptions of where the vampires are, she is one of the best authors I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An opportunity wasted","review":"Despite my misgivings after the fourth book in the cronicles I gave in and read this book. Unfortunately I wished that I hadn't or at least that I hadn't hope for more. This book is frankly boring it is over long in it descriptions of places, objects and things and too short excitement. After the wonderful Vampire LeStat this book is a disappointment. It waxes on and on about unimportants things for more pages than are necessary. It misses all the opportunities to become great, skipping over the vampires true nature in exchange for pretty words and descriptions of their surroundings. Vampires are truely soleless beings who are by their nature ruthless, evil and quite sexy. None of the vampires in this tale are any of these things, instead they are just shells not given the opportunity to develop truly vampire natures. Not recommended to LeStat fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been worse--2.5 stars","review":"I've read Anne Rice's work since the publication of \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" During that time, I've seen her prose become increasingly florid and her narrative structure weaker and weaker. Lush descriptions have always been her forte, and this book includes enough of them to please her most rabid fans. The Venetian Renaissance setting provides an intriguing background for the relationship between the ancient Marius and Armand, his young Russian slave. However, the quality of the story line is overwhelmed by the tendentious purple prose. There is the kernel of a good book here--in fact \\"The Vampire Armand\\" is much better than Rice's earlier \\"Pandora.\\"-- but it gets buried under the overwrought descriptions and hot house sex scenes. 2.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful. Armand is a perfect Vampire","review":"I cant believe there are so many bad reviews on here of this book!Awesome book. the ending was a shocker. This is one of the best Chronicles next to Interview and Vampire Lestat.

I am hoping this is a publisher mistake and someone sees this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly unarticulated , and vacant!","review":"Weakly planned and reharsed, the story does not flow at all. Probably the author has a small story in the middle of the novel but not before or beyond . Very repititive and lean ,a total turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been so much better.","review":"I purchased this book because Armand is such a great character and I wanted to learn a bit more about him. The first half of the book was wonderful, it answered all my questions. That joy lasted up until the middle when things just started to fall apart. Unfortunately for the reader it just never gets better and by chapter 24 you too are willing to go into the light to end the misery. Things happen that Rice can't or won't explain, leaving you and Armand at a loss. So take my advice, read The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned but none of the rest. If Ms. Rice can't get the facts straight you can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Vampire Porno!","review":"Geez! If a homosexual was in the closet, he'd be out after reading this book!

Well, if your into that sorta thing you'll love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Fantastic","review":"This book brought back the real focus of the Vampire series,Vampires. Not the brat prince which I quite frankly was getting quite sick of. I new there were other vampires with interesting beginings just as Louis and Lestat. I am still waiting to hear more of Pandora , Santino, Maherat,Gabrielle,just to name a few I hope this new book puts Ms. Rice back on the path .It was starting to seem like Lestat and the hardy boys mystery.

The answer is obviously limitless. Like anything that's been overdone, quality declines and with Rice, this decline has been obvious ever since her first well-written and fairly original \\"Interview With a Vampire.\\" For those who cannot have too much bloodsucking and/or gushy immortal torment, this book will satisfy. To me, Rice has lost her power by oversaturating her chosen genre. Can she even write a real novel? Why doesn't she give it a shot and let's see."},{"rating":"2","title":"the vampire armand","review":"I liked this book a lot, because you got to know Armand from the inside out. Why he went from good to bad and back to good. Excellent story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I see there is no option for 0 stars. I loved Pandora, it was hard to put down, but Armand is so hard to pick up! Enough sex already! That's all Armand did while he was alive! Pandora at least led an interesting life! Marius was a completely different person in Pandora. Who is this weirdo in Armand? Blah Blah Blah! Anne, I love you, but this sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G !","review":"Initially, I was estatic to discover that Armand survived his suicidal attempt. And the story started out interesting enough. I could even tolerate the sexual themes. However, the things that ruined the story was the ENDLESS descriptions, ENDLESS history lessons, and wasted focus on boring Benji and Sybelle. I can pick up a History Book for a history lesson. And environmental/new character descriptions are fine as long as they don't overpower the plot or primary character(s). I desperately wanted more DIALOGUE, PLOT and a TIGHTER story. Also, what was wrong with Lestat? And what's with all the tears? Marius, Louis and the female vampires are not constantly crying like Lestat and Armand. I still love Armand - I just don't feel that Rice did him any justice in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"unorignal","review":"this book seems to follow the same format of nearly all of the other vempire chronicals - in the first chapter he decides to record his story - from human to vampire. i am a fan of rice's earlier works - but this one is unoriginal and involves some themes i am not comfortable with. the scene where marius has sex with the young mortal boy bothered me, not the sex part, but the fact that the boy was an orphan and had been horribly abused, and was desperate for love. marius took advantage of this in my oppinion, so growing up he thought he was in love with marius, but he really wasn't given the opportunity to experience a love that was nonsexual."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit wordy at times but entertaining overall","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The Vampire Armand\\". Not much of his life was given to the readers in previous books, just crumb by crumb. Here the reader gets the whole enchilada, figuratively speaking. I must admit when I was reading how he was captured as a slave to be sold, that part of the book was a bit too lengthy and kinda bored me to tears. Armand led quite the hedonistic life with Marius, up until he was separated from his master by those rogue vampires. From the hedonistic life he had with Marius, Armand moves on to leading a coven of vampires whose beliefs do not coincide with what Marius installed in Armand's morals. And then we see Armand in modern day society from when he tried to set himself on fire after viewing the veil that God gave to Lestat to his new life with his two new companions Sybelle and Benji. Compelling for the most part but it could have used a little improvement I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic","review":"The Vampire Armand leads you to another world, full of love, power, and lust.

I really love Anne Rice's books, but I could not relate to the story. And if you do miss this read, I don't think you'll miss anything.My final vote is \\"Skip it.\\" Armand is more interesting in \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" than in his own book, I'm sad to say. I do look forward to reading how she combines the Mayfair Witches with the Vampires. So I have something to look forward to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Reading","review":"I have tried to read this book 3 times and all three times I have put the book down because of lack of interesting character development. The characters do not catch the attention of the readers as any of her previous books have. The story becomes slow reading quickly and becomes utterly boring 50 pages in.

After reading Interview with the Vampire, and Lestat, and seeing the movies as well, maybe I expected something I don't know a bit darker?I just find this book quite annoying and disappointing. If you have read ALL of her books and like them then go ahead I am sure you will LOVE this book,But if you're like me and have read only a few, you will most likely find it a disappointment as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably my least favorite of the series","review":"I didn't like the character when he was a supporting one in the other books and I like him even less here.

I could not put it down. Many people have complained about the homosexual thing, but remember people, this took place 500 years ago and people were different back then, especially men. I definetely recommend it to every Anne Rice lover. Also, it is probably my 2nd favorite Vampire novel next to The Vampire Lestat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armand's a hottie!","review":"This book only took me two days to read. It's very detailed and a little too explicit, but I liked it anyways. You don't really learn a whole lot about Armand's vampire life, but you get a lot of info on where he came from and stuff like that. The imagery is fantastic, and even though it kind of changes the way you think about Armand and Marius(in a bad way), I'd recommend it to anyone who's read the other Vampire Chronicles books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply boring","review":"I just finished the book, and am happy that it's over .. I agree with most of what the reader from New York wrote on October 14, and the one from Northern California on October 18: Once upon a time, Rice's books were a real pleasure .. this one is full of historical inaccuracies, facts in contradiction with some presented in the series previously. The first part with the (to me not too disturbing) homosexual touch might be nice to read, the rest is simply a gathering of confused thoughts and views, sometimes completely out of the context (like the one sentence where she describes Leonardo Di Caprio as a \\"young and brillant actor\\", what has he got besides a pretty face ? BTW, if anybody wants to see historical inaccuracies at their worst, watch \\"The man with the iron mask\\" .. it's depressing).Anyway, if Anne Rice doesn't spend time really working on her next book, her time is over.Mine with her is (i.e. I won't buy anything else from her)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downhill slide of the Chronical has finally hit bottom","review":"The downhill slide of the Vampire Chronicals has finally hirt rock bottom with The Vampire Armand.

A classic example of writing for money rather than passion's sake, and the entire series pays the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tapped Out!","review":"Is it me or has Rice pretty much tapped out on this series? The character of Armand just didn't ring true as the book developed. From under the tutelage of Marius, to the man we first meet in \\"Interview\\", seems either Marius wasn't an adequate teacher at all, or Rice couldn't explain how the time Armand spents with Sorrino justifies his drastic character changes?!

At least Steven King has a plot to flesh out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Anne Rice's earlier works","review":"I loved Anne Rice's early works, but the magic has slowly turned into aimless wanderings. Rice has become so successful that her editors no longer seem to be able to do their jobs--i.e., EDIT.

Where those books were entrancing, held the readers interest, couldn't put the books down type, this one went on and on. Blah, blah, blah!

This story sure sheds light upon this creature. What a great story it is! I like this guy just as much (maybe more) than Louis. Anne Rice does a superb job of relating Armand's Renaissance-Era life to today's reader. I felt like I was sitting there with them in Venice. For Armand to go through tough times, wonderful times, tough times with pressure and being abandoned from everything, then meeting Lestate - who is the exact opposite of empathy and sympathy. It's funny in a sad way. Which defines this story: Ironic, Complex and Soulful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like this, I really do, but ..........","review":"I LOVE Anne Rice. I have read about Vampires and Witches virtually from cover to cover in one sitting. I can not get enough, but Armand ... weeeelll that is turning out to be another story. I am finding it heavy going, a little bit too descriptive and not enough real meat. I have read other reviews which are concerned with child-related material, but that was not my biggest problem which was keeping the book in my hands long enough to read it all. I am 2/3rds through now, come hell or high water I will finish. Who knows, I may even change my opinion by the end. Yes, who knows! However, this will NEVER put me off Anne Rice, she is still one of my favourite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for any Armand fan.","review":"For me the \\"secondary characters\\" such as Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora, Santino and even Daniel are the more interesting of Anne's vampires. Lestat bores me. Armand is one of my favorite characters because he's so complex, menacing and yet seemingly innocent. I enjoyed reading about his past very much. The only problem I had with the book was I found the characters Sibyle and Benji very trite and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VAMPIRE ARMAND by Anne Rice ...","review":"... is an extremely difficult book to rate. It nearly returns to the old Anne Rice feeling towards the first part, as Armand tells the tale of his life to David Talbot. Everyone is here - Pandora, Marius, Lestat. It is absorbing, and Anne Rice is even more stunningly vivid in her writing than before, telling a tale of the ages. Yet the tale is occasionally confusing, annoyingly erotic, and towards the end, very much too religious - like her previous flop, MEMNOCH THE DEVIL. I must give the book a 4 for Rice's ability to keep me hooked through the whole thing, but it still can't compare with Anne Rice's earlier works. The ending will need to be read by Lestat worshippers, though, so pick it up - even if Armand isn't your type of vampy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for Life","review":"Absolutely perfect soundtrack.

You know the ones. Something to read on the plane, maybe get a laugh or two. Nothing too challenging. I was on vacation, you understand. Well, all I can say is, Wow. \\"Idiots\\" is actually a well-written, literate novel that happens to deliver audible laughs on every page and gut-wrenching ones every few pages. It's a modern, hipper, funnier look at the world through the same eyes as Kurt Vonnegut and John Irving. The writing is like Tom Robbins and Douglas Adams only much more literate, while still being just as hilarious. A surprising find."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Find","review":"Every once in a while you pick a book randomly off the shelf at the bookstore (I admit, it was because the cover looked oddly interesting), only to find later that you've stumbled onto to something much more than a little bedtime reading.I fell in love with this book. From the leads to smallest bit players, the characters are hilarious, witty, perceptive, outrageous and sometimes they'll even break your heart. Noel \\"Satan\\" Dorobek is the greatest literary anti-hero since John Kennedy Toole's Ignatious J. Reilly. A man at odds with society, cell phones, advertising, and poorly made foil products. Yet unlike Toole, Savio has created a character that is more accessible, more human. In doing so, Savio may have cost himself a Pulitzer Prize, but he's fashioned a work with just as much bite, but one that's more modern, and more endearing. It is a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale imitation of Ignatius Reilly","review":"I'm always looking for literate, satirical books with a wicked sense of humor. Having read all of these 5-star reviews, and convinced that this was one of those rare finds, I rushed out to get a copy of \\"Idiots in the Machine.\\" Instead of a book bursting with originality or wit, I found instead what can only be called a wannabe...the main character is flat, contrived, and totally preposterous and forced. Imitation may be the greatest form of flattery, but it doesn't mean it's a good read. Try \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" if you haven't already, or maybe Julian Barnes or Kurt Vonnegut or TC Boyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Derivative","review":"Agree with the other reviewer who called it a ripoff of Confederacy of Dunces. This is a highly-contrived, paper-thin work that just labors through a plot that loosely borrows from dozens of better works. If you think this is a 4 or 5 star read and in any way funny, you need to read Confederacy of Dunces, John Irving, Michael Chabon, et.al."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple & Powerful","review":"Shakles the song is fantastic.

The diameter of the product is significantly smaller than what I have used in the past and therefore it was difficult to stack in the valve containment device. Lastly, I anticipated a tablet that would dissolve slowly over time to feed continuously.

Putting it together I soon realized why it's so cheap.The end caps for the legs and top hooks are made of a very flimsy, brittle plastic, and they do not fit properly. Several of them broke when I tried to put them on. The ones that didn't break were misaligned, leaving sharp metal ends bare.The bolts are completely visible after assembly. Not just the heads of the bolts - you can also see the shaft of the bolt between two parts. Things don't line up flush with each other.And finally, it is very unstable. A towel I was using caught on one of the hooks and flung the rack at my face. I ended up with a fat lip and a cut.I promptly threw it out and spent the money to buy a nice towel rack, like I guess I should have done at the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the best of all","review":"I use to have the wooden type and parts breaks on it everyday but when I got this, no part of it has come off and every body is safe in the houes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsive reading","review":"Must read.The second book follows the first exceptionally, wonderfull!I have just started the third book, When Darkness Falls, Cant put it down:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first","review":"The second installment in Merecedes Lackey's 'The Obsidian Trilogy' is just as exciting ast he first.

Secondly - I really liked the main character and his growing as I raced threw the pages - from an innocent boy without a clue to a young man with a great burden and hartbreaking responsibilities.Finally what I really liked was the fast pace of this book - it is nothing like the Sword of truth or the Wheel of time series.

I don't get why this stupid rule of not asking questions is back in place with the war going on. Supposed to be a set of \\"war manners\\".Why does this upset me so much?

She did not have any background in Trusts but much in administration and that was the skill the bank needed. Her supervisor was a fantastic teacher and introduced my wife to the world of Estates and Trusts. She in turn introduced me by having me read this book. The material is well presented and organized. The basic information helps you understand the signifcance between planning and not planning. It provides you enough information so you can make reasonable decisions about you own plan of action.

I guess I've been spoiled by only watching the good ones with David Wells and Ciaran O'Keefe so far. The THREE episodes on here (yes, only three) all have that over dramatic/over acting Derek A. in them. In addition, they were not at all scary, nothing substantial happened in any of them, and I actually fell asleep during the last one. Very sorry I wasted my money on this. Derek's constant yammering throughout all three episodes gets old fast. Seriously, the man does not shut up.

Like another reviewer, I read 40%, put it down out of boredom, finally finished it but man, it was tough. Just plain dumb and dull writing, an idiotic heroine, superficially historical setting.

I see no redeeming qualities in this one, though normally i have a tolerance for cheese (I did appreciate Caroline by the same author). The 18 year old heroine thinks her mother has died brutally in a fire while being raped by a British soldier only days before, yet promptly flings herself into a petulant flirtation with a roguish privateer without a seeming care in the world. She has nightmares about her mother but her grief does not seem to permeate her waking hours in the slightest. That was my first issue. My second issue is the glaring overuse of exclamation points. Every other line uttered by any character ends in one! It's really annoying! Luckily, I downloaded this book for free so I can say with conviction it is worth what I paid for it. If you enjoy vapid, predictable story lines rich with implausibility - this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth every penny...","review":"...especially since i got it for free.

Actually, I had completed about 3/4ths of this book when I began to skim and then skipped to the end.The characters and story line were interesting enough but something was plainly missing in the relationship between Andre and Devon. Devon was young and immature so her foolish desires and the way she dealt with life could be excused. However, I hated the fact that Andre kept on having affairs even after he was obviously in a serious relationship with Devon, especially when he attempted to get it on with one of her best friends, Azalea, in the same inn where he and Devon were staying while Devon and Azalea's husband were downstairs. Give me a break!All I can say is Ugh!

I'm all for reformed heros but he never reforms! Randomly at the end of the novel he decides he in facts loves the Devon even though he has treated her like complete crap and slept with other women while they were \\"together\\". The heroine is quite remarkable that she puts up with him but I really don't like characters that enter into marriages with other men when the man they love is there but not the groom. It's not that I don't mind characters with flaws but these are severe enough that I just didn't find the characters likable enough. This didn't stop with the main characters either. The heroine's best friend tried to sleep with the hero even though she was engaged to another man and she could guess that the heroine was in love with him. The heroine found out and they were still friends. Awkward. All and all I can't see why this book has gotten any good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty predictable stuff","review":"Imagine all of the traditional romance tropes.

He may miss a minor point or two (e.g., Mt. Athos is the site of 20 monasteries, not a single monastery), but the heart of the matter--the heart of Orthodoxy--is well expressed. Unlike the reviewer below, the idea of juxtaposing \\"the Orthodox\\" with \\"Christians\\" strikes me as painfully ignorant; fortunately, such a division does not figure in Prof. Fairbairn's important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reading for Orthodox and non-Orthodox","review":"Donald Fairbairn has done a good job of presenting the Eastern Orthodox religion in a dialogical and understandable way. This book is very helpful for understanding Eastern Orthodoxy, especially because Fairbairn accurately displays the fact that there are differences among those of the Orthodox Church. Fairbairn is helpful by showing us Christians what we can learn from Orthodoxy, and what Orthodoxy can learn from Christians.

For example, on page 131 the arithmetic is all wrong. The original payment to the service was $180 per hour and Delia got $60 of that. The subsequent direct payments to Delia's post office box were $50 per hour, which is certainly not 3 times $60 as stated. Seems she actually gave herself a cut in pay, which might also be appropriate for the author/editor. The suspense of waiting until the end of the book for revelation of 'what Delia did' kept me interested through some rather repetitious and boring episodes. However - there was no revelation! The secret was never revealed to the poor sucker reading the book. I was annoyed by this at the time, and still am a day later.

I found all of the characters completely unlikeable and underdeveloped, and towards the end I didn't care WHO was blackmailing Delia. I also found it completely unbelievable that every man Johnny spoke with during his investigation had no problem immediately opening up to him about Delia. It's implausible that each would share intimate details to a complete stranger who thinks they may be a blackmailer! I, too, found the movie character/actor references annoying. Finally, I was perturbed that the author chose not to reveal Delia's secret sexual \\"tricks\\" after going on and on about them throughout the book (couldn't think of anything spicy enough?) In all, I found this book to be boring and not quite the page-turner I was hoping for.

I read quite often, and loved the refreshing change that Overdrive brought. It was honest, and talked about love, relationships, people and how we live and view our lives with out being sugar coated like many novels are. I could identify and connect with many characters in this book. The characters felt like real people, going through life just like the rest of us.

The bowl is secured at the bottom by a plastic ring that has three notches that are located at the bottom of the shaft that holds the knife blade. After the bowl was properly locked into place, I started the processor, but shortly thereafterafter, one of the three notches on the plastic ring broke off. Now the bowl cannot be held securely in place. I purchased this processor less than 2 years ago, and since then have used it only a very few times. After this happened to my processor, I looked at some of the larger and newer KitchenAid processors, and found that they eliminated this serious design flaw. Since my processor was out of warranty, and since the estimate was that it would cost $32 for shipping + parts + labor, I figured that for that cost I could buy a new processor. And as another customer noted, I will be sure NOT to buy a KitchenAid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken After 2 Years Light Use","review":"As other reviewers have reported, the plastic shaft that spins the blade broke on my processor. I used it maybe twice a month on average during those two years. There is no excuse for this breaking aside from poor craftsmanship.

Perhaps they will find a new type of handle for the bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, bad customer service","review":"You would expect a $100+ appliance to last more than 2 years. It worked great for a while - we didn't use it that heavily, maybe a few dozen times. Recently, the base of the plastic spindle cracked and is now crumbling - this is what has the notches that turn the blades. It is built in to the base of the machine, so can't be replaced separately. It worked beautifully up until this, but now we will have to buy a whole new unit. We complained to KitchenAid about the poor quality/performance, but they basically told us to pound sand. I would have bought another of their products if they'd at least given us a coupon or discount on a new purchase, but not now. Their products can't be trusted and they don't stand behind them. That's the last KithenAid product we will ever buy. Will give Cuisinart a try next."},{"rating":"1","title":"really not good","review":"This flimsy food processor lasted for 3.5 months of everyday use.

It just has a sturdy feel to it that this one did not have. I would still be using it, except I lost the shredding disc when we moved. It is too old to get a replacement disc.

Before it was 14 months old the handle disintegrated rendering the processor unusable. The cheapest price for a replacement bowl is about $40.00 with shipping.I am ditching this piece of junk and replacing it with a Cuisinart or Braun. I will decide which shortly.

The KitchenAid had a much smaller feed tube than the Cusinart it replaced, so it was less convenient for preparing vegetable shreds and slices. It seemed perfectly adequate until it stopped working 10 1/2 months after we bought it. It's possible to fidget with the lower handle to engage the interlock button, but the plastic is very flimsy and I doubt this will work for long.It's within the 1-year warranty, but we decided to write it off and get a Cuisinart.

I wasn't prepared for it- my old one weighed only about 5 lbs and I could easily whip it out when I needed it.That being said, it looks great on the counter. It is a nicely designed product, inside and out. Easy to clean, not too big or too small.7/14/09 UPDATE: I am still in love with this appliance! I use it all the time.12/10/10 UPDATE: The bowl handle broke and now I am replacing it for $30. I've been dangerously rigging it with a chopstick for several months and now I can't even do that.

However, the way they designed the handle is completely idiotic! There is an opening where water and goo can enter the handle, yet there is no way to open it to clean it out. After a year of use, I have to throw this thing away strictly because it is completely disgusting! The mold and crud that collects in the handle is nicely visible through the clear inner portion of the handle.

So technically I would give the food processor itself a one star and KitchenAid customer service a five star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it were better","review":"I had great expectations when I purchased this processor, Kitchenaid had never let me down in the past. The base is impressively heavy, clean lines (easy to clean) and simple to operate. Unfortunately the work bowl handle is not very well constructed. If not locked onto the base very very gently it breaks, and there are several small pieces to break. I replaced the work bowl, paying more than half the price of the processor, and assumed I had to be very very careful, and it cracked anyway. Then the base part that turns the blade broke off, not all of it, it still runs, but if part is broken, how long before the rest does. I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this processor","review":"This is a very quiet food processor and does a nice job. However, it won't last. Choose something more durable is my best advice. It is true the design is very bad for cleanliness. I figured out how to wash it with the small end of a bottle brush. However the plastic pieces on the bowl handle have broken more times than I can count. My husband is handy and up until now has been able to Mickey Mouse it back together, but this time it is unfixable. I have only had this food processor a little over a year. I would suggest staying away from this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke too soon","review":"I've had this food processor a little over a month now.

As far as the machine goes, it is fast, quiet, and makes a banana ice cream that is out of this world delicious :) The only reason I gave it a four instead of five stars is because it is small. It is perfect for nights when I cook for only myself, but even cooking dinners for two (and especially three) might be more tricky.

Other than that, there was hardly any romance in it. I bought this book as a romance book and it really wasn't. The second story was better than the first. In the first story, Eb and Sallie had a bitter past together and they seemed just too forgive and forget very easily. Like in one day they were friends. Then came all the action with the drug lords and Eb ended up saving the day! The second story was rushed but I liked it better than the first.

Unfortunately, the similarities don't end there. Along with having the same characters, it has the same general plot. It is 100% predictable. The last chapter of the second story is there for the sole purpose of introducing another book, the next in the undisclosed series which- surprise- has the same plot!

An extremely readable and thoroughly enjoyable book; all politicians should be as likable as Kerry Kilcannon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching grass grow","review":"This was very difficult to get through and completely lacked the emotion or drama proclaimed on its cover. The characters are not very well developed or believable and the story line runs very slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title was better than the Book","review":"The storyline had a great deal of potential. I was bored and disappointed. This book was kind of predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!","review":"This book is really predictable and boring. Thank god I read it at the bookstore while my wife shopped. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up, or wait and get it at the library. In addition it's yet another preachy novel where the novelist just has to ram his liberal views down your throat. Seems every writer now a days just must make a political statement. I just wish,instead, they would write a good tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but the twist was pointless","review":"I really enjoyed the book - until the end.It seems like Patterson didn't know what else to do with the affair between Kerry and Lara, so he just dropped the whole thing.I still don't understand why Patterson chose the man he did to be the assassin. The whole idea of the radical pro-life killer was good enough without having to bring back someone from Kerry's past. (A someone who had nothing to do with the pro-life cause when Kerry knew him.)A very good book, but be prepared for the strange twists at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughingly banal.","review":"Pro-affirmative action, pro-government health care, pro-abortion idealist runs against right to bear arms zealots, pro-life murderers, and big bad tobacco. Love interest is Lara, a journalist described as someone with \\"great character.\\" She has two year affair with married man, obtains an abortion to save her career, and covers the story of his primary run \\"objectively.\\" If you can't write the ending to this book after reading 20 pages . . . It always a disappointment to read a book where the author has suddenly decided us Bubbas need a lecture on liberalism. I won't make the mistake of buying his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No safe place to hide from this awful book","review":"Upon a recommendation from a friend, I gave this book a whirl. I gave it up about half way through. I just found Kerry to be incredibly unlikeable. Patterson was not able to convince me that this guy was a Kennedy-esque politician. He should tell stories in the first person. That way he can cut back on the dialogue a little, which he is incapable of writing. In all fairness, the only really bad dialogue was that of his female characters. This guy ought to spend a little more time around woman. Learn how they talk with each other and to men. Incorporate that into his writing. That would have made all the difference in the world when I was trying to wade through this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safer to avoid it","review":"This book did keep my interest to some extent until the title character has an affair on his wife and lacks the communication skills with his lover to have her avoid what was a very descriptive abortion. This made my stomach turn and was as far as I was willing to go with this. It was just too unbelievable..his wife wants to leave him because running for President is too dangerous and his feminist girlfriend choses her career over a child?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun book","review":"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I found it a bit long in parts. Wannabe President Kerry Kilcannon is a great character study of someone who is unsure just how much to lose or compromise to ascend to the highest office. What's nice is that he is an honest to goodness good person. I wish he were running for office in real life. I recommend this book. This was the first Patterson book I have read, but it won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One From The Master","review":"Richard North Patterson is one of America's best contemporary fiction writers. His character development is outstanding, and his ability to consistently tell a good story is impressive.True, there are times when this story kind of lags, however it is representative of the election process. I would bet that reporters and politicians alike become absolutely bored with day after day of the same thing...looking in the same place for another story. So to that end, Patterson conveys what it must feel like to be a part of all that. And he does it very, very well.The negative reviews are thoughtless. And as to the person who said this story is not thought-provoking, I say go back to your mindless world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standards...a difficult read","review":"As one of the other reviews said, only liberal P/C views are found in this book eg., no balance. I had trouble getting through this book, story drags along. I enjoyed his other books, hope the next is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting insite into the politcal scene weak plot","review":"One of Mr.Patterson's weakest book. Plot weak and at times very boring. Really no surprise at the ending but very predicatible. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Mr.Patterson's other books but this was a chore to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore to read","review":"I finally was able to finish \\"No Safe Place\\" and found it to be a chore to read. Pattersons books have given me great joy to read in the past, however this book was an EXTREMELY difficult read. The content was fair, and the characters well developed, however it lacked the ability to catch my attention for any length of time. I would not suggest this book to anyone. Its only redeeming quality is the characters. The story, however, is just too drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was better than reading cereal boxes, barely.","review":"If you are left of center and hate Republicans, the right to life and the NRA this could be the book for you. Although the plot and characters are still very thin as are the disguised \\"real\\" folks, i.e., VP Gore and Mort Zuckerman. Wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a great fan of Patterson's books, and have oft times preferred reading his writings to those of John Grisham. But I am sorely disappointed in NO SAFE PLACE. This is not a mystery of any genre, but a story of a love between a presidentail wannabe and his soul-mate. All in all, I suppose this was a good read, as I did finish the book, but it is not Richard North Patterson at his best. If he wishes to change his writing venue, please let us know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson has given us no safe place from boredom here!","review":"I have read most of R.N.Patterson's books - and the enjoyment quotient has ranged from moderate to high. Had to give this one up after 200 pages: insipid, putrid, shallow, and BORING!! The characters are stark and wooden - the pace that of a martini-soaked snail. I felt absolutely no empathy with anyone in this grotesque political melodrama - it almost made \\"election 2000\\" seem exciting in retrospect! Yes, I have given up reading Richard North Patterson for lent - and maybe for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was predictable from beginning to end with very little depth to the story. Disappointing for Richard North Patterson who usually writes some interesting stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring; very slow read","review":"This was one book I could not wait to finish. Politics aside, even the story was choppy. Very slow, mostly uninteresting characters. I will not buy another one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"This book was almost impossible to finish. Rarely can I not finish a fiction story, but this one was torture. Patterson's previous novels were excellent. If you liked those, I suggest that you pass on this one. As for politcal thrillers, I have read much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow, unexciting","review":"Having enjoyed all his other books, I was really disappointed with this one. Kept putting it down and wishing it was finished. Only because I hate giving up on a book did I continue to the end..and was I glad to reach the last page! Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to any of Patterson's previous works.","review":"Getting through No Safe Place was a challenge in itself. Having had great expectations going into the novel I was disappointed in the story's weak story line, lack of suspense, and for Patterson, sub par writing.I have read all of Patterson's previous works and there is no question that No Safe Place is his worst! I realize he tries to cross the line from the legal thriller to a \\"political\\" thriller, but is unsuccessful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and kinda boring","review":"This guy can write a good book. This isn't a good example of it. The whole thing is just too predictable. If this had been his first novel it would rate a 3 star maybe, but this is so much worse than other two novels I have read it deserves a lower rating. Better luck next time, RNP."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake","review":"I only paid $5 for this CD , but , what a stinker. I don't have any Ides of March & thought this might be the answer , particularly to get the song Vehicle. What a disapointment to find it's 5 plus minutes of crowd sing along. I'll never listen to this CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much ...","review":"I got the album based on good reviews on Amazon -but what I am hearing is some not-so-impressive live versions of songs from well after their peak era.Live concerts are sometimes hard to enjoy if you were not actually at the event - this is one of those ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Exactly what I was looking for! It was the right size and did the job of fixing the shower door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I loved this book from start to finish. It is easy reading and relaxing. All the characters in the book are well developed and have personality. The flashbacks to the ancestors of the 3 girls are well written and keep ones attention.I would recommend this book for easy reading (holidays, etc.) to anybody. Definitively a book that I would read again and again. In fact, if it was not on the Kindle, I would give it to my mother immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining!","review":"I read this book unaware it must be the sequel to \\"Whiskey Island\\". Not a problem. The author pulls you in with each character and the storyline going from past to present, then back again was done smoothly.
