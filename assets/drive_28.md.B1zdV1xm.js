The singing superb and the staging impressive.","review":"My wife and I saw a stage production of Les Miserables several years ago, loved it very much and bought the CD featuring the original Broadway cast right after. Also saw the recent (2012) film, which features drama and realism over pure music, and also like it very much. After watching and listening to this concert on YouTube, I purchased it the same day. It is a superb cast, especially Alfie Boe and Samantha Barks; I believe they are the best Jean Valjean and Eponine yet. Boe's\\" Bring Him Home\\" is the purest, most beautiful I've ever heard and Samantha's \\"On My Own\\" is both beautiful and full of emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"As spectacular as the Movie","review":"And the singing talent is the finest.

It is just terrible. All the singers were just screaming rather than singing. There is absolutely no musicality in their voices. Lea Salonga's voice has a wobble so big you can drive a truck through it. Please save your money and your time, don't watch it. I will turn off the DVD player as soon as I finish typing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed but expected","review":"Les Miserables is one of the, if not, the greatest musicals of all time. However this ensemble of a cast was disappointing. Marketing was at play to gain a new audience. They did the same with Phantom of the Opera movie. Why in the world would they cast Nick Jonas? How do you go from Michael Balll to a Jonas Brother? His accent was more \\"English\\" than the British. I think little Gavourche would have put on a better Marius. This Valjean is no Colm Wilkinson. Wilksonson was the most convincing of Valjeans because you could feel a man and his struggles when he sings. This Javert commands no authority and Thenardier was difficult to watch. This cast is a dismal comparison to the Original London Cast, but this was also expected.I do recommend that Les Mis fans rent this copy because of the nice little treats at the end of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Arrived timely however when I went to use in my dvd player did not play at all.

The 10th anniversary concert literally had a dream cast. Unfortunately, this one didn't. Lea Salonga was soooo perfect as Eponie 15 years ago. Her replacement in the 25th just couldn't hold up to part. And while I was surprised Nick Jonas had some bit of a voice talent, he just wasn't a trained operatic singer. It was disappointing that he was casted as Marius. Really? Come-on!

The voices, and even though it isn't the show that you would see if you saw it on Broadway...the songs are the same! Sung beautifully and with as much passion as if you were in that era!

Awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New voices to an all-time favorite!","review":"OK; it's not the Tenth Anniversary \\"Dream\\" cast, but if you like the musical it's well worth purchasing. There were some performances I liked better in each one, but these failed to detract from my enjoyment of either whole production.I believe the criticism of Marius is far too extreme, and certainly not something which detracts from my enjoyment of this performance. However least I be too forgiving, I must say that none of the 25th performers are up to Phillip Quast or Ruthie Henshall (this comment made me go to You-Tube and listen to Ruthie sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" and Phillip sing \\"Stars before finishing this review). That is not to say The 25th singers were in the least wanting.

The first page had me hooked and I read through the rest of the book with eagerness, wanting to know the outcomes. The main character loses her son in a car accident and sets out on a quest to determine what happened when she experiences some supernatural events. The events become more frequent and sinister leading her to a frightening conclusion. There were a few minor loose ends at the end of the book, which is why I only gave it a 4.

But twenty three pounds lighter and a new bounce to my step it certainly has done for me what no diet, book or program has ever done.

My LCD flatscreen has several inputs, and I've tried every single one. I went to my Itouch video settings and made sure the settings were correct. Nothing. As my title suggests, it's better to be safe than sorry. Pay the extra few bucks and buy a cable that connects directly to the ipod connector (and not the headphone jack).

I bought it after hearing \\"Wonders Never Cease\\" in a commercial. There is not one single thing I don't like about this CD. It's at once a little ethnic, a little poppy, and a lot retro. A beautiful mix, topped with perfect lyrics and a FANTASTIC singer. I absolutely cannot get enough of Daisy Martey's voice! The only downside is that I have to wait for another Morcheeba w/Daisy Martey release--I might not make it!A deliciously slick collection of songs! Don't miss this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye Bye Skye Goodbye Daisy","review":"All The Reviews I read are unfair. Come on this album is magnificient and deserves to be reviewed honestly.

Morchiba's prior stuff has a prominent place in many of my playlists -- so trippy, so beautiful. At virtually every dinner party, someone asks \\"who is this?\\" when a Morchiba tune comes around.But I am sorry to say that I doubt any tracks from this album will end up on my future playlists. I agree with another reviewer - several tunes sound like they could be out of a James Bond movie soundtrack. Don't get me wrong - it's not bad, it is just not the treasured sound of the greatest trip hop band of all time.Sad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice is gone","review":"The voice is gone, the voice is gone....a sad day, Skye Edwards no longer haunts the ethereal realm of trip hop and its a damn shame. The voice is gone and although Daisey's voice is good its not Skye Edwards'. I fell in love with Morcheeba because of a voice, Skye's voice; nothing else like it on earth. To me Skye and Morcheeba are one in the same. Remove her and you should change the name, its simply not the same. I miss that voice, that voice, that sensual voice, that hypnotic voice...what happened?If you don't own it already, buy \\"Who Can You Trust\\" and start your collection there and see what I'm talking about, then you can end your collection just before this one. This is not Morcheeba...its not the voice. Its decent but falsely advertised as Morcheeba....sort of like Sammy Haggar sitting in for David Lee Roth...its good but not the same...Skye Edwards please visit us again...please"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Antidote to Mediocrity","review":"After the loss of Skye, Morcheeba's remaining members knew they had to take a step back and look at themselves. The inclusion of a new guitarist and singer, along with different directions in sound--a medieval-sounding flute on Ten Men, for example--prove they still know how to make good, non-redundant music.The thing that strikes one most about The Antidote is Daisy; not just her as a singer, but the way the rest of the group has refitted their sound for her. She's got an edge that Skye didn't show in her singing; she's more dramatic, and has allowed the sound of the music to shift more to that area as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I bought this album after falling in love withCharangoand I was quite disappointed. Skye Edwards departure made for a different sound that I personally didn't enjoy as much.I respect the opinion of those who do like this album, but my personal experience is that I like Charango andBig Calm, but not this. I think I ended up giving it away to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Effort...","review":"In my opinion, replacing Skye Edwards with Daisy Martey has substantially changed the flavor of Morcheeba, and decidedly not for the better. Quite honestly, I'm surprised at the number of favorable reviews here. To me, this album sounds like Morcheeba retread (nothing new here musically), and without interesting vocals. In fact, I found some of the songs downright embarrassingly poor and couldn't listen to them all the way through. If this is what the new Morcheeba sounds like, I won't be buying any more of their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES! This is MORCHEEBA???","review":"I read all the reviews, and selected this based on the most mature and unemotional reviewer i could find. Alas - I ask you to trust your instincts and believe me when I say morcheeba is not morcheeba with out Skye's voice - unless you really really really really love [bad] Disco. Go to Itunes instead.

It sounds like a pop song, FCOL. I got hooked on Big Calm after only ONE song that was included on a mix CD I got for free after attending a Stevie Nicks concert.This album just isn't as interesting as Big Calm was. I'm going to see what Skye has been up to... hopefully she has a solo album out.FCOL = \\"for crying out loud\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Day For Morcheeba","review":"I was sad when I heard that Skye Edwards was leaving but the pure vocal talent of the new lead singer more than makes up for it. What can't redeem this album is the song writing straight out of a junior high school band. It is truely sad that the vocals cannot carry the tired and cliched songwriting. This album (which I bought for $9.99 on iTunes) was a waste of money and has made me move on from Morcheeba with much regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Slick is back?","review":"These are not the Morcheeba, these are the Jefferson Airplane in one of their best moments.

While I'm sure this new saccharine approach will find them new customers, long time patrons like me will be looking for somewhere else to dine. The album is musically proficient, but lacks anything resembling the Morcheeba fans know and love. Oh well, all good things must come to pass. Good luck in your new venture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure.....","review":".....whether this CD s*cks or blows. I have all of this band's other CDs, which demonstrate a good spectrum of style, but this new CD just isn't what I like. I know the Godfrey brothers \\"are\\" the band, but without Skye's vocals, they are just another band, and not one that I particularly care for.AND.....their website says that now their new lead singer, Daisy, has been replaced by someone else. Better get it together guys, but in any event, I won't be buying any more Morcheeba CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Lame","review":"I bought this album in France for the airplane ride home. Let's just say that it didn't occupy me the whole time. This is unfortunate, because after hits like Big Calm, I was expecting a lot. I suppose it has been too long since I listened to Morcheeba; their sound has totally changed, and, unfortunately, not in a good way. The lead singer's voice is really wonderful, but the writing is poor overall. The only redeaming song on the album is \\"Everybody Loves a Loser\\" which at least has some oompf. The other songs are utterly forgetable. I am sad to say that I was unhappy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative and effective","review":"Griffith utilizes a distint core approach that focuses on all the planes (thus the \\"3D\\") giving a complete and total workout that is not only effective, but attainable.

The DVD does an excellent job of laying out the program design, you can perform ABS on consecutive days by choosing a plane of motion(rotational exercises on Monday, Frontal or side to side on Tuesday, and sagital on Wednesday) instead of targeting specefic muscle groups. By choosing a plane a day you will cover all of the muscles in the core region, create balance in your workout, and have less of a chance of overtraining.

So much so, that I don't want to spell it out for fear of scaring off potential viewers. I'll just say that it's a lot more nerve-racking than a movie that revolves around cows should be. The stylish camera work and believable acting help you reach the point you need to be at to dispend belief enough to let the plot unravel. However, the true genius comes in the slow build towards unease and sudden shocks that the average movie would ruin with a heavy orcestral score punctuating the parts where you're supposed to jump. This is clean and direct, which works wonders. Clever, yet simple, this would be a rare horror gem, if it didn't fall into the tired chase/hide/scream formula in the third act. Any true fans of horror should give this one a shot ,If u like \\"THE THING\\" or \\"ALIEN\\" style of movies! B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"Missed the mark.

Plus, they weren't really sure how to end this debaucle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The little farm of Horrors","review":"Theoretically another pointless horror flick with a very sloppy storyline failing to grasp my attention.A plot monotonously presented and rather too absurd to even consider the existence of killer cows.Also with the unpersuasive, weak and shiftless characters, who I felt nothing for in any of their circumstances, though I may give credit to Romanian actor Marcel Iures who has always impressed me in most of his previous films and alas is cast in a humdrum undemanding role of the evil scientist of doom!An unyielding caution to anyone who decides to view this desolate film, make sure you have a strong stomach in owning to the overdone effects and props of blood and entrails that can be seen practically in every single scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie was kind of lame. Cows give birth to human-craving spikey rings of disfigured calf. Then you have the characters: the kindly farm hand, the love interest vet, the evil scientist, and two runaway teens. None of the characters are delved into very deeply, and when they started dying I was like \\"meh.\\" I love horror movies but this one bored me to tears. Don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"KILLER KOWS","review":"I have to admit it, I have never seen a movie where mutant cows terrorize people...unless Billy O'Brian watched South Park. To be fair it really wasn't the killer calf per se, but the mutant offspring of the calf. I have also never seen a horror movie with mutant rabid butterflies either, that doesn't mean we need to rush out and make one. The acting was a very stiff. I don't see how anyone would rave over this, it just wasn't that good. The calf delivery scene dragged on forever, even in FF speed. Might be worth watching, but not if you have to pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better...","review":"One of the better sci-fi/horror films I have seen in a while.

His absolutely stunning vocals combined with truly solid instrumental backing have resulted in an audio treasure that has become one of my all time favorite CDs. In addition to crafting superb covers, John's own appreciable writing and composing abilities shine through on his subsequent offering \\"It's About Time\\". You'll want both of these jewels for your collection. Best wishes, John! - - - Pete Sferra"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great take on Beach Boys songs","review":"This wonderful collection of songs is reminiscent of the Beach Boys, but Phillips delivers them with his own sound. Satisfying takes on good songs, with wonderful harmonies. I like his voice best on the kind of rockin' bluesy things, and his \\"Wild Honey\\" to me is outstanding. I also love \\"Somewhere Near Japan.\\" There isn't a track on this CD that I skip over, I like them all. When a second CD is available, I will definitely buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all consistent","review":"By comparison to the Crossman premier or RWS pellets, these are not very consistent.

In fact, it pushed me over to get a high-speed Internet service through my local cable company.The modem is sensitive to line noise, or at least picky as to what modem it talks to at the other end. Tons of dropped connections for no apparent reason. I tried it at many houses including two I lived and at several friends.I send it in for repair with hope for a fix but it turned out to be a feature; It is worth mentioning that support was unprofessional with their responses.Let me add that it is V.Everything except for anything after V.90, so no V.92 or other improvements added to the Sportster models and others.After more than a decade of using and recommending USR modems, this last experience marked the end of my loyalty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Jazz Artist","review":"I really love this record.

He will sing the songs, which are the letters and the letter sounds. This brings joy to my heart because my son is autistic and he didn't start talking until after he was 3 years old. So now he's learning letters and their sounds, its a beginning to him saying more words, which is exactly what he's doing. My 2 year old daughter loves it too.

My three year old will spot letters and quote the movie. She's learned a great deal and is thus moving on to the Word Factory.That being said, for a generation of kids used to Shrek and similar animation, Leap Frog needs to move towards more advanced graphics to keep their audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"The songs on the DVD are very catchy, and my daughter loved it.

They got my 3 year old so interested in words that he made me teach him every day until he learned to read at 3!! I have now tried to start playing them for my 23 month old daughter, and my son gets mad. He loves these videos so much that he thinks they are only his. He loves to share almost anything else except for these videos because he is so attached to them. I'm not one much for allowing him to watch shows that don't teach him anything. Occasionally watching something with no educational value is ok, but it is not something we're going to do all the time. However, I do try to find videos for him to watch that are fun and hold his attention to where he doesn't even realize it is educational. These videos and the Rock 'n Learn videos do that. I was just more impressed with the graphics on the leap frog videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids wont stop sounding out words!!!","review":"I have two preschoolers and this was the first leap frog video I purchased for them.

Kids learn quickly and in a fun way!","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas with money he received and I am definitely NOT sorry! He is ADDICTED to this and the Words Factory DVD's and has learned SO much from them in only a few weeks! Within a few days he knew ALL of the letters, and most of their sounds (and didn't know ANY of them before watching this). My son is also speech delayed (minimally) and these videos have helped him a TON in sounding words out and being more intelligible. I cannot recommend this videos enough, they are worth every penny and more. The songs are catchy, he loves singing to them, and i must admit that I don't mind watching them either LoL. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars +++ Will get all in this series","review":"I couldn't believe how quickly my almost 3 year old daughter learned the alphabet, their sounds, how to wite them and how to recognize every letter where ever she sees them. I had bought this for my four year old son, but he \\"can't like it\\" now that his sister already did something before him. This is one to get and start your child on at a young age. I am ordering another copy for my 18 month old nephew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noticed an improvement immediately!","review":"I bought this for my almost-3 year old son recently on the recommendation of a friend. My son immediately took to this video, which he fondly calls \\"The frogs\\". It's about 30 minutes so not too long. Within a couple of days, I could ask him \\"What sound does a P make?\\" and he'll say \\"Puh\\". \\"What does the F say?\\" and he'll reply \\"ffff\\" with his arms flapping. Something about the presentation/repetition of the sounds really makes it stick in that 2 year old brain! I'd say 2 1/2 is probably the earlist a child would be ready or interested in it. My 1 1/2 year old wanders off when it's playing - not quite ready.I'd highly recommend this to any child aged 2 1/2+. I can't vouch for long how they stay interested since we're still watching it regularly. It will go on my Christmas gift-giving list for any children around this age, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute!","review":"So far I have yet to find a leap frog product I don't like.

Exciting and engaging. Definitely holds the interest of kids. My 3 1/2 yr old LOVES it, usually asking several times a day to watch it. Before this dvd he could only recognize a few letters by name and did not know ANY of the sounds. Within 3 days of watching the dvd he began to talk about letter sounds throughout the day, and a week later could give the sounds of most all the letters. My 5 yr old has greatly benefited from it as well. We plan to purchase other Leapfrog dvd's! Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT AND EDUCATIONAL DVD - A MUST FOR A TODDLER","review":"I bought this dvd for my girl who was turning to be 3 years old in 3 months time. Within a week, she knew all 26 letters and its sounds. This is amazing, considering she could memorize each letter and its sound and also the order of the story, she can follow exactly all the conversation about each letter, and what Prof said. She even can memorize the colour of each letter and can relate simple words with the letter. This is really unbelievable, this dvd is very entertaining and at the same time is educational. She can ask to watch the dvd one day a couple of times, which I have to restraint her from watching too much.I definitely will recommend this DVD to all children who is going to learn about reading. Thank you for this wonderful DVD, which saves my time to teach my children as I am working mother.One question, does L really sound like \\"All\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap Frog is The Best!!!!","review":"This video and all the Leap Frog videos are outstanding.

Our 20 month old son loves learning his alphabet with this DVD, and will watch it as many times as we allow.Leap Frog has really knocked one out of the park with this creation -- animation has a bright, warm look.

This entertaining DVD teaches kids their letters and phonics in true stealth mode - the kids don't even know they're learning.The only caution is not be in the same room when your kid watches this - once these catchy educational songs get into your mind, there's no getting them out. Trust me, no one in the office is going to take you seriously once they hear you singing \\"every letter has a sound and B says 'buh'\\" to yourself at your desk.

After a few weeks where he asked to watch it at least once every day, he can identify almost all letters and the sounds they mention. He also excitedly points out when he sees letters on signs or in books; he isn't always 100% correct, but he is excited about them. He also doesn't realize it is an educational video; he loves pointing out funny things that happen in the video/dvd. I am making a point of giving this dvd as gifts to other 2 year on my list this year, and hope to introduce my son to the next installment as a christmas present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Children's Video Investment","review":"I taught Kindergarten for 6 years before my sons were born. I got out all my old games and tools to teach my 1st son his letters. When my second child came along, I was sadly too busy to invest the same amount of time. When my son received this video for his 3rd birthday, I popped it in the car DVD player at his request. Why not learn while I run errands.....he knew ALL the letters and their sounds within 2 weeks of errand running. WOW!! I have spent an entire year working on that with other children. I must admit I haven't seen much of the video as it plays behind my head. I do know all the songs, and they are very cute and catchy. The only negative I have found is that I do not believe it covers lower case letters. Like I said, I haven't seen the whole video, so I could be wrong. However, my son only knows the upper case ones so far. Now, I'd like to see a lower case letter factory!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Phonics tool","review":"This is an excellent phonics tool.

She watched it twice and begged for more. We couldn't believe how enthralled she was with the music and cute storyline. Later that day she was playing with her magnetic letters and began to correctly identify some of the sounds. We later bought the DVD, and we used the letter song to help her learn the sounds of all her letters. We have really enjoyed this Leapfrog DVD and many of the other Leapfrog products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to teaching phonemic awareness","review":"I bought this DVD to supplement and add variety to the way my kids exposed to learning letters and sounds. I have an 18 month old and a 2 1/2 year old. My 2 year old realy likes it. I skip the introduction period and forward to the scene where they start with the letter A. The beginning to way to loon for my son, that is why I skip it. I would give it 5 stars, except some of the rponunciation of letters is incorrect. Especially for the letter L (where did they get the UULL sound?). There are a few more letter, like O, M, N, R, but they are not as profound as L.Other than that, great DVD. I am also getting my son Fridge phonics set, so he can play with lettes and still hear the familiar song."},{"rating":"2","title":"leap frog letters-great","review":"I have a two yr old and 4 yr old, they didn't move from their spot, called out the answers.

I like the introduction of each letter, and the repetition of the little song for each letter is good for young ones (it's the same thing that's on a lot of the Leap Frog toys). But I always skip over the introduction. It's really drawn out, and kind of over-the-top with it's pro-capitalism. Why do they have to have this factory where some big rich duck is going to come see a presentation to decide whether or not to buy these letters? And why do they have to say things that I think are borderline racist like: \\"our letters are the best letters in the world!\\". I guess once my son gets older I'll have to explain to him the capitalist/xenophobic ramifications of this video he loves so dearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect sounds","review":"It was distressing to hear the video tell the viewer things like \\"L says 'UL'\\".

I thought it was more of an educational DVD that reviewed letter sounds. The letter sounds are introduced, but in the context of the plot of a cartoon show. Most cartoons annoy me, and this is one of them. There's a lot of extra stuff that I don't necessarily want my almost-two-year-old saying, \\"Okie-Dokie-Artichokey\\" being one of them. And it's annoying to sit through all of the beginning and end plot of the show surrounding the alphabet sounds. I'd recommend watching someone else's copy before buying one for yourself.We also bought the Leap Frog alphabet fridge magnet set that uses the same catchy song...highly recommend that over this video to teach the sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letter Factory (Used)","review":"The used Letter Factory was a great choice.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful product from Leap Frog!","review":"This is my sons new favorite DVD. He just turned 2 1/2 and just started saying real words a few weeks ago. Since this DVD, his letter sounds are said more clearly. He asks for this DVD all the time and as soon as he sees the ending credits come up he says, \\"More fogs peeze\\". He watches it daily and never just once. I actually find myself singing the song in the shower or on the bus! A well done product for teaching letter sounds. Very clever, fun and educational. As the mom of a late talker, I highly recommend buying this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and educational","review":"My daughter loves watching this show.

My only complaint is that it is pretty long for two and four year olds to hang in for til the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartest kid ever","review":"I can't believe how much my 18 mth old has picked up from this DVD. She absolutely loves it and wants to watch it all the time. She can now see a letter and make the sound on her own! It has also helped her to use more words. Would recommend to anyone with a young child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and fun","review":"I thought my 3 year old son had the shortest attention span because he was not interested in learning the sounds of the alphabet letters when I tried to teach him. Then I bought this DVD for him after a friend told me about it. Within 2 weeks, he learned all the sounds and would sing the letters and sounds on car rides. He wanted to watch this video twice a day. I'm going to get the Talking Words Factory next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good DVD for my son","review":"My son is 1 year. He can say some words now.He really likes to watch this DVD.Animation is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational letter-learning guide","review":"My son was having a difficult time learning his letters. More specifically, he didn't have the desire. Two different people recommended this DVD to us, and it has been amazing! There is a room for each letter, with that letter making its sound, and a catchy tune for each letter. For example, in the \\"E\\" room there is an old Letter \\"E\\" in a rocking chair, and every time the young frog says something to him, he says, \\"eh?\\" (the \\"e\\" sound). The song for each letter is to the tune of \\"The Farmer in the Dell,\\" and says, \\"The (letter) says (sound), the (letter) says (sound), Every letter makes a sound, the (letter) says (sound).\\" I knew it was a success when an older child said a letter, and my son broke into song! :-) I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another way to learn","review":"I am using this DVD in my Kindergarten class and the children love it.

I thought he'd watch it once, lose interest during, and not want to watch it again. I was completely wrong. He asks to watch the \\"froggy\\" video over and over and over. He sings \\"every letter makes a sound\\" when the video isn't on. This is a great educational video that really holds their interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for my preschooler","review":"My 3 year old will sit and watch this movie. I am not going to say it is his favorite, he would honestly rather be watching the 1966 batman, don't ask me why, but thankfully he will sit though this too. After he watched this movie a few times he was saying the letter sound when the letter came up.One of the annoying things is the kids pick up the letter sounds exactly how they say them and when the W comes up it says the sound about 3 times in a row, now my kids will say the W sound multiple times because they think that is how it pronounced."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video taught my 6 year old to read!!","review":"We had been working with our 6 year old son on phonics for 2 years (since he was 4 years old) and he was still struggling with his sounds. He started kindergarten this year and we knew it was an important year for him to start reading.I bought this video on a recommendation from a friend, but never expected it to be as successful as it was. By the third time my son saw this video he had learned ALL his phonetic sounds!Three weeks later he started reading!!! I wish we would have bought this video sooner!!Now to work on our 2 y.o. daughter :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I was given this DVD by a friend when I said I was going to teach letters to my 2 yr old. After one week he was in the bath tub and I started picking up foam letters. To our surprise he knew almost ALL of them AND the sounds they make! Now, a few weeks later, he has them all down. On to counting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic DVD","review":"I typically do not comment on purchases but the Leapfrog Letter Factory is a great dvd. I bought it for my toddler to begin to recognize and know the sounds of the letters and it truly exceeded expectations. He could recognize capital and lower case letters and knew each letter's sound. The music was catchy and even entertaining for my husband and I. When our youngest started watching and picking up on the letters and sounds we knew this was a good purchase. I particularly like how each letter is introduced, then they make their sound, and it's reinforced in song. I've recommended it to other friends with great success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tool every young child should have!","review":"At first the graphics look a little hokey but what a great concept. My 2 yr. old and 5 yr old both within watching it 2 times \\"got it.\\" They each recognize all their letter and sounds and can recite and answer any identification question you ask them about their letters. I also like the fact that the videos are consistant with all the other Leap products! Great product, BUY it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYONE MUST BUY THIS!","review":"I bought this DVD on a Thursday morning and by Friday afternoon both of my boys (just turned 3 and 4) knew EVERY letter and EVERY letter sound from A-Z! I have never been so amazed by a video. I can teach my 4 year old to read. Both of the boys go around the house all day singing the letter sounds. I am not kidding when I say they know EVERY letter and sound from A-Z. I suggest everyone buy this video. I'm just hoping they come out with letter flash cards to match the letters in the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used this for years in my classroom","review":"I used this DVD in my Pre-Kindergarten class for years. I discovered it one summer during summer school when another teacher was using it. I am not a video teacher so I thought \\"no way\\". But I noticed her test scores for letter and sound recognitions where through the roof! Well the next summer I bought it and wanted to see what it could do for my students, since they are only there for 18 days, I needed all the help I could get! Well, it WORKED!!! I had students who had been in Pre-K an entire year and knew no letters, leave my class knowing 17 letters and 20 sounds. It was a joint effort between class work and the DVD, but I know a lot of it was the DVD. It gave me the time to work with small groups while the other students watched the video. It was like having another teacher. I have since bought it for my 2 year old son and he knows almost all of the letters and their sounds. Now if I could just get him to potty train! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational movie!!","review":"Highly recommended! My 2 year old loves this movie!! It teaches them how to pronounce letters in a very fun way!! :) It was recommeded to us by a children's speech therapist.

Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old, and within 3 viewings he absolutely know all his letter sounds. He hadn't really been interested before in learning them, but this DVD really did it for him. He loves it! Bonus: the 18 month old, who only catches a little of the DVD once in a while (he doesn't get very much TV), knows some of his letter sounds too! Really cute DVD for a good price. You won't be sorry you bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves it","review":"my son knew about half of his letters before watching this video, now he knows almost all of them and and ones he can not say he can say the sound, i can hardly wait to try other leap frog dvd"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"Absolutely Wonderful!!!!

Thank you Leap Frog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a hit in our house","review":"My 2-year-old twins will watch this, but they never ask for it and seem bored by it. I would recommend Richard Scarry's Best Ever ABC video over this one (we have that one and they love it, sing along with it and ask to watch it over and over)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'm a teacher , and i used this DVD for my students , they loved it and they gazed on the screen during the show time.. and they asked me to repeat it again and againperfect in teaching phonics and vocabulary , i love to watch it too ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"My son was 2 when we bought this and he liked the music that went along with the DVD. I don't think he got the message it was also teaching him letters. But then one day he asked to watch the DVD letter movie and I knew it was clicking. He totally enjoys watching and now at 3 he knows almost all of his letters and sings the song too! Totally worth the buy, you can sneak some good learning in a DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Entertaining and very educational. Our son learned most of the letters and sounds within a week of receiving this video. He loves watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool to help your child learn their letter sounds","review":"A friend of mine recommended this DVD when I mentioned my 4 yo was having difficulty learning the different letter sounds. This is a short cartoon that holds your child's interest. I loved the technique of showing them the letters and incorporating a catchy tune which for each which helps them remember what sound each letter makes (example R is a racecar making rrr sounds when it goes fast). One of my sons favorite parts is the last one in which he gets to play a letter game - they give him the sound the letter makes and he uses the remote to highlight that letter. Great reinforcement and you can skip the other part of the video and go directly to this section if you want. I would HIGHLY recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE","review":"Leapfrog Letter Factory had my three year old twins knowing the sounds every letter of the alphabet makes after only two viewings! It's great! It's a fun video on top of being educational -I totally recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for 2 year olds","review":"letter factory was recommended to me by a friend and my 2.5 year old daughter loves it! with all of the shows on disney and nickelodeon, they don't teach phonics or word association. my daughter was drawn to a different style of learning, and letter factory gave her just what she was looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have To Admit It Is Wonderful","review":"I find the Leapfrog characters HIGHLY ANNOYING. I also don't tend to buy things marketed toward early learning. We received this DVD as a gift; I never would have bought it myself.And--it is great. I have 2-year-old twins, and within a few days both of them were saying things like, \\"A--ah! B--beh! C--kuh! D--duh!\\" It was freaky and gratifying. I still find the DVD annoying, but I can put up with a LOT of annoying for results like this.I recommend also buying the Fridge Phonics set, which uses the same catchy little song from the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must-Buy","review":"I bought this for my son at 13 months. He is now 15 months old and knows every letter's sound on command, not to mention non-sequentially. He has a little bit of trouble with the W for some reason, but he can do all the others (even the X--\\"ksss\\"). Everybody is amazed. I have no idea if this is normal for his age, but I know his playmates can't do it!!! I also purchased the word factory, although I won't be taking that out until he can actually recite the alphabet."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for toddlers too!","review":"My baby was 1 and a half when she started watching this video. She's 21 months now and still loves it. She also knows her entire alphabet along with the proper sound for each letter because of this video. I buy this for friends' kids too. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"MomSoup Review: Easiest way to teach your child the letter sounds!","review":"Not all tv is bad and if you need a half hour babysitter, make it quality and educational. This DVD is GREAT. It teaches all the letter sounds with a catchy song. Children like it and learn their letter sounds from it. The only drawback is that it doesn't teach both the long and short vowel sounds, only the short. The only other rival is Challenger School's tape which you can only purchase via Challenger Schools. Its sister DVD, Word Factory is also good but if you choose one, go with the talking letter factory. Once your kids have the letter sounds, skies the limit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"After watching this just a few times, my 2-year-old daughter went from recognizing most of the alphabet to flawlessly knowing her letters and their sounds. She loves to watch and gladly watches the entire show without losing interest. The results are simply amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Winner Your Child Will Watch","review":"I've never been this exciting about a children's video. This one is truely a gem. The video teaches your child the letter sounds in a fun, captivating way. The video really isolates the letter sounds so your child learns the sound and not just a word associated with the sound. Not only that, but your child will learn to say the letter sounds with CONFIDENCE. It is truly amazing and the learning is SO easy. Leapfrog definitely has a winnner here! On a personal note, since watching the video (more than once of course), my 4 1/2 year daughter learned all her letter sounds and coupled with the Talking Words Factory is now sounding out words. Hope Leapfrog comes out with more videos (i.e. long vowels, blends etc) - I'll be the first in line to buy them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this item","review":"I ordered from Japan.

Good story, fun and kept our daughter engaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Taught my first child her letter sounds within a month. Just got my second started on it, and he loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible graphics","review":"I purchased this DVD in a bargain bin, I can see why it was there. The visual graphics are horrible, like 1980's cartoon quality. My kids make it through the first 5 minutes and are begging to shut it off. They enjoy the leapfrog toys, but if you are going to show your kids a DVD to teach them letters or sounds I think preschool prep is better (graphics suck but it gets to the point and the information sticks!) and the your baby can read series. Both of my kids watched these along with the Blues Clues shape detectives, at 2 years they could identify all letters, shapes, colors and numbers. At 3 my son could read anything and everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video!!!","review":"Wow, great video. I wish I would have given it to my daughter earlier. I waited until her 2nd birthday(she is 26months old now) and she now knows all of her sounds and can identify all her letters, she has known her alphabet for about 4 months before her 2nd birthday. She is happy to watch the video and enjoys the fridge phonics that goes along with it. We sing the song when driving in the car. I am so happy with this video. I am looking forward to purchasing the other Leap Pad videos"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kids video!!!!!","review":"My mother bought this video for my son when he was 1 1/2. He is now 2 1/2 and LOVES it. He knows all his letter and the sounds they make. He is able to recognize them when we are out and about. The teaches at daycare can't believe how smart he is. There are kids there that are 4 and 5 that are having trouble with their letters. He is always asking to watch \\"Froggy\\".He also has the Talking Word Factory. I would highly recommend this video also. Once your child has begun to master his/her letters, this brings them into the world of making words and sounding them out using the techniques learned in the Letter Factory. I would highly recommend these videos to anyone who wants to give their child a jumpstart at loving to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this now","review":"Awesome DVD for the preschoolers. This is the only \\"educational\\" video that my child actually asks to watch. She can sing the whole thing without the sound on. The Letter Factory DVDs have taught her more about letters and complex words than her entire year at preschool. I only wish they would make MORE of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2-yr-old knows ALL of his sounds!!!","review":"I recommend this video to every parent with a child that doesn't know their letter sounds. My son began watching this video daily at around 2 years, 3 months old, three months later he could identify all of his letters and sounds. More importantly, it's not as if he's being forced to learn, but instead enjoying his favorite cartoon. Letters are brought to life with memorable, and funny examples. My son often imitates the examples when he sees particular letters, like \\"Toe-Tapping-T\\". This has to be the best video on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"Even though our 5 yr old knew his ABC's & had practiced writing letters some before starting Kinder, it has been rough. He struggles with letter recognition & has some speech articulation problems that only intensify the issue. The Letter Factory is engaging enough to retain his interest after multiple viewings & catchy enough that we're able to describe the letter 'characters' when he struggles to identify letters. It helps him often make the appropriate connection & accurately name the letter. Beyond that, our 2 year old enjoys the DVD too. He has started expanding his letter vocabulary & enjoys saying the letter sounds. I REALLY wish we would have stumbled across this DVD sooner! I'm a TOTAL fan of Leapfrog!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD","review":"My son, who just turned two, has been watching this DVD for about a month. He knows 75% of the letters. He can identify the letters and say the letter and/or make the sound. We also have the Leapfrog Fridge Phonics Letter Set which has played a large part in his learning. My son only said about 20 words up until a month or so ago, so we are astonished at how quickly he has learned the letters and he now says over 50 words. This is one of the best DVDs we have. I also got the Word Factory and I know we will love that when the time comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning As It Should Be!","review":"If you are looking for a FUN way to reinforce letters and their sounds to your preschooler this is the DVD to buy! Leap and his friends make this process fun as learning should be for this age group. Before long you will find yourself singing the \\"Every letter makes a sound\\" chorus much to the delight of your preschooler. I highly reccomend this dvd for those children that might need a gentle nudge in letter recognition as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son Loved this!","review":"I got this for my son when he was 3, and in no time he knew all his phonics! He is 4 1/2 now and I still catch him watching this movie. He reads paragraphs now and I still hear him sound out his phonics or blending sounds (Leap Frog Word Factory) when he gets stuck. I will definitely keep it around for my little girl to have as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome Leap video!!!","review":"After my daughter fell in love with the Talking Words Factory movie, we went out and bought this one for her too. It's simply amazing how quickly she's learned all the sounds of the letters!! (3 viewings and she knows all the phonics sounds)When we go out somewhere, she's pointing out the letters on signs... she's pointing out letters on TV commercials... and she is starting to spell the words out in her books.I hope Leap Frog continues to produce these videos ~ they're the best educational aid that we've found yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific","review":"My 4 year watches the DVD a dozen times and memorizes all the sounds in the DVD.

It is something he has enjoyed watching many times. I love this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3-year-old son loves it!!","review":"I bought my 3 year-old son this DVD to re-introduce (he knew all capital letters) alphabet one more time for this summer. The contents were well organized and using imagery as well as sound in the background to emphasize the sounds of letters. There is a room for each letter to introduce its phonetic sound, using literal images such as flying for F, vibratiing room for V, buzzing bee fo B, etc. Each letter is then sung in a melody which is very familiar for anyone. After watching 2 times, he started singing along. I am very pleased with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this video","review":"I purchased this DVD after receiving a recommendation for it and reading all of the positive reviews. My son just turned 2, and he loves this video. After watching it for only a couple of weeks he already knows almost all of the letters and many of their sounds. I also got a couple other alphabet videos to reinforce the same concept in different ways, but this one is by far the best. The story is very clever and my son watches the entire story intently. We also have the Fridge Phonics magnet set by Leap Frog, which sings the same tune as on the video, and I love having that toy along with this video. I will definitely be purchasing more of these DVDs for gifts for kids from 1 1/2 to 3 (although I am sure it could be enjoyed by kids who are even in Kindergarten already)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool!","review":"This is a wonderful learning tool for children!

Nothing worked, until The Letter Factory came. He loved watching this DVD and would actually request it. He learned all his letters and their sounds within the week! It was a miracle! My husband who was concerned about him was shocked! He still likes to watch it because he thinks it's funny. And I must admit I laughed several times myself when I watched it with him. It's cute. I definitely would recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old learned the alphabet!!","review":"This video is great. I bought it so my son could watch it in the car while we drove around town. It is funny, cute, and educational. One day my 2 year old was pointing to letters on my shirt and telling me the names AND sounds!! I was amazed. I thought he was too young to learn this but I figured if he had to watch TV in the car it might as well be educational! I bought all of the leap frog videos. He even enjoys watching the ones for older kids but I figure maybe he will learn those eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MUST HAVE DVD for alphabet learning","review":"It's Schoolhouse Rock for your toddler. My son received this as a gift for Christmas @ 18 months. In less than a month, he knew his ENTIRE alphabet, phonics and letter reconition included.

The songs are fun and the movie is so entertaining it will have you chuckling as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"My 2 1/2 year old loves it and knows all his letters and their sounds. The songs are great and we sing them again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!!","review":"My son had no interest in learning his letters and sounds. Now that he is in kindegarten I knew I needed to really encourage him and work hard on getting him up to speed. This video was like magic. I popped it in the car DVD player and he is watching it nonstop and then talking about letters and sounds all day long. Within 1 weeks time he is all caught up and it could not have been easier for us. Before we purchased this video we spent many hours trying to work on his letters and sounds and always ended up frustrated or in tears.WARNING: you WILL find yourself singing the catchy tunes. Even my 9 and 11 year olds are humming the songs.Time to purchase the numbers factory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What took me so long?","review":"I had been thinking of purchasing this DVD, but was hesitant to add yet another movie to our \\"collection.\\" My sister and a couple of friends said their kids learned their alphabet in a matter of DAYS.

He loves the movie and asks to watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome tool","review":"Love this video! My preschooler has gotten so much out of it!

The whole series is one that should be on every child's movie shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phonics Video","review":"My sons (2 & 3 years old) love this video. They have watched it several times and never seem to get bored with it. My older son can now pronounce almost all the letters in the alphabet. The video focuses more on just recognizing and naming letters, but the phonics behind letter sounds as well. I think it will be much easier helping them learn to read now that they know what sound the individual letters make.My only criticism is that I think the letter L is pronounced funny in the video. Doesn't quite work as well with phonics reading as the other letters do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for multi-sensory learners","review":"This video has been even better than I expected. It was recommended to me by a friend who works with special needs kids. My kids LOVE to watch it. There is also a game that they enjoy. They aren't able to play the game without my help since you have to use the remote (we play ours on the TV but, you can play it on the computer as well). I have been telling all of my friends about this series. It is worth every penny and I would pay twice the price for the results we have gotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big hit with a 3.7 old boy","review":"My son who is 3.7 years old likes this movie. His favorites are the letters \\"P\\" and \\"W\\".We are in Brazil and he is in a bilingual school learning English; so this is a great video to introduce him to a more natural and Montessorian way of learning how to read. Using the sound of the letter rather than using the name of the letter.I follow up the video playing a game of chosing words that start with a few letters of the movie, I let him chose the letters.He really likes it.I will now make at home some sandletters so that I can get him really used to the letters.we have also another video from the serie and he likes it as well. Thumbs up for Leapfrog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Letter Factory Video Review","review":"It's been a while since I purchased this video for my then 4-year-old. It was recommended by his Kindergarten teacher during their orientation about a month before classes started. I order it because I could not find it at stores. My son loved it from the first time he watched it. He knew some of the letter sounds, but the video helped him learn all of them well before school started. Best of all, he didn't feel like he was doing a chore or \\"homework,\\" which he actually doesn't like, but instead he was enjoying a video and learning as a result. All the Kindergarten teachers at his school spoke well of this video, and they were quick to asure us they are not receiving any benefit from the endorsement of it; maybe they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letter Factory","review":"Leap Frog is an excellent tool for your young toddler. I started my 1yr. old off with it for entertainment in the car. He found it so entertaining, everything sunk in. Now, he is in kindergarten reading at a nearly 2nd grade level.

He knew how each letter \\"sounded\\" by 2yrs. old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped my 3 year old learn his letters","review":"Before I ordered this product, I was having lots of problems getting my 3 year old to learn his letters.

I would buy this for any child to help them learn their letters and sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Tad","review":"My 3 year old daughter learned her ABC's and more importantly the SOUNDS of the ABC in a couple of days of watching this DVD. She was hooked on it and asked for it by name daily. \\"Mommy I want the Letter Factory\\" became the phrase of the month in June of 09. She can now sound the beginning parts of words when she sees them written in her books. She is so proud of herself and gets so excited when she can show me her new words.

She lovesthis video and is glued to it, which thrills me because she's learningas she watches. We got this for a birthday gift for another toddler andher mother told me she is glued to the tv, too. I have no doubt she'll haveher abc's learned in no time, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jumping off point","review":"My 3.5 year old had learned to recognize both upper and lower case letters, and I was looking for a way for him to learn letter sounds, (that wasn't boring old Mama teaching him). I checked this out from the library as I was unsure if he would like LeapFrog. Three viewings and he had it down. 6 months later we are on Lesson 6 inThe Reading Lesson: Teach Your Child to Read in 20 Easy Lessonsand he is reading theBob Books, Set 1: Beginning Readers.I am sure results vary, but the catchy tune was just what my son needed to jump start his reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun animated and educational","review":"We enjoy this video, the songs are a fun way to teach kids the sounds of the alphabet. My son is almost two, and he likes to watch it. He tries to mimic some of the sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is great!!","review":"I bought this DVD for my three, almost four-year-old, son. He has had trouble pronouncing many letters, commonly saying the 'd' sound for 'g', 'p', etc. He had been in speech therapy and it was helping a little, but he wasn't making that great of progress. Until he started watching this DVD, that is! Within watching it just two or three times, there was a noticeable improvement with his speech. After three weeks of having it, with him watching it maybe five times a week, he can say every letter clearly and correctly. This DVD has made a world of difference! Plus, he is able to recognize all the letters and is well on his way to having the alphabet memorized. Thanks Leapfrog!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Son really likes it!","review":"I got this dvd for my son because my niece has learned to read since watching it. Her mother attributes her learning to read largely from this dvd. She is 5, & my son is four. My son really likes it. He is already doing very well on the sounds of the letters from watching the dvd. I highly recommend it for preschool-aged children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention","review":"The video was the right length to keep my sons attention. Because toddlers get bored quickly. He really enjoyed playing the games after he had watched it, which is a plus, because that is what will get him to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what a brilliant DVD!!","review":"I bought this DVD for my just turned 2 year old daughter and our 18 hour drive to Florida. She was instantly glued to it and wanted to watch it over and over again. All you heard was \\"letters, letters!\\" By the time we got home she knew all of her letter sounds. This DVD, like all Leap Frog products, is wonderfully written to keep a childs attention and makes them want to learn. I look forward to my next Leap Frog DVD purchase!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Preschoolers!","review":"A fun way to teach your preschooler about the letters and their sounds.... My 2 year old grand daughter can't stop watching it... And she knows many of the letters and their sounds. I am VERY impressed with this product and will be investigating more of the leap frog products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational and entertaining DVD","review":"My son (2 years old) enjoys this DVD - he sings along, makes the sounds of all the letters, and is still captivated by the story despite watching multiple times. Would recommend Letter Factory for little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea! But could be improved on!","review":"I got this a gift. I was told that it helped my cousins kids with learning their letters. I finally watched it after having it for a year. I liked the concept but was disappointed.1. Teaching of morals.....older brother lies and there's no consequence or talking about that.2. The video only talks about one sound that each letter makes....but some of the letters make more than one sound. So disappointed because we have the leapfrog magnetic letters and they sing the same song but they incorporate the different sounds the letter can make."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK video but contains some phonics mistakes","review":"This is a good video...NOT great as people seem to think. There are some grave mistakes, for example, the 'O' and the 'U' both seem to say 'Ah', the 'L' says 'Ul' and the 'R' says 'Er'.Im distressed that my 2-year old sems to be learning the letter sounds incorrectly. Even when I try to correct the video, she seems to go with the sounds made on the video. Im kind of turned off by the Leap Frog company. How could they have let this kind of stuff fall through the cracks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Okey dokey artichokey\\" - REALLY??","review":"If you let your kid watch this be warned: the main character says \\"okey dokey artichokey\\" and other annoying things throughout this video. I couldn't stand it. It might be an otherwise great DVD but okey dokey artichokey was a dealbreaker for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product. Get toddler attention immediately","review":"This product is wonderful. Before we got this DVD, we had a hard time to get the attention of our 2 years old to sit through learning from A to Z from a book or other DVD. But with this one, she was able to follow the sounds and alphabet and she is now almost done with 26 characters with just 4 days. Amazing! I would recommend this DVD to anyone who would like to get their toddlers' attention for ABC. This DVD is not lengthyg and lots of motions and sounds so it is not boring at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The letter factory is amazing!

Her b-day is the end of February, so she hasn't received it yet. She enjoys her books, so I think she will really like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dvd","review":"This dvd is fantastic in teaching the sounds of the letters in a way that children remember. As a middle school special needs language arts teacher, I was looking for something that would help kids learn phonics in a fun way. I plan to use it next year with my students who are generally reading on about a 2nd or 3rd grade level. I have also used it with my own children who now know all the letters and sounds. One of my children is 4 and the other one is 2. They love it and I love that they are more prepared to read when the time comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My almost 3 year old loves this and other Leap Frog (Talking Words and Math Circus) videos","review":"This is a wonderful phonics video. My son loves to watch this video and has associated so many beginning sounds of words with the alphabets. I tried the conventional way and he didnt have the patience to let me finish (very frustrating). This video is fun to watch, he has to repeat what he hears and he has learnt it all (Phonics) from this. The video is no too long (a half hour) which is great since he only get 2 half hour sessions in a day to watch television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for learning letters and their sounds","review":"We originally bought this as a Christmas present. At first my daughter showed no interest in it. Now, at just under 3 1/2 years old, she asks to watch it at least once a day. She became very interested in the DVD once her long term memory improved and she was able to remember what different letters looked like. It has accelerated her letter recognition and really helped her recognize some letters that look and sound the same (B,P,D,etc...). Now when she recognizes a letter she say its name and sings the song with the correct pronunciation from the DVD. All this with about two weeks of exposure to the DVD.As a parent I really like how this DVD, My First LeapPad: Alphabet book and the Letter Factory Game all reinforce the same idea. She gets the repetition in different formates. I highly recommend these products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"My 3 yr old daughter learned all the alphabet sounds after just a few times of watching this video. Good supplement for any phonics program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning Tool!","review":"This DVD makes learning the alphabet fun for young children. After 1 week of viewing this DVD, my 2 year old recognized every letter and knew the sounds each letter made. She also began reading 4 months later. (Three letter words.) She is now 4 years old and can read 3rd grade level!Buy this product and enjoy watching your children learn.Vlady"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"You don't need another review since there are 1,083 already, so I'll make this one short. The Letter Factory works for my child, too. It's very intelligently made with catchy little songs and mnemonic devices that carry over to the Talking Words Factory and the Code Word Caper to help children remember the sounds of the letters. My husband even laughs at the jokes and enjoys watching it with our son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional teaching tool","review":"EXCEPTIONAL product. Fun and absolutely effective. Inexpensive and simple way to teach. Simultaneously engages all learning styles: Audio, visual, and kinesthetic. After a few weeks of enjoying this video, my 28-month-old identifies each letter of the alphabet and tells me the sound each letter makes! The results have AMAZED me. We are ready to move on to sight words."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"Cupitt is one of these Christians who don't believe in God... hmm... while he writes very well and explains his position at length and with great literary talent, in terms of actual logical philosophy, next to Kant, Nietzsche, Sartre, Aristotle or even fellow postmodernist types like Derrida or Foucalt, Cupitt's mistakes are all too obvious - and there's one on almost every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can be said","review":"It is hard to write a review for something so simple, but I will state what I like about it. It protects my screen from the keys touching. It keeps the screen clean and it fits nice and neatly when closed in my MacBook Pro. I also like that when I have it open and I am using my bluetooth keyboard, it is protecting the keys and keeping dust out of the keyboard area.I guess I did alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Gimmick plain and simple.Hard to use and looks rubbish. Bad gut feeling when ordering and rightly so.Just buy some screen cleaner and a decent cloth and clean manually every month. I edit photos every day and no dirt has ever interfered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black looks sexy","review":"I have had cloths from shaggymac all these years and wanted to try out the RadTech. I also always preferred the gray cloths for some reason. But with the new black bezels on all of apple's displays I decided to get a black cloth this time. It's hard to drool over a cleaning cloth really. So all I would say is the Radtech is much thicker and stiffer than the shaggyMac cloths but the fit is slightly more perfect that the shaggyMac ones I have used. The stiffness would probably help in the long run to minimize imprints from the keyboard on to the lcd glass. But I am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent product","review":"This item seems to be a solid product. I have been using it for just 15 days, but no marks or scratchs at all have appear on my MacBook display. Still looks like new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie , great body","review":"Well, the 1980's had its share of bad films, and this one is no exception. The plot is as simplistic as it gets; a nerd wants to have the perfect body so he can be happy, only to discover there is a price to pay. ( Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it, true happiness comes from within, take your pick!) The acting is terrible, but let's be honest girls we are not gonna watch a movie called \\"Hunk\\" for the acting or the dialogue. We want to look at a hot body and John Allen Nelson definitely has that. Unfortunately, the scenes with Hunk showing off his gorgeous muscular bod are few & far between. Hunk is harmless fun, but if you want to drool over a beautiful body, you'll have alot of fast forwarding to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great body, bad movie","review":"Well, the 1980's had its share of bad films, and this one is no exception. The plot is as simplistic as it gets- a nerd wants the perfect body so he can be happy, only to discover there is a price to pay. (you know, be careful what you wish for because you might just get it: true happiness comes from within, hey! Take your pick.) The acting is not good, but come on girls we are not gonna watch a movie called \\"Hunk\\" for the story or dialogue. We want to look at a hot body, and John Allen Nelson definitely has that. Unfortunately, the scenes with Hunk showing off his gorgeous body are few & far between. \\"Hunk\\" is harmless fun, but if you just want to drool over a muscular tanned body, you'll need to fast forward alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Body!","review":"I really liked this movie. I think the guy has a sexy body. I saw it with my mom and sister and in the beginning of the movie, they showed a close up of his body in the shower. My mom's mouth dropped open and she said she liked how the camera focused on that. Me and my sister (she is 12) love Hunk's wide muscular back, six pack abs and big broad chest with golden brown nipples that were always hard! I liked the way all the girls looked at his body. They should have had more parts in the movie where women kissed his hot body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad acting","review":"I usually like older 80s romantic comedies, but Hunk just takes 80s corniness to a new level. The acting is atrociously bad, and I say that as someone who typically forgives weak acting. The basic plot is fine - a guy sells soul to the devil in order to become a hunk - but the plot twists just don't make sense. Why does the devil keep going back in time to create more evil? Is he actually trying to change the past? A TV host nearly drives a jeep in reverse off a pier and doesn't seem capable of braking during the minute or so it's going on? Isn't it a bit all too convenient that the Devil's assistant falls in love with the main character? On top of all that, the guy's name is Hunk! I'd definitely recommend avoiding this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage alert","review":"I bought it to educate my kids about the history and events of WWII. This set fails miserably. It's mostly unexciting footage with many repeating scenes and many times there is clearly no connection between the battles covered and the footage.The storytelling is abysmal and the pictures are unexciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of historys best","review":"Due to the lack of educational films on WWII, this one is the best to be found. It clearly explains the whole European campaign, with personal photographs from the GI's who were actually there. I think that it is important to know the history of something before you watch a drama on it, so i suggest watching this movie before watching Saving Private Ryan, or The Thin Red Line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Colorized footage","review":"I had high hopes for this set but can't recommend it for 2 reasons. First the colorized footage is poorly done. If it had been done better it would have been OK but the color values are often incorrect and very basic with poor shading and depth of detail. The second reason is that the DVD's are very short in length. All this material could have probably been put in a 2 Disc set in one keep case. Multiple DVD's is a common practice to make the consumer believe they are getting their moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any one have a map, magic marker, and a pointer.","review":"There are some really good shots of actual combat, but the 2 D.V.D. set completely lacks any sense of the overall picture of the war. The actual conflict between MacArthur and the Navy, why Midway was so important,in fact the overall strategy of the Navy is never really explained. I would have thought the History Channel could have done better. The best part is the story of Bull Halsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Totally Third Rate Production","review":"In short, too much repeat footage. This DVD pack is sub average at its very best. The Highlights are the program on the battle with the Africa Corps. and the program on the Battle of the Bulge. The other 2 programs are made up of repeat footage. Their are virtually no insights given and the feeling of the entire set is one of an impersonal overview. And not just any overview but an overview that is rushed, its as if the narrators (there are 2 and they are both inept) need to make a mad dash to the toilet and just want to get this damn thing over with. If you are looking for something comprehensive and insightful this clunk is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster clip show","review":"I have seen some pretty good productions from the History Channel. This is not one of them. It views like a text book, with rapid fire black and white war footage, and facts. The information is good, however it is difficult to watch as the narrator changes with the footage (which is often). Do not expect to see much along the way of synopsis or historian commentary / insights as you view this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This set of videos was disappointing, especially because the History Channel usually is better.First, it's not just about the war in Europe, so if you want to focus on the European theater, you're also going to get some about Japan, Asia and Africa. Which means the European focus is weaker.Second, they use some of the shots and narratives twice. Which is okay if you watch an episode a week, but not if you watch all 4 in a couple of days. The repetition seemed pointless.The videos also don't give a good feel for plans or battles. It seemed to be more like 'a battle went here, and here, and here...'I'm looking for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont do it again","review":"Late, late late, no bladderwrack i've seen, i didn't feel comfortable with product, a little afraid to use it so......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I have never seen a book so full of factual errors as this one.

Plus, if you need your Phoenix fix (SPOILER ALERT!) he does make some cameos. The new characters, including your obligatory teen-girl sidekick, Trucy, will grab onto your heartstrings and tug. While PW fans may miss characters such as Gumshoe, Mia, Maya, and Edgeworth, they'll be rewarded with a fresh cast of characters that will make up or the loss. The cast is as vibrant and fun as every other PW game, not to mention mind-blowing plot twists and connections between past and present characters you never would have deemed possible. Capcom, you've scored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I really enjoyed this game, but of course I also enjoyed all the other Phoenix Wright games as well. Love the fact that you can get close to some objects and dust for prints.

The flowers are beautiful, and the projects are as well. However, the instructions and illustrations are poor. Some of them are photographs using dark fabric, so you cannot see what the directions are describing. I found it impossible to figure out several of the folded projects.

This book has been a disappointment because I can't figure out how to make all the things I see in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"This book gave me some good ideas for adding something different to my quilts. At first glance the instructions appear simple but some of the photos and diagrams need to be studied quite carefully to achieve the desired result. I found practising with paper first, on some flowers, helpful as the paper holds it's fold. However that is a disadvantage with other flowers. Experimentation is probably the way to go.

It is not well known because its subject matter is very dark -- an explicit depiction of government supported racism and police brutality in 1970s England from the view of a person who witnessed and was subject to it. It is a miracle this record is still available.The reggae music that accompanies Linton Johnson's lyrics is some of the best that has ever been performed in the genre. I first heard this record in 1984 as a reggae DJ at a college station and today, 16 years later, the words and music are still relevant and fresh. Most overtly \\"political\\" music quickly gets old and outdated with time. Somehow, LKJ and his musical collaborators concocted these songs so that they have not aged with time. How they did this, I don't know, but they did it.I cannot recommend this record too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Always Prefer - the First Position !","review":"I do a lot of filing - at home and at work.

It was a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time greats","review":"A teenage girl, missing for weeks, reappears with a story of being kidnapped and imprisoned by an eccentric mother and daughter; the latter enlists a bored country lawyer to defend them. Tey's Inspector Alan Grant takes a back seat in this book to the main characters. The plot is based on an actual eighteenth-century case, but Tey updates it and makes it fully believable. Not only are all the characters (even minor ones) beautifully drawn, but the various settings in which the story takes place are memorably described. The book is not only a whacking good mystery with a thoroughly satisfying solution, but also a vivid picture of post-WW II Britain, and a commentary on the power of the popular press that's more pertinent than ever today. This one is high on my Top 10 Mysteries of All Time list."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been jaded from today's kind of endings","review":"This book was a good read. The only problem was on my end. I kept trying to make the book more twisted and deep that it really was. You have to remember when it was written. You can't compare it with today's books or TV shows where there is always another twist coming. I thought the ending was a little disappointing. Even in the movie Casablanca the guy didn't get the girl at the end and that movie was written before this book. Overall the mystery was good and I would recommend it ending and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another timeless read","review":"The accusations leveled by Betty Kane could have so easily been made by someone in today's society. In fact, we come across this type of situation in the news every day. When I read Josephine Tey, I have to remind myself of the years during which she was writing. Does the time frame make her stories dated? If you call dated a book in which the language used is reminiscent of a more civilized time, so be it. For me, it is quite refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mystery","review":"The Franchise Affair is a great mystery. Even though you know what the ending will probably be, you'll want to keep reading. Marion Sharpe and her mother, who live in a isolated mansion known as the Franchise, are accused of kidnapping and beating a teenager, Betty Kane. They say that they have never seen her before, and enlist a local attorney, Robert Blair, to defend them. He has never handled a case like this before, but resolves to do it. As the book progresses, Blair decides to conduct his own investigation into Betty Kane. He fervently believes in the Sharpes' innocence, and works to find gaps in Betty's story. Even though it seems like something straight out of Masterpiece Theatre, The Franchise Affair is exciting and hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sara Hendrix Rocks Again","review":"Another great CD from this talented artist.

I've had it for about 10 years now. It has a solid case, polished links and is water resistant to 100 meters. it's got a beautifully detailed ivory face and Roman numerals. It's got three blue sub-dials for the chronograph for the sub-second, minutes and hours. My one glaring complaint is that the hour and minute markers are very thin and hard to see, especially against the blue sub-dials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Shadows a Spectaular Summer Romance!","review":"This second book in Gayle Roper's Seaside Series is as entrancing and enjoyable as the first. I love the \\"obscure\\" women the heroine quotes as motivation for herself and also the idea of the hero having a \\"dual personality\\" - as did the villian! I was hooked from the first pages and couldn't put it down. I empathized with Abby's problems with her mother and Marsh's with his dad - all of us had troubled times occasionally growing up. Abby is endearing not only to adults, but obviously cares for kids and pets, too - and kids and pets always know who the good guys are. The relationship with Rick and Celia was a great parallel romance. A highly recommended, great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Seasons down, two to go","review":"I figured Gayle couldn't possibly top Spring Rain, but boy, was I wrong! Summer Seasons kept me reading from the time I opened it until there was nothing left to read, and then left me upset that Fall and Winter aren't written yet!I thoroughly enjoyed Abby's quest for freedom, Marsh's quest for peace and quiet and Rick's quest for something real. I also enjoyed the fact that the \\"mystery villain\\" actually WAS a mystery for quite a bit of the book, and that I was surprised to learn who it was. And I'm still laughing at the concept of a cat named Puppy!This book is a good entertaining read, but it's also full to the brim with useful, edifying subject matter, a perfect blend of romance, intrigue and good, solid Christian faith. In other words, you'll enjoy reading this, but be careful- you just might learn something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Shadows","review":"Both my daughter and myself have now read this book, she has done so many times and wanted her own copy. I am happy to see there is a author who writes books with a intriguing plot and continues to put Christ at the center.

It's just bad writing- plain and simple. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamburger's writing lacks!","review":"After reading several reviews of \\"Faith for Beginners\\", my book club chose this as it's next book to read. The reviews used words like \\"funny\\", \\"insightful\\", \\"profoundly moving\\", & we were all looking forward to reading it. \\"Faith for Beginners\\" is NOT at all funny! It is quite the opposite in fact. It is a completely depressing novel with nothing interesting, powerful, memorable, meaningful or redeeming about it. The characters have no depth, with the exception of George, & therefore do not draw you in. The result...this reader didn't give a hoot what happened to any of the characters. It drags on & on, & you think that it's got to get better but it never does.All in all, Hamburger's writing was not creative, interesting, profound or...ANYTHING. The only thing I felt at the end of the book was angry that I wasted my time reading it. This book does not work, & Aaron Hamburger hasn't got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fans of SY and Beck","review":"Here is a low priced little book with lots of journal entries from Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo, quite a few from Beck and a couple others (but the others don't contribute too much). It is a very interesting inside look at one of the most vividly remembered tours in independent rock history. A lineup featuring the likes of these many performers will probably never cross the U.S. again in my lifetime. The Kathleen Hanna incident doesn't actually dominate Thurston's entries, but takes up a large chunk of his journals. Beck's entries are great. David Yow doesn't say too much... One overriding theme is how big of a jerk Courtney Love really is. There are plenty of little interesting stories relayed along the way. Don't miss out you Sonic Youth and Beck fans! And for all those who still remember being at one of these shows, it might be interesting to hear what was going on behind the scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAVEN'T READ IT YET!","review":"Be careful what edition you receive.I received the book without the Illustrations by Maurice Spira.

Lp2 by Sunny Day Real Estate and the Deftones' masterful Adrenaline are examples of other CD's like this. The vocals may be nothing but screaming, and the songs may be all written in the same key, but for some reason, it all clicks and sounds great. At first listen, El Diablo seems like a giant wall of noise, but after awhile, the listener discovers beauty behind this wall. I can't really explain it, it's just... beautiful.WHVN and Carpe Diem both have some good songs, but none are up to the caliber of the songs on this album. If you like bands such as Neurosis, The Promise Ring, and the Deftones, which have subtle ways of [messing] with your mind, you will love this album. It may take awhile to like, but once you get it, you won't stop playing it. Oh yeah, and read the liner notes.

I didn't understand one word but I loved it. This is the Carmen Miranda of Rio, not the Hollywood caricature everyone expects. Her lovely voice expresses each tango and samba with joy and passion. This is probably not for all tastes, but if you have a love for the exotic you will enjoy this collection of Carmen's earliest recordings from 1931-35. Just slip it on and imagine yourself in the Copacabana sipping champagne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Work","review":"Once Again Eleanor Taylor Bland delivers a real to life suspense, mystery thriller in Windy City Dying. The Heroine-Marti MacAlister is a lady cop being tracked by a psycho/murderer but she doesn't know it. Many years prior her deceased husband (who was also a cop and was killed in the line of duty) had put this murderer behind bars for killing someone. Now the murderer is out and wants revenge but the cop (Macalister's husband ) is dead so he goes after her and all the jurors and the judge that placed him in prison for so many years. This is Bland's best work-I guarantee you will not put this book down until the end--and what an end it is. I love all of the Marti Macalister novels and hope the next one is just as good. The characters are real and the events really make you think about your own life and the decisions you make. Eleanor Taylor Bland is a gifted writer and I hope she continues doing quality work.

He classifies his early admiration for Junguian thought, as \\"I was in my twenties and fool\\". Well, how's that for self disclosure!

Reading this dry, deconstructionist rant once again proved Wilhelm Reich (another similiarly persecuted psychologist) correct- little men will always reject ideas which they fear and misunderstand, by attempting anything in their power to disprove the conflicting idea or defame the conflicting individual. Instead of reading this garbage, I would suggest trying to reconstruct your subjective mind- Friedrich Nietzsche, Ken Wilber, Aleister Crowley, Wilhelm Reich, Timothy Leary, Terrence McKenna, Michel Foucault, or even <snicker> Carl Jung could help you \\"expand your head\\" beyond the inculcated ideas of our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hatchet job but has some value.","review":"Much of this book is about Pan-German volkisch groups,Nietzscheanism,neo-paganism and sun worship in Germany and kindredsubjects,all of which are claimed to be influences on Jung, but specific links are not made clear.Jung's actual ideas and teachings are barely touched upon.Significant points made are that the Solar Phallus Man account by Jung is very dubious;Jung had an experience of self deification; and the Jung movement has certain cult like features.This book adds to our knowledge of Jung, about whom much has still to be learnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda & tired pseudoiconoclasm","review":"Some people will do anything for a little propaganda. A book like this could just as easily have been written about Socrates, Rabelais, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Joyce, or a lot of other people. Whenever a revolutionary new thinker comes along, the irrelevant, talentless pseudoiconoclasts (e.g. Richard Noll) come along to take them to pieces. Spare me yet another hyped-up 'j'accuse!'. Yes, I did read it and take note of it, and the facts are selectively chosen and selectively interpreted. A waste of money, and deceptive & vindictive too. Burn this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done","review":"For those familiar with Jung's work, the scholarship and interpretation in this book will be disappointing at best. Jung's contribution to psychology is certainly portrayed in a misleading manner here and one can only wonder what prompted the author's uninformed ax-grinding. Jung's work is a much better source for the interested reader as is most any other critical study of his methods and ideas. A very weak and poorly done book on a fascinating topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing Devil's Advocate","review":"Methinks Noll missed the spiritual point entirely. For one thing, Jung never exalted himself; he exalted his Inner Woman. Nor did he ever consider himself a god (\\"the wise old man is an ape\\"); in fact, he wrote: \\"The inititated man regarded himself, not as a god, but as a goddess.\\" Any person who has \\"experienced\\" the triad -- Freud, Jung, Hillman -- knows this simple truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid Trash with a Bibliography","review":"This book is filled with simple assertions that are quite simply false. Sonu Shamdasani addresses many of these in Cult Fictions. Some things Shamdasani doesn't address have to do with the assertion that Jung was a \\"Gnostic Sun-worshiper\\" which, in and of itself, is a contradiction of terms much like saying he was a Dionysian ascetic. Other idiocies and falsehoods abound. Anyone with a passing familiarity with Jung's work will find this book hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanderous guilt by association tactics on every page","review":"This is the greatest act of scholarly libel of our age. Mark Noll's thesis seems to be that Jung himself, and his theories, are somehow racist and quasi-Nazi because Jung was an ethnic German of the upper classes who had some contact with the intellectual movements of his day. This is, of course, bunk. In no way does this prove anything about direct intellectual influences between proto-Nazism and similar currents of thought and Jung or his psychology. As such, this book is a vile slander trading on anti-German stereotypes, the same kind of garbage that was used to dismiss Nietzsche until Walter Kaufmann save dhim from oblivion some decades ago. Anyone with a sense of intellectual honesty should avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book to read","review":"I find this book boring and confusing.It presents too much details,and they are predetermined.The author igored some important aspects:the works and articles by Jung himself,the statues of other important psychoanalysts,etc.The author claimed to present us the \\"historical Jung\\",but I got little idea from it.I wish I hadn't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best of the West","review":"I bought this disc because of the personnel - Shank, Shorty Rogers, Jimmy Rowles, Levy and Larry Bunker. All of whom I have enjoyed immensely on other West Coast jazz sessions. But this recording - essentially two LPs, one by Shank with Rogers in tow and one by Levy's trio - is what I would call a lesser session. It lacks any kind of cohesion on either date. I expected those tight swinging clever charts with cool harmonies and a hint of Basie that these guys were so famous for. But not on this one. These are some recordings seeking an identity, seeking an audience and most of all, they don't swing.

I seldom find recipe books that take 'delicacy' into consideration-- she notes the ways that the mushrooms interlace with other ingredients, like the way that brie slices are infused with the taste of the truffle slices. I particularly love the Buckwheat Crepes with Wild Mushrooms, Ham and Gruyere.The whole book is beautiful- it may sound odd, but the paper quality is excellent. The cover has that high quality paperback flap that fold over, making the cover thicker and more durable than regular soft cover books.

You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date. Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming. His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.

Is it a bad movie? No. It's just nothing special. Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy. De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that. But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good. I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given. Believe me, I wanted to like this movie. I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting.

At first I thought, \\"Boxing movie? Cool!\\" but only a few minutes into the film I discovered that it was miles away from exciting. Jake La Motta is an extremely unsympathetic character whose temper and jealousy don't give any motivation for the audience to like him. He alienates everyone close to him and I couldn't bring myself to feel sorry for his eventual fate. Robert De Niro's portrayal of La Motta was well done, but being well-acted doesn't make the film any more watchable. The boxing scenes were the parts I was most looking forward to, but again, I was sorely disappointed. I am well aware that the boxing wasn't the main focus of this film, but a director of Scorsese's caliber should have been able to make it slightly interesting.The only thing that angers me more than the fact that my time was wasted by this film is the fact that so many hail it as a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raging Baloney","review":"Martin Scorsese isn't a bad fellow, and he has a lot of talent, no doubt, but his influence on young American moviemakers has been entirely negative. The galloping illiteracy of this film, the first of Scorsese's f-word festivals, has infected dozens of other directors and screenwriters, and has even spread to television, where we see a sewage backup like \\"The Sopranos\\" being acclaimed by many who should know better. The screenplay of \\"Raging Bull\\" is shot through with inaccuracies, and nobody who remembers Jake LaMotta performing on \\"Car 54 Where Are You\\" is going to accept him as a tragic figure. The real tragedy is the debasement of the English language and its inexhaustible variety by a film like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated! Overated!

It's a story about a cocky, arrogant jerk who likes to abuse the people around him both mentally and physically. Most of the movie is of him degrading women, screaming profanities to them and hitting them. In one scene he beats his own brother badly in a jealous rage, stomping him and then slugs his own 20 year old wife. The only thing I learned from this movie is that Jake Lamotta was one horrible person. This movie does nothing for boxing. It basically just shows boxers as violent wife beaters who can take punches. Even the fight scenes do nothing to showcase the art of boxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ragin Bull Rating","review":"I love De Niro movies typically.....that smile of his, his acting potential, which cann go from extreme insanity to totally hilarious actor but this movie, De Niro or not De Niro, my son and I rated a \\"negative one-halve\\".Every movie my son and I watch, we rate them after as a family thing, if you will, from 1 to 10...............we rated this movie negative one-halve.

De Niro is perfect. The supporting cast is perfect. The fight scenes are perfect. I didn't cringe during Goodfellas, but some of the fight scenes here are just brutal.The picture on the DVD is perfect, as nothing is lost in the black and white. The only issue with the DVD is the fact that the sound drops alot between fights. De Niro sounds like he's mumbling occasionaly, but that can be fixed by turning up the sound on your TV a little bit louder than normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touted as a classic","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT movie, but not a classic. I am really not sure why it won the awards it did other than it was very different than the other movie in 1980. Filmed in black and white, this is the story of boxer Jake La Motta, played by Oscar-winner De Niro. It's other Oscar went for film editing. Joe Pesci puts in a typical performance as a foul-mouthed east coaster.The film is very good, however, it became a cookie cutter for Joe Pesci roles. De Niro was FAR better in the Deer Hunter, admittedly a very different kind of movie, but the film is very typical of the De Niro/Pesci movies. If you have seen these two work together before, you are really not in for much new. If you haven't, please, watch this, but avoid any other De Niro/Pesci movie, as the plot changes, but the men remain the same. This film is these two actors working together at their best, but Scorsese himself has beat these two into the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best American films of all time","review":"I will not be redundant of the deserved high praise others have given this movie, and particularly DeNiro and Scorcese, except to say that I agree completely. Few reviewers have mentioned the stunning performance of Joe Pesci (in his first major film role) in which he perfectly creates a character who is hilariously funny, ultra-violent and a compassionate and caring brother. For the viewer, a great companion film is the Scorcese-DeNiro-Pesci work, Goodfellas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece (thought most people don't know why)","review":"This film is a masterpiece. We're all flawed individuals, and an individual is not to blame for his/her personality development. But we are all responsible to control what we've become, and that is hard for all of us. Some more than others, like the bull in this film. If only there were safe places for all children to deal with their emotions. But there aren't, and that's why the world is suffering. And it only gets worse.And why bash \\"Ordinary People\\"? That's also a brilliant film. Just because it doesn't have tough guys, tough dialogue, and blood doesn't mean it's a sissy movie. If anything, it's more disturbing than \\"Raging Bull\\". At least Jake LaMotta tried to redeem himself to those he hurt, and to himself. Mary Tyler Moore's character in \\"Ordinary People\\" simply walked out, losing the battle AND the war. Now how on earth could she ever live with herself? At least LaMotta found a way to live with himself without being the animal of his past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and White Masterpiece","review":"Meticulous attention to detail and proper use of black and white photography gives this story of the self-destructive life of pro-boxer Jake LaMotta extra-added emphasis.Footnote: When interviewed, the real Jake LaMotta said the movies's depiction of his life was inaccurate - the movie wasn't violent enough!!!!He did not elaborate, and no one wanted him too.Can you blame them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is our Special Edition?","review":"While this movie is a true classic and is one of Scorsese's best, that can't be said for the far unacceptable DVD that is now out of print. A Special Edition w/ and Anamorphic transfer would help, but it can't come soon enough. Since the previous DVD has been out of print for quite some time, I assume a Special Edition is in the works and I expect an Anamorphic transfer. If not, I'm sure there will be more than one angry film buff.The movie is flawless as you see Jake LaMotta's soul and career being torn apart by himself through an amazing performance from Robert De Niro. A performance that I would say is the best of all-time. With the help of Jake LaMotta himself, Martin Scorsese has delievered a movie with awesome black and white cinematography, great boxing visuals (some of the most powerful you'll see in film) and top-notch performances from the entire cast. A must-see film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This film will knock you out !!!","review":"Raging Bull is the film based on the autobiography by formermiddle-weight champion Jake La Motta. Jake La Motta is a visiousfighter who was renowned for his powerful punches, which gave him the name \\"The Raging Bull\\". He is also a very jealous man who often assumes that his wife is having affaires with several men. This makes him an angry violent man which costs him the love of his wife and his brother. Robert De Niro plays the part of La Motta with sheer excellence and Joe Pesci as his brother is just as good.This is simply one of the best films money can buy. Get it and watch it again and again.

All of what these others say in praise is true.What I want to get across is this: This is also the most realistic boxing movie (non-documentary) ever made. I used to fight as a light-heavyweight out of Phila., and watching this movie gives me sympathetic muscle spasms, it's so real. I have to take deep breaths during the fight scenes in order to get my pulse rate back down.Every time I watch it, I forget for a moment that I am now an overweight, middle-aged guy on the sofa, and the years fall away to when I was a strong young man with good speed and good power in both hands.It's that real and that true. This, compared to other boxing movies where I view the fight scenes with mild derision. You want to know what a boxer sees and feels?

The eight year old girl who viewed it to the end (she always does, no matter what!) was often distracted and her five year old brother was bored and left the room before the scary parts forced us to turn off the tape. 3)The attempts to make the story appealing to young children by adding animal characters further confuse the plot and make the story untecognizable to anyone who, like me, has read and enjoyed the book.

I would recommend the book from Kaplan or the Flashcards from Mosby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Mistakes!","review":"I have used 4 different resources in preparing for the NCLEX, and this one is glaringly bad. I have found probably 10 or more errors in the practice questions. The question will ask for one thing and then the \\"correct\\" answer will be the opposite of what the question was asking. i.e. \\"What is a sign and symptom of X?\\" and then you'll wrack your brain and get to the answer and it'll say \\"1 is the only answer NOT a symptom of X.\\" Some of the answer numbers are wrong as well...it'll put one answer number and then the answer explanation will obviously be referring to a completely different answer choice.I've already written the company telling them that I've found so many mistakes that I'm questioning the efficacy of the whole book. This was added stress when I didn't need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I'm satisfied with my purchase. I was seeking an NCLEX review book. This book was highly recommended.

The artwork for the album is fresh, and that is the only reason why this record deserves one star. I don't enjoy writing negative reviews, and this is probably the first record Warp has released that has made me upset, but Team Shadetek are a completly void of any musical talent. This album can in no way compete with material from RDJ, Squarepusher, Prefuse, LFO, Boards of Canada, or even Chris Clark for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This album, from start to finish, is the sound of a beat box falling down the stairs. It stumbles, it crashes, and it finally ends with blissful silence. There is no melody or rhythm, just a garbled bunch of nonsense looped over and over, track after track. If \\"music\\" this amateurish is making the grade and being published on Warp Records, I'm going to buy my three year old daughter and drum machine and make millions off of her lack of talent.

It has two mobilization modes, and a lot of movable parts, including those awesome blades on its back, which can be posed almost any way you want. It's durable, too; mine took a nosedive off of my TV, and all that happened was that a few parts came off (They didn't break, they just came apart), but no major damage occured and the Fury still works. This is an excellent Zoid model, one of my favorites.

This collection was a little disappointing in that There were not a lot of interesting extras and some of it was still censored, but the content was good. The characters in this show are exaggerated and outrageous at times yet they seem very human in their faults and failings. I wish they would tone down the violence in some episodes, but you have to realize this is fantasy. That is the contradiction in this show: the characters seem believable and yet the situations are totally unbelievable. It is not for everyone, but I enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show but Not UNCENSORED","review":"Most of the episodes are censored.

I ended up using a air tool with a cutting wheel instead, which was a lot of work. Each time I tried to make a cut, the pressure would make the wheel move off to the side.

Even with very little pressure, the wheel would move off to the side resulting in something other than a 90 degree cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw, but needs improvements","review":"I used this saw to cut angle iron (about \\" x \\") to build a support frame. Like others have said, the blade does have deflection, so be aware of that. The saw did do the job, other than on my first cut, I was only cutting about \\" off the end of the angle iron and due that the blade started deflecting, the blade itself cut into it's own guide. No big deal here. My only complaint is that it only offers 1 way angle cuts - meaning that you can only go 0 - 45 on one side, which is useless when you are cutting 90 angle iron. I ended up using my band saw for those cut. If they improve on offering 45 cuts in both directions I would have given this review 5 starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Saw","review":"Plenty of power to do anything you need done.

The cover is atrocious and duller than the vibrant picture we see here.

Perhaps if I wasn't already an existential nihilist, it might be more shocking or revealing, but, instead, I crave a second to Candid.

This book catalogs Jackie's trials through lost love and free life after the gate bangs shut. After his prison term, Jackie goes on the road to end his inner turmoil and finally find freedom. The style of this book resembles that of the talented Jack Keroauc in his famous novel,\\"On the Road\\".

Can't wait for more from this very promising new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty cheesy and not very funny","review":"I guess it wasnt the worst movie i have ever seen, but it was pretty forgettable.

Tunes are 1 Stella by Starlight.2 Five 3 Joanne. 4. Back and Blow. John Willson was the supprise to me, what a good trumpet he is,not unlike Chet Baker.The star has to be Phill Woods, his alto in Charlie Parker style produces long flowwing lines,and tne unison passages are nagotiated with ease.The last four tracks are by a different group consisting of Howard Mcgee(t)Dick Hyman(p)Teddy Kotick (b)Roy Haynes(d). The tunes are 1. Costernation 2. Lemon Drop 3.The Little Bandmaster 4. Pee Wee's Dream. Howard shows he hasn't forgotten those Be Bop licks from the forties, and the band gells nicely.

Although not a masterpiece, the beautiful locations helped a rather mild story about emerald fever. Stewart GRANGER and Paul DOUGLAS are quite convincing as the mining buddies, but Grace KELLY seems bored and not interested by her role through most of the film, wearing gloves in a coffee plantation(in Colombia, with an average temperature of 110in the shade !!!) and changing dresses (created by Helen ROSE, of course !)in pratically every scene !!!

The author's premise seems to come down to this--people can only be free and happy in shadows of MCC. Phrases (no kidding!) like \\"What went wrong--*too much democracy*\\" actually appear throughout the book. Trade unions are vehicles of \\"thuggery,\\" etc etc etc. Honest to god, I'm basically speechless after wading through the book. An establishment, corporatist \\"take\\" on how/why people get what they deserve when they dare to reject free marketry (and are then deliberately hobbled by those in a position to behave in a moral, responsible, socially conscious manner)....much like Cuba is held up to Americans as ostensible proof of socialism's abject failure, rather than what happens when a country is cut off/isolated and left to die, rather than respected and engaged.

His co-star, Jeff, is extremely talented for a boy his age.

The ultimate reason for the danger in the book becomes rather silly, but still there is some redeaming quality to the novel. This was basically Fennimore Cooper's first attempt at an American novel and so some tolerance is warrented. I shall try the next book, The Pioneers, in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book of Falling Quality","review":"Berendt's writing style is engaging as always, but the book is so unfocussed that it is more confusing than readable. Instead of concentrating on a single crime/scandal, and then spiraling outwards from that (which he did remarkably well in his first book), this book bounces around between several notorious deeds spread across large expanses of time, and all of them are chronicled to wildly varying degrees -- and some have questionable \\"conclusions\\" and some are just abandoned in the middle of the book and never mentioned or concluded in any fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for the atmosphere alone","review":"Berendt does a masterful job of creating a powerful sense of place and then layering it with class, psychology, the dark underbelly, the glittering lives and the whole ambiance.

Probably, because it took me over a month to drag myself through this painful piece. I kept reading, with the hope that something would happen. I think that my home owners policy would make for better reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, fun characters","review":"Much in the style of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, John Berendt has traveled to Venice and found the most unique and interesting people to write about. Once again, the book reads like fiction and the reader has to keep reminding himself that the events and people are real. It begins with the Fenice Opera House burning to the ground. Wild accusations abound as the Venitians try to ascertain whether the fire was accident or arson. Fingers are pointed at everyone including top level government officials. Amidst the fire investigation, there are parties, business deals, crimes, and even murder/suicides for the socialites to discuss and share their individual viewpoints. The writing makes the people and the city come alive with culture and fun. At times it is difficult to keep all of the characters straight, but overall an original insight into the city and it's people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Star for Venice","review":"All Venice lovers will pick up this book as a must-read, but many will put it down with disappointment. The supposed theme is scandal and intrigue, beginning with the alleged arson at the opera house and trailing through a glass blower's family arguing about the business and a woman who is said to have tried to steal an archive and failed. None of it is very convincing; none of the accused have plausible motives; the sources seem random; some of the writing is piercingly shrill; and on the whole, who cares? For anyone interested in Venice, there are hundreds of books available, and this one ranks very near the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice prose -- but there's no story","review":"My title says it all. Great writing. Clever dialogue. Nice descriptions of Venice. But there's no story in this book. Nothing to pull you forward other than a lukewarm \\"leitmotif\\" about the theater fire.

Having pre-ordered this book months in advance, and waited keenly by the letterbox for it to arrive, I have to confess I was heartily disappointed. It lacks any recognizable plot and is wholly composed of uninteresting and fragmentary second-hand gossip.After waiting so long for a follow-up, I now wish Berendt had waited longer, and found something actually worth writing about. I understand he was under pressure from the publishers to produce something, and it certainly shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Portrait of a City","review":"Having been one of the annoying tourists that swarm through St. Mark's and the Rialto, it was fascinating to gain an insider's perspective on a city that, at first, I had not found all that attractive. I thoroughly enjoyed the snapshots of the local color in Venice, particularly the Plant Man, whom I believe proves beyond dispute that fact can be stranger, and more entertaining, than fiction. A few of the snapshots overextend themselves, particularly the ones concerning the Curtises and Ezra Pound; however, Venice in the end won me over, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has any appreciation of history or culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"a trivial book of gossip","review":"I was looking forward to a great book about Venice, but it was such a disappointment.

Having arrived in Venice the year the Fenice burned, I am aware of all the conflicting reports of the fire, the importance of the theater itself and of the obsfucation of facts that was promoted by authorities and the press. I could not put the book down as it gives a remarkably concise picture of Venice and the expatriate community that lives on the islands. This fascinating reading is very easy to relate to the mystic of Venice and makes one yearn to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse of Venice...","review":"Short and to the point--John Berendt is able to capture you from the first pages of this book to the point that you are unwilling to put it down...that is the mark of an excellent writer.

I have a rule to give up on a book after 100 pages but I broke my own rule because I kept thinking the book was going somewhere. It wasn't. It was like Midnight in that it gave you lots of side events in Venice but in Midnight there was an overarching crime. There was an attempt in this book to make the burning of the Fenice Opera House a similar overarching theme but it really wasn't nearly as interesting. I should have given up after 100 pages............"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Anyone Who Loves Venice","review":"A great read about Venice and its inhabitants and culture.

The people and facts were intesting, but the whole time I'm reading it, I kept thinking, \\"what does this have to do with the storyline?\\" I thought that some of the characters talked about would do at least something in the end, but I was left with very brief explanations as to why they were even in the book to begin with.

He's an unskilled writer and thinker, with the soulful depth of a gossip columnist. Pick your favorite town or city, and imagine someone spinning the news-making personalities (University heads, retired CEO's, Mayors, developers, elites and gold-diggers) into a porttrait of your town, coated with a pretense of depth through literary references. You'd be incensed. Most people don't care about the trials of the rich and famous (maybe 10% of the population does, enough to keep books like this successful) -- they care about real stuff, like life, death, happiness, meaningful work, family etc. There's nothing important here. This is not Venice today, and the inhabitants of the city are right to ignore the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 103 pages","review":"If a book cannot grab me within the first 100 pages, then I have to stop. Not only that, but it was due at the library, and there is a waiting list (why?). I just have little time, and so many other books to read.I will say that what I did read was somewhat interesting, and the writing was good. I just wasn't that interested in the story - at least at 100+ pages. It must get better, but I wish that I was made to care earlier in the writing.Sorry if this wasn't very helpful, this review is more of my opinion than a critique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhanced visit to Venice","review":"I read this book in conjunction with my first visit to Venice, and it enhanced my understanding of the city.

There's just no story there. It's as if the author was trying desperately to replicate his enormous success of \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\\" Although Venice is a fascinating place, descriptions of the scenery and ambiance can only go so far. The book starts off with a big fire in a legendary theater in Venice. But--it doesn't go much further. The people were boring and I found all those paragraphs of dialogue monotonous. It's rather weird how the author can turn up in a place--and a big dramatic event is happening. And everyone he meets is associated with the event. This is a book that I was really looking forward to reading but it's one that i simply couldn't generate any interest in. Sorry, John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Venice I remember!","review":"The author tells the story of Venice in two ways--by relating the story of the burning and rebuilding of the Fenice, Venice's world-renown opera house, and by describing some colorful Venetians and American expatriates he met while living in Venice. I was taken aback by some of the people he described, many of whom I felt were self-serving, obnoxious, and pretentious. The worst of the lot were Larry Lovett and Dr. Bob Guthrie who may have been friends at one time but who used the charitable organization Save Venice in a quest for power and to spew venom at each other. I would much rather have learned about the simple folk who populate this most amazing city.

The scenery was beautifully presented, but the story was hard to get through. I felt constantly lost, as the author jumped from one time period to another within a manner of paragraphs. Situations were never resolved and left me hanging. Perhaps that was Mr. Berendt's purpose?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to do with Venice","review":"I bought this book as I am interested in how people live in various parts of the world. The author noted early on that no one has written about people that actually live in Venice. He is correct, and they still haven't. About 60% of this book is about the boring lives and political infighting of society types, most of whom are from New York. Why does anybody think these people are interesting? But if you like Britney Spears or Paris Hilton, maybe you will like this. It does have a few good parts when he can drag himself away from royalty, society and literary types, but most of the book is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The City Of Falling Angels","review":"Just the type of book I was looking for.

I also marveled at the willingness of just about everyone the author met to divulge information that he should not have been privy to, and at times the author was a down-right nuisance to a police investigation with his Sherlock Holmes attitude.

I keep waiting for something to happen, or some sense of a story to develop and there was NOTHING. Absolutely nothing ties the book together, it is basically about someone writing about people they meet who really are not all that interesting. The only thing that makes the book remotely interesting is that it is set in Venice. If it were anywhere else I probably would have quit reading a lot sooner.Maybe it gets better later in the book, but frankly I don't feel like wasting my time to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petty and Pretentious","review":"If Venice is a city you've always dreamed of visiting, or your favorite travel destination, this book still isn't for you! Don't get me wrong, I love great stories filled with interesting and eccentric characters, as this book is billed. Trouble is, this book doesn't deliver on that score either.Sure there are some great stories buried in the pages of social party drivel, like the Seguso glass dynasty - worth every paragraph and more.But mostly Berendt's long awaited follow-up to Midnight is chock full of gossip, innuendo, and pandering blather about all the \\"great\\" people Berendt can name - John, I get it, you can list all the hall of famers on the 19th and early 20th century facist poet dream team.

I got to a point where I didn't care about Venice or about the characters, I just wanted the book to end and be far away from me. At least in Midnight, the characters' stories were centered around a central plot. Not so here. There is a fire in Venice's main opera house. That's all the plot there is. From there it's just the main \\"character\\" doing interview after interview of people. And not having to do with the fire either.

Having not read Midnight, I came to it with no expectations. The attraction for me was Venice. I have been reading a lot about Italy lately, and no other book has been anything like this.I found Berendt's writing style extremely easy to read and very descriptive. I was really caught up in every little story he told, and his characters are some of the most memorable I have ever encountered - and they are real people! In many ways Venice is like a theme park. It is hard to believe people really live there. So I was fascinated to read about some current and previous residents of Venice. It was also interesting that so many people who presume to treat Venice as their own are actually expats or even foreigners.In short, I loved it and would read it again.

Mr. Berendt unfortunately has written nothing more than an extended gossip column.The book is filled with observations, about people especially, which are either of no interest to anyone but the most mesmerized tourist or useless as anything other than page fillers. He is so taken with the rich and famous that he forgot, at least up to the point at which I gave up, to talk about La Fenice in any meaningful way.

So what was stopping this book from becoming an unputdownable adventure?It seemed to me that Berendt simply ran out of ideas. What we ended up with was a boring litany of squabbles amongst a pack of mad rich socialites who aren't interesting and who, for the most part, aren't even Venetian.I stayed to the end just out of curiosity - to find out the end of the La Fenice story - but was quite relieved when I finally reached the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book starts off great, but becomes a let down very quickly.

If I wanted to read local gossip, I'd pick up one of the rags at the supermarket. I've been to Venice, and wanted to read a book about this fascinating city which includes the political and cultural landscape. Unfortunately, this is not the one. It's a hodgepodge of unrelated anecdotes, none of which interested me in the least about people I don't care about or want to know about. Sure, there were some tidbits that shed a little light on Viennese society; but overall, this was a huge disappointment. The only mystery is...how did it get the good reviews it has had???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","review":"This is quite possibly the biggest claim of false advertising in the known Universe! The back of the book is totally lying about what the book is about. The author drones on and on about stuff no one would probably care about, all the while name dropping and sounding important. There is absolutely no story, no mystery and no point to this drivel. An entire 30+ page chapter on the membership of the Save Venice committee? Who cares?

Berendt pads the story with numbing descriptions of palaces and mansions. He spends so much time eyeballing ceilings it's a wonder he survived with his neck intact. Adding insult to injury, he then veers into a Reader's Digest history of Venice, with profiles of famous former inhabitants. All of which can be found elsewhere. Midnight... was a classic work. This book was simply unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried..","review":"After reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil I was excited to read The City of Falling Angels. I tried so hard to get through this book it was incredibly boring and dry. I appreciate the amount of work that went into this book with all of the historical facts and such. I was just wanting more. It literally took me 2 months to read this only reading a few pages a day....very little interest at all. If anything I took away an extreme amount of knowledge of Venice.

The people of Savannah are known for their quirks. So are the Venetians, and John Berendt lets you know there are a myriad of idiosyncracies in Venice.It's not an easy read, like \\"Midnight,\\" but it's worth the effort if you want not one story with an easy-to-follow plot but a character study that will explain a culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Autumn that did \\"Return To The Breath\\" and \\"Hating Tree\\"","review":"This is a different group from the one that did \\"Return to the Breath\\" and \\"Hating Tree\\".

Most of the local stores don't have it and even if they do, some charge as high as $69.95 (some charge $35 for the 2004 re-release).This is the very first album from 11/5, and every track is bangin. There are times when the tracks are fast-paced funk like garcia vegas to a parody take on punk-ass love songs like the yola track brousin'. There's never a dull moment, with Tadatay, Hennessey, Maine-O, with beats by T.C. the hardest rap fan will end up fiendin 4 tha funk. As a side note, I found that this rap album made some russian rap site's top 5 rap albums ever made.Looks like 11/5 got em fiendin 4 tha funk up in russia as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"sick debut","review":"arson... one of the greatest new metalcore bands out there. this first ep is a bit different than lacerate the sky, its got a different singer who is BY NO MEANS anywhere CLOSE to anthony ezzi in terms of goodness. he sounds like a mix between the guy from snapcase and the guy from the agony scene. so the vocals are a con compared to their other album. but its made up for in music, because alot of this record is more melodic than lacerate, and ive got a soft spot for melodic guitar a la gothenburg death metal. best track on this one is definitely the title track and avoid the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Gorman","review":"6 Nightmares was actually only one or two nightmares. Anthony Lake begins discussing the global dangers facing our nation today, but eventually digresses and gives us his autobiography instead. He also dedicates quite a bit of space towards how Bill Clinton really wasn't as bad as he seemed to be and how we are all victims of the vast right-wing conspiracy.There were plenty of interesting insider tidbits, but I think an article in TIME might have been more appropriate than dedicating a whole book to Anthony Lake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Washington","review":"The book starts out OK--and some of the concepts are impressive considering it was written in a pre 9/11 world.

Yawn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is lame.","review":"This book only impresses naive, unthinking people with lazy minds. There are many logical errors and contradictions in this collection of talks. For instance, under \\"Proofs and Evidences of the Existence of God\\", 'Abdu'l-Baha states, \\"The contingent world is the source of imperfections\\", but later under \\"Modification Of Species\\", he states the opposite, for he says, \\"...the universe has no imperfection,...\\" Well, which is it? Another talk asserts \\"The Nonexistence of Evil\\", where he omitts the very real evils that men do to themselves and others, such as murder, rape, thieft, lying, etc. The list goes on and on. I recommend this work only to active, critical, free-thinkers, that they may become well informed on the muddled reasoning of the faithful.

Not only does the story vaguely follow the correct timeline of events, but so much of historical facts are left out that I felt cheated. I think Beatty did a fantastic job in his portrayal of Clyde, but I couldn't help but think the casting of Dunaway was made in error. Yes, she is a fine actress, but at their deaths, Clyde was 24 years old and Bonnie was 23. I couldn't help but notice how much older Dunaway appears in the film in comparison to Beatty.

From the beginning, movies have always, I repeat, always taken liberty with facts. So unlike some earlier reviews, I was not disappointed that the movie skipped some facts. But I was disappointed in the movie itself. The critics have built this movie into one of \\"The Great Ones\\". Yes, the movie is rich in the technical areas, but I don't think the movie could decide whether to glorify them or to demonstrate how self destructive and crime obsessed they were. It was all I could do to finish the move."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Art","review":"Mr. Bonesteel characterized this movie as art. I'd have to agree with that because art is entirely subjective. However, his statement about these two hoods being heroes to the people at the time is not accurate (more misinformation from the movie). B&C rarely robbed banks. In fact, they robbed mom-and-pop stores and stole people's cars. A couple of times Clyde killed \\"pop\\" in the process. This killing of innocents, as well as law enforcement, did not endear them to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was sensational during its time (1967) but in the 21st century, it\`s not good.","review":"First of all, I believe the director did not intent to make this movie truthful. That\`s why many scenes were completely fictional. Secondly, I understand it was released in 1967 when anti-war and anti-establishment sentiments were the norm. Yes, it was a very violent movie during that time but compared to R-rated movies these days, it\`s like a PG13.I'm glad I borrowed this from my local library instead of purchasing it.Overall, it\`s not an interesting film. At least, it does not depict Bonnie and Clyde as Robin Hoods.

I think we need more good quality movies like this! I never owned the VHS or DVD so I can't really say how much of an improvement the PQ is, but for a movie made in 1967 you would never be able to tell with the Blu-ray. Some people don't like the packaging, but I really like it. It's got a 34 page book filled with lots of fun trivia, and the movie case is literally shaped like a book!

It's a cheaply made deck of playing cards (I can buy poker cards of higher quality for $2.00!)

I would definitely recommend picking this up if you're into TMBG or some of the bands on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why!?","review":"Wow. When you look at the songs on this CD you see a list of TMBG gold. I'm astonished at how the bands who covered them could turn them into complete garbage. Nearly all of the bands have a terribly generic sound, the opposite of what TMBG is about. Recepter, Jason Trachtenburg, The Wrens and OK Go pretty much made me hate them for their covers. They're by far the worst tracks on a terrible album. They drastically changed their songs with horrendous results. I'm not saying that all of the songs are bad, though. Steve Burns, Self and Frank Black have some very good takes on classic TMBG on here. They're the only songs that stand out as decent, and sadly could not save this project.The bottom line is, if you like They Might Be Giants, chances are you'll hate this. I advise you go to Itunes and buy the individual song for each one you think sounds good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This CD was so highly rated that I couldn't wait to receive it. When it came, I was extremely disappointed. My niece (of whom I have custody) is struggling with her math facts for school, a necessary promotion standard, and we really need help, but she hates the songs, and quite frankly, so do I. I thought they'd be fun and catchy, but they are cheesey and tedious. The \\"Hip-Hop\\" claim is quite questionable. . . . We also purchased Schoolhouse Rock, and it is by far a better investment.

However, setting and changing the playback stations is so tedious and time consuming that I have to give low marks to features and ease of use. Worse, the effort does not pay off. I tried the unit in a VW Jetta, Jeep Liberty, Honda CRV and Toyota Corolla and was never able to get acceptable sound. Radio static is the main problem, but compared to FM stations, the dynamic range is very short, with clipped high and rumbling lows. Noise that the car radios do not usually pick up, like from power lines and vehicle ignitions, is amplified. The experience is like listening to a cheap AM car radio from the 1950s.

You can use the ifm with a protective case. And I just clip the little base unit onto my ipod armband.This is one of the two accessories I use regularly from Griffin Technolgy (the other is the itrip).

It's never skipped in ESP mode, and I'm still on my first set of batteries (it takes 6 D) after a few months of use.Radio reception is good, and the antenna swivels. The bass ports on the back have rubber padding, so you can also sit the unit on its back for an even smaller footprint (but it doesn't sound as good).Finally, it has a sleek, futuristic pod look that will turn heads, especially if you walk around with it up on your shoulder, blasting some Jay-Z, as I am prone to do in my neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good little boom box","review":"I bought one of these right when they came out because I wanted a mp3 playing boom box that could take some abuse. After a year of carting it around in my pick up from worksite to worksite, its held up quite well even after being dropped and rained on a few times. I've had no problems playing mp3 cd-r's (burnt on my old mac with toast) except for 'chirping' on an occassional tune. My major complaint with it is that it eats up the D cells when playing cds. Now I carry the AC adapter in my glove box and use it when not just listening to the radio. The sound is decent given its small size and light weight. My only complaint with the controls is when scrolling through my station presets, I always use the toggle the wrong way (you have to toggle down to go up, rather upside down, I believe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly rich sound","review":"I love everything about this boombox.

We are returning the unit because we use the AC power much more than batteries - we can't imagine lugging this brick with us everywhere! Too bad because we liked everything else about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the others' reviews","review":"Bought this unit because it was a good price and really wanted a portable MP3 boombox. It should not be called a boombox, as it certainly is incapable of booming. I work in a fairly noisy production area, and only can hear this player by being next to it, a problem I think is due to being strictly a 9-volt system. Also, like all the other reviews, the MP3 loves to screech on the slightest hint of haze or dust, much more on an honest scratch or fingerprint. Embarassing. Wish I'd bought another selection, but the design is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mp3 does not work that well","review":"Purchased this unit a couple of weeks ago and had to send it back. First of all the sound was only so-so. I was not too surprised since the speakers are of an average quality but i have heard better from similar speakers.The unit has a 10sec buffer for antiskip which was nice except when it came to playing my mp3 CD's it would skip the first 10sec of the track and start playng with the counter starting from zero. I tried several mp3 encoded CD's and they all did it even though they CD's would work fine on my Riovolt SP250. The replacement unit did the same as well.Close but no cigar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller is a Thief","review":"Sony Boombox failed after 20 minutes.

I tried 2 units because I really wanted it to work but the mp3 playback was horrible. Random screeching sounds were very common and note the word random (it isn't my disk). I returned it and bought a mp3 boombox for half the price and it works great. It doesn't look as cool and unfortunately it doesn't get quite as loud. However, it is playing my mp3's perfectly and that is what I really wanted. Good luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wayy overpriced","review":"I found a deal on this one at a local store. Compared it against many other Sony products and other brands as well. This had a horribly small tinny sound. For the price, I would expect more, although this plays mp3s. The sony cfd-s20cp sounded somewhat better and is much cheaper. The cfd-s20cp doesn't look as nice, but then again this zs-x3cp looks kindof dumb to me. And it has a cheapy feel to it, which is probably partly because it is lightweight (transformer is in plug and not the actual device).I didn't like the button layout either, but I haven't seen anyone do a very good job on this yet. It's ironic that car stereos have one heck of an intuitive layout in about 10 square inches, and Sony can only make it worse when the real estate on top of the unit grows by 10x over the car stereo.If you are set on paying this much for a boombox, I would suggest JVC RC-BM5 or . If you want the same device for less, I would suggest sony cfd-s20cp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek looking, but ......","review":"This unit claims to play MP3 discs, but it would not read the home-computer created CD-R or CD-RW MP3 discs that I have no trouble playing on either my Rio portable or Pioneer DVD players. I took some sample discs to a Circuit City store and tried them out unsuccessfully on a display model. Allowing for the possibility of a defective or broken display, I went to a second Circuit City store and got the same results there. They had a store-copy, commercially produced (by MP3.com) sample disc that worked just fine, but none of my Roxio or Adaptec burned CD-Rs or CD-RWs had any function. So, if you like creating your own MP3 compilation discs, and you're looking for a portable box unit that will play them --- this one's NOT for you!Also, there are no tone controls or equalizer pre-sets to choose from on this player. Except for the bass boost, one sound setting fits all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I have two complaints.1. I was completely unsatisfied with MP3 playback. Long Load times and a terrible shuffle contributed to this problem. I bought the player for mp3 cds and after the first week I wasnt even using them.2. After owning the player for six months and never putting it through a high stress environment CDs stopped working. The player would continue to play on low volumes but at normal volumes the player turned off after 15-20 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware MP3 CD-RW faults","review":"I was surprised to find that this Sony box was not able to play a particular ordinary CD-RW with about 65 MP3s written on it. (It was able to play a different one with about 150 MP3s.) A much cheaper unit was able to play both CDs, but skipped, which was what brought me to look at this one.Loading the CD-RW with 65 MP3s caused the unit to spin up, show that it was reading an MP3 disc, count to 65, and then suddenly shut itself off when it should have started playing. Two different units in two different stores showed this exact behavior. I was unable to figure out what the difference was between the two CD-RWs that caused this to happen.Bottom line: buyer beware! This unit looks cool and the navigation works well, but it could easily end up disappointing you when you bring it home to play your MP3s.

Every picture shows a landscape or an interior white with the dust of Carrara's exceptionally pure marble; stonecutters white with the dust; even some pictures where you can't tell whether it's fog or dust in the air, or whether it's snow or dust on the rooftops. Carrara is the source of marble for some of the most revered works of sculpture in the Western canon: Michelangelo's David and the Pieta; Bernini's busts, St. Teresa, and hundreds more. To see it all as essentially an industrial process, and to see the people who have given their lives to quarrying this rock, is beautiful, bitter, and moving. There's also a great essay at the back by an Australian anthropologist, which is well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"way to complicated","review":"I read the instructions on this product and never even took it out of the box.

This book not only covers the basics which are important, but also touches on possible diseases of African Greys, and details \\"what to look for\\" in a number of scenarios to help ensure your grey's health. This book is something you must own and perused again as situations may occur with your bird. And remember, greys (parrots) have only been domesticated two generations which still leaves the tag of wild for quite some time (way beyond our lifetimes), so we will always be learning and adapting new techniques, finding diseases (and hopefully proper vaccinations in the future, etc., etc.).

Not only are the new scenes obviously poorly sliced in , you can tell the difference in the film and the surroundings.

Boy was I wrong. The first thing I noticed when I slipped the disc in was a new musical score that replaces the orginal. This score is so overbearing that it completely detracts from the images on the screen. It is an ABOMINATION! I removed the disc after five minutes and immediately placed it up for auction. Thank God I found a willing buyer. By far the best version on DVD is the Elite Entertainment DVD. It should be considered the definitive version of the film on DVD. There's a reason why the Elite version is frequently on backorder and the Anchor Bay 30th Anniversary edition is always in stock...the Anchor Bay version is pathetic!

Turn your back on this one, Horror fans and see the B&W version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"Will give you the chills. A landmark horror movie; the film that made horror movies scary again. The black-and-white photography may be a sign of its low-budget, but it's also a nice effect and gives the movie a memorable touch. The sight of zombies surrounding the house is eerie. A purposely frustrating ending adds to the psycholigical terror.As for the bonus feature, \\"Night of the Living Bread\\", it's pretty dumb. I thought it had one funny scene (how the girl kept falling over and over), but that's it. Still, it's not a bad extra.

George just gathered alot of zombies or ghouls and well that made you either extremely scared to the point of wetting yourself or in my case you yelled oh Sh*t!

The new score that has been added sounds like terrible last-minute MIDI crap and the extra scenes have no relevance or point at all as they are filmed just before it was put on the dvd [I'm guessing '97?]. The extra ending actually has a character overcome being a zombie? Yeah, really stupid, I know. I recently bought a plain ordinary edition of Night of the Living Dead for 10$ or so and I recommend you just do that or get the Millenium Edition everyone is raving about.

Trust me on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good horror movie","review":"This is with difference the best zombie horror movie ever made, from the moment we see the first zombie, until the siege to the house. The black and white makes the movie more mysterious, because you never know what's going to happen after. Maybe for problems in the budget the story seems incomplete when one of the character, explains what did he saw when zombies attack a truck. I wish we could see that scene (if it exists). Years after they made the remake, good enough, but not as George A Romero's original. If you want a good zombie movie buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Definitive Edition !","review":"I just picked up this new Elite Millennium Edition today and I am impressed to say the least.

It is a real shame when you see people who should be digging ditches or flipping burgers somewhere getting money to make a film. The additional scenes and new music score in this version of NOTLD made me cry.

I really looked forward to new scenes (which I thought were cut from the original move, not added at a later date). While the new scenes at the beginning helped to explain the beginning of the movie, it didn't make up for the footage cut. After viewing the entire movie, I was absolutely devastated that I had wasted my money on this assault on one of my favorite movies of all times. The new score also grated on me after about 5 minutes. I will be giving away this [DVD] as soon as possible. I appreciate the recommendations about the Elite edition - I think I'll check that out. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE VERSION","review":"This is one of the worst transfers of Night of the Living Dead I have ever seen. It looks to me like this was an old 16mm educational print that was \\"reamastered\\" (read re-transferred) to DVD to avoid copyright violation of re-releasing someone else's videomaster. For those who don't know, NOLTD is in public domain and these pirates are releasing the film without compensating the filmmakers for their hard work.

Anyway Johnny gets what was coming to him and Barbara gets away and runs to a nearby farmhouse where Ben(Duane Jones)helps board down the doors and windows to keep the flesh eaters out. later on they find out there were five people in the basement hiding. The whole plot is seven people in an isolated farmhouse trying to stay out of reach of the flesh eating ghouls outside the house for the night.

I only gave this one star because the computer kicked it back without a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has John Russo lost his mind!","review":"Really, NOTLD was a great movie, you cannot improve upon greatness, so don't try. I know John Russo worked on the screenplay to the first NOTLD, but he should have left it alone. All the talent must have been from the great George A. Romero. John Russo should stick to skin filcks like his Santa Calws and Scream Queen's Naked Christmas where nobody cares about a story line. Leave the classics to someone who knows what they are doing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Color??? That'll be the death of this movie!","review":"Black and White made the atmosphere of this Romero classic perfect. Even on some levels, the Black and White helped in the racial undertones that you feel in the movie where the black man is the hero for the scared white people in the farmhouse. But colorized?The effects work in B&W.; In color they'll just look campy.This was a bad marketing idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars - about as scary as a cartoon","review":"I have no idea how this film ever made it to cult status. I thought it might have been taken as a \\"turkey\\" - an unintentional comedy because of its dismal production values, 8 mm film quality, and 20$ reel to reel tape recorder audio standards. No! There are people who actually find this frightening. I want their names so that I won't have them around me during a real crisis - they would probably fall apart. I don't get this film. A group of ugly actors stumble around trying to act like zombies. Occasionally, they eat meat -pretending it is human flesh. It isn't scary. It is simply a low budget, drive in movie that might have filled the third slot of a late night triple feature. The story could be told in 30 seconds. Horribly bad. And I don't mean so bad that it is campy and funny. Just horribly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong one - don't waste your time with this","review":"I wouldn't waste my time on this one, don't get confused like me - the one we're all looking for says \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\" and \\"2 Disc Set\\" or \\"No B.S.\\" in the title and description.

Mr. \\"I Co-wrote 'Night of the Living Dead,' So How Come I'm Not Famous?\\" managed to convince the other original backers of the film to do this 30th Anniversary edition (a year late, by the way, for the actual 30th anniversary of the movie!), found some old B&W film stock, and has shot 20 minutes of new footage that makes no sense and detracts from the film's pacing. Worse yet, he's CUT 15 minutes of footage that adds character and depth to the film, plus he's added an awful, uninspired pop-rock soundtrack by the ludicrous Scott Vladimir Licina. Licina and Z-movie strumpette Debbie Rochon (Troma's \\"Tromeo & Juliet\\") are featured in an epilogue that is more embarrassing than enlightening. See what George Lucas started? At least George Romero was smart enough to wash his hands of this entire sorry mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if it's on sale for a buck!","review":"Night of the Living Dead is a classic horror film, this is just awful. 15 minutes of useless, badly done, amaturish footage has been added and to compensate, they REMOVE character driven dialogue pieces. The special features don't make up for it either, an annoyingly pointless music video, a inane documentary and commentary from John A. Russo, the man responsable for this tragedy. If you need to own NOTLD on DVD, go buy the far superior version that was released a few years back that has not been so horribly violated. Please, don't even buy it out of curiosity...even if it's on sale for a buck...DON'T BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"blasphemy","review":"This 30th anniversary version of NOTLD is a grotesque and venal deconstruction. Here is one of the few truly great horror films ever made; yet John Russo &co. thought it needed improving. So they cut out some of the \\"slow\\" scenes and inserted several new ones. The result is an unqualified disaster. These new segments--talky, poorly shot, and poorly acted --subvert all the carefully built-up rhythms of the original. And speaking of rhythms: the new musical score by Scott Vladimir Licina does have a certain eerie, languid beauty; but it's all wrong for this film, and often--as, for example, in the early cemetary sequence--works at cross-purposes with the images it's supposed to be enhancing. I bought this video figuring that there must be something here worth seeing. What I saw instead was a shameless act of cinematic violation. It isn't even worthy to be laughed at--only ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly repugnant embarrassment for Russo and Anchor Bay.","review":"I am a filmmaker and fan of NOTLD. I have never been so offended by a \\"special edition\\" of a film in all my life. The new scenes are poorly acted and edited, the new score is a laughable MIDI nightmare of its own, and the sound mix has been worsened by bad sync and poorer sound effects quality than the original back in 1968. To those who willingly particpated in this travesty- shame on all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so George! Zombies must be behind this","review":"You'd be much better off buying Madacy Entertainment's poor-quality,budget-minded version. At least that version maintains the integrity ofGeorge Romero's vision. Anchor Bay's so-called \\"expanded and enhanced\\" version consists of 15 minutes of the most horrible acting in the history of American cinema. The new \\"score\\" doesn't score at all. Worse yet (and that's saying a lot), the DD 5.1 soundtrack relies too much on the center-channel giving the new dialogue (HA!) an unrealistic \\"tinniness\\". The transfer quality shows signs of neglect near the bottom of the screen in certain sequences. Buyer beware: spend your ducats wisely. Purchase the THX Digitally Mastered Elite Entertainment version of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" rather than this. Long live DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a travesty. DO NOT BUY THIS.","review":"The original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a true classic. This is John Russo's incredibly lame attempt to milk more more from the project that he was clearly the weak link in. George Romero has told Russo that he will not badmouth this version because they are friends, so Romero remains silent on the issue. I think that says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only version worth buying is the millenium edition","review":"I've had to go thru the many copies of NOTLD before icam across the millenium edition. This is by far the only version of NOTLD worth spending bucks on. I know there are 3 dollar version floating around, but they lack what the millenium edition has which is George Romeros blessing. Not only do you get awesome quality transfer but you als get a few commentary tracks, interviews, and other goodies included. In my opinion \\"Night\\" is the best of the dead trilogy. Unfortunately too many lackluster versions of this classic are being sold. Truth is you get what you pay for when buying a copy of night. This might be the more expensive version but it's the one that captures the films greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Night of the Living Dead","review":"This film stands as one of the top three or four horror (terror, thank you, Boris Karloff) films of all time. Its appeal lies in its psychological horror/terror, which is often unnerving. The \\"amatuerish\\" quality of the cinematography is a coup, making it less of staged movie and more of a realistic experience caught on tape. Who can deny the absolute terror of the opening scenes where the girl is trying to escape from a nightmare most of us have never dared dream? I agree with another reviewer who commented on the socio-politcal issues of racism, sexism, and other -isms. Sure, the film works at its primary level--to view others worse off than ourselves and make us greatful for our own sense of security. Good horror films function for us in much the same way tragedy served the ancient Greeks, to purge us of fears and to arouse us to pity--more or less. Watch and enjoy, but be prepared for a long night with the characters fighting for sanity and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know where some cliches come from!","review":"Wow. This movie is better than I expected. It starts out so goofey! \\"They're coming for you, Barbara!\\" And Barbara is such a silly chicklett. But still, it's good, there's a reason it's a classic. The plot is clumsy, the attempts at science laughable even then, the acting is from the Charlton Heston/Captain Kirk school. But it still has that something special."},{"rating":"1","title":"filth of the lowest order","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is TERRIBLE. Being a fan of the genre I was ecstatic to see a special edition version of NOTLD. Little did I know that the so called \\"never before seen footage\\" would consist of below b-movie acting writing and direction, as well as a dead ringer for Anton LaVey posing as a priest. The same Anton LaVey lookalike who is responible for BUTCHERING the original score. The bonus soundtrack cd isn't even the original spooky score! It's the worst kind of MIDIfied noodling with no emotion behind it whatsover. Stay far away from this. Far, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthless pile of garbage","review":"Kudos to Anchor Bay for remastering the original footage (which is even sharper and clearer than Elite's version) but the lousy new synth score and stupid, pointless, badly acted new scenes are a case lesson in how you can take a classic and turn it into a turd.And John Russo, the talentless co-writer of the original NIGHT and the director of the new scenes for this new NIGHT, says, \\"This is what we wanted to do originally.\\"If that's so, I imagine the conversation between Russo and George Romero in 1968 during the production went like this:John Russo: Hey George, wouldn't it be cool if we added a subplot with a bald-headed geek as a priest and two gravediggers at the beginning?George Romero: No, John. That's stupid.Any self-respecting film fan should avoid submitting themselves to this catastrophic butchery of a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE DEAD HAVE A REASON TO WALK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Simply put....DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS VERSION! John Russo has ruined a classic film(oh the humanity!)

I'm amazed the original group involved w/ the movie (excluding George) could ever do what was done to this. The new scenes are unwatchable. In the commentary they babble on on how seamless they are implemented. But they don't discuss how BADLY they were acted. I gave this \\"new\\" movie two stars for the following, ONE: Clarity, TWO: the music is great but it doesn't fit with the feel I've known this movie to possess.

Reason being, the idea itself is the most disappointing aspect: \\"hey let's take our little classic and ruin it!\\" I am pleased to see George Romero had nothing to do with this experiment. And that's exactly what it is to me, an experiment that was bound to fail from its very inception. But I was very eager to watch it with an open mind, knowing full well it will never replace the original masterpiece--in my heart OR on late-night Halloween tv airings. It's a good alternative to those of us who know the original line-by-line, shot-by-shot but I still heartily recommend purchasing the Elite company's remastered (and unchanged) edition that was released in 1995."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of money.","review":"I'm sorry...They have spoiled this classic film with a new score that sounds like it's from 1981, and terrible new scenes that don't fit in at all with the original film.

Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother travel to their father's grave, and soon after they arrive, Johnny the brother is killed. Then Barbara flees to a nearby house, and takes refuge with some other people including Keith Wayne, Duane Jones, Karl Hardman, Judith Ridley, and Marilyn Eastman. Then, one by one, they are killed by zombies obsessed with eating their flesh. Disturbing film, and unhappy ending. The zombies are scary, and the daughter-turned-to zombie sequence is frightening. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good for it's time","review":"This movie was a classic if I may say so for it's time. It was unlike the other movies being produced in the 60's. I was especially surprised with the naked zombies though. It kept me on the edge of my seat a few times.

The new soundtrack is bearable at best, but detracts from the edgy feel of the original.

Apparently it is somewhat difficult to find a decent rendering of this movie, but at all costs avoid this one. Simply put, there is new footage and new music that RUINS the original. To me, it looks like some idiot goth kids wanted to have bit parts in their favorite movie from high school and decided, hey, let's create all new characters and dialogue for the 30th anniversary edition. In fact, the awful new music is composed by the same guy (Scott Vladimir Licina) who played the worst new character, Reverend Hicks.

Romero's Classic","review":"This is a classic and really the grand-daddy of the modern zombie movies. \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" is the most serious of the Romero Quartet (Night, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead & Land of the Dead). Night, like Robert Wise's \\"The Haunting\\", is shot in B/W, and this adds dramatically to the feel of the film. Compare the B/W version to the colorized version and it's clear which one is more cinematically creative (the former!!). Well scripted and acted, Night is a must see during the Halloween season. The end sequence is the most disturbing - not gore-filled or scary, but disturbing - in the way the end of American History X is disturbing (racial prejudice being at the heart of both!). If you want a more \\"fun\\" zombie movie I suggest Dawn of the Dead - some really hilarious social commentaries on consumer America, or try the more recent and splendid homage to the living dead movies, Shaun of the Dead! 4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic from the master","review":"This was the first movie showing the \\"modern zombie\\".

Really.","review":"Although his name appears in the credits, George Romero was in no way involved with this project. The new footage doesn't match the original. Despite a mountain of makeup, Bill Hinzman looks much older than his first incarnation of the cemetary zombie. What was he thinking? New cuts and fades, intended to improve the pacing of the film, seem premature and at times omit valuable dialogue. The prologue and epilogue add little importance overall,the main addition being a religious subplot which frames the entire story. Licina's newly recored soundtrack reminds me of bad MIDI files imbedded in somebody's web page.

This scoreis so overbearing that it completely detracts from the images on thescreen. It is an ABOMINATION! I removed the disc after five minutesand immediately placed it up for auction. Thank God I found a willingbuyer. By far the best version on DVD is the Elite EntertainmentDVD. It should be considered the definitive version of the film onDVD. There's a reason why the Elite version is frequently on backorderand the Anchor Bay 30th Anniversary edition is always in stock...theAnchor Bay version is pathetic!

I used to watch Psycho with all the crackling and lines and such, but when I bought the DVD I was amazed at how much the print was cleaned up.

Sure, you may pay a few dollars more-- but Romero did NOT authorize this re-edited disk. Besides, the picture quality is far superior on the Elite disk. The one star rating is for the \\"30th Anniversary\\" edition only. Otherwise, the film gets FIVE stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"3D Night of Living Dead (2-D & 3-D Versions Included)","review":"The 3-d has to be used with some special razor 3d glasses reg 3D glasses dont work.

There's some good amateur acting and some violence and gore, but there's also a strong plot and an incredibly tense atmosphere. George A. Romero, like Alfred Hitchcock, plays his audience like a piano.This DVD by (shudder) Madacy has lousy picture quality and wafer thin sound. The extras (trivia game, biography, poster art) are typical of Madacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror as horror is meant to be","review":"An absolte must to own if you are a fan of horror.

Buyers Beware of the Horror","review":"[...]The five star rating I gave Night of the Living Dead is, of course, for the original, uncut, unadulterated edition. The original is, quite simply, the most terrifying movie I've ever seen, even when compared to horror classics like Diabolique (the original French version), Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Halloween and The Shining. I saw NOTLD when I was 9 years old on Creature Features at midnight after a funeral. I had nightmares for the next two nights. The film still gives me the chills whenever I see it (usually at Halloween)."},{"rating":"2","title":"night of the living dead 1968","review":"Is a classic in the horror for those who like George A. Romero movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living Dead finally dies","review":"Let the buyer beware: While this disc contains two versions of the 1968 horror classic, both are ersatz. One version is a \\"special\\" edition, with newly shot footage concocted by one cowriter and one coproducer (director George A. Romero was not involved in any way). Aside from being unforgivably shoddy and stupid, the new footage also diminishes the original's claustrophobic menace. The other version presents the film as it was intended--except that it replaces the original's cheesy, library-derived score with a cheesier original one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Scum","review":"A shameful rip-off of all the original film's fans by John Russo. The new footage is Amateur Hour & unnecessary, the new acting is pathetic & this DVD abomination should be shunned by everyone, old fans & new audiences wondering what all the classic fuss is about. (After I threw it across the room, my puppy even poohed on it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother with this version","review":"I just picked up this version of night of living dead. I already have all the other special editions of the film, However this one had a commentary from Mike Nelson from Mystey Science Theater 3000 which i figured would be quite funny. Much to my suprise the quality of the film was about the same as my old VHS version, and the commentary was just rotten he tried so hard to be funny but he fell flat no humor at all. Such a waste!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo-o-o-o-ring","review":"This is perhaps the worst movie ever made.If you want to see a real cult classic, buy The Little Shop Of Horrors(the original) or Robot Monster. Heck, even The Creeping Terror is better. The actors and actresses are very dumb and can't even act. The screenplay looks like it was written by a 6 year old. Don't make the mistake of buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stupid piece of trash","review":"This ia a movie about zombies who surround a farm in search of human flesh.

Dis-orienting, unscary, mess of sloppy and unimpressive effects with no entertainment value at all. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT looks like a good time compared to this movie. BOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie movies are a lot like zombies...","review":"All right, now I am no fan of zombie movies, but if anything I suppose there has to be some limited appreciation for this, Romero's film which some say 'started this whole zombie thing'. As such, I do appreciate that Romero understands there is more to fright then gore. In fact, as far as I am concerned the focus is all on those inside the house, with yes that memory about what lurks outside.Still though, I just do not see anything too particularly enthralling about zombies. I mean, they are zombies with zombiesqe movements and zombiesh attitudes. This means they are slow and boring. Now as I mentioned, Romero helped alleviate this, but I still, with my clear anti-zombie bias, am not a fan of this film. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of Bad Men, Bad Women, and Bad Places","review":"After reading LaSalle and the Discovery of the Great West, I began to look for more information on LaSalle's camp on Matagorda Bay. I bought this book for the chapter on LaSalle. The rest of the book is a collection of Texas stories, many of which seem true. The book did have a few J Frank Dobie type tales. The tales cross the entire state and cover most time periods, from LaSalle all the way to Bonnie and Clyde. The book has also given me a few short stories on Texas towns that I have driven through for years. I recommend this book to all who enjoy the lighter side of Texas History."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that it works","review":"I bought the book and the DVD. It actualy works.

Yes, you need someone to check your form, so I ordered the drill cards too - that way the \\"coach\\" can look at the drill card right there at the pool and check form. The DVD gives you the visual and verbal cues to aid in learning. I would watch 2-4 drills, go apply in the pool, then add on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much and too little","review":"...Too much money for too little product. This overpriced DVD comes in short (about 30 minutes) and cheap. (You're not going to believe the shoddy production values). While it is useful to see good to great swimmers executing Mr. Laughlin's techniques, there is no info on correcting common problems for the rest of us. C'mon Terry, you've been teaching for over 20 years. What about a \\"5 most common mistakes\\" section that could help the rest of us along? Also, while it shows the recommended drills, there is surprisingly little on linking the drills to actual swimming. Most of the demonstrations don't show the swimmers even breathing but rather holding their breath as they execute the drills. (Yeah, I know, Sweet Spot - but that hardly shows how to link strokes, particularly for alternate side breathing). Also, unless my DVD player has developed hiccups, the disc itself has got problems - There were a number of stutters and \\"freezes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Content - Bad First Impression","review":"After reading the TI book and not getting too far, I thought that I'd try the video so I could actually see how the drills should be done. When I unpacked the video I was fairly shocked to see that my not-very-cheap DVD came in an el-cheapo paper slip cover. After loading the DVD I was equally surprised by the cheesy music and videography.Overall, I think that the content of the video was excellent, but I definitely expected a higher quality production based on the relatively high price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not put it all together","review":"The DVD is like a novel where the plot is going along and then the author just seem to run out of pages without a satisfactory conclusion. The DVD gives the student all the drills but never tells you how to put it together in a freestyle stroke. Perhaps later editions will go the extra chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELPFUL SWIMMING VIDEO","review":"I read the book first and felt like I needed to see the drills demonstrated in action. The video makes a good complement to the book. I feel that you need both to benefit from the system.

However, he makes an irresistible and compelling case that the LDS perspective and doctrine is the one closest to the original beliefs of the first Christians. It is amazing how much early Christian doctrine is ignored, hidden, or glossed over by other writers. I can testify from personal experience that this book DOES cause major heartburn to Evangelicals in the same way the Bible does and it is a major faith promoter of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The death of Sola Scriptura by it's own hand is evidenced in the form of this book. A must for every Christian library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to listen to while watching whales die","review":"In the 1970s and 1980s I bought most of the ECM catalog as albums were released.

It is a very easy installation, just pop off the filter cover for the old one and slip these pre-oiled filters in. Great for a car's lifetime. Two words of caution though: 1) buy the cleaner and oil kit because you will need it to clean the filter after about 5000 - 7000 miles and 2) make sure you install the filter correctly. The filter has a curved corner that matches perfectly with the filter box. If you are not attentive, you might not align it correctly and close the box without a good seal. I'm sure the instructions might tell you this, I never took the time, but I guess I had enough time to install it twice. After about 1000 miles, it seems to increase the fuel efficiency, but don't expect dilythium crystal - like increases/savigns.

Robin Pilcher's work provides nothing but doom and gloom, with stiffly written characters, forced plot lines, inconclusive and feeble endings, and a boring storyline. I read this entire book because I kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately it did not improve. I find Pilcher's writing stilted and his characters shallow.

Johnny is joined by trumpeter Dave Burns and a rhythm section led by Norman Simmons. They stretch out Tadd Dameron's Good Bait to 12 mins and split the ballad You've Changed, with Simmons not being heard in solo on this track. That first track is a brief introduction by Babs and he returns for some briefer comments- so it's 5 tunes for 40 min or so, not 6.---- A little known Johnny Griffin sideman session is vibeist Johnny Lytle's NICE AND EASY session from 1962. Bobby Timmons was the pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"on a whim","review":"I heard The Alrights play at a halloween party of all places and was struck by their originality of sound and how each song has it's own eclectic style to it, so that not one song is similar.

My favorite track is \\"The Sickness\\", and recommend everyone to buy the album just for that specific song."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Makes You Want More!","review":"These guys are amazing. Their ability to harmonize would make you think they were linked by blood. I love the tightness of their sound, the drummer keeps it clean and going strong. Toby's lyrics are poetic, raw, inspiring and, if you have the pleasure of seeing a live show, full of dark humor. The depth of their music abilities is impressive-something for everyone. And I love how this cd flows, it takes you on a wonderful journey of emotions-passion, anger, cynicism, and joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album","review":"is very close to the excitement of seeing these guys live.

Unfortunately, this book gives little to no details about their inovations (except for vague descriptions)and focuses instead mostly on the personalities involved. We are repeatedly (unendingly) told about how brillant and incredible they are while getting only an occasional superficial token look at what they did. Granted, there is room for other books than \\"how to\\" manuals, but I really hoped to come away from this book with at least a few ideas to try. It is a book about inventors after all. Where are the inventions? For me....a waste of money. Wait until you can check it out of the library.

And, as you will read from some of the other comments here, Kasparov's analysis and game review is outstanding, with very few blemishes (caught by other reviewers on here so no need to rehash them). Overall this is a GREAT BOOK, worthy of placement in anybody's collection. But, as the competitive chess world is also a gauntlet of political machinery, to get \\"to the top\\" you have to appease the \\"powers that be.\\" Some of the politics associated with other players was painted with rosey paint, others, a bit too hard, layered too thick. Every author has their own viewpoint and perspective, including Kasparov. Perhaps it was some of these comments that caused Fischer to recently challenge the current FIDE World Chess Champion, Topalov, to a match. And, as reported online at [...] maybe we will soon see Kasparov and Fischer play a match after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kasparov is just a lot of talk !","review":"Plain & simple, Kasparov has super computers doing all the work on finding Fischer mistakes in this book. Computers are the steroids of chess. Todays players cannot be judged equally because of this. Fischer, and prior chess masters, had only their minds and that is why they will continue to be known as the greatest natural players of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too opinionated","review":"Kasparov is very bias with his assessments. He should have been more neutral. Being a Russian, I guess you can say he is bias toward Bobby. I was looking for more than what was offered. I liked volume 1 the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fischer Afraid???","review":"A large supposition of Kasparov is that Fischer was \\"afraid\\" of Spassky, hence his argumentative and demanding behavior prior to the match. He was not afraid of any Russian. He, like many who strive for perfection, was afraid of his own shortcomings and possible failure. The fact that he not only overcame his inner trepidation to beat Spassky but that he did so with the roots of a severe mental illness present, clearly demonstrates without question that he was--The Greatest Champion. He not only overcame the Russians but also himself. He would have destroyed Karpov."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"We were assigned this book for a contemporary art history class. From the very first page there are typos, a missing chapter 8 (the last chapter), poor quality images and misspellings which could change the course of art history (ok, at least our grades) Just incredibly annoyed to have spent the money on this 'new' version while the students who have 20 year old copies are in far better shape than those of us who purchased this one. In all, the information in it is untrustworthy as its a transcribed (poorly) version of a classic art history book. This version from kessinger library reprints is inferior to other copies i have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading and very informative!","review":"Hi Linda!

It seems the tried to cram a lot of information in this book however, all the information is just a breif summary. While there were a few good tips to use in the book, I found the training advice to be way too breif. This book would have been a lot better if they would have been more detailed about the training and cut out some other information that just made the book seem cluttered and unfocused."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst SF book I've ever read.","review":"This is without a doubt the worst SF book I ever read. As a previous reviewer stated: It's a mind-numbingly tedious description of nothing happening. You keep thinking that the story will have a point but it never does. I felt so cheated at the end of the book that I literally threw it across the room in disgust.The main points in this book could easily have been published as a short-story. There is not enough plot to justify a novel.I normally like Aldiss's books, but this one made me swear off of him for quite a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Previous Editions!","review":"After purchasing this book for the past several years, I must voice distress with the 2004 edition.

The story is made memorable (and frequently hilarious) by John Gregory Dunne's chuckle-a-page expositions of Irish Catholic foibles. Lt. Tom Spellacy of the LAPD, a semi-corrupt but competent detective, jousts with his partner, his superiors in the department, and his brother, the Rt. Rev. Msr. Desmond Spellacy, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Dunne is to Irish Catholics as Philip Roth is to Eastern European Jews, and \\"True Confessions\\" is Dunne's \\"Goodbye Columbus\\"--a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Really a Mystery Novel","review":"True Confessions is so well written that you may not realize that the apparent lack of style IS the style. No flowery prose, not a wasted word. Expert craftsmanship.Other reviewers have described the book as a mystery story. No such thing. The mystery is a MacGuffin, and the plot itself is just a device to, first, gradually reveal to us the characters, and, then, subject each of them to self-revelation and growth.Although there is much irony and many clever bon mots in the story, its overall tone is bleak. I give it only four stars because its lack of sunlight mars our acceptance of it as reality. The film, on the other hand - an excellent adaptation - contains perhaps too much sunlight.Summary: a great read, but don't hang your interest on its being a detective story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raunch.","review":"After talking to friends (one said she stopped after 40 pages) who were reviled by the language and images in the book I decided not to read it. There are too many great books to read without wasting time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him. Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring. However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better. Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like advertized","review":"I have these Memorex CD-RW and Sony CD-RW.

Just as discipline with physical aspects of our health and well-being, so is discipline required mentally and psychologically to ensure that we focus on productive thoughts and positive thoughts and feelings. Ultimately the invisible and unseen manifests into the physical and very real aspects our lives.In a number of chapters the author argues his case clearly about the impact and effect of thought of man. I consider this book to be the forerunner of The Secret. It deals with the law of attraction and the law of action.

Your higher thoughts pull you toward what is pure and real and your base thoughts draw you into immoral conduct and inhibit your spiritual release to fulfillment. This relationship of thought upon action impacts the companions with whom you associate and determines who is drawn to you and whom you repel. This edition destroys the simple read and truth of the words by pulling text out and seeking to emphasize portions to an extent not intended in the original version.

It has sat on the shelf for years without me reading it. I picked it up the other day and read it in about half an hour. I now understand the significance of this book, even though it was written long ago. This book truly makes one look at how they've lived their life, their thoughts, and actions. Each of us has room for improvement, that's what life is about. We have all undoubtedly errored in our judgement, or in how we have treated others, and had to live with the consequences. This book brings contemplation of these subjects and others to the surface of our minds. This is not a how-to book. It is also not a hell-fire and brimstone, shame inducing book.

It wasn't that I have never seen nor heard the main crux of the substance that Allen is putting across here, but I have to say, the angle from which he approaches it hit me right between the eyes.

I have heard it was a classic and wanted to see what all the buzz was about. I purchased the book free of charge through the Kindle store and found it to be very insightful and uplifting. The language particularly is one of the strongest parts of this book. It is written in the style of early philosophers like Plato and Aristotle which means lengthy sentences, highly quotable phrases(I Tweeted several of those quotes), and musings on timeless issues like morality and character. If you are looking for a \\"Top Ten\\" or \\"Be Happy in ...Days\\", you won't find it in this book. If you are looking for a book that sit down with a nice cup of coffee, a notepad, and muse on the role of positive thinking in your life, this is a great book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but the essence is still true","review":"I bought this thinking that it would be good to give to some of my employees at work. However, after listening to it, I decided not to because of its age. The writing style is very dated, as this goes back to 1913. Can't blame the author, but for 30-somethings, I think there are better choices if you really want them to listen (or read) something.What I really like about the book is that the message of visualization rings true. It seems to be the basis for books like The Secret, which, to me, went way overboard on promising what this type of thinking can deliver.So - if you don't mind the old-style prose, give this a read or listen) - it's the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"this book is a wonderful reconfirmation of how the Law of Attraction is working.

This is a wonderful satire of the hero-genre, a humorous tale of a super mid-life crisis written long before The Incredibles made animation history. Mayer skillfully creates a fantasy-pulp world chock full of pop culture's infamous and iconic, with enough cameos to make any child of the 60's and 70's grin with wicked delight. But overall, he is able to transform the stuff of comics - that brilliant combination of noir and sensationalism - into a delightful yet adventurous novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Super book!","review":"After an over two year search I finally located and read Superfolks. The book was worth every minute of the wait. I read the book in one night. I urge all comic book readers and lovers of good fiction to find and read this work, they won't be disappointed.

Doesn't make it better just because it came first. Shakespeare's plays are amalgamations of other earlier works, and few remember those original, inferior works. Same thing happened here. Alan Moore (along with many others) revitalized the comic industry, creating epic stories that will be remembered for ages. Superfolks is Superman with a color swap, clinging onto one idea for the brief length of the story. Read the author's review of Watchmen to glimpse a bitter, failed author who wants a little attention. It's only going to get worse with the empending release of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE SUPERFOLKS !!","review":"\\"Superfolks\\" is an excellent novel.It has everything you might want in a Super-Hero novel: Action,Satire,SEX,Intrigue,Comedy,A True Suprise Ending.

It would have been nice to also see him ride some 'problem horses' in a clinic to see what a difference his style makes when he rides a horse with difficulties. Too many times one has to see the same pictures of him riding around his farm. Some of the interview sections were too long - the book explains it a lot better.

That said .... the actual riding on these tapes is hand riding of the most severe variety, and while there are some very good things here, there are also many many things in the riding that it would be very sad to see people emulating.

The first disc contains the excellent studio album Filth which is only surpassed by the final track which is a gargantuan performance by the Swans at an early gig in the Kitchen in New York circa 1982. The second disc is a remarkable collection of out takes and life performances that defined the raw, primal and powerful sound of this benemouth of a band that could rarely be equalled in a live performance. Michael Gira's later incarnations of this outfit after Public Casturation in 87 would show a different musical progression and loose some of this bands most innovative qualities in the process"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT the digipack edition","review":"Excellent reissue indeed, but music collectors might want to know that this version concerns the jewelcase 2CD and NOT the digipack version as stated in the \\"Editorial Review\\".

In case you enjoy the dark ambient of Wolf Eyes or Sunn0))), but also when you are looking for a Massive Attack \\"with guts\\", Swans simply need to be in your record collection!For what concerns packaging, I can only hope that Swans frontman Michael Gira and Young God Records will soon decide to reissue the VINYL editions of their unmissable debut LPs, of course in original sleeve artwork please!

Can't wait for remastered vinyl reissues to appear!Johan"},{"rating":"2","title":"the world looks dim","review":"Swans is something rare. It isn't hatred against humanity...its more like hatred against hatred. The name does a good job describing the bands intentions. Filth were heavy as f**k, heaviest since sabbath. The 2 drummers were literally a good idea. Gira's great too, he's got a weird poet meets hardcore kid meets rally leader voice. To see a band like them sustain significance overtime is great, they hadda a real thing going from the start.

He wants to wear this one all the time. Because it is easy to clean he usually does just that. I paid more than you pay for an average cap but it was well worth the extra money.

So we tried re-setting the timer and couldn't get it to heat up again. Waited awhile and tried a few more times and got it to work. This time the buzzer did not go off at all when it was done and the pizza came out completely burnt on one half and just thawed on the other.

He takes us across many continents and interviews many people, throwing in anecdotes about his life and interests.However what stops me giving this book a 5 star rating is the fact that I feel that some of the topics are given superficial treatment (despite the lengths of the chapters), and there is too much emphasis on the author's own involvement. Fair enough, you might say, it is his book about his experiences, but I feel it is these experiences which should take central stage.This is however only a small criticism, and it is a VERY interesting book, about interesting people in interesting times."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for anyone who has ever read a Lapierre book!","review":"This wonderful series of adventures and relationships brings the reader into the fascinating world of Dominique Lapierre.

I was only familiar with the author through his \\"City of Joy\\" book but after finishing \\"A Thousand Suns\\" I am anxious to read his other books.

They were guests of black abolitionist Nathan and Polly Johnson in New Bedford, not Bedford, and remained in NB until 1842 or 1843,as documented by City records.When married in NY by Pennigton, Garrison was not present.

Instead we get the story of pitiful Ottile, who in real life was imbalanced and probably carried on the affair in her own head rather than real life. The chapters on Anna Douglass, however are superb. This is a tender portrait of a woman who loved a man who, despite their marriage, never really was in her grasp.

In exchange, his marries her. However, as Douglass' fame grows, he meets a German woman named Ottilie Assing. This book potrays Frederick as a scum-bag who just wanted women to be submissive to him. Anna is whiny and annoying, even as we DO feel a bit bad for her being left all alone (usually pregnant) while Frederick is away, many times with Ottilie. Ottilie is a stuck-up snob, so it's hard to care about her. I couldn't really connect with eithier woman.

The author seemed to make a point that Dr. Frieda was not the saint she apeared to be in the famous book from Greenburg. In every sentence, it was reaking with some pessimistic streak, even in the depictions of the many photos I found fascinated by. I love Greenburg's book dearly, and to just know such a person as Dr. Fried existed was enough to give light to this world. I think the author of this book should have mentioned more of the fact that Friada did accomplish an enourmous amount... It was awful how the author refrained Frieda's untimely death over and over and over again, as if her life had a sad fate, despite all that she strived for. Even her work with the real Johanna Greenburg is underminded, immediately followed by a whole chapter about a patient she was unsuccessful to reach out.Not recommended, although it is the only existing book I know about her, and I rushed to the library to get it as soon as I knew it was out.

The entire book reads as though a couple of first year grad students scrapped it together in the span of a week or two. The author picks the absolute simplest, most specific problems to use as examples, and skips most of the steps needed in the derivation. The homework problems are vague, don't give proper parameters, use different terms than those given in the reading, and sometimes the answer deck doesn't even have the right answer. If you are like me, and prefer to learn out of the book than pay close attention in lecture, then do not even bother with this book, find another one and photocopy the problems from a friend.

Some of the sections are a mere two to three pages long, which is definitely not enough information. What they explain are basic spring and mass problems, but when it comes down to it, these examples are just too basic to apply to homework or test problems.

I was really looking forward to the release of this movie and what a disappointment it is! It starts out with the pioneers already stranded in the mountains. You never even see the Donners or their camp. I have read multiple accounts of the actual tragedy and what takes place in this movie is not even close to the real story as told by the survivors and historians. As if the true story wasn't horrific and dramatic enough, they have to fictionalize it and try to make it even worse. There was nothing redeeming about this movie in my opinion. I think the final insult is at the end when it is dedicated to the Donner Party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This movie is deficient in a variety of ways. First, although it is shot on location, the photography is so bland and uninteresting that it may as well have been shot in my backyard. Secondly, the script is weak, although the actors do a fine job with so little material. However, the worst aspect of this movie is the lack of historical accuracy, on every level. There are 2 murders portrayed which did not actually happen, and the murders that did happen are not portrayed! The characters are wrong, and the approach to the cannibalism is simply revolting. While it did really happen, why must a movie protray the group eating \\"human flesh\\" (which looked like chicken) about 5 different times? The real \\"Forlorn Hope\\" (who did NOT name themselves, by the way..the military term was ascribed to them 30 years after the distaster by an author) even ate their own moccasins before resorting to eating the dead, with great reluctance. Don't bother with this dreary, plodding film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't happen","review":"As the title states, it purports to be a nonfiction. The unsuspecting viewer may be lured into thinking that they are actually viewing an event that happened in our early history when in reality, they are watching a fiction.

In reality the snow at times was so deep that walking was impossible. Also it was historically innacurate - although to be fair it advertises the film as 'based' on a true story - so I suppose they have added some drama by including murder into the story.Read the book called 'Ordeal By Hunger' by George Stewart if you want all the true facts. There was one man called Keseberg who was suspected of killing a young child - but only suspected. Then there was a man killed in a fight long before they were trapped in the mountains. The bodies that were eaten were all people who succumbed to hunger and cold - not murder victims.This could have been a really good film, especially as it was actually made in Donner Pass, but seemed to have been poorly put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be listed as fiction","review":"What a horrible misrepresentation of this historical, well documented event.

Not much, I would imagine. The cast mainly trudges through the snow in the woods, getting lost on the way to California. Hungry, they resort to cannibalism to survive. But the women, and even the men, look way too clean and healthy, their hair perfect and their faces ruddy. They were starving? Doesn't look it. Also, they appear to only make one meal out of each dead body they carve up. But, in reality, they could have survived for days, if not weeks, per body. The score is silly and too melodramatic. The acting is leaden. In all, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Barbier - come back.","review":"Mr. Barbier's Mastering the Basics video was an audio delight. His attitude and approach to lightness and partnership can serve to be an inspirational message to trainers who struggle daily with horses that, through previous forceful methodology, have become lumbering, difficult and resistant. Unfortunately the visual elements of this particular video, at best do not compliment and at worst mock the enlightening narration. His horses appear compressed and over-bent and traveling too much sideways to deliver a light ride. His instruction, although pleasant to listen to, is unproductive and his riding seems thoroughly contradictory to what he is saying.

This new pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers do not have a needle point; the tweezer's point is squared off so they are not sharp enough to pierce the skin and grab ingrown hairs.Also, the contact area when you have the tips pressed together is so small it's difficult to grab any hair with these making them quite worthless.They are being returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what we were looking for!","review":"We've purchased several so-called needle-tipped tweezers; always to come away disappointed. Either the tips didn't meet perfectly or were too wide (not a true needle-tip) or they were flimzy. This is not a good situation to be in when you're attempting to pull a tiny glass-shard out of your foot as was the case with me recently. The shard was so tiny my wife couldn't even see it but I sure could feel it! We had a lousy set of tweezers and gave up with them she had to come up with a \\"plan B\\". THIS pair, however, is perfectly aligned, needle-tipped and strong. I definitely recommend this model/brand tweezer and will be revisiting Tweezerman for our future Tweezing needs as well.

I will never own another pair of tweezers owned by anybody. I wish I knew about this brand years ago. They make all my old tweezers seem as dull as a butterknife. Anyway, these ingrown hair tweezers are no different. Now when my husband has an ingrown hair on his head I pull only the problem hair and not a patch on his head. I know he appreciates them. Because they are so pointy and sharp, keep them where a child can't reach."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No","review":"I have the regular tweezerman tweezers and I thought these would be even better.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"I like the product. The materials used seem to be of good quality. It is what I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much tweezer for me","review":"I was very excited about this product, and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me. However, I was only able to use this product for a short time. My first problem was that after every in-grown hair was removed, there was a tell-tale scab left behind. I'm not sure which was worse, the hair bump, or the scab. Secondly, I dropped the tweezers, and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly, so I had to jimmy the ends a bit every time I used it. I finally had to stop using it altogether after I misused the tweezers to retrieve something at the bottom of a narrow bottle and the tips bent.In the end, I think this is probably a great tool for an \\"emergency\\" in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional. However, it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are, like me, a little clumbsy or ham handed (you know who you are ;))."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I really was hoping for something very precise. These have a nice point but they are not as small at the tip as I had hoped. The tip is certainly much larger than the Revlon Platinum Tweezer Slant Tip, which I have included in an image next to the Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze.I am currently using these for crafting, which they are actually perfect for. Anytime I need to grab something fine like a bead or brad they really do the trick. They are also great for small stickers or stamped images or pretty much anything else. If they were advertised for this, I would give them 5 stars. As tweezers they fall a little short.I hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"The points allow you to work on exposing in-grown hair. But the tips barely touch so it's very difficult to grasp the hair to pluck it. There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective but I didn't see them for sale on Amazon. Found one that works at Walgreens (purple coated)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really sharp and pointy ... be careful!","review":"These tweezers take out the shortest, tiniest of hairs. When paired with my 15x magnification mirror there is not a stray eyebrow that is safe from being plucked! Just be careful, I left it sitting out one day and accidentally punctured my finger with it, ouch! Some reviewers say they have difficulty pulling/grabbing hair with these tweezers, but I never have a problem - I think the trick is to hold the tweezers more parallel to your face and pull in the direction of hair growth.The price on amazon is really good too - I have seen it at big box stores for between $17 to $22, and currently on amazon it's only $11! If you have amazon prime you can get free shipping and save yourself the gas it would have taken to drive to the store, win-win!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"Tried this for a splinter once and couldn't get it to grip at all.

They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I bought these tweezers for removing ingrown hairs that did not come out after I shaved. My regular flat tweezers were not pointed enough to grab them.This product's graphic yellow design makes it more eye-catching than your traditional stainless steel model. I realize the tips have to come to a point to pull splinters or small hairs, but these ended up being a little too sharp. There doesn't end up being enough surface area sometimes to easily grab what your trying to take out.Overall, I like the tweezers and would recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"*not* a needle point!","review":"It doesn't grasp a ingrown hair at all I have to dig out the ingrown hair with a needle then I can grab the hair with this product. if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this wouldn't be the right product for you, the so called point isn't really a point it's squared off and just doesn't grasp the small hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Work brilliantly, you do have to be careful with them as they are very sharp though.

As a result, readers that grab this title seeking a horror story (gory or not) stand to be disappointed. Mary Shelley's story, which must be read in full appreciation of the style and sensibilities of the 19th century, is actually the sad story of a creature rejected by its creator. Love and love denied, revenge and forgiveness, rejection and acceptance, right and wrong - and how human judgment is tainted by appearances. In a century where image is all and beauty is mistaken for intelligence, Frankenstein's story is all too contemporary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected","review":"This book is profound.

But the book, to me, was written poorly. When reading the novel, my mind always wandered becasue of the dragging on of events. It used difficult language, uncommon words, and was saturated with too many words. The 160 page novel could have easily been shrinked down into an 100 page story. It was repititive in its ideas and difficult to concentrate on.

I knew what Frankenstein was about, or so I thought. Although many movies have been made about Frankenstein, none compare to Mary Shelley's novel. Shelley captures human emotion like no movie can. The expression of anger, sorrow, and helplessness of the monster created cannot be seen in such movies. Shelley's novel ties a completely fictional idea to real life in which everyone can relate. There are many things that can be taken away from this novel aside from the whole \\"man creating monster\\" idea. For a look at real human emotion, this is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankenstein","review":"I found the story Frankenstein a pretty dark story.

I recommend it to nobody."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Human Condition at Its Finest","review":"The relationship between Victor Frankenstein and his monster portrays every emotion a human will encounter in life. Despite being murderous and physically appalling, it's easy to identify with the monster's alienation and despair, which is deepened through Shelley's touching poetics and prose. \\"Frankenstein\\" contains the most effortlessly beautiful language to ever be penned. Although an early innovator in the horror and sci-fi genres, \\"Frankenstein\\" still remains a seminal piece of simple romanticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankenstein","review":"I think that Frankenstein is an instructive book. It was fun reading it, and the story is very well written. You read that the monster is very ugly and therefore everybody is scared of him. I think that you shouldn't have prejudice based on looks. You should get to know someone first, before you judge him or her."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a monster story","review":"Shelley's novel is so much more than a story about a monster. The whole mood of her novel is electrifying and startling. The sensation is similar to arriving at the very edge of a mountain precipice, gazing down, and feeling the enormity of life rush over you. This sense of vertigo is one of Shelley's gifts. She has the wild writer's mind and she can deliver the chills. One could argue her shocking sense of life was very similar to the later wildly popular french philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, and the theme of his sudden realization of the horror of existence. Shelley's gothic novel written in the age of romance has elements of both styles. But, it's her wild mind that makes this novel eerie, extraordinary and amazing.

When Dr. Frankenstein refuses to create a companion for him, the monster begins killing his family. Overall, this is a book well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradigmatic Gothic","review":"Frankenstein is one of the key templates of modern fiction, setting into motion narratives regarding anxiety about science and creation, power over nature, and more saliently anxiety over reproduction, particularly male anxiety. The novel revolves around an implicit and typical family romance that can be found in many gothic novels - the temptation or possibility of incestuous relationship and its sublimation and avoidance. There is also a fairly radical revolutionary subtext in the novel inspired in part by Mary Shelley's father William Godwin (his own fictional works are mirror images of Frankenstein in many ways)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know the secret of animating dead matter...

You would think he'd have enough balls to not run away from what he created because it was a bit ugly. I guess he donated those to his creature.I'm glad I read this book because it is something I should have read when I was younger but I didn't care for how Frankenstein behaved in the story. For such a brilliant mind he sure acted like an idiot throughout the story which I believe makes him more responsible for the deaths of his family and friends than his creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"This book was pretty good but for some reason it did not do much for me. When I would tell my friends and family the plot they would all say wow that book sounds great or sounds like a really exciting book. But in reality to me it wasn't. I think that it might have been because there was too much unnecessary writing in between the interesting parts.

I am 15, and sitting here reading (and sleeping to) this book was just an absolute waste of time. The book was filled with constant tautology (constant repition of the same thing, just in different words) and filled with chapters that were utterly pointless. There is no horror to this story at all...It is about a living creature, shunned by society who eventually goes on the rampage. Gee, like that hasn't happened before. The story was generic, even for it's time.

This book was a struggle. At points, i was halfway into it, but unfortunately, Shelley always said, \\"No, stay an armlength away from me.\\" I think the main thing i hated about it was how Victor was always saying, \\"Oh, and my heart was always troubled. The monster led me to my self-destruction and doom.\\" Shelley wrote this so the readers might sympathise with his plight, yet she should've paid attention to the saying, \\"Show, Don't Tell.\\" And the constant \\"Words cannot describe the sorrow i felt,\\" really did bug me as well. If you're published, that is, slap-bang in the middle of an industry based around words, you SHOULD be able to describe stuff, else you shouldn't be in the business.

I think I'll stick to the movie for this one. I'm hoping it gets better the further in I go. I'm amazed they were able to write a screenplay based on this book. WOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Myth Is Better","review":"I'm probably biased, because I hate the romantic period for its namby-pamby emotional fireworks, and I think Frankenstein epitomizes that. Everything is so dramatic to the point of being histrionic, and annoyingly so. Honestly, the author's life and the inspirations for the novel were a lot more interesting than the novel itself, which was neither scary nor emotionally involving. If anything, I felt little besides sheer ire toward the protagonists. This book awakened my schadenfreude. Unless you have to read it for school or something, stick to the legend of Frankenstein as the monster, not his creator."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better...like Berenstein Bears","review":"This was the dullest book I have ever read in my entire existence.

As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class. I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed. My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it. I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature. She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time. So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel sorry...","review":"for the people who hated this book and gave it poor reviews. Really missed out on what may be the greatest novel of all time. For me it's hard to put down. And the themes are deep and everlasting ones that humans will forever struggle with. Life and death, God vs science, good and evil, spiritual themes, and social ones also, all wrapped up in a GREAT story. Oh well, you can't expect everyone to get it and resonate with it.One thing about this Rieger version: it says it \\"reproduces for the first time in more than a century the text of the first edition published in 1818\\". Not true. Donohue produced at least three editions (I have them) around 1895 that are all the 1818 text.Just an FYI.Believe the hype! This book is hard to surpass. I virtually never give 5 stars to ANYTHING. This deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for the patient readers","review":"An excellent classic about Victor Frankenstein and his creature. Mary Shelley's only book was a great success and is full of suspense and insanity. Although it may be a great story, it is not for readers who want an action-packed, fast-paced book. Chapters and events tend to drag. Overall an excellent instant classic that shall never be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"Mary Shelley brings up a well argued topic. Who has the authority to bestow life upon a creature? That is about the only thing that holds water in the book. The book starts out boring................ and stays boring. She wants to write a chilling horror story or a romantic novel, but she only skims the surface. The only exciting thing about the book that gets you hooked is the vividly designed cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes!","review":"The idea of a mad scientist creating a human monster was a great idea--especially in the year 1816. However the book is boring...implausible...over-written...under-edited...and boring. So why is is so famous? Let's face it, today nobody would have heard of, much less read, this book if the 1931 movie hadn't made it famous; yet the book and the movie have very little in common. So why does it get such great reviews? Again, let's face it, the title is so famous that most people don't want to say that they don't get it. But there's very little to get, other than what you read into it--the emperor has no clothes!

The letters are too bored (you can finish this book in 20 concentrated minutes...) and there shouldn't be any pictures because it cuts your imagination. The story isn't very elaborate.

I picked this book up to look for answers on the questions of identity and wasn't disappointed.Very interesting and definitely worth a read at least to understand the monster's perspective. And if you think its 19th century origin might be a turn off for our present generation of readers, well you will be surprised.For Mary Shelley knew how to keep up the excitement and of course the gothic appeal will have the 21st century reader turning pages with delight! :)Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is amazing.

The fact that it was written by Shelley when she was only eighteen or so makes it an even more remarkable story. Very easy to read and access the language.

It is a good quality leatherette that feels nice, but it is not leather. The leatherette is very thin and will wear off the corners and binding. The paper is medium weight. The font is large size.

Yeah, he just walked in the local morgue and picked up the pieces he needed. Sure. Well if you have any thing that you need to get done DO IT BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK.

Well I think I made my point."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a classic???","review":"3 Words best describe this book: wordy, contrived, and melodramatic. I LOVE reading classics, but this one consistently disappoints. A lot of classics are wordy, and a lot of Gothic tales are contrived and melodramatic, but at least the pay-off is worth the effort. Sadly, I cannot say the same for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

THIS IS NOT A HORROR NOVEL. it really is not, as stated by a true horror master: H.P.Lovecraft. it is a philosophical supernatural drama. if you want a horror novel, you are looking in the wrong direction. i agree there is something grizzly here, but that does not make horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"frankenstein stinks","review":"ok this book does not deserve the title of a horror story its not scary in the leat bit. so all y'all who think this book will send chills up your spine IT WONT!

Mary Shelley did an excellent job portraying the monster, and an even better job showing his human emotions and compassion. At first, you are led to believe that the creature is an abomination in the name of human kind, but quickly realize that he did not ask to be created, and that he is nothing more than what his creator's hands molded. This is also a look into the subject of human beings \\"playing god\\", and offers many viewpoints that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, it can be incorporated with modern subjects, where everything is not \\"black and white\\", but where there is a \\"gray\\" uncertain area (cloning, etc.). A must read for anyone who enjoys drama, especially those readers with ethical questions in a modern chaotic world."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerfull masterpiec of literature","review":"beautiful book. mary shelly really had the writers blood in her! she opens up days of discussions with this novel. aspects such as the power of science and morality, that are still looked at today."},{"rating":"2","title":"kept me up all night just reading it!!","review":"the first few chapters were boring..till the part the creation of monster was described...then i just couldn't put it down.i feel for the monster cause it's lacking parental love from the day of its birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing book that is not always easy to handle","review":"I read this for 11th grade english and was not thrilled with having to read it because I wanted more Shakespeare. However I did read this book and was struck at how many themes in it were applicable to the moral battles being fought today. Stem-cell research, cloning, designer babies, etc... All of this was being touched on by an author who couldn't ever dream how true her prose might ring. My experience with this book may be distorted because when you read a book with a guide (such as a teacher) your opinions become mingled with your teachers. The character of Victor is fascinating but he is one that you will hurt deeply for. He does so many things that will repulse you and he takes so little responsibilities for his creation and the consquences that will spring from it. Read it and soak up the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankenstein Classic","review":"Had this book when I was young and recently saw it as a play.

I knew that the movies veered pretty far from the actual plot of the book, but still expected something more. While the book was probably very scary and very controversial in 1818, it didn't really translate through the centuries. At least for me it didn't. I rated this book based more for being a horror classic and for basically inventing the creature feature horror genre and less on actual entertainment and merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic","review":"I chose this and other Touchstone Classic books for my 8 year-old, because it is the original, unabridged version. At these low prices, this is a good opportunity to expose your children to literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movies","review":"As with many of the other reviews for this novel, I too was surprised to find that the original character bore little resemblance to the movie representation. This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech. While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure. It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility. This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them. There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help. I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic tale","review":"This is good but has challenging vocabulary but I do recommend it to people that read in a high level just like me.

Although, many times i found my mind wandering to other things. It was somewhat slow paced, and at times very boring. I felt Mary Shelly left out some things that perhaps should have been discussed in order for the book to be a little more interesting (ie. how the monster actually came to life). Even though the story was short, and unbelieveable i did however like how she made the monster a product of society- everyone hated and feared him, therefore he hated everyone else. He could have been good, and lived a (somewhat) normal life. The story has a deep meaning to it- it just took M. Shelly a long time to bring it out. I would recommend this book if you like science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Frankenstein","review":"Frankenstein was a good novel which depicts the dangers of modern science.

Its not one of those \\"feel-good\\" books. Mary Shelley portrays the world-view of \\"The way you act, good or bad, is based on how you are treated by others.\\" According to Shelley, if you are rejected by the world, hated by others, and despised by your own creator, its \\"ok\\" to murder innocent people and hate those who are happy and have joy. I disagree with this world-view and wouldn't recommend this book to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"Loved it!

There is a lot in this story that is not talked about in the movie remakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Obsession Gone Awry","review":"Frankenstein is one of the great classics of horror literature. Wanting to overcome death and disease, Victor Frankenstein seeks to create life. In the process he builds a monster from graveyards and slaughter houses. The monster comes to life and wants to be loved. However, the monster's unpleasant appearance makes it difficult for others to show compassion. The only person who offers any sort of kindness is blind. The monster eventually stalks and torments its creator. Ironically, Frankenstein loses some of his loved ones at the hands of the powerful monster he created. Though this version is an adaptation designed for younger readers, it is still a powerful and compelling story. The book concludes with a short biographical profile of Mary Shelley. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electrifying","review":"Wow. How did I reach the age of 43 without realising \\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than a one-dimensional horror story about a blockheaded monster with bolts in his neck?

Either way, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Work.","review":"This is a wonderful piece of literature, both moving and morally powerful. Frakenstein and his creation each moved me to sympathy and contempt, and I was left torn between caring for and loathing them at the same time. Without question this tale is worthy of its status as a classic, and is infinitely superior to the flat and superficial \\"Dracula\\", a work it is often classified with, though I feel it is a far more meaningful work. If you haven't read \\"Frankenstein\\" you owe it to yourself to do so--you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless, brilliant young writer","review":"This classic reflects Mary Shelley's mental anguish and pain which she endured in her own life.

I realize that the prose is from the 1800's, but if anyone ever actually spoke or thought like the characters in this book they would be laughed at by everyone who heard them. Frankenstein creates an 8 foot monster and then, after bringing it to life, he totally abandons it and never sees it again for 2 years.

More like they've got some sort of tumor that needs looking into!Also, how can you write a THIRTY page intro to your book, explaining that it was an attempt to match the spooky campfire ghost stories you heard on vacation... and then create a monster who's demeanor and diction put shakespear to shame!Call me old fashioned by I'll take my Frankenstein monster with a side of Grandpa Munster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype ...","review":"I'm sure that I'll have people wanting my blood for this, but I have to be honest. This book is horrible. Absoulutely horrible from start to finish. The writing is grade-schoolish, the plot moves to slowly and is so far fetched that one can't lose one's suspension of disbelief no matter how hard the reater tries, and frankly the monster itself is sleep-inducing.Don't bother with this book.

I had seen the movie, and usually, if I like the movie, I like the book even better, but this time they really improved on the book. I found the book incredibly boring. I had to force myself to finish it. I've read other books written in the same format -- mostly letters back and forth between people -- and enjoyed them. Bram Stoker's Dracula was written largely like that. But Mary Shelley is just not a very good writer, in my humble opinion. She had a good idea, and other people have done great things with it. But the original book just didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazon service way below par","review":"I ordered a copy of Frankenstein but was billed for seven copies because Amazon accused me of having clicked the order button more than once. I will take this opportunity to accuse Amazon of thoughtfully or thoughtlessly having created the possibility of more than one order per click, a reality that could indeed happen with a purchaser who has a tremor or who quite accidentally clicks the order button more than once. That's a sad trap for customers who don't pay close attention to the orders they receive, thinking that Amazon sent an order in the customer's favor and the customer later not recognizing the reality of what happened and end up paying the full amount of the credit card invoice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks Sucks Sucks","review":"I have to add this to the top of the list of books that I have had to read but HATED! Let's see it was up there with Call of the Wild, The Odyssey, Farenheit 451, The King Must Die, True Grit, When the Legends Die, etc...I think you get my point. It is as if the teachers and district pick the worst possible books. Frankenstein has SOOO much potential to be great, however it falls abysmally short. I am sad to say that I had to read this horrible book front to back without the option of throwing it in the fireplace like I was so longing to do. We even had to read the lame(for lack of better word) letters at the beginning. Our teacher said that most teachers don't make their students read those--I guess he is not one of those teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too good, I was a bit disappointed","review":"You know, the movies make it seem like tis really fantastic, but it really sint.

When Victor Frankenstein went to study at Ingolstadt, his quest for knowledge became the center of his life. He focused solely on his scientific creation, leaving little time for outside connections. However, when he finally brought life to his creature, Frankenstein had no idea that his \\"work of science,\\" would eventually control his life. Shelly's novel breaks the boundaries set by dull science-fiction stories and enters a world of human nature, with love, vengeance, misery, anguish, and regret. The ending to this well written classic is just as enthralling as the first page, as the term \\"mad scientist\\" takes on a whole new meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"The tale of a large cannon that falls into the hands of Spanish Guerilla's during the Napoleonic war.

It focuses on the cannon's impact on many people instead of one individual like the Hornblower series. I have enjoyed rereading this book several times over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Forrester failure","review":"I read this one many years ago, and like his other works, Forrester fall flat. The characters come across more like cartoons than people, There are a number of inaccuracies in this one like so many of Forrester's works. The idea of Spanish guerrila troops with an oversized cannon wreaking havoc on a Regular Standing Army smacks of a lame Hollywood movie plot.If you are a fan of Forrester and like to throw your money away, have at it. If not, pass this one by"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great set, spoiled by subtitles","review":"This is a fascinating collection of really beautiful animated films.Unfortunately, they are marred by some very obtrusive English subtitles, which CAN'T BE SWITCHED OFF, they are rendered into the video stream.This is deeply upsetting, because the value of the films is in their visual impact, not their text, and the ugly subtitles are ALL OVER the frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garish and rabid fun","review":"This four-DVD release gathers together what may be some of the most ideologically garish cartoons of the 20th century. And yet, if you look past that and revel in the method and artistry of these animators, artists and directors, you will be amazed. In fact, these films often display rather daring artistic expression for their times - apparently permissible if the anti-Americanism was sufficiently rabid.

On the other hand. The Soviets were not very good cartoonists, and their propaganda is so sterotyped and heavy handed as to be a complete turnoff. As a result, this compilation is apt to be a large bore to contemporary viewers. On the other hand, Russian citizens in the mid-twentieth century may have been more receptive.In my memory, American propaganda in the visual arts never portrayed the Soviets in such a crude, unsophisticated fashion. The German Nazis, however, protrayed them in cartoons as bestial and rapacious barbarians"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I got a 5 on the AP exam.

Somehow this book is 600 pages of information about shamanism while not informing the reader of its actual basis. What a blunder that this is supposed to be a definitive textbook on this religion and some poor people have read this book and considered themselves learned in shamanism. It needs to be taken off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn off one-click if you're enebriated","review":"As the title says, if you're surfing Amazon while having had tossed back several cold ones, turn off your one-click.

It doesn't just tell you what to do to maintain your car, but includes the science behind it, so you know WHY certain practices are good or bad. The best section is on the four causes of engine deterioration. On the down side, there is too much discussion of carburetors, and the two product plugs seem unprofessional, especially since one of them is for a product made by the publisher of the copy I purchased, ATG. Also, there is some repetition and some mild contradictions - the book is not well edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"review of 'Drive it Forever\\" from a certified mechanic","review":"I do agree with the other reviewer, that this books endorsement of slick 50 after being heavily penalized by the federal trade commission seems like the wrong way to help people. The information is fairly outdated in my opinion. Yes, it does have a few good points, but following your owners manuals recommendations would pretty much tell you the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Padding, padding, padding...","review":"If you drive a car made after 1985, or a car with automatic transmission, 90% of the information in this book is totally irrelevant. The author discusses carburetor maitanence and the finer points of gear shifting in exhaustive detail. It seems as if Mr. Sikorsky has put a TON of padding into a book that otherwise would be a good pamphlet on effecient driving habits. For instance, he wastes nearly 40 pages discussing the properties of different oil grades. WHO CARES!?!

The first two have been contemplated by philosophers and laymen alike for years. Now Ken Lamberton brings us his insights on the third.In honesty I only bought the book because I had known the author in the time leading up to his incarseration and wasn't even sure if I would read the whole thing. I wound up reading it twice. The perspective is unique and the insights are thoughtful.As a transplanted Arizonan the descriptions of the desert of southern Arizona brought back wonderful memories for me as did the tremendous illustrations.As we get pushed further from nature this book is a wonderful reminder that even in the harshest most 'un-natural' environments we are never very far from the wild wonderfull natural world - we just sometimes have to look a little harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I read this book for a class. It was interesting. You could tell that he wasn't a professional writer but tying the nature to the prison was interesting. His crime sort of bothers you in the beginning but, you get over it. I actually met the guy who wrote this book a while ago. He was pretty interesting. Overall if you are interested in nature and prisons this is probably a good one for you to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've had the most luck with this one.","review":"When it comes to wanting to express something I say in English in Japanese and making myself understood, I have had more luck with this book than any other.

The kit looks nice and mounts fine to the radio. However, this kit does not fit under the Cobalt dash panels. It appears there was a manufacturing error or incorrect labeling of this product. The face is about 1/4\\" to wide and will not mount under the cars dash panel. It is not worth modifying since the face would have to be physically cut to fit under the dash panel. Cutting the hard plastic face would be very noticeable and cutting the car dash plate would be an unrepairable modification.I would like to give this product a \\"2 star\\" rating because it does well at securing the radio in the dash and is reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the dash panels could not be replaced with this mounting kit installed. My background includes several custom car audio installations and I am very confident in my ability. This does not fit in a late model Cobalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got the measurements wrong","review":"Double DIN is 100x180 mm - any radio that adheres to these specs won't fit in this kit.

This lotion smells like a cheap cocoa butter smelling lotion. Why purchase a $10 tube of this for that smell? Also, it does a very basic job of moisturizing. Nothing special. I REALLY wanted to like both of these products based of the reviews but was dissapointed in both. I would recommend you smell the scent of this in a store and decide for yourself. Will be writing a review on the body scrub as well so feel free to check that one as well.

His style is poor, his insights are predictable.There are so many books which could bring you understanding of this magnificent continent as Martin Meredith \\"The Fate of Africa\\" (history of every country on the continent since independence) or books by Kapuscinsky, if you want to understand how ordinary people live in Africa, rather than how wrong and dismal politics is made.There are few interesting observations World Bank envoy makes concerning how wrong international help could go. He points out that unconditional help makes things worse. He gives several revealing examples how undertakings supposed to bring good, make more misery instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trouble with Africa","review":"Having recently traveled to Africa for the first time, I left that continent, as did my fellow travelers, wondering what could be done to better the lives of the people we met. It seemed that the troubles were monumental, and that solutions would be nearly impossible. As I read Mr. Calderisi's book, I felt that here were the concrete, rational ideas that are needed to begin the transformation. It made me wish I had the expertise and leadership abilities to get started on it NOW and I only hope that in the very near future that someone with Mr. Calderisi's insight and knowledge will make this a priority and start implementing his ten ways of changing Africa. A truly thought-provoking and inspirational book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is not a whiteman look over Africa, but a very clever and clear understanding on the roots of the blocage based on ways of doing in Africa.I loved this book because Robert does not judge but gives pertinent observation based on experience at high level behind the corridors of the powers.Money loaned by westerners increased corruption instead of bringing releaf.This book points some clear responsabilities of who's doing what, and what is behind this huge mess on this continent."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy easterly instead","review":"this book was not all that i'd hoped it would be; i was very disappointed. why?1) it was poorly organized.2) it was hard to trudge through, not a joy like other books.3) there was too much personal info about the author that had nothing to do with 'the trouble with africa'.4) there was posturing and self-congratulation that i found really distasteful. the author may indeed have gotten a lot closer to the poor than the other aid workers or local government officials, and he may indeed have received awards at the village level, but that really has nothing to do with 'the trouble with africa' either.5) what was actually worthwhile here only filled 20 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal insight","review":"Robert Calderisi is someone who has lived in Africa and worked at the World Bank.

She had some very eye opening things to say about the state of things on that continent, and it got me curious to know more. I enjoyed the honesty, though I see where it might raise eyebrows. His experiences come across vividly and he shares many personal and specific anecdotes to illustrate his points. Africa seems a little less mysterious, if not a little more contradictory. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Stupid Book","review":"My Sociology teacher assigned this book and after reading it my conclusion is that it is the stupidest book I've ever read.

The jacket piqued my interest and I began to read the book myself. The book brought tears to my eyes. The author sincerely understands these children, as only a parent of a child with ADD could. How insightful! I appreciated every nuance of this story!Of course, I insisted that my son read this book.

Most other books I could find on adoption was too babyish for our 10 year old to be even remotely interested in. Andy, the main character in the book, is so much like our boy that he immediately latched onto the story with great interest. Each night after reading a few chapters we discuss the contents that we just read, and how Andy's situation is similar, or different from, his own. It's been a great way for us to examine and discuss what's really going on in his life right now, and I'm sure it has helped him feel not quite so alone.

I'm not that patient!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her first and last album!","review":"Ha ha ha!i'm laughing on lolly and her crap album.i listened to this album 3 years ago in a local store but now i'm reviewing it.this album is the worst album in the music history.when i first listened to it i burst out laughing.i think lolly wanted to do this album to make herself a big joke,then she saw that all the people laughing at her so she didn't show her face after 4 years or maybe forever.if you have a copy of this album put it in a trash can immediately or throw this crap out of your window or give it to a mum that has a new born baby to make her sleep at nights or perhaps when the baby listens to it he/she will start crying cuz these songs will give him/her a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they had zero stars","review":"Okay I wish there were words that I could use to describe how crappy this CD is. But there are no words to describe how bad it is. When I first heard Viva La Radio I had to rush to the bathroom because I was going to pee my pants. I have never heard anything so funny in my life. I guess that the British people that signed her to Polydor were like \\"I know lets play a practical joke on the people of the UK.\\" If only the good people of the UK knew that then no one would have taker her seriously if anyone actually did. Oh well I guess all I can do is warn you not to buy this album. I am sorry that my sister wasted her allowence on this CD but I hate to tell you sis I told you so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really bad holy crap!","review":"This is some of the crappiest junk I have ever heard. Thhe only reason that I gave it one star was beacuse there wasn't a zero. The only good thing about this CD is the Karaoke versions of all her songs. If you want a good pop singer from the UK get Billie Honey To The B it si alot better then this garbage. Also you might try some talented pop exports from the UK, S CLUB 7, STEPS, and try the Irish Samantha Mumba. They are all better then this pseudo talented pop trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Omigawd this is so bad.","review":"Okay lets start that I love this album. Not for its content but for the fact that it makes a great mirror. Omigawd I can not beleive that people actually bought this album. My little sis gave it to me to listen to and she told me that she wanted me to have it becuase it made her sick to listen to it. I thought that it was cute. Okay lets start out with the main purpose of this album. I feel that this album was made because they saw her as an answer to Britney, um sorry floks of the UK but didn't you already do that with Billie? Oh well I guess I can just tell you to go out to your local record store and buy a copy of Leslie Carter's single \\"Like Wow\\" that is worth the... to laugh your a** off for the three and a half minutes. Oh well don't buy this trash I have heard and seen better. Oh Lolly maybe your next single can be \\"Viva La Cardboard Box\\" since that is where you will be in the next 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this disc","review":"Before you purchase this disc, be sure that your receiver will decode its soundtrack. The only soundtrack available on the disc is DTS-HD. Because I'm using an older surround processor, I can't play it because there is no sound. I'm not planning on running out to purchase a new processor just so that I can watch one disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Swan Lake out there in the market place!","review":"This is the BEST Swan Lake out there in the market place available. The Actress and the Actor are the PERFECT performers for this ballet. Almost all the other dancers have also beautifully and wonderfully danced throughout. Other than dances are very beautifully and professionally danced, the costumes, background setting and lighting are also very beautiful and wonderful. 5 stars all the way. The only and the biggest mistake they have made is the camera man, the worst camera for a ballet performance like this - constantly changing camera, one has no knowledge about how to shoot a ballet performance, making too many mistakes in shooting. Overall the performance is PERFECT, the camera is of a great regret, still, I am going to get another Blue-ray of this performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but wrong ending.","review":"I purchased this blue ray and have been very impressed. The dancing is superb, as to be expected considering the source. You would be hard pressed to find better visual quality, and the music is impeccable. My only complaint is that this version of Swan Lake has a 'happy ending'. The music and story dictate tragedy. It should have been played out with a double suicide, and it wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Wake-Up Call","review":"This easy to read book is for anyone who yearns to live a fuller more creative life and is wondering why they can't seem to be able to make any headway. It presents well documented, sometimes shocking, information you will never hear or read about in the media, interspersed with personal, relevent stories. It educates us as to how we are being manipulated by the media and by large transnational corporations and how this manipulation is affecting every area of our lives, from the emotional health of our children to the physical health of our bodies.But the book doesn't leave you hanging, feeling helpless and depressed. It is filled with easy suggestions that we, as individuals, can do to turn back the tide and take back control. This book was a real eye-opener and I highly reommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar's sweetest!","review":"This is an album I first heard sitting \\"seiza\\" in a small, yet emaculate apartment in Kansai Japan, 1984. Don't let anyone tell you different; this recording was made prior to that, though I think it was originally released in the U.S. about 1987. This is Sugar at his finest! I love Dancehall and Lovers equally, and this (entirely Roots/Lovers) skank is sweet and lovely!

Really mellow baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canto: An unfortunate redaction of a timeless classic","review":"Don't get me wrong -- \\"On Growth and Form\\" is one of my absolute top favorite books of all time. Possibly my favorite book, in fact. This review is a warning to make sure you get the right imprint.Unfortunately some publishers think that they know better than D'Arcy Thompson, and cut out more than half of the original material. After all, nobody these days actually looks at equations, right? Well I do, and the pathetic edition by Canto (368 pages) weighs with less than 33% of the material in the modern unexpurgated reprint by Dover (1116 pages).Amazingly enough, the redacted Canto version costs nearly the same as the Dover complete. If you care about this material, take care to get all of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable because of poor production","review":"I wish I had read the reviews to this edition before I bought it because I would not have wasted my money. However, my complaint is different from that of the others I have read. The book I received? I literally can't read it. Imagine using a copier to copy the pages of a book, with the \\"darkness\\" factor set high. That's what I got. A grey background to every page. There is such poor contrast between the type and the page that it's all just a big wash of grey. What a disappointment. btw there was no publisher listed anywhere on this edition - nor any mention that it was abridged. I suspect it is an Amazonian \\"on-demand\\" printing, apparently overseen by a broken robot. I shall search out the unabridged edition elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the number of pages before you buy !!!","review":"This wonderful book contains in its original form more than a thousand clearly written pages, and over five hundred illustrations. The poor excuse of a book, facsimile copy I got for ~12$ contains less than three hundred pages, and in its black and white printed form (opposed the full color online view) is barely readable. Check the number of pages in the book version offered before you buy !Amazon should do a better job at separating this inadequate version from the original.Having paid only <12$, it would be more expensive to return the book than keep it, so I just ordered a different version. I hope this time it would be the appropriate one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this edition","review":"This is about this edition not the book itself. What I received was literally unreadable.

There is such poor contrast between the type and the page that it's all just a big wash of grey. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Growth and Form","review":"Amazing book. Like a scientific Ulysses. Every sentence contains an un-footnoted reference or allusion to some other work--literary, scientific, or otherwise. Untranslated quotes in at least half a dozen laguages. Most of it is way over my head and probably most people's, but read on, let it flow over you and catch as much as you can of this late vVctorian polymath's immense knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic compilation of very neat gems","review":"This book is a *classic*; an adventure into abstract mathematical properties of nature. The author rambles on about many topics concerning natural manifestations as viewed from near human and cellular scales, with the tools of the early 20th century. It's that enigmatic space between Biology and Geometry, presented in a very accessible manner by an author whose love and knowledge of the subject shines through well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - But not as good as WoO","review":"For any dirt track racer or fan out there this is a must have. The gameplay is as good or better than WoO but unfortunately this game doesn't offer much that's new as far as tracks etc goes. A create a track feature would be nice and a variety of cars in the pure stock class would keep it more interesting. It is more realistic with it's engine damage but the car damage is still very unrealistic. I would also like to see more physics introduced like tire pressure, tire compound, toe and castor/camber settings etc. Good game with lots of areas to improve upon for the next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for !","review":"These dividers are cheap and extemely hard to push the wires into. I have 8mm wires and I was afraid I was going to cut into them with these clips. I threw them away before I even got all of them on. Spend a few extra bucks and get good ones, like the MSD clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very odd and often disturbing","review":"I was very excited when I received this one in the mail. Having been a long-time and old school Bjork and Sugarcubes fan, I couldn't wait to see Bjork's movie debut. Her performance was not in question, but the script and direction were my main problems with it. First of all, I would've preferred Icelandic with English subtitles. It was all in English. The mood was dark and odd, which really was enhanced by the film being in black and white. Far too much information was left up to the viewer to decide on. Most of the action was talked about in past tense in bad voiceovers while showing barren landscapes. The plot suffered due to the director trying to be too artsty. So constantly, I had to keep adding in scenes in my head that were never there. Ugh! The movie had a cold realism and a grim fairy tale type ending. It was not horrible, but my copy of this immeadiately was listed on ebay after I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork As A Witch?","review":"Bjork played an outstanding role, her part as a witch was great. This film is in black and white, which only adds to the intrigue. She makes you feel like you are there, with her and her sister. The man her sister marries has a son who cannot accept her. Bjork is accepted after a trial period by the son, but the sister attempts her own witchcraft on his father, which seems to work. The son catches on fast, he wants to know where Bjork and her sister come from, Bjork does not give him a straight answer just comments \\"somewhere far away, that does not exist anymore\\", this film will take your imagination far into the past. The clothing everyone wore was right for the time period, to me it was very Nomadic. Bjork is not only a great musician, but also a great actress. Her performance is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for die-hard fans...","review":"\\"The Juniper Tree\\" features Björk's first attempt at acting; though the movie is not very good, it is definitely worth taking a look at if only just to see Björk as a young actress! I would only recommend this movie to true Bjork fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay awake thru","review":"Movie is entirely in black and white. Very little dialogue. Very artsy. I had to watch it 5 times before I saw it all. Your not missing anything. Bjork is the only reason I watched, and even she wasn't enough. Without her I would have given 1 star. Get \\"dancer in the dark\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly...","review":"...Now, I've the utmost respect for Bjork's music and acting skills. Granted, she is decent enough in this. But this film would never have been released in the USA if she wasn't in it. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great NBA game","review":"Prior to this, I had not played a NBA video game since NBA 2k. Yup much has improved since then. The graphics, sound and physics are excellent. While most players have a great amount of precision, some players look outright scary. (like Ginobili) The arenas, the fans and the mascots are lifelike. Can't say the same about the fly girls. The create a player mode is also detailed but is very tedious. What I liked most in the game was the 24/7 game option. I would definitely recommend this game to any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"with the xbox 360 this game has really good graphics, really easy to play and very enjoyable with friends, plays 4 players."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBA2k7 - THE BEST Nba game/series","review":"This is easily the best and funnest nba game series. EA's NBA Live and that other NBA game are just garbage. The Live series has actually regressed too. The NBA2K series has been pretty similiar year to year, with mostly minor tweaks every year added. The biggest difference I noticed was the free throw system this year. While it's very different using the analog stick to shoot free throws on Xbox 360, it really only takes a few free throws to get it down. While the game isn't 100% perfect, it's pretty close to being. Using the analog stick instead of the buttons to shoot and do layups and dunks makes a ginormous difference, and recommended. And this game is incredibly fun too! Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best basketball game out there","review":"It doesn't get anymore realistic than NBA 2k7 for the Xbox 360.

In particular there is little information on NAT, and zero configuration examples. 4 months ago I recertified on the CCNA and one of the simulation questions was NAT configuration and at least 3 multiple choice were on NAT router commands. I am now tutoring 4 other engineers using this book and we've had to use Cisco Press books to cover NAT and other material that is missing. The Simulator in this book will not do OSPF and EIGRP (both crucial, so we bought Mr. Lammle's routersim from www.routersim.com, this does allow these routing protocols, but VTP doesn't work correctly with the simulator switches. In hindsight I would definitely use Cisco Press now, it doesn't appear that Sybex is keeping up. The Cisco books aren't as well written or real world, but they have everything you need to pass the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about enough to pass the exam","review":"After reading user reviews here on Amazon, I realized that this book, the 4th edition, was lacking in some areas...most notably, NAT. This deluxe edition though, included the virtual lab which I thought would be important since I do not have actual equipment to practice on.I'm glad that I went this route. I passed the exam today using this book, the virtual labs, practice tests and bonus exams included on the two CDs. I took approximately 2.5 to 3 weeks to study. I enjoyed the way the book is written and layed out. At no time did I find myself falling asleep in material that was not presented well enough to keep me awake. I supplemented my education in the areas that others had complained about and past my 55 question test with room to spare.If you do not need nor want the virtual lab, go with the later 5th edition of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simulator doesn't work well","review":"The text of the book seems decent enough, but the whole reason I bought the book was to get the router simulator software. This is supposed to be limited in scope, but sufficient to support the labs in the book. However, too many of the commands don't work even when entered verbatim, as specified in the labs. Someone obviously quit working on the software before it was finished. I am going to borrow a real router and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting writing style and lack of visual aids","review":"The writing style of this book is informal and distracts from the training process. The author lacks basic grammatical skills leading me to wonder if the book was edited at all. A complete lack of visual aids makes many portions of the text excruciatingly difficult to understand.If you are seeking a professionally written textbook then you should continue shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Network textbook","review":"This is a great book for learning the CCNA material. It will teach you all of the major points that you need to study to pass the exam. Even if you are not taking the exam and just want information on how networks are designed, this is the book. I found it a good read and the practice CD was priceless in learning how to issue commands to the various Cisco routers. A great book and worth the money too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"if you are learning CCNA by yourself and have a ciscopress book, but just understand half of the stuff, this book clear any doubt about the subject, its written in natural language, easier to understand than any other book of networking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the exam","review":"I'm sure you can pass the CCNA with this book even without any Cisco experiences as long as you read it through from cover to back.

I sat for my CCNA today and it the questions I got where not covered all that well in this book.

Admittedly I'm not a big fan of this brand of singing, but the hype had me curious. However, if this is someone's cup of tea, I can see why it would be embraced... it's safe material by a nonthreatening safe performer. For me it was just a whole lot of meaningless oversinging and affected delivery by an uninspiring singer/performer. Given more time and experience, she may yet develop into a performer with more depth and true star quality. It'll interesting to see if her fans will let her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Kelly","review":"I know it doesn't seem like it since I gave her two stars, but I do. I think she should stick to ballads and R&B. The \\"rock\\" songs are O.K., but not very well written. She has a more soulful voice and it is not displayed much here. I think she is very talented but she needs better songwriters. She has a bluesy voice which is showcased on \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\" which I like a lot. Also, only the photo on the inside looks like her! My Mother says they airbrushed too much. We know she probably didn't have much say this time around, but I think she will only get better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's true idol!","review":"This CD is awsome!

There are alot of different types of songs on this album ranging from ballads to R&B to gospel. However, the best song on this album is the killer ballad \\"Anytime\\", which should have been the first single. I also like the two 'American Idol' songs, \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Before Your Love\\" as both of these songs also showcase the range of her vocal ability. I think that Kelly is talented and has a great voice. She is not just another 'poptart'. However, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, she has some bad vocal habits and would benefit from some singing lessons.

I'm sticking to my guns and saying I should have been the one who had that glorious moment! My heart burns with rage when I hear Kelly's voice on the radio! Someone gave this CD to me as a gift b/c they thought even though I was rejected from the auditions, I would love to have the winner's album. What an idiot.

She can show the world that even though you aren't a size 0, you can still dress nice, NOT sleezy! I was expecting a great CD full of hits like \\"A Moment Like This\\" But she came out just like Christina Auguleira, all sleezy and gross.

Kelly Clarkson in my opinioon is like the ulimate snob. when she was on American Idle she sent the message that you only should like guys that have UGLY looks & no brains and that your life is going to be misareble if you are yourself.

Not only does she sing the heck out of the songs she also co-wrote several. For a debut album that is amazing. I can't wait to see the wonderful things Kelly will do in the future. I highly recommend this album if you don't have it already. We can expect great things from this one. Congrats to Kelly and I wish you the best is all that comes your way. You deserve it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Love this CD!!","review":"I am really happy with this CD. Kelly Clarkson has come through with a CD that will put critics to rest! This CD is amazing. Her voice is so powerful and beautiful and one of the best thing about the CD is the variety. You get to sample the full range of her talent. This CD will spawn many hits for Kelly and is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"UMM... WOW! This album is amazing. Kelly sounds great! I would highly reccomend it (even though the \\"new mixes\\" are the exact same of Moment... and Before...). Clive Davis produces it and everyone knows whatver he touches turns out to be amazng. 10 out of 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better (and different) than I expected!","review":"I bought Kelly Clarkson's cd yesterday and have already listened to the entire album several times. Being a fan, I knew I would probably like the album, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself loving it. I am so glad the label waited to put together a solid album for Kelly rather than throwing something together right after she won American Idol. I think this cd will prove that Kelly is not a flash in the pan.The album is very mature for such a brand new artist. What I really liked is that there are several different styles of music on the album. There are pop songs,there are soulful ballads and also some rock. I was most surpised to hear a couple songs that sound more Alanis than American Idol. Every song on the album is one that I could hear playing on the radio and becoming a hit. Even if you aren't a die-hard fan of Kelly's I think you will like this cd. I think Ms. Clarkson will have many more fans with the release of \\"Thankful\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good, some borderline","review":"Some songs are definitely single material (Low, Just Missed the Train, Anytime, as well as current single Miss Independent) But others lack as much feeling as when we all heard \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Before Your Love\\"The song \\"You Thought Wrong\\" featuring Tamara Gray was great also.1.

It's amazing that she went undiscovered for so long.I can't wait for her next album to come out. This girl is a true \\"Class Act\\"! She is here to stay, and I know that we can expect great things from her in the future.And contrary to what Simon said about Fantasia being the best he has heard on American Idol, well he needs to have his ears cleaned out because Kelly is the BEST!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\\" Kelly Kelly Kelly *ducka ducka ducka*","review":"Kelly Clarkson is an incredibly talented, soulful, young singer who has been compared to Mariah, Whitney, and Celine. The album 'Thankful' has a little something for everyone, soulful r&b ballads like 'The Trouble With Love Is', and 'Some Kind of Miracle, pop ballads, like 'Anytime', 'A Moment Like This', and 'Before Your Love', fun pop songs like, 'Miss Independent', 'Beautiful Disaster', and 'Whats Up Lonely, cool rock songs like 'Just Missed the Train', 'Low', and 'You Thought Wrong' (featuring the freakin' awesome Tamyra Gray),and we can't forget the title track, r&b 'Thankful.' This album is really great, and Kelly's voice is so powerful. For your first listen check out 'Anytime', 'You Thought Wrong', 'Beautiful Disaster' and 'Just Missed the Train!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best CD's to have","review":"Thankful is one of the best CD's that everyone needs for their collection. There is every style of music you could want. Kelly Clarkson's voice is beautiful and romantic which makes the songs wonderful. If you like Kurt Nilsen, Clay Aiken, Ryam Malcolm or even Kimberley Locke then you will LOVE this CD!!!!! She is great and has a voice like the greatest of singers!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful coz this album is amazing!","review":"Kelly Clarkson does not disappoint me with this amazing debut album. It is so rare to find a CD where i love every single track, in fact i think this is the only CD that i can say i love every single song! When i put it on, i have to play it from the start as i dont want to skip over one!A really brilliant album, Kelly's vocals are unbelievable and definately worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Wait!","review":"Great album that incorporates practically every genre of music out there. She does a great job!Finally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I thought that this cd was amazing! It not only had ballads but it had upbeat r&b tracks to! I am such a huge fan of Kelly's and i highley recommed her album!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly thankful","review":"I never watched the American Idol series as it took a couple of months longer to view over here and I could just find out the goss on the net anyway. A friend who was and still is obsessed with kelly clarkson raved about her and I had heard the upbeat single \\"Miss independant\\" and loved it so decided to get the album. Money well spend I must say nearly every song is worth listening to. They are all well written and there are none that verge on that pathetic sappy barrier we all hate. Standouts for me were \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" \\"trouble with love is\\" and \\"Low\\" and the best thing about this album is it has a good mix of ballads and up tempo songs so you never get bored of it. I was surprised that such a manufactured act could be so versitile and this album really impressed me so I'll be hanging out for the album. The record company had their money well spent for production for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I thought I was gonna fall asleep. I really love her new hit Miss Independent....very full of life and danceable, but it seems to be the only song on the CD that will probably make it. I'm no critic, just thought I'd let you know if you expect a CD based on the first hit. I expected the whole CD to be like this, or at least a majority. But it was way too mellow for my taste. It sounded just like a Christina Aguilera CD (I wasn't surprised to find out she helped write some of the songs) that I thought it was hers. I think they could have done much better with Kelly's talent instead of just made her another Christina. Very disappointed and have given it a few spins only to find out it simply will not grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"After listening to this CD I asked myself was it worth the price that I paid for it and I have to be honest \\"no\\".It should have been titled \\"Nothing Special\\". Cut after cut I kept waiting for at least one song on the CD that didn't sound as if it had already been done before but it just wasn't there. My advice is save your money or buy my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Great service, lightning fast speed. Great product from a really great Band. Thanks so much for every thing. I really appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful for Thankful! (couln't resist)","review":"Fantastic sounding album! Kelly has a great and soulful voice which she uses to great effect here with a nice variety of material. The \\"new mixes\\" of AMLT and BYL don't add anything to the album and should have been left off for more new songs. All in all, a very enjoyable listening experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Idol off to a Great Start!...","review":"Wow....this album really showcases Kelly's amazing vocal range. She is an incredible talent and she proves that America chose the right person to win with her songs on this album. Some of the standout tracks include her hit single co-written by Christina Aguilera (\\"Miss Independent\\"), \\"Some Kind Of Miracle,\\" \\"Just Missed the Train,\\" and her original Idol hits \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Before Your Love.\\" Any fan of the show and Kelly wil definitely like the album. Congratulations Kelly! You deserve the best!! And for those of you that think Tamyra should have won, never fear....Kelly duets with Tamyra on \\"You Thought Wrong.\\" So, now you have no excuse....there is no reason for you to not want this album. Go Get It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"It's a pretty good for her debut cd. Of course, it has some slow songs, esp.\\"The trouble with Love Is\\" and \\"Thankful\\". They're very plain, and have notthing speacial going on about them. Also, the rest of the eight songs (#2-#8) are good. It comes with her two singles she released after she won on American Idol, which are considered \\"bonus tracks\\". Overall, i would rate it 4&1/2 stars, because there is still something about this cd that makes me enjoy the album, along with her eloquent voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look What You've Done, Shame On You","review":"This CD just goes to show the further dumbafication of America. The fact that some talentless nobody can stand in front of billions of people and shell out some dribble that some puppeteer behind the scenes throws together is beyond me. All Kelly Clarkson fans should be ashamed of themselves. Everyone should go and find something they enjoy and not just accept whatever some record executive decides to shovel out to you that particular month. C'mon wake up people, this music is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"honest","review":"only song i like on here is miss independant.

All this new stuff that keeps comming out. So she has a good voice, that doesn't mean she has talent. If you want to listen to music that makes life worth living listen to Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Cream, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Allman Brothers Band, Jimi Hendrix, or Creedence Clearwater Revival. These guys know how to rock and make it sound amazing. Do yourself a favor and make the right choice. It's for the good of the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD!ITS AWFUL","review":"Save your money.DO not buy this cd.ITS ALL HYPE.BUY A CD withsomeone who has real talent-Mariah Carey,Barbra Streisand,Celine,or LINDA EDER.buy LISA MARIE PRESLEYS CD.THIS IS NOT THE AMERICANIDOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's to be 'Thankful' for?","review":"Note to Ms. Clarkson: Taking the faux-R&B route will not make you credible, it will merely make you boring. As a fan of manufactered pop, I had high hopes that Kelly Clarkson's debut album would feature cheesy ballads, one or two upbeat poppy numbers, and at least one ill-advised cover track. No such luck. Instead Kelly and her handlers have delivered a retro-marinated R&B snoozer. 'Miss Independent' is cute, but it's lacking something. 'Low' has a catchy chorus and will sound okay on the radio. 'You Thought Wrong' (which features Tamyra Gray) should have been a guilty pleasure tell off song, but it's more gutless than guilty. The rest of the album tracks mesh together in their attempted 'soulfulness'. An artist like Kelly Clarkson (who has a great voice and infectious personality) should be trying to win our affection not our respect. This album and Kelly's chosen career path are a bitter disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the humanity!","review":"From this point out, I shall only refer to Ms. Clarkson by her proper title...The Queen of Uncool (QoU). To have an \\"incredible\\" voice (as others like to point out) she is quite unoriginal. QoU's voice may be in top form (I disagree) but the rest of her is just a mess. Half the time I see her with a scarf wrapped around her neck, was she bit by The Master or is she just ripping off Rogue from X-Men??? Other times I see her in ill fitted gowns looking peculiarly awkward, of course that could just be the Texan in her. To be honest she gives me a greater appreciation for Mariah Carey, something I thought I'd never utter in my life. Just wanted to add she has a carbface too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful is great!","review":"Kelly Clarkson has an amazing voice, and I'm so glad that her cd finally came out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Thankful\\" I did not buy this CD","review":"She may be the winner of American Idol, but this album is mostly slow songs! I heard snippets of it in a CD store one day and thought that all the songs sounded the same. As for \\"A Moment like This\\" how many more releases will they put this on? Most of these songs are too slow to keep me interested for long...To think that this girl outsold the Beatles... I would have liked to have seen more uptempo songs on this CD... The thing that is missing from this is a little bit of everything else...We will see how she will fair when Justin has his chance to shine.. From what I have heard he has a strong chance to make a showing... Sorry Kelly, maybe next time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzz","review":"I loved Kelly in AI but this CD really doesn't showcase her great voice.

I must admit that I am very dissapointed with the end results. Ms.Clarkson's vocals are good however the overall production of this CD lacks direction. The songs selected are \\" GRADE B Pop \\" as they badly attempt to imitate hits from a multitude of artists currently listed on the BMG roster. Ms.Clarkson's CD is nothing more than a bad melting pot of grade B pop songs. Clarkson should carefully package the next CD if she does not want to end up fizzeling faster than MENUDO did on the North American charts !"},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm just so disappointed.","review":"i pre-ordered this cd a while ago, then i heard 30 second clips. and i have to say, don't buy this cd unless you're prepared to sit through 11 ballads and get only TWO uptempo songs! don't get me wrong, she's got THE voice, but kelly.... you really let me down. once my cd comes in the mail, i'm returning it. hopefully the next will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD. It was nothing like the songs she sang on American Idol. Her music is very hard compared to the music she portrayed on AI. The CD forces you to install software you dont want onto your computer (If you play it on your computer), just so you can watch the Video. You are force fed pop up's from the software imbedded in the CD.

So I thought, I\`d give our American idol a fair shake and started listening to Kelly and Clay\`s album.Oh boy!It was painful.Typical manufactured pop music.No originality nor quality that I look from a musician.I didn\`t feel the poetry and the substance from the music when they sing.In short, theirs is very ordinary whereas Kurt\`s album is exceptional and astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"All I can say is it makes for great listening.

The duet with Tamyra Gray, You Thought Wrong, almost made me deaf with its loud intensity during the chorus... it is a good song though.

Think Christina Aguilera, who co-wrote the song \\"Miss Independent\\" and uses the same intonations to pull it off. Ms. Clarkson is another copycat oversinger with more screaming than soul.It is so obvious that the production was as contrived as a Britney Spears cd, but, Britney comes across with a sense of humor about the whole thing. Kelly Clarkson is just another one of the singers, the young fans can say \\"oh she is the only one can sing\\" meanwhile they learn only that singing is about vocal acrobatics and not emotions.Ms. Clarkson needs to get together with some competent songwriters which does not include master of hooks Dianne Warren or \\"miss girlpower\\" Christina Aguilera. A fresh approach to singing and songwriting and you might have half a chance.Maybe when a Joplinesque or Stevie Nicks influenced singer hits the scene then we can talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD","review":"With such a powerful and amazing voice on American Idol, how can Kelly Clarkson have released such a terrible CD?

She sang great on the AI Christmas Special. The reason she was so good was because she had such volume. She just yells too much. If you like yelling and volume then you will like her. But as far as just singing, she is just ok. She is trying too hard to be cool, like with the nose piercing. That was just a bit much. I just wish that she had just stayed herself. After being so impressed with Clay, I guess I just lost interest in her. He does not have to strain at all. He is a natural and will not change who he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the industry coming to???","review":"I remember when the music industry had real stars selling records instead of Star Search contest winners who scream instead of sing.

I've never liked Kelly Clarkson(then, why am I reviewing this)and the only reason my brain has suffered from this no talent bad singer/reality tv star is because of my 10 years old sister.Kelly Clarkson in my opinion is like the ulimate snob. when she was on American Idle she sent the message that you only should like guys that have looks but no brains and that your life is going to be misareble if you are yourself. She says she has always wanted to be a singer but she never said that until she went on the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"The American Idol herself..Miss Kelly Clarkson proves herself as an artist on this debut album.This album has a variety of different genres of music on it,that everyone will like,although i feel Kelly shines her best on the slow rnb ballads songs.The Standout tracks to me:Anytime-the best track on the album,show Kelly vocal powerThe Trouble With Love IsSome Kind Of MiracleWhat's Up LonelyJust Missed The TrainThankfulBeautiful DiasterThe only complaint i had about the album was i thought it was too short,and the bonus tracks wasn't needed.This cd is for anybody that like REAL music and a GREAT vocalist..(which is hard to find in the music industry today)..THAT IS WHY I R-E-S-P-E-C-T KELLY CLARKSON AND IS PROUD TO BE A FAN..AND I THINK SHE ONE OF KIND AND I FEEL SHE WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME TO COME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better.","review":"This cd is ok.NOT Grammy worthy.Theres nothing special aboutKelly Clarkson.She sounds to much like Mariah and Christina.Nooriginality in her voice.She needs to develop her own style instead of copying other artists.She is NO MADONNA.KELLY,you needto stop copying other artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm \\"thankful\\" for this album","review":"This is an incredible debut album! The songs are great and each one has something different about it. She definitely explores many different musical areas and not just ballads (which is what I thought it would be). The 2 best songs are her first single off the album, \\"Miss Independent\\", and her collaberation with former Idol Tamyra Gray entitled \\"You Thought Wrong\\" (in my opinion this will be an amazing single). The only thing wrong with this album is the length- there's only 10 songs and 2 \\"bonus tracks\\" that aren't really bonuses at all...they're supposed \\"new mixes\\" of her 2 songs \\"Before Your Love\\" and \\"A Moment Like This\\" which sound the same as the versions released last year.

Kelly is not as fantastic as people pumped her up to be, she tries to hit notes like Mariah Carey, but when she does it sounds like screeching or screaming and is idstasteful, she did it with the song respect on American Idol too and i was not impressed.I dunno it is obvious that Tamyra Gray was cheated from what should have rightfully been hers. Kelly's voice is not at all fit for singing she should get into Rock where people can shout and scream notes and the fans love it but for me this CD was a waste of time...Sorry I dunno if it was a racial thing where people voted for Kelly because she is caucasian or what but Kelly sure did not win based on talent and it is sad. I think people need to move away from the idea that african americans are not talented because they are Tamyra is definently one of them.I am proud of both ladies for singing their best but Tamyra comes out on top everytime..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankful? For What?","review":"Boring, trite, bland, unoriginal, screamfest are some words that came to mind when I heard this album. Kelly has one good song on this album, Miss Independent (written by Christina Aguilera), but that will be her only hit from this album. The rest of the album is boring and bland. Kelly should utilize her voice and make the song special instead of screaming every note she possibly can, but than again, with songs this stupid, she doesn't have much to work with. Kelly is way too homely. She doesn't have what it takes to be a star. Her voice is average to say the least. Her 15 minutes of fame will be up soon and from the looks of her movie with Justin Guarini that flopped horribly, it looks to be that way. Good riddens."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song","review":"One good song: The trouble with love. And I already had it on the Love Actually soundtrack. Kind of a waste. I should have listened to the puking sounds my son makes every time Kelly Clarkson is mentioned. But that one good song is so good I hoped she had some others. Good voice, lots of talent. Rotten material. Aretha Franklin didn't get where she is by choosing bad songs. I guess that's the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD, it's awesome - every song is amazing!","review":"I really love this CD. Kelly sings all the songs great and the songs themselves are just plain good to listen to! I'm very glad I bought it! Low, Miss Independent, You thought Wrong, Beautiful Disaster, Just Missed the Train, Thankful, What's Up Lonely are my favorites ... and I still love every other song too. It's awesome, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE DESERVED TO WIN","review":"I THINK THE RIGHT CHOICE WAS MADE. I HAVE LISTENED TO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE TO SEE HOW CORNY IT MIGHT BE. WE'LL SEE. I WISH HER LOTS OF LUCK AND WELLNESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything you read is true....","review":"Kelly Clarkson is an absolute powerhouse as a vocalist, but she needs to stop hiding behind her production team and step out center stage where she belongs!This CD is pure pop fluff and promises to be so much more than it ends up being. I expect great great things from Ms. Clarkson if she takes some risks on her next project. A very safe endeavor, indeed for an artist who, if she starts running her own show will shine like the American Idol that she could be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amercian Idol","review":"OK I enjoyed the first season of \\"American Idol\\" and was thrilled to see Kelly win....but now the 15 minutes of fame has gone to her head. All the songs on this third rate album sound too much like a second rate Madonna,Christina,Whitney,Celine wannabe! And why is Kelly turning into a badly dressed, over-pierced drag queen! What happen to the great songwriters and talented producers that were promised! I hope the winner of Season 2 has a better first outing then Kelly! Maybe the second album will be better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS ALL HYPE","review":"This cd its all the marketing.They hyped it up.Kelly is a goodsinger.But there is nothing SPECIAL about her voice.She is noBARBRA STREISAND OR LINDA EDER.SHE JUST SCREAMS THE SONGS.Thescream scares my cat.COME ON KELLY.YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!do not buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on Thankful...","review":"I believe this CD is very good in many ways, and bad in others. One thing I did like about the CD is that it showed Kelly's whole vocal range. However, I did not like how some of the songs sounded alike. This CD is very much a blues CD, with the exception of Miss Independent and You Thought Wrong featuring Tamyra Gray. There are also some alternative songs, such as Beautiful Disaster. And of course, with every young girl singer, there are going to be some pop songs. However, these songs are slow, and I love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*Kelly is the best!*","review":"I LOVE this CD! This is Kelly at her best! She is beautiful, and she has a GREAT voice! My personal favorites are: Miss Independent, The Trouble With Love Is, and Some Kind of Miracle. You should really buy this CD if you haven't alreadyLuv ya Kelly!KatieA New Kelly Clarkson fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"her voice is extremely powerful, and honestly to me her voice sounds like an angel. The songs aren't what I had expected but I still love the cd. My favorite song is \\"you thought wrong\\" ft. Tamyra Gray...There aren't as much upbeat songs as I thought there would be but still this is easy listening, and u could tell how powerful her voice is :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, but could have been better","review":"A lot of people have high expectations for this CD and I am one of them. There are good songs on here, it's just that some of them are nothing unique. SOME KIND OF MIRACLE is a typical love song that, to me, is just fluff. Although, I did like how a couple of the songs have a pop/blues sound to it. The only major thing that irks me about this CD are the 2 \\"new\\" mixes of A MOMENT LIKE THIS and BEFORE YOUR LOVE because they sound exacltly like the originals. Overall though, it is a good CD, she can only getter better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted to hear!","review":"I enjoyed listening to Kelly Clarkson sing when she was on American Idol, and still feel that she has an excellent voice. She sold out on this album. The songs that were chosen for this album were all chosen to appeal to the young age group, who will spend a lot of money on buying her album. I think she sold out! Her voice is too powerful to do songs that do not showcase it. I would have preferred to hear her do more ballads, like \\"Anytime\\". I do not feel this album is \\"her\\" style, and I feel that the record label wanted her to do music that would appeal to the buying public. I was let down by this album. All of the songs sound the same, and have that rough beat to them. If you are over 30, you probably will not enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm THANKFUL for THANKFUL!","review":"Kelly Clarkson's Debut Album THANKKFUL is a refreshing combination of Pop,R&B,Soulful Ballads and Rock.Kelly can sing Like no other and she puts her signature sound on each and every track!..Displaying the versatility and creativity (she wrote on the album) that made us fall in love with this talented Texan this is a must addition to anyones collection who is a true lover of music..Honestly this is the only CD I can put on and listen to from start to finish! Yes it is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Thankful for Kelly Clarkson!!","review":"Kelly Clarkson is by far my favorite singer ever! She is so versitle and genuine. I really feel that she does not have to dress like Britney to get attention, because her voice is so powerful. I love Thankful and it is probably one of my favorite cd's ever. My favorite song on the album is Just Missed the Train because I just love that song. I saw her in concert with Clay Aiken and of course she was amazing. This cd rocks and I think Kelly is here for the long run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of potential, but...","review":"There's no denying Kelly has great vocal chops. Unfortunately, no matter how well she sings, there's only so much she can do with material as weak and generic as this. These songs could have been given to any flavor-of-the-week pop singer. Kelly has a unique, Southern-soul voice that recalls great singers from the past like Aretha Franklin and Dusty Springfield. Given the right material, she could make an album that stands up to those artists' classics. This isn't that album. It may sell a ton of CDs, but unless she records songs that will stand the test of time, she's going to be just another quickie pop star. She deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Thankful\\" for this album","review":"I was very excited to hear Kelly Clarkson's debut album, \\"Thankful.\\" I was VERY disappointed! I have read many of the other reviews on this album, and I am starting to wonder if I have the same album as everyone else. How can anyone say that this album is great? She ruins every song on this album (except \\"Miss Independent\\"--which is the only reason I gave this album two stars)by desperately struggling to hit every note on the scale. KELLY, we already knew you could sing from American Idol, so why do you feel the need to oversing all of the songs?? There's only one person that can do that and get away with it and that's Mariah Carey. So don't try to be something you can't be. Anyways, I thought she was an awesome singer on American Idol, but this album is NOTHING like that. Don't waste your money on it! You'll be \\"thankful\\" if you don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a set of pipes!","review":"Kelly is an extremely talented singer. She can sing it all. All types. I wasn't happy having another CD with \\"Moment Like This\\" though. Wish they would have filled that slot with another song by this talented young lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Kelly Clarkson!!","review":"Even though this is Kelly's first cd I think it's the best thing she's done so far.I have liked her ever since American Idol and never stopped. This cd is very down to earth and I can relate to it which makes me want to listen to it more. The lyrics are very catchy and I can't wait to learn all the songs. I've only had the cd for a day and love it all ready. YOU GO KELLY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful is a good start for Ms. Clarkson","review":"I must admit that I was a little anxious to hear this CD!! And I wasn't disappointed. Despite some reviews which say she is trying to hard to fit into different genres, I find it to be the opposite. She is so original and soars on this album with ballads like \\"Anytime\\" (sure to be a hit)and \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\" (a Diane Warren tune) My personal favorite is the bluesy \\"Low\\". There is also a surprise in the form of a powerhouse female duet with fellow Amercan Idol contestant Tamyra Gray on \\"You Thought Wrong\\". It is reminiscent of the popular Brandy/Monica duet The Boy Is Mine, only they soar on \\"Wrong\\", proving why they both were Top 5 contestants. Run and get your copy today..you won't be disappointed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"America LOVES Kelly","review":"Not just for her bubbly, infectious personality, but also because of her booming voice. This girl can SANG! The only person I can think of with vocal chops like Kelly is Mariah in her prime.Anyhow, this is a great cd filled with a variety of music... something for everyone to enjoy. I love Thankful, You Thought Wrong, Miss Independent, The Trouble With Love Is, and just about everything else here.I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am TOTALLY SHOCKED by this album - 10 STARS!!!","review":"I was very excited to get album, but I was guarded since it was a debut album and a contest winner. I couldn't have been more WRONG!Producer, Clive Davis, is a mastermind. The material on this album is insanely GOOD. Great lyrics and masterful mixing will catipult this album to the stars. Kelly's voice is amazing and she shows true flexibility in the various types of songs on this album. All of songs are good, but my favorites are: Anytime (which might be the next single), Thankful and Miss Independent (not the best material on the album, but she performs it nicely). I liked the duet with Tamyra Gray, but I was hoping it wouldn't be such a screecher and allow the song to showcase their incredibly strong voices.Get the word out to everyone! This album is very mainstream and should please most audiences..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"I didn't buy her CD right away, not until after I heard Miss Independent. I hadn't bought ANY CD's before I got Clay's. But he inspired me to build a collection. I don't understand why critics think this is cheesy. What is cheesy anyway? My favorite songs are Miss Independent!, What's Up Lonely, Beautiful Disaster, Thankful and Anytime. My least fave is You Thought Wrong only because it is too boggled or something. I get confused as to who is singing, Tamyra or Kelly. Of course, I also love the 2 bonus tracks, A Moment Like This and Before Your Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"We waited this long for this???","review":"Okay, I will admit to being a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson. Finally there is a star who can actually sing live! American Idol was a great stepping stone for her, but I've been waiting for months now to hear what direction the record company would take her, and YUCK! The album is not what I expected in the least.... it's a mix of Christina Aguilera discards..... Kelly has such an amazing vocal range that she seems stifled on this album... Hopefully there will be enough support for a second album..... and maybe the soundtrack to the movie will throw out some good singles.... who knows....I wish the best to Kelly and I hope she does well, but she needs to get control of her beginning career and give American and the world something that the other youngsters can't bring to the table... Kelly has Raw Talent!!! Unleash it and hopefully remix some of the songs and then we will see her shine!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Kelly Kelly","review":"All I have to say is AMAZING! I don't think I know anyone who doesn't like at least 1 song on the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Surprise","review":"Although I never followed American Idol, I heard stories about it on the news. As soon as I head the song Miss Independent I went and bought the cd. What a pleasant surprise. This cd is great. Although some songs should have been left out, there are other great ones. These are: The Trouble with Love is, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, Beautiful Disaster and Anytime (this one being my favorite). Buy this cd if you love pop music. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! WONDERFUL! COOL!","review":"There are many more words that I can use to describe this album. I can't stop listening to it! It's a great cd, sometihng I've been waiting for a very long time. All the songs are great, Kelly's voice is extraordinary and wonderful. This girl can sing! And the songs chosen for her really show off her voice and talent and they are perfect for her. Don't think twice about getting this cd....just get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From American Idol to Superstar","review":"Kelly breaks away from the AI safety net and launches her career with this awesome set that showcases her versatility. She has the potential to be all things to all people. Now she needs to concentrate on developing her OWN sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"I just got this cd, and I love it!! All the songs are absolutely wonderful, the only thing was that I could not tell the difference from the newer versions of her first two songs. But otherwise it was absolutely wonderful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Kelly is a great singer. I love her voice. But I only like 2 songs on this disc and those 2 songs were on the \\"American Idol\\" cd. I really didn't like the rest of the cd. I'm hoping her next cd will have better songs. When she was on American Idol I really liked it best when she was singing older songs. I think a cd of remakes by Kelly would be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"What a disappointment. As a big fan of Kelly Clarkson on the American Idol show, I was excited for her CD to be released. Not only is the music selection \\"me too\\" for hip hop/soul, but the mixing was totally out of balance. I could hardly hear her great voice over the loud instrumentation. What's the point of having a talent search for someone with talent and originality when she's just going to be forced to be a wannabe Christina Agulera, etc. I still think she's one of the most talented voices out there. She just needs to have a more talented producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate","review":"I have listened, and re-listened, and re-listened to this album in hopes of seeing a glimpse of the adorable woman who captured our hearts last summer.Sadly, it is not to be.I had hoped to hear something akin to the bluesy songs Kelly chose to perform on the show last year, bringing back raw rootsy american music into the mainstream. Instead, the recycled sound of the worst type of pop filters through my stereo speakers.For those who believe that there is no such thing as \\"good\\" pop music, I suggest you re-listen to The Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\", to Ben Harper's \\"Burn to Shine\\", and to U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" all fine examples of the best pop (okay, maybe it's a stretch to call Harper \\"pop\\" but he did receive quite a bit of radio airplay) has to offer.To those searching for a little bit of soul in pop music, I suggest you forget about Kelly Clarkson's debut, and check back for her next effort. Her voice is beautiful--perhaps next time her producers will actually create something worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING SPECIAL","review":"This cd is ok.KELLY IS NOT SUPERSTAR status.I would not recommend this cd.Kelly needs a vocal coach.She a karoake singer.Poor arrangements,MISS INDEPENDENT is awful.This albumis too bland.Nothing special about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY IDOL","review":"I was looking forward to getting this cd that I popped it in my cd changer for the road. 1 minutes into listening to the the first song I starting to scan through all the tracks.....I ALMOST FEEL ASLEEP. Kelly's voice is so powerful when she was singing other's people's songs but oh the songs on her own cd are soo boring and had no dimensions. All the songs sounds the same, mellow, and outdated. So sad how a cd with such notable names backing it up is so bland and unexciting. Maybe its just me but I am usually open to broad range of music...but somehow I couldn't get into this one. Oh well....I guess I was just so dissapointed I had to write an input."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the better pop cd's out there...","review":"I would prefer a Hilary, Christina, Mandy, Britney, or a Jesdsica cd any day... Clarkson has no breath control and really can't carry a tune, besides the songs here are not very good in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed So Much","review":"I had expected this to be really great after waiting so long.But as you listen to the tracks they are so generic that you can attribute them immediately to the other singers who's style they represent.Kelly has absolutely no style of her own...just sings what is in front of her. No major complaints about her voice it's quite good except really...no style whatsoever.I wanted to like this cd, I really did.It was a huge disappointment. I would be surprised if she comes out with another one right way. I am hoping Guarini does better, his voice was just as good and he definitely has style of his own. Grey however...sounds oddly tinny on the track on the Clarkson album."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"How can anybody that listens to good music give this album more than one star! The only good song on this terrible album is, \\"A moment like this\\". All the other tracks are AWFUL!!!!!!!! I listen to all kinds of music and I remember Kelly on AI and thought she had a good voice. I borrowed this album from my nieces and was shocked after I listened to it. Did she get a voice coach to tell her that she needs to scream more, because that is what people want to hear? I have to admit I do not usually listen to Christina A., Britney S. or any other young no talent singers. I really liked Kelly on the show AI, but the lyrics and singing on this album are AWFUL!!!!!!!! Buy Norah Jones instead - MUCH MUCH BETTER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing There","review":"I am very thanful that we are able to listen to samples.

I look forward to buying more Kelly albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant Deubt Album, Well Done Kelly","review":"Kelly could of released her album a few months after American Idol ended to cash in on the hype like other Idol alums and it would of had no artistic component.But Kelly waited to stay true to herself and prove to the world that she's no flash in the pan. Thankful fullfills this sentiment by being one of the best deubt albums by any artist in the past few years. From the soul renching opening number \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\" penned by Clarkson herself to the sweet melodic sounds of \\"Just Missed the Train\\" this album is stellar. It scares me to think how good Kelly will be when she loosing the chains more from the record label and breaks free as an all out artist. If she's this good already with some comprimise look out world Kelly Clarkson is gonna be a force to reckon with"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best American Idol!","review":"Kelly has put together one of the best c.d's i have ever heard.

Although, I do agree with the person who said that the beggining of the song \\"Low\\" did sound a bit like Avril Lavignes beggining to \\"Losing Grip.\\" You also might get bored when you listen to it a bazzilion kazzilion times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I hoped It would Be","review":"As an avid A.I. viewer, I couldn't wait to buy Kelly's new CD. I hoped it would be a great CD because I knew she had the talent if she could just get the right songs to showcase her fabulous voice. As I listened to one song after the other I realized this was going to be one hot CD! I liked every single song. I would catch myself humming a different one each day. \\"Thankful\\" played in my head for days and those ballads, especially \\"What's Up Lonely\\" all done to perfection. I loved Kelly and Tamyra's duet on \\"You Thought Wrong.\\" Wow, what fabulous job those two did on that one. It was so like one of those a diva duets they do on those VH1 Diva shows and it gave me goosebumps!! \\"Just MIssed The Train\\" was another good one.Yeah...I surely do recommend it....to all pop music lovers!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid","review":"This is a very good CD from our favorite American Idol. Kelly shows off her many different sides with some R&B sounds, a bit of country, some good rock sounds, and of course a few ballads. The duet with fellow Idol Tamayra Gray is very catchy and fun to listen to. Overall I would suggest you purchase this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice wasted on insipid songs","review":"A big fan of Kelly's from last season's show and I've been looking forward to her much-delayed cd. That said, there are five songs that I kind of enjoy (Anytime, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, You Thought Wrong). The other five are complete filler. The album as a whole seems to be a lot of fluff that has no particular feeling to it. And the bonus tracks were a complete waste of time. Not sure why they couldn't have included \\"Stuff Like that There\\" or something that would have been a true bonus. Just too many ballads, too much over-sweet filler. Just very, very bland. They should have put more effort into a cohesive cd instead of wasting her energy on what will likely be one of the worst movies of 2003. Not sure if this is a good sign for future Idol contestants, but I'm hopeful that Kelly will rebound from this and re-remind us why we voted for her in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is hot","review":"I gave this 5 stars cause she was the hottest singer on that show. And she has a great voice, cool name too :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This CD was a disappointment. Kelly is basically riding the coat tails of a very successful TV show. Her voice is the result of digital remastering on this CD. Although some of the tracks are decent, I was hoping for more. Miss Independent is probably the best song, but after that, you'd be better off just listening to someone with more talent. The second season of American Idol has far better performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Anything Here","review":"Kelly has boring generic songs on Thankful composed by hired songwriters. This album is standard over produced pop. She may be able to juice the American public for a few more years but then it will be lights out for this act. Everything associated with American Idol is hot right now and Kelly will remain popular as long as the show is. Clarkson brings nothing new to the table and would find a better home at country fairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the hook?","review":"Kelly who? Kelly, if you're making some money now better hang on to it or invest it for the future. Bravo on 'making it' on American idol... what spell did you have on the voters? Yeah, yeah... Lee Trevino was subjected to critism when his peers commented 'you got lucky' after winning a tournament. Lee's come back was... 'funny, the more I practice, the luckier I get.' How does this apply to Kelly? Really, Kelly, you did get lucky. No doubt about it... lucky. I really believe she can't sing without yelling it and that really gets to be annoying after a bit (a very short bit) as well as there is nothing unique to the sound of her voice as compared to Jann Arden, Amy Sky, Carolyn Dawn Johnston and the list goes on. Time will tell... in a year from now (or less) the term will be 'Kelly who'. A short blaze in the pan... good luck in your next endeavor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!...","review":"I expected a really good cd from kelly but i didnt expect it to be THIS great!! seriously its not often where you can listen to a whole cd from the first song to the last and not skip over some!... i love it! cant wait till her next one! ; )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"This album is AWESOME!!

She does a variety of different styles of music on this cd and she can sing like no other. We are a little partial here in Texas though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful for the fresh sounds...","review":"Kelly could have been swept up by some producers looking to crank out a quick (and quickly forgotten) moment in pop culture. I for one am THANKFUL that didn't happen. The twelve tracks here showcase an honest talent. Kelly's provactive voice is neatly wrapped around some quite listenable tunes. The girl has the pipes to over sing a power ballad like \\"A Moment Like This\\" or \\"Before Your Love\\" and I was expecting a disk full of moments like that. Whatever Kelly put on disk was bound to sell and dart to the top of the charts. Thank goodness someone took the time to make a quality album in the process. \\"Low\\" is a standout for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now what I expected, but good.","review":"I was a fan of Kelly Clarkson during the first season of American Idol, so I have had an interest in this album since she won. I didn't expect it to do well, thinking that it would probably only be ballads, but then I heard her perform \\"Miss Independent\\" on this season's American Idol, and I was glad. That song seemed the type that would be a radio and Billboard hit. However, I was a little disappointed that the song sounded too much like Christina Aguilera, and that Kelly didn't have her own style. I bought the CD today, and I am impressed. \\"Miss Indepedent\\" is not representative of the rest of the album. There were a few tracks that were a little too bland for me, but on the average the tracks were good and refreshing. I like the direction Kelly is moving in. This album reminds me of Alicia Keys, but with more of a beat. Good job Kelly, I'm proud that you're from Texas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start","review":"Kelly's debut album really shows why she wont the AI title. Unfortunetly, I don't think that show has come up with any other stellar talent since then and should've quit after the first season. The only songs that I really don't care for are A Moment Like this and Before Your Love; although Kelly does an excellent job vocally. They are just too cookie-cutter-like ballads. The rest of the CD is great-full of Kellys powerful vocals and shows off her wonderful range and control. I look forward to many more great albums from this talented young lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This highly anticipated album was worth the wait. Kelly's voice brings quality to each song. The moodsy lyrics on \\"The Trouble With Love is\\" brings chills to you. Ballads such as \\"Some Kind Of Miracle\\" and \\"Anytime\\" showcase her vocal diversity. The upbeat tunes of \\"Miss Independent\\" \\"Low\\" and \\"You Thought Wrong\\" add a pop quality for the young at heart.\\"What's Up Lonely\\" \\"Just Missed The Train\\" \\"Thankful\\" and \\"Anytime\\" are all songs that could very well get alot of airtime on Adult Contemporaty stations. \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" with it's rock style really stands on it's own. No need to skip any track on this one. Overall, this album rates high because of it's diversity. Kelly and company have definitely put out a quality list of tracks. Well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!!","review":"Albums usually take MUCH longer than a few months to put together, so I assumed that Kelly's first album would be decent, but still very generic and predictable. I was blown away with this album!! Every song is so different and the diversity of genres is bound to please all music lovers. You can find blues, rock, ballads and even a bit of hip-hop. Her duet with Tamyra Gray is definitely one of the cd's highlights, along with \\"Just Missed the Train,\\" \\"What's up Lonely\\" and the power ballad \\"Anytime\\" Kelly Clarkson's incredible voice shines throughout. I highly reccomend this album to anyone with a broad range of musical interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 reasons NOT to buy this cd","review":"I am an AI fan who couldn't wait for this cd to come out. After listening to it I was seriously dissapointed and have been trying to give it away since for three reasons:1. It's much much much more R & B than pop2. There are NO SINGABLE LYRICS (which is boring and no fun)- nothing catchy!3. The musak behind the lyrics is, well, musak. Not interesting or dynamic at all.I like Kelly Clarkson, but as Simon might say- \\"not your best performance\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"she is my idol","review":"i know that kelly was the american idol but i am an aussie and she is my idol,my australian idol.kellys album is awsome i am going to buy it when i get the money.i love the song trouble with love is,i sing so i got the lyrics and i am learning to sing it. I also play the paino so mabey one day i will be able to sing and play.this album rocks and i love kelly YOU ARE MY IDOL KELLY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love this cd! It really showcases Kelly's talented singing. I hope that her other albums will be just as good or even better! She has a fantastic voice and I really hope that she wins a grammy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This CD is great. Every song is worth listening to. She is so soulful and has a wonderful voice. This CD has a blue-sy, R&B vibe to it. I would recommend this CD even if you didn't watch or enjoy American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exciting.","review":"I expected much more from this American Idol winner. Her incredible voice was showcased on the show to millions of viewers, and I thought to myself (If this girl wins, she will be the next Mariah Carey)However, I just think this album was thrown together way to fast. It has an un-inspired feeling when listening it. I think Kelly Clarkston should consider writing some lyrics of her own, and chosing some songs that showcase her vocal range.She has talent, but it is just not being shown in the right ways on her first disc. Of course there are some catchy tunes here \\"Miss Independent,\\" and \\"Low\\" are the strongest songs here (coincendentally the first two singles) and the rest sounds like filler. Maybe and hopefully her follow-up will be more inspired, and more thought-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I followed the first season of American Idol religiously. I didn't miss an episode. The whole time I loved Kelly. (even though I was cheering for Justin) I had so much respect for Kelly. She made everything her own no matter if she was singing songs from the big band era or a brand new song off Celine Dions new album. She was solid in every type of music from every time period. But I was so so so disappointed in her album. I found myself only listening to \\"A moment like this\\" and \\"Before your love\\" songs that I was already tired of. To me it didn't sound like she had her heart and soul in it. Almost as if she was just singing it to get the song recorded and over with. It wasn't the same Kelly I watched and cheered on American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"I consider myself a big Kelly Clarkson fan, but this album is a huge disappointment. The only song I enjoyed listening to was \\"Just Missed The Train\\".She is an awesome performer live, but this studio stuff is just total junk. The music and lyrics range from awful to average. The production and arrangements are just horrid.Hopefully, they will let her pick her own songs next time (I can only hope she didn't pick these)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Kelly!!","review":"I think that with this CD, Kelly Clarkson proves once and for all why she was chosen to be America's very first idol! It features Kelly using her great talent on a number of very diverse tracks. Some of the best include Low, Just Missed the Train, and Beautiful Disaster. I don't think that I will ever get tired of listening to this CD. Pick it up if you get the chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"I got this cd not because I liked the songs \\"A Moment Like This\\" or \\"Before Your Love\\" (which bored me to death after 2 listenings), but because her song \\"Miss Independent\\" was fun and catchy. Ok, the rest of the album lies with and includes the 2 previously mentioned songs, and \\"Miss Independent\\" is the only semi-fast song on the disc. The rest are slow, draggy, screechy, and boring. If you liked \\"Miss Independent\\" DON'T buy this disc, for your own good. However, if you liked not that one, but \\"A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Before..\\", you'll probobly like the rest. Not recommended. I gave mine away after the first time I listened to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fifteen minutes up","review":"this is just more of the same assembly line fluff music with no emotion it has to do with looks rather than substance.i'm so sick of this music for the last ten or so years when will it end?if i could give it a zero rating i would"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice...lousy songs. This stinks!","review":"I love Kelly Clarkson's voice. But...whoever is producing her should be fired for making her sing these lousy songs. I really think she needs better music to survive in this industry. I honestly don't think this album will get much airtime on the radio and I suspect she may fade off into obscurity like other \\"made for tv\\" musicians (o-town, and the group from pop stars, for example). I would love to see someone write songs for Kelly like they do for Faith Hill. At any rate, I think this album stinks...and it's a shame. She's too talented for this and the stupid movie with Justin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"Kelly Clarkson has a wonderful talent and all the people on here that have not liked her CD obviously have no taste at all!

I loved her on AI and she's only getting better and better. Buy this. You won't regret it. There's not a bad song on the entire cd, and that's extremely rare these days.Most cds have 2 to 4 good songs and the rest are filler. This cd is loaded with nothing but top quality material sung by a top quality girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it! Kelly, Kelly, Kelly!","review":"Kelly Clarkson is the most talented artist on the charts right now! She is so versatile and can sing any genre of music. I haven't taken her CD out of my CD player since I bought it. I believe that this is only the beginning of a great career for her. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLARKSON IS THE NEW POP PRINCESS.","review":"Forget all the \\"American Idol\\" hype, Clarkson has chops, personality, and talent.With Clive Davis producing and looking over Clarksons shoulder this album has got to be one of the 10 best for 2003 easy.A very thorough album, with the first single showing a wilder, sexier Clarkson \\"Miss Independent\\", other songs include her #1 smash \\"A Moment Like This\\", and one of my favorites that should be the next single \\"Anytime\\".Clarkson has a future, and after reviewing Madonnas latest which is one of the worst of 2003 (note: a fan of 20 years), Clarkson shows we need new blood on the pop front, and she is definitely one of the best for 2003.A real refreshing treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is good stuff","review":"I can't believe how much I like this CD... I just think it's fantastic. It's been on repeat since the day it came out. The CD is a nice mix of peppy up-tempo songs and the slow, heart wrenching love songs. I couldn't be more pleased with this CD. It was worth every cent I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG LETDOWN","review":"I was looking forward to Kelly's CD since before she won American Idol, I thought she would show the same diversity she showed on the show. I was hoping she would be unique and not follow in the lines of Christina Aguilera and the like. What a big letdown this cd was for me, I would have rather heard her sing more of the songs she sang on American Idol. The instrumentals seemed too loud almost overpowering her voice. I just hope Justin stays true on his cd and hopefully Kelly's next one will be more like the Kelly we watched and loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"kelly is awsome","review":"it was worth waiting for. my whole family just loves it. what a talent. this album is awsome, it rocks. wow. we love every song, what more can, i say, kelly, kelly, kelly, you're the greastestand so is the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!!! WORTH THE WAIT!","review":"Kelly fans couldnt be happier!! This cd is Awesome! Well worth the wait from the expected first release date of November.I think my favorite song is Beautiful Disaster. Kelly has such a wide range in her voice and this song showcases her voice perfectly.Other favorites are Some kind of miracle and The trouble with love. Although every song is great. Buy this cd. You will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Debut!","review":"Even though I was a fan of Kelly's on American Idol, I was a bit skeptical and worried about her debut after listening to A Moment Like This and Before Your Love. But this album is, in my honest opinion, the best album released this year. It has something for everyone from rock to R&B and her voice handles the changes of style like only a true and talented professional can do. My particular favorites: \\"Miss Indpendent\\", a great kicking track and \\"Just Missed the Train\\", a laid back rock song with lyrics that are actually meaningful.Buying this album will not be a mistake..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This CD is absolutly amazing! i can't put it into words!! Kelly has varity of type of songs on here which makes this CD different from all the rest! Its awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Atempt","review":"For being her first album with the \\"Idol Buzz\\" I was actually impressed. Her vocal ability is limitless and they have done a good job at giving her songs that show it off. All in all, it was worth the buy and makes a good addition to the cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent debut","review":"I read that Kelly initially wanted to name thisdisc, \\"Pidgeonhole This\\", and it would have beenfitting. Thankful is fresh and ecclectic withoutbeing schitzophrenic. Kelly shows off her massiverange without resorting to vocal gymnastics.Keep up the good work, Kelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cd! Well worth the wait!","review":"If you loved Kelly on American Idol, you are sure to love this cd. It is a blend of everything. I definitely think she will have longevity in this business with her beautiful voice. I haven't listened to anything else since I got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deluxe","review":"Masterful, saucy, and silky smooth, like Granny Smith's famous apples, Kelly has woven a pie crust of warmth, and has filled it with scrumptious lyrics, full of plump, juicy, and sugary-sweet appointments. I love eating to this cd, especially when I'm feeling low. I just whip out my favorite gallon of ice cream, turn up the volume, and eat my tears away!The title, \\"Thankful\\", reminds me of Thanksgiving, when the table is full of my favorite dishes, and this year, instead of the typical Peggy Lee, we'll be blasting the loveliness that is Mrs. Kelly Clarkson.I hereby announce my LOVE for this four-square-meal of a musical choice, right here on Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiver Me Timbers....","review":"Can you say blown away? This album rocks. I have not bought an album in a very long time where I not only like, but love every song on it. Not only that, but I can't choose a favorite. No two songs sound alike. Yes, she is Our American Idol, and she proves why she is. All of this is just a span of a few months and with the whirlwind of the American Idol tour and filming of her movie, I believe we can expect even greater things from her in the future! She is unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!","review":"This fantastic CD is proof that we need great talent showcases like \\"American Idol\\" on TV today; such shows remind me of \\"The Original Amateur Hour,\\" which was one of the top shows of the day when I was growing up.Kelly truly lives up to that title through every track...and there's something for every taste here, from ballads to smooth jazz, to uptempo pop (check out her duet with Tamyra).The other reviewers have said all there is to say, but I'd like to add my own two cents here...it has earned every inch of the #1 ranking in Billboard. Congratulations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent, excellent, excellent CD. Ms. Clarkson is a young woman loaded with talent. What an amazing voice. This CD was worth every penny. I have to say I like all the songs. My personal favorites are Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed The Train, and Anytime. It is rare that anyone likes more than one song on CDs realist with today's \\"artists\\" but this one has the potential of many hits. Thanks Ms. Clarkson for your talent and man on man, that voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I PREORDERED KELLY'S CD,COULDN'T WAIT,THIS CD IS NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR MONEY,I THREW IT OUT IN THE TRASH, NEVER AGAIN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, carbon-copy, boring garbage!","review":"Not much to say about this pile of rubbish. It sounds like every other CD that is fit for pre-teen girls. Everything has the feel of super-slick studio production, which gives it a synthetic, fake vibe. American Idol really does a great job at promotion though, almost convincing us that this trash is in actuality a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"woohoo","review":"You know how some cs's only have one or two good songs, well this one has NONE, every song really sucks...okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well when I thought things couldn't get worst. Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world's dumdest fake brunette. I've never liked Kelly Clarkson(then, why am I reviewing this)and the only reason my brain has suffered from this no talent bad singer/reality tv star is because of my 10 years old sister.Kelly Clarkson in my opinion is like the ulimate snob. when she was on American Idle she sent the message that you only should like guys that have looks but no brains and that your life is going to be misareble if you are yourself. She says she has always wanted to be a singer but she never said that until she went on the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cloned diva","review":"This girl is just another Mariah Carey wannabe. Yeah she has a good voice, but that aint enough these days. She doesnt have the range in her voice that Mariah does, but I admit she has a good voice but her songs are total garbage. Her sound would be closer to Celine Dion being strangled or something. Fact is, if she had any REAL talent she wouldnt have needed to go onto American Idol to be noticed. Give her 3 months and nobody will even remember who she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainwashed sheep","review":"If you like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, then this is \\"THE CD\\" for you. But if you like music, you should know better than giving this cd more than 2 stars! Shure, she might sing cleen, most vocalists do! Follwing the Britney/christina formula and succeeding... To be continued!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Christina wannabe","review":"I was given this CD by my mother who likes Kelly Clarkson, and can not stand her voice. The overwrought trills she tries to pull off are laughable. Her voice may be decent, but nothing special. There is no power behind it just yelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"*yawn* I was never a Kelly fan, and her album justified my reasons for not liking her even more.So what is she? R&B; or wannabe pop? The album will never tell. \\"Miss Inpdendent,\\" although a catchy song, is just Miss Christina Aguiler's leftovers and doesn't deserve the publicity it's getting.RCA is just trying to turn Clarkson into a generic pop machine, make her into a Britney Spears although this will never happen. There is nothing traditionally sexy about Clarkson and I can't see her making a mark like Spears did. First album was successful, so? She won a contest, got lots of publicity, hence the reason she sold quite a few albums. She'll die off so fast in a couple months people will be saying, \\"Kelly who?\\"Buy Clay's cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish it was a moment like that","review":"When i bought the album, i was really expecting great upbeat overwhelming talent like \\"Before your love\\" or \\"A moment like this\\" but unfortunately, this wasn't so. Kelly Clarkson resembles Lucy Woodward or Jennifer Love Hewitt in most of her songs. The only difference: kelly screams on the top of her lungs. I was thinking Pop, but, I guess, American Idol didn't really occur to her as she was writing some of the songs. She can be considered an American Idol trator. I love Kelly, but she really disappointed me with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese :-P","review":"if your thinking about buying this- DONT! i made a huge mistake getting it, and i love kelly. although natural woman is a great track, its not worth $30 when you can download it for free- and the rest of the cd is japanese! at least clay aiken's import was in english (and the bonus was a bit better)since some of the other tracks on thankful arent that great, dont waste 30$ on this, buy something else of kelly's thats priced reasonably, or better yet, buy something of clays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"This album is just awful. \\"A Moment Like This\\" is clearly your everyday, generic, mushy gooshy, crappy love song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Clarkson has arrived!","review":"WOW! What a CD! This was well worth the wait. For people who like a variety of music, this is the cd for you! From rock, to r&b to blues to a gospel feel, this album has it ALL. I am so glad she pushed to do her own things and didn't take the bubblegum handout they tried to push on her.Watch out America! Kelly has arrived!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"Kelly's voice and range are simply amazing! She is a genuine artist without need of the fake voice editing that many of today's pop stars rely on. Kelly is a true talent and this CD proves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"Kelly's album is awesome! Each song has a different style and feel to it so it's never boring. In my opinion the best songs are Low, Miss Independent, Just Missed the Train, Beautiful Disaster, and Anytime. You thought Wrong (a duet with Tamyra Gray) is also a great song. Overall, I was very pleased with Kelly's debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I bought this album, but it's actually quite good! While the songs themselves are mostly forgettable, there's no denying that Kelly Clarkson has a fantastic voice. The album is extremely eclectic -- there's gospel, R&B, pop, rock, even a little coutnry -- and Kelly jumps from genre to genre flawlessly. She manages to successfully sell even the schlockiest pop ballads (see \\"A Moment Like This\\") with her voice, her technique, and her emotion/passion. She really elevates the otherwise bland material on this album. Overall, I find \\"Thankful\\" very enjoyable if a little generic. It's definitely worth listening to, and if Kelly can get better material for her next album, it will be just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully, It's Awesome!","review":"I love this album! I'm a huge fan of American Idol and a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson. I am so happy she won, and so happy she made such an amazing debut! I would not tell people to rush out and buy this album on a whim. I adore it, but everyone has different tastes. If you liked the singles, you should like the album, but be warned, there are alot of different types of tracks on this CD. If you're expecting an entire album filled with \\"Miss Independent\\"s you could be sadly disappointed. my advice? Listen to the album, figure out whether you like it or not, then decide if you want to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I totally disagree with the guy who named his review Great For All Ages!","review":"Like my title says I totally disagree with the guy who named his review Great For All Ages!

So I took my 8.1 mp camera out to a near by lake and starting shooting in burst mode. The Sony 2 Gig High Speed Pro Duo started to stutter after about 20 frames which is pretty decent, but when I shot the same subject in the same conditions and it went beyond 100 frames before it began to stutter a little. But it was very quick to recover and start shooting again.This was just a test to see if there was any difference between the two high speed cards, and honestly most people would never rack off over 20 frames at 2.1 frames per second, but with this card you can get what Sony says you can get with this camera and that is 100 frames at 2.1 per second.Just a nice easy test"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service but cost was average","review":"This product was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition.

This program is the source; and I would have bought it long time ago if I knew it was available. Napoleon was ahead of his time! He was articulate, practical, humble and intelligent. This program is not about financial riches, it is about giving us a road map for success in all aspects of our lives (health, wealth, communication, relationships, growth and development, faith and more). The 17 success factors were explained in great detail with examples so we can put them to work immediately. If you travel this program is ideal for listening on the road.

There is nothing earth-shatteringly unique in this audio that the average person hasn't heard or thought about at some point in time; however, it is put to you in a manner that kind of just smacks you in the face, and says \\"come on man... what are you waiting for\\".

In almost every case, the rule applications are no more than diachronic restatements. In other words, they simply recap the historical evolution of the current forms.That is because the concept of underlying forms is the stumbling block of Chomsky's theory, and although Chomskyians and their ilk try to avoid diachronic data, they really cannot in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long since obsolete","review":"Tis book kick-started the fields of phonology and linguistics, but it is long since obsolete. It's a work that is based on intuition, and the field has moved on to experimental techniques. Rather, I should say that experimental fields have grown up, like Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics, but linguists in Chomsky's tradition have largely ignored them.It's a work that describes English, but gives the impression that it is providing deep explanations of English. For instance, it popularized the idea of a \\"feature\\" as a basic, atomic entity in linguistics. But, 50 years on, features have led to many publications but few insights that have proved themselves useful outside the tightly knit community that uses them. Speech technology, for instance, never found features to be particularly useful.It's a Bible among a certain class of linguists, but it's not clear whether it has actually led to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too bias for me","review":"I bought Motor Trend for 30 years, but for the last few years they have become a follow the leader, praise what's hot, and have little regard for value.

I've wrote letter after letter to the editors and not once was one printed, if you are critical they ignore you. Don't get me wrong they haven't strayed too far from the pack, most all the car mags give props to the large advertisers.

As stated in prior reviews, there is some subjectivity; however, all car magazines I have read do have SOME objectivity -- we do want their opinions. They do test high-end autos (Porsche, Aston Martin, Ferrari, etc.); but, that probably comprises only 10% of their tests. If you really want to read about high-end cars, read Road and Track.

This book is an addition to an already impressive list of books on issues of faith, forgiveness, grace and relationship.

In the first cartoon, Grandfather Frost (Russian Santa Claus) leaves the North Pole to find out what is this thing called \\"summer\\". There is music to rival that in \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\". The third cartoon is about a poor woodsman, the orphan (and her cat) whom he adopts, and ... a legendary silver-hoofed deer. Magical, beautiful, emotional, perfect for Christmas Eve.

Dr's Criswell and Patterson augment much history with other dispensationalists ignore and carry a strong apologetic base into the evangelical Arena which will aide pastor and layman alike to defend their faith and to share it. Others have noted spelling errors in the text but this reader has noted them. The book is out of print and used copies are sometimes pricy but well worth the expense.

Unless fully extended to distribute the little pressure, or fully closed, there is a weak point right at the top of the bands where the plastic goes from thin to thinner.The sound was okay for my needs.The comfort was pretty bad though as others have mentioned.

I bought a pair and they were great for my workouts. But one day I was extending one of the earphone legs and it snapped in half. But I liked the phones so much, and they were cheap, so I figured, \\"I can afford to buy these if I can get six months or so use of them.\\" So I bought two more pairs and was really careful with these.Well they lasted about six months each and I went to buy more pairs but the price went up 50%! So I'm switching to something that might last longer.There are three potential break points: each earphone leg extends to your comfort level. each of these can break at the extension point. Also the phones fold in three places: at the extension points and in the middle of the headband piece. The last pivot place can also break (twice in my case). Thin metal in place of thin plastic would make much more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than what you get with the iPod, but will eventually break","review":"These headphones are indeed a step up from the Apple ear buds if you take your iPod on a run.

I thought it was me and ran out to get another pair.This morning as I went to put on the second pair after NEVER using them, they broke at the top hinge. If these work for you, you have my congratulations. But I didn't feel I handled them roughly at all and felt they wouldn't hold up to any wear at all.

I mean, I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time. If these cost $15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year, compared to ones that cost $25 and they last two years, the latter are the less expensive pair.Being cheap, I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it isn't that I'm being rough with them - I treat them well, but eventually they die (usually the sound goes out in the left ear).I am no longer going to get these, fool me... 4 times.

They fit in anything when folded. The practicality of these things is excellent. I don't think SONY leaves out anything when they come to designing their products.They are even good to have when you are putting your mini-disc player away. You just pop them into the box or carrying pouch, all tucked away out of sight. This helps when you don't want to always be looking for them everywhere around the room or house.The sound in these little things is amazing. Best level of bass I ever had for replacement headphones of this kind. Mind you, my original pair are fine, but you never know when you will need an extra pair. One last thing.

Until they correct this, I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, broke in 2 days","review":"hope you got a good price, because these will break quickly due to the cheap plastic and lack of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sport Headphones","review":"I've tried lots of different headphones for my long runs but these are my favorite. They fit my ears the best, are comfortable and lightweight, and I like how they fold up for compact storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke easily!","review":"These headphones snapped when I went to pick them up but one side got caught underneath something. They broke, and it surprised me a lot since I've never had a pair of headphones break so easily before. I had read another review that said they broke easily, but I thought it wouldnt happen to me because its not like I put them to rough use. But with simple household use, it did! Not happy about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad quality.","review":"Like every other bad reviewer my pair broke within 3 months. I barely even touched them and they just snapped apart. (Strangely enough, when I got angry and tried to crush them completely they put up quite a fight.)Good sound, bad quality plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony makes yet another defective product","review":"The headphones do sound great but they break with little effort. I've had two break at the same place in less than two weeks and I was ultra careful the second time. If you must buy them, better buy a dozen so they last a month or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Broke Too Soon","review":"these headphones were comfy, and i liked the white \\"sporty\\" detailing, but they broke on one side at the hinge within a few months. i took them out of my backpack, unfolded them, and *snap*! it was often in my backpack's outer pocket, but with heavy books & a laptop, i might have put too much pressure on it at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"very flimsy","review":"The sound is fine and they work well for exercise until they break. I have had 2 pair break each with a couple months of purchase at one of the 2 bottom hinges The guy next to me at the gym had the same thing happen as well. I would recommend an alternative that doesn't fold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to break","review":"I only had these for a few weeks before one of the arms broke off at the pivot point (where the arm that has the ear bud on it folds up). It didn't break from rough use either; it broke just from me unfolding them. I super-glued the arm back on and that worked for about a week until they broke again; in a different spot!! At that point I gave up and decided I needed a more durable pair of headphones. The sound quality was excellent and they were very comfortable to wear, but you apparently need to wear kid-gloves to handle them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the reviews","review":"The product worked well and was comfortable, but quite a few reviews talked about how fragile they were. As careful as I was folding them and caring form them, after about 1 month I accidently flexed them the wrong direction and the hinge on one side snapped and broke, rendering the headphones useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily broken, sound quality ok","review":"I would give the headphone 4 stars if sony knows how to make them more durable. the material used is very cheap and fragile, a little bit of force would brake it from the junction very easily. I guess this is how sony make money by force you to buy frequently. the sound quality is ok. but if you keep the headphone more than 20 mins in your ear, it will start to hurt your ear canal because of the pressure. After broke my two headphones in 3 months, it is enough for me. Try another model or brand if you want a quality built headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"In the last 2 months I have gone through 2 sets of these. The first set broke at the top hinge, then one of the arms holding the ear piece snapped. I foolishly bought a 2nd set, and the same exact thing happened! Luckily I was able to return one set (didn't have receipt for the other). I would not purchase this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL PLASTIC","review":"I liked these headphones, but they were all plastic. The adjustable part broke after three weeks. I super glued them several times then tossed the over-the-head band. I still have the speaker parts; a baseball cap will hold them in place while I am searching for new headphones. I would not buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Total piece of garbage. The left earpiece died within two weeks of use, the right earpiece died about a week later. Visible cracks in the wire casing, exposing the copper wires. No complaints about the sound, just the terrible, terrible quality and poor durability. I did not abuse these any more than a typical runner/gym-goer. Most of the time they lived in a small zippered compartment in my gym bag, now they are in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk headphones","review":"Broke when folding gently after one month of running with them.Very uncomfortable for ear, would never buy again.If this is supposed to be for sport use it's a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the gas to go get them","review":"The sound was \\"okay\\"...after all, they're Sony, so the sound's not going to be great to begin with. I purchased mine at Best Buy, not thru Amazon, just for the record. After only a week or so of use, the band snapped in two while putting them on; I had not stretched them apart any farther than I would any other set of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easy","review":"I have had these headphones since May 07. I have not been impressed with these at all. They have broken at every joint now. I have had to super glue the ear pieces back on, and now yesterday the center joint broke when I was putting them on. Will not be buying these again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy several pairs since they'll snap at the hinges","review":"These headphones sound great and stay on while working out, but...DO NOT BUY THEM - I have snapped several pairs in the past 6 months and have switched to ear buds. Horrible quality - they'd be better with no hinges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left headphone always fails","review":"I have been buying and replacing these headphones for a few years now. The left side always stops working after a few months. I know they take a lot of sweat but it is always the left side. My most recent pair only worked one month. I think it is time for me to find another cheap pair for workouts, since I'm pretty aggravated with the durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the gym, at a good price","review":"I agree - criticism is really just nickpicking. The sound quality is okay to good, but the point is that one can sweat all over these things with no damage done! And again for $14 what do you expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sweat guard is a joke... great while they lasted","review":"These headphone had great sound, until they crapped out. I used them exclusively at the gym, and on a fairly regular basis, one side or the other would go out from sweat. Maybe I sweat more than the average person, but I bought these especially because they were supposed to be designed with the gym in mind.After they would dry out, they would usually work again. Until finally they didn't. At the gym, one side went out, and has never come back, weeks later."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice for exercise but BROKE","review":"These were perfect for exercise (held on my head very well) until they broke in just under a year. I wasn't even putting any particular pressure on them. I will stay away from Sony in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have owned Sony Sport Headphones for over 10 years","review":"Usually the headphone's speakers go bad (too much sweat/moisture I'm guessing). Recently this happened and I bought Sony's latest offering. After 2 weeks, the flimsy plastic snapped. Others here have complained about the same thing. so buyer beware"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphones for running","review":"The headphones are well worth the $20 I paid for them. I expect that as I run with them and expose them to sweat and use, they will eventually break. I have owned 4 pair and have not been disappointed. They are not magical unbreakable headphones, the more you use them the faster they will break. They stay on your head, the sound is good, they are not outrageously priced, and are not big, ugly, or heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.... Always Break","review":"Broke 3 times in 3 different spots within 3 weeks! Cheap brittle plastic breaks very easily. The sound is great, and the waterproof is great, but what good is that if you can't wear them. I'm not very rough with them either.Do yourself a favor and buy the version that does not fold up. I had those for years and bought the fold up ones because I lost my non-fold up version. The non-foldup version has the same sound, very durable, and seem to last forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy headphones. They break very easily.","review":"I'm not especially rough on my gear but I've had to tape these \\"sports\\" headphones up three times after they kept breaking. They are really brittle. They break off at the part above the earphones and the middle part that goes over your head They do sound good but just don't handle them alot and be very careful when putting them on or taking them off because they don't bend well, they just snap. You may think I'm over exagerating but I'm not. You need to slip them off very gingerly or else you'll end up with two or more pieces in both hands.I've had other sports headphones before that were far more durable (and flexible). After these are gone for good I'm getting another brand. I recommed you keep looking for a different brand as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 7-month-old daughter broke them","review":"I've used these particular headphones for years because I *love* the sound quality, bass, fit, portability, lack of sound leakage, and extra long cord. I bought three pairs of them two weeks ago off Amazon since they usually short out after a year or so, and the price was only $10. TWO OF THEM ARE ALREADY BROKEN. I was wearing the second pair last night while holding my 7-month-old daughter, who pulled at them and they snapped in two.It's a shame, because these were the perfect headphones for me. Sometime in the past year or so, Sony must have started using a different plastic, because previous versions of these headphones were far more durable. The cost-cutting measures of big businesses really piss me off sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly dissapointed","review":"The ear pieces are not as comfortable as I had hoped and the cord is shorter than I expected. The head part seems very cheap, but the ear pieces are good quality and will not fall out. Hopefully they will last longer than some of my headphones in the past, but overall, I think this item is a bit overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be zero stars","review":"I'm amazed at all the people who've given this three plus stars even though they've broken multiple units. They are decent, while they work, but for the price of three sets you could get something better to begin with. They are good for working out, but my first set broke after three months. I figured I'd be more careful with the second set, but they broke after 1 month. Both broke at the hinges, just like everyone else's. Now I'm out the money spent on those two sets and I have to invest more $$ in something decent that will last. These are garbage, save yourself the aggravation and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE WILL BREAK!! BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"I had a hard time finding headphones that suit my needs-(won't fall off and sweatproof). I was excited to finally come upon these. I bought my first pair and really enjoyed them, that is, until they snapped one day as I was picking them up. I thought maybe I'd been more rough with them than I thought. I ordered another pair and used them for a few months. Then, last night as I was getting my stuff together to go to the gym- SNAP! I couldn't believe it. My husband looked at them and said they are poorly designed with only a thin mechanism holding the hinges together. I'm very careful with things, so it was not due to rough mis-handling. They are supposed to fold easily, but the slightest wrong move and they are done. I guess my search will now resume for a good pair of headphones, because I'm not willing to waste any more money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Price, Works Well, Cheaply Made","review":"I've been searching for a decent pair of headphones to use while running and settled on these as they were the only ones available at the various stores in my neighborhood. They work just fine, but are very flimsy and because of that are prone to snapping in half (which mine did within 2 weeks). I'm now searching the web to find a better pair, but would recommend you stay away from these as the plastic parts are just to weak and prone to breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"great till they break","review":"if you are going to keep these in a gentle place, such as on your desk, they will be pretty good, as they sound great for the money.but, if you're gonna take em to the gym or anyplace, THEY'LL BUST, just like all else say. just the slightest pressure OUTWARD and the 1/8 inch thick piece between the head piece and ear piece snaps.i bought four pairs (gym, desk, office, extra). the only one that didn't break within a couple of months is the one on my office desk, where it only has to travel from the desktop to my head and back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"They function well, but they break easily.

DO NOT BUY< DO NOT BUT> DO NOT BUY...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fold 'em","review":"As I recieved these headphones, I was excited. I had a pair just like these for years and they had finally succumbed to the stress and overwork that I put them through. I pulled them out of the box, excited and ready to listen to some good music. What happened next I never expected... as I unfolded them, the right extension snapped clean off. Now I'm waiting hopefully for a refund. If you're not going to fold them up, it might be worth the money. If you are going to fold them, look for another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took a VERY long time to receive","review":"There should be an obvious note when purchasing that they are shipping via USPS because I entered our physical address thinking it would be shipped via UPS. We don't receive USPS mail at our physical address, so it got sent back and the seller wouldn't ship a new one until they received the old one back. It took almost OVER a month from the day I ordered it until the day I received it. Also, when emailing the seller, it was difficult to get a response most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for runners","review":"These headphones are really designed for runners. They have strong and light adjustable frame, never slip off, fit nicely, sound is good and the price is right. Unless you have some very special requirements, you can't be wrong with buying these phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 for sound, 0 for durability","review":"I've had four pairs of these headphones; each pair has snapped at the earpiece. The first two pairs lasted a good long while before breaking but recently I broke two pairs in two weeks. (Fortunately I had a replacement plan so the second was free.) The foldability isn't worth it. Go for the much cheaper and far more durable ones that don't fold."},{"rating":"1","title":"the perfect headphones for the runner who hates intact headphones","review":"Seriously -- these are total junk.

Before that, they were great for running.I expect headphones to last much longer. I wouldn't buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"Based on other reviews, I decided to purchase these headphones for my Ipod Nano. I use them for when I'm working out at the gym and they work great. As long as the headphones are adjusted at the right angle on your head you will get excellent base response. I just moved the band which goes over the top of the head slightly forward and back until I received good sounding base. They stay in place and are never in the way when I'm running or lifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running","review":"I got tired of re-inserting the little ear buds that came with my mP3 player when I was running. A friend suggested these headphones so I tried them. They work great. They stay put! If you run into someone on your run, you can simply pull one phone off to talk. They sound great too, now that I'm not putting them on backwards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very flimsy","review":"Earbuds snapped off on both sides accidentally without much force. Sound quality is decent. Handle with extreme caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"7 Pairs Broken","review":"I like these headphones because they are water resistant, and they fold up nicely. They have fair sound quality, but more than adequate for using at the gym.The bad news is because they fold up there are 3 different hinges on them which I have managed to break 7-10 different times. My record life span for a pair of these headphones is 6 months. Typically they break within about 3 months.The reason I keep buying them is because they are cheap, and for the 13 bucks you can beat on them for 3 months until they break, but I am tired of replacing them now.If you are looking for something that lasts and is durable, steer clear of these headphones. If you are doing anything other than using them to work out, they are junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL JUNK DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought two of these for my morning runs and let me tell you they both broke in less than a month. Someone wrote a review saying that short of stepping on them they will not break, that is total nonsense, they are poorly made, and the plastic on the hinges broke on both of them. I was very carful with them and they snapped at the same hinge, BOTH of them. Sony makes other headphones much better, don't waste your time or money......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - they break easily","review":"I've bought this product twice, and both times they've broken in the same place (first time wasn't a fluke it appears). They are especially weak in the thin extendable part (between upper head piece and the \\"sweat\\" resitent thicker part). Also, sweat still gets in ear and clogs sound holes, so really, go for the cheaper headphones, which work just as well and last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far","review":"These are the best sports headphones I have found so far for a reasonable price.pros- the fit good and hold on tight even while running sound very good for sports headphones and appear pretty well built.cons- the ear pieces are a little big and after a long workout there is some slight irratation but not to bad.overall great buy but if you have small ears id look for some with smaller ear pieces"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony MDR-A35G S2 Sports Headphones","review":"Sony typically makes good products. I had been searching for an inexpensive headphones set for my workout at the YMCA. I purchased this because it was inexpensive, made by Sony, and designed for workouts. Okay, the headphones lasted about one month before the sound became scratchy and I couldn't hear the sound out of one ear. Apparently the sweat or moisture has dripped down into the earpiece. Returning it to amazon.com is not an option at this point but I can certainly return it to Sony for a replacement under their 90 day warranty. You get what you pay for even applies to the most reputable companies. The cost of the headphones has increased by shipping costs to Sony plus my initial investment of $13.99. Apparently these headphones while designed for workouts require more care than anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"They are comfortable, sound great, stay in when running....after going through several more expensive sets of headphones, these are keepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing headphones..","review":"Even after all these years, its got amazing quality, very comfortable.It is a good portable headphones and the sound clarity is best.

While these Sony phones are in the same price range, they're NOT in the same realm when it comes to sound quality. I can only describe the sound as \\"very muddy\\". There's plenty of bass response, but overall they sound like I had cotton in my ears. If you are at all interested phones that will accurately represent your music, try something other than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality - no audio in left ear","review":"At first, I thought it was just expected that headphones would have a limited life. However, on my second purchase of the same Sony headphones, I found out that the left ear stopped having audio after ONLY 2 MONTHS!This appears to be a problem with the wiring, but it is annoying that Sony, a well-respected name in consumer audio, can sell such a shoddy product. I have reported my complaint to Sony customer service, but have not received a reply yet.Do not buy this product OR any Sony headphone unless you are already deaf in one ear, preferably your left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Manufacturing Quality","review":"I have owned these headphones many a times, and up until 5 months ago I wouldn't have bought another pair out there for sport purposes. They have always provided what I needed in a sport headphone, but like I said, until 5 months ago. Recently, the last 2 pairs I've bought, have broken in similar fashion while NOT IN USE. I used each pair while running and lifting, nothing too crazy, but they broke extremely easily around the first joint coming up from the ear bud. I was just moving them about my room or on/off my head and they snapped. Nothing extreme. I was very disappointed. I had recommended them to my girlfriend and hers broke, but in the top middle portion. Honestly I think Sony has changed something in their manufacturing process to produce such poor quality.

Others have criticised the fragility of the headband. Believe it, the band it too fragile. They always break at the thin plastic retractable part.

Every one has broken in the same place, the plastic slider just below the hinge. It's a real shame that an otherwise well designed headset should be constructed with a flimsy thin PLASTIC slider at a critical stress point. The reason I bought 3 (got the forth one under warranty - it also broke) is that I couldn't find another headset that collapsed so compactly. What's wrong with the marketplace that a competitor can't beat Sony to the market with a better product?

A set lasts me about 4 months (more with duct tape!), but I don't mind paying $15 or so for a new set. I just bought two sets to get the free shipping, and I'm trying to be more careful with them (don't bend them outward!).

I'm sure I am not the only one dying to find a GOOD replacement for these fine headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweat guard works; sound & comfort need improvement","review":"Yes, these headphones are designed well to keep the sweat out of your ears. I bought them to replace the yellow \\"Sports\\" in-ear phones that came with my old cassete/radio Walkman. With those I had to take them out every once in a while and wipe the sweat off. With these new ones, it's not a problem.However... I'm disappointed with the sound quality. I think it's because the in-ear part is bigger than it used to be - it doesn't go into my ear as far as the older model did. And they hurt! After about half an hour they make my ears hurt so bad that I have to give up on them. The fold-up feature and sweat guard design is not enough to justify the discomfort and lack of sound quality. I would not buy these again and recommend that other shoppers look elsewhere.I'm training for a half-marathon and am still trying to find the perfect pair of traning earphones!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap like a twig.","review":"My second pair broke as easily as the first, despite being extraordinarily careful after the first broke on the same place. They do a better job handling the sweat than others I've used, but are so flimsy they need to be sold as disposables in three packs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony A35G Headphones","review":"Very compact and eazy to store. My wife and I each have a set to use with our iPods. Sound is great and the design allows you to still be aware of your surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few weeks","review":"I liked the fact that it did not fall off my head while exercising and I liked the sound. It insulated outside noises reasonably well.But after a two week use it broke in half when I tried to unfold it. I was always very gentle with it and I was shocked when the main hinge (center one) just broke. Upon inspection I found that it was made from plastic and it was weak by design.It went straight into the garbage bin. Wasted $15 plus shipping and a few kilograms of CO2 in the atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brittle headphones break every time","review":"I really like these headphones. I've bought them four or five times. Each time the headband snaps near one of the joints. I can't bear to buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fra - Gee - Lay","review":"The headphones gave good bass when angled just right in my ears, but that is pretty much where the positives end. The sweat guard failed several times while I was running and actually channeled sweat into my ears more than any other headphones I have ever used. The fold-up feature helped save space in my day pack but caused the cord to tangle. Finally, after only three months of use, the headphones snapped in half just last night as I removed them from my pack. This was a fun experiment with a new style of headphones but I will not buy another pair and would not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Constructed & Easy to Break","review":"These headphones looked great and I'm sure that the sound quality is excellent. However, the band of my headphones snapped while I was removing the headphones from my head after just one use! The thin band is incredibly fragile. My boyfriend and I purchased these headphones at the same time and his also broke within days of first using the headphones! Based on both of our experiences, I have concluded that these headphones are a terrible waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Poor Design","review":"I like the fact that they're designed to keep sweat out. The sound quality is good and they do stay on your head while exercising. The bad part: the design!The foldability is great, but the joint at which the ear piece bends is EXTREMELY fragile. I've broken two pairs already in one month, I will not be buying the fold ups any more. I took the headphones off my head and bam! One side snapped. To buy them at a store costs $20...not for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exercise headphones but not perfect","review":"I have had these headphones for over a year and use them mainly for jogging/running, usually 4x/week and at least 15-20 miles per week. I like the fact that they are water resistant. The sound quality was good for the price but not great (but who needs great while exercising anyway). Comfort is great and these are one of the few in-ear headphones that haven't given me headaches after hours of use.The only reason I don't rate them 5 stars is the weather finally caught up to them. After running multiples times in rain, humid weather, etc. one side has finally gone bad (left). I can still use them but the sound from the left side is very faint.I will purchase the same type again but am looking for slightly better sound quality. But who knows, over one year of getting rained and sweated on isn't a bad track record for a pair of $20 headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very easily broken","review":"Like another reviewer, I was pleased with these for a couple of months. They stayed in place while running and were not affected by sweat.But, they recently snapped at a hinge while simply taking them off. I wasn't rough with them or anything. Since they were already broken I played with the other hinges and realized that they all are very fragile and will break with the slightest bending. I'm replacing with another brand -- if you own these I would handle them like they were made of glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone after five months","review":"I absolutely loved these headphones when I got them. They were comfortable, durable, and had great sound. Unfortunately, after five months the sound in the left headphone went out. This makes them virtually useless. To add insult to injury, they went out during a LONG flight across country. I had to endure the flight with no music. For the money these cost, they are NOT a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, but poor quality","review":"I bought this set of headphones to use with my iPod while jogging. I like the black & white color and compact folding design, but the poor quality of craftmanship drops its rating substantially. First, the headphones could not be used with the treadmills at the gym because they would build up static electricity and shock the ears (the classic yellow ones that came with the Sony Walkmans years ago never had that problem). But even given that limitation, I would have still given this product a 3 or 4 star rating if it were reliable. However, the left speaker went out after only 5 months, rendering the headphones unusable. Sony provides only a 3-month warranty on this item, of course. In contrast, I still have a set of the old-style yellow Sony Walkman headphones that are still working fine (it just doesn't match the color of my iPod)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poorly made","review":"Apparently Sony's quality has taken a serious turn for the worst. These head phones broke just one week after I recieved them. I was folding them up and they snapped in half. If you need head phones to last more than one week, do not buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you plan to work out, don't use these.","review":"These were possibly the worst headphones I have ever used. The sweat-gaurd mechanism did not in fact gaurd against sweat and it would still pool in one's ears. After awhile the sweat shorts-out the ear-pieces and I'd often lose sound in them while working out. Second, they are unbelievably uncomfortable and you simply cannot wear them for longer than 45 minutes because of the constant irritation. Finally (and here's the real kicker), they broke after a month and a half - I got maybe 15 total trips to the gym out of them. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I bought these to use at the gym. And first, they're not really comfortable in the ears. They felt like they were boring into my ear. And second, they broke after about three weeks. I had them hanging around my neck; went to pull them off and the connecting band snapped. I consider it a waste of $13 and would instead send the money towards better headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they used to be","review":"One ear of these headphones went dead after a month of running. My old Sony sport headphones were excellent and lasted years. I'm not sure what's changed, but it's frustrating to get so little use from a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and Uncomfortable","review":"I have had these for less than 30 days and the hinge just broke. For headphones that are suppose to cater to the sports advocate, you would expect something a bit more durable then to break while using an elliptical machine at a gym.Furthermore, I thought the buds dug into my ear and made wearing them fairly uncomfortable.I am pretty disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweat guard mechanism did not work for me","review":"I bought these because of all of the positive reviews regarding their ability to stand up to sweat. I was looking for a set of headphones with an over the head band because those ones that have ear loops always shift out of my ears when I run so I can't hear the music well. These headphones really stay in my ears, but I run hard, and I guess the sweat guard cannot stand up to that much sweat. After 30 minutes or so, the pores on the headphones fill with sweat and no sound comes out. I'm disappointed. This does not happen with my ear loop headphones, but again, those don't sound good. Rats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke within a week","review":"About 15 years ago, Koss sold a similar design. I still use my Koss phones at work, and bought these for home and workout use. The sound and functionality are fine for the intended use. Trouble is, on the Sonys, the extender band is made of flimsy plastic (Koss used metal), and with the first tug on the cord, it snapped clean through. Portable headphones need to be sturdy, and these are not. This is one of many disappointments with Sony products in recent years. They used to be so good -- what happened? If I'm going to buy a portable product, I need to be able to bang it around a little. Unfortunately, I can find no other manufacturer who makes this design, so if you need them, buy them, but you may need to baby them a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound and fit but Very fragile","review":"This item has a great sound and fits well on the head and in the ears; it fits very firmly and doesn't move around when working out, and I work out hard. In use, it is fantastic it. BUT::::::The downside, and it's a big one, is that it is super fragile. Simply folding it, I was always afraid of breaking it but there is no real way to store it, especially in a gym bag without significantly, increasing the risk of breaking it, unless you have a hard case that it will fit in for protection. I was only able to enjoy these for a week before I found them snapped in my bag. And I am usually very careful with stuff like this but... Way too fragile for a workout headphone and that is a big shame because they are one of the best I've ever tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"wind comes through!","review":"when biking or running fast, the sound of the wind is very loud and drowns out the music, very annoying to have to turn up the volume to have to compensate, also kinda hurts my ears, I would look for a Creative brand one if possible ( plus wire is too thin/ long and gets tangled when running)"},{"rating":"2","title":"iPhone compatible!!! what a nice a surprise!","review":"Not a review. Just wanted to put it out there that these headphones are iPhone compatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones, but not durable","review":"I have bought two pair of these headphones. The sound quality is good and the cord is long and doesn't twist.However, as pointed out by another user, they are NOT durable and ARE prone to breaking near the folding joints. This is NOT user area and they WILL break near the fold if you are not EXTRA CAREFUL in handling them.I may buy my third pair, but will be EXTRA CAREFUL when handling them so they do not break..."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreed with Russell Popkin's review","review":"these headphones broke at the top hinge, after wearing them only 3 times! and they fit too snug in my ears. i bought these same earphones 6 years ago, and they lasted me 6 years without issue, until they broke earlier this year. i bought the same model as a replacement and found that it's a much tighter fit, AND they're so flimsy! ridiculous. sony - whatever you did to try to 'improve' this model, please go back to the design from 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sports Headphones","review":"I purchased these headphones specifically for use in the gym.

I did find the stories of the heroes whose selfless devotion to humanity portrayed to be moving and inspiring. These people have (or will have) a special place in Heaven, I am sure. Having lived most of my life among holocaust survivors and their children, I have heard and read alot of stories in several languages. These stories, while moving, I felt were quite boringly presented.

Everything the other reviews have said is spot on. The organization of this book is a particular strength. The interesting sections on sufficiency and exchangeability, which go so far as to cover partial exchangeability and the theory of extremal families, aren't covered in many other textbooks.

It's ironic that Wein makes it sound as if the Peanut were made specifically for the 285."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for newer Vivitar 285HV","review":"I tried this product out with a new Vivitar 285HV that I just purchased on Amazon. It is quite unreliable in triggering the flash. I would hit the remote flash ten times and maybe it would fire one or two times. I called and spoke to a customer support representative from the manufacturer, and he said that it doesn't work with the new 285HV because of the low trigger voltage in newer models made within the last two years. I feel it was misleading when I bought the product because it said it would work with the 285HV in the product description. I guess it does, just not the one I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well on Vivitar 285hV triggered by 580EXII on 5d mark 2","review":"I have done lots of research trying to make the scenario work.

Will see how reliable this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera for every episode thereafter.Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's \\"Shadow Baby\\" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"No storm here!","review":"Where is the big storm?

How can this be when many of us purchase new computers every 3 or 4 years? Also, using the dictionary to look up a word is very very slow. For example, if you are looking up a word such as women, you have to go thru all the w's until you finally reach the \\"wo's\\" for women.

Well, this $20 tray (free shipping if you buy something else like I did) is ideal. The 28\\" side fits perfect, and the extra 6\\" next to the sides of the cargo area are fine with me.

I'm sorry that Ms. Geller wasn't the beneficiary of such a marriage & family, but her warped view of life is partially the result of her parents having taken the road she so heartily recommends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, wise analysis","review":"Geller has written a very persuasive critique of marriage and weddings. This book makes you question why being married automatically brings status and why not being married brings a sense of shame (especially if you're a woman). Geller analyzes wedding guides, bridal magazines, Jane Austen, and \\"Sex and the City.\\" She questions why romantic monogamy is revered so much more than platonic friendship. In one hilarious passage, she goes undercover as a bride at the Bloomingdale's bridal registry and recounts the way she's treated by the salespeople (basically, like royalty). I recommend this book to anyone thinking about marriage. Even if you are married, this is a very worthwhile read that will get you to re-examine your lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"and your point is...?????","review":"This book could have been great, this book should have been interesting, It should have been provactive discourse on the return to patriarchy & the societal pressures on women to wed.I wanted to hear about the new feminine mystique - the nameless dread of being in the \\"leftover bin\\" as one approches her late twenties unmarried, the societal message that men are in a positon to \\"reward\\" a woman with the gift of marriage.So much to write about -- and instead this book is one long movie review, the shaggy dog story that leaves one wondering what the point is.Jaclyn Geller's tone comes accoss as a slightly bitter woman on a mission. Her assertion that friends be considered equally important to one's significant other is laughable. The critique of such fleeting popular culture references such as Ally McBeal and Betsy's Wedding is pathetic and indicates that Ms. Geller was grabbing at straws to fill up space and back up her point - which she never got around to making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative and well-researched","review":"This should be required reading, not only for any newly engaged woman, but for EVERY unmarried woman in America. I am 39 and will be 40 when my fiance and I marry - and I wish I had read this book sometime during my 18 \\"single\\" years as an independent adult. The notion of marriage as the most, even the only, valuable social unit in our culture is so widely accepted that we fail to see how cruelly we force ourselves to adhere to its demands. As women, we have the right to be nurtured, understood and encouraged in our own right, not only as wives or potential wives. And as women who choose to marry, we need to know what traditions we are truly carrying on; as the author insists, it is incumbent upon us to generate independent intentions for our own lives outside of these outmoded expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Way with Weddings","review":"Jaclyn Geller's excellent new book blends a finely observed social comedy with a thoughtful critique of the cultural ritual of marriage and an exposure of its complicity with the normalizing forces at large within capitalist morality. Taking the elaborate preliminaries, crises and consequences of the wedding event as her central theme, Geller's gentle irony plays over the terrifying subjection of modern woman by the systems of production and consumption. Geller is both eye-opening and vastly entertaining on the subject of marriage. Her writing is stylish, astringent and restrained, her empirical and historical research of the wedding event very full, and her insights into deeper motivations often chilling. Highly recommended for all inside or outside marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I bought this item because I liked the 6-1/2\\" depth of the box, and competitors only offer the standard 4\\".

I bought the paperback, and it has worked out very well. The paper is good, there are little to no printing errors, and the spine is relatively in the same condition as the day I pulled it out of the box. One of may favorite qualities of this book is the inclusion of four illustrations from the hand of Tolkien himself, offering further insight into the story as Tolkien envisioned it.Even though this book is geared for a younger audience, I found it a quite enjoyable read. At just over a hundred papers, it isn't very long--taking me only a few days of very casual reading. However, this perfectly suits the tone of the story: the journey of a young dog after being cursed by a wizard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this book...","review":"But I couldn't get past 40 pages before giving up. I know, it's a children's book, and Tolkien was busy with The Silmarillion (this book was finished in 1925, The Silimarillion started at 1919 and ended at 1973.), but the story's WAY TOO FAST! I couldn't finish this book without saying \\"Why? Why? Why did I read it?\\"I'm giving it 2 stars because this is just Tolkien and it was just a children's story, way before his genius came into being in 1935 with The Hobbit."},{"rating":"2","title":"the cutest book!!!!","review":"oh i loved this book so much!! i think that it was a very good book and very interesting. even though the reading level is about hmmm...3rd grade or so, any tolken fan should'nt go without it. it makes a really good read if you want a book that's short but intersting. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and charming","review":"Roverandom is a flight of fancy written for Tolkien's children over several years as an explanation of what happened to his son's little lost toy dog. It is extremely light and silly, and generally good fun. Little Rover, a real dog turned into a toy, gets into various scrapes, lives with the Man in the Moon (and the Dog in the Moon) for a bit, and meets a whole lot of people with very silly names.To get a feel for the style, it's really a lot more like the Father Christmas Letters than the Hobbit, and is full of Tolkien's scetches and paintings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting a high standard","review":"The first episode of Granada's 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' broke the mould, with Jeremy Brett offering a highly original and brilliantly thought out portrayal of Holmes, sweeping away other interpretations in his wake. He brought a new and definitive idea of Holmes to the screen: his performance shows that Holmes has depths that cannot be fathomed, perhaps even by Brett himself. Watson was similarly reinvented by a splendid David Burke, later to be equally well played by Edward Hardwicke. Productions values were high, and supporting casts were always from the top drawer. It was a classic series, cut short by Brett's untimely death in 1995. This first episode amply reveals what made the project so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product ! !","review":"Great Product; Fits very comfortably and it filters perfectly.

I've read all of Clive Cussler's books, and this is the worst one I've read so far. There wasn't any of the magic or fun that I've come to expect in the books, nor the passion. It's almost like Cussler couldn't quite make up his mind in what direction he wanted to go, and in the end, he went in too many different directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I have read only half of the book, but can't seem to get interested in it. It isn't what I thought it would be. I'm halfway through and nothing has really happened in it to make me want to read more. This is my first book by Clive Cussler. I thought maybe it was just a 'guy' book, but I have read several reviews by women who liked it. According to some of the reviews I have read, this is Clive's worst book, wouldn't you know it. I plan on finishing the book, but will probably not buy another from the author.

They shall both be quickly forgotten. This was one of the worst-written, ill-conceived books I have read in a long time. The plot was sophmoric and the dialogue inept. This books is best described as a cartoon, a comic book, that somehow made it into hardcover form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speak the lines, I pray you . . .","review":"Fascinating story, BUT, good Lord--the dialogue!

You read \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" by Graham Hancock. You thought to yourself it would make a great piece of fiction. And you managed to comletely screw it up!I had never read Clive Cussler before, and I never will again. First of all, the dialogue was utter nonsense. No one speaks like these characters. Also, why in the world does the author insist on describing in detail every piece of machinery, or gadget that Dirk Pitt (and what a stupid name!) or his enemies are using? This is inane. Is Clive Cussler getting kick backs from all of the brand names that he mentions in his books? Everything about this book can be summed up in one little 5 letter word.Silly.If you respect your intelligence, stay away from this one! I would have given no stars if it was possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"Well, not even pretty. It starts off with an interesting angle, but thereafter goes rapidly downhill and the ability to suspend disbelief disappears completely after about the half-way mark. However, I bravely stuck it out to the end, and it just became steadily more ludicrous, the characters more and more cardboard cutouts, the successful adventures against hopeless odds ever more absurd. The paperback cost me SFr10 (about $US6) where it was being sold off presumably in an attempt to move it. I paid too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book - BAD tape","review":"I am a big fan of Clive Cussler, and have read all his books. I read Atlantis Found and really enjoyed it. Just recently I bought the book on tape (read by Michael Prichard), for my husband to listen to. He is not a fiction reader, but we listened to Harry Potter with our kids and became addicted to listening to the tapes while driving. Well, the narrator of Atlantis Found was just terrible. He read in monotones, and brought little excitement to the story. Each character sounded the same, except the females and he read them sounding really silly! My husband did enjoy the plot, but we will not listen to Michael Prichard reading a Clive Cussler book again. Mr Prichard should take notes from the Harry Potter narrator (Jim Dale), who was outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow Up","review":"I can't believe I keep reading this dribble. The stories are fair, but the characters seem to keep getting more moronic. I can't figure out who is older - the cliches or the characters (who seem to be going through a neverending mid life crisis). This is the last Clive Cussler book I buy. My suggestion is to get this one at the library and spend your money on good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable male macho drivel","review":"Boooring! The hero is of course taller, stronger, and smarter than anyone, and all of the women are sexy, sensuous and in love with him at a single look. Moreover, it was a re-hash of the old Nazis-rising-again theme, with a generous dose of German-bashing. Tries for a Crichton archaelogical depth, but never achieves credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I was intrigued by this book because of its title, rather than the author. I had never read any of Clive Cussler's books before and found this one to be very intriguing and well written. I read it in one day and enjoyed it. It was a long book but it kept you into it by not being repetitive and boring. I appreciate that even though it was much like James Bond, it did not have sex scenes and trashy language throughout, in fact I don't recall any language or scenes. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone know an assassin for hire?","review":"Mr Cussler is starting to believe his own hype and has moved away from fast moving stories into self indulgence with tired and predictable characters.By the end of this, I am afraid I was with the bad guys and was hoping for Pitt's early death.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my","review":"This is the first Clive Clusser book I've read; I selected it because people told me that anthropologists/archaeologists are main characters and I'm an archaeologist. Oh lord, I got my first huge chuckle from mammoths freezing solid where they stood (in preface or intro) and continued laughing from there. Not sure what is funnier: Atlantians colonized Antartica, the Forth Richt (as in Nazi's were the Third Richt, not sure how to spell 'richt\\"), the so-called archaeologist acting like a hired killer/adventurer, or the author writing himself into the novel-on Antarctica of all places. Read this book only if you want a good laugh and have much freetime, its long with tiny print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story - pity about the style","review":"The aim of any fiction writer is to get the reader to suspend belief. My ability to do this was greatly impaired by Cussler's writing. His characters are hardly even one-dimesional, his grammar is no better than a schoolchild, and his dialog is, frankly, dreadful.In the book's favor, the storyline is strong and well thought out. That didn't, however, outweigh the many, many faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantis Found","review":"The book might have been alright, but the narrator of the unabridged audio tape left a great deal to be desired. It sounded like he was reading to an audience without a microphone and was trying to be heard by the person sitting in the last row. There was no feeling in his voice. I listen to all of my books by audio tape on my commute. I had to quit listening to this one because it was so awful. A weak story and a very bad narrator. I will make sure that if the narrator Michaiel Prichard I will NOT BUY the audio tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"online book review","review":"Atlantis Found was a greatbook. It was full of twists and turns that keep you reading. In the story some billionaires are trying to continue another third riech! They have a dominant plan to flood the entire world. Dirk Pitt of NUMA, is trying to stop them with every ounce of power he has. In the midst of it all he is being attacked by all angles. Prepare for a great page turner in: Atlantis Found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler at his best","review":"Atlantis Found ranks not only as one of the most enthralling adventures undertaken by the wisecracking Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino but as one of the greatest books I have read recently. The ingredients are formulaic, as with most of the Dirk Pitt novels, but in Atlantis Found the plot is constructed with trademark Cussler flair and punctuated by thrilling Pitt action/adventure.Yes, one could argue that similar plots have been used in his previous books, but Atlantis Found possesses a panache greatly lacking in today's action offerings.A classic Dirk Pitt novel and definitely one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, Intrigue, and Then Some","review":"Cussler really researched his ideas and then had a lot fun with this novel. I found it very entertaining all the way through. Written with action and implants of nervous humor, the villian and the plot almost seem possible even though it is very James Bondish in a \\"world domination\\" theme. The book is very readable, and entertaining. Well planned hero stuff. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully relaxing","review":"Sure, Atlantis Found is wordy, macho, 8th grade level reading, etc, but hey, it wasn't designed to be a literary masterpiece.

Dirk Pitt fans are sure to love it, I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantis Found","review":"I've read every CC novel and was excited to see a new one. I read it quickly, though it was long! It was highly suspenseful, well based on scientific fact and probability. It's a thinking person's adventure, full of stops to look on the maps included in the book, comparisions to larger maps to see the area as it really is - and allowing you to feel fully part of the adventure. I wonder if Admiral Byrd's Snow Cat is real? This is a definate high adventure keeper... Very enjoyable to escapism as well as broadening knowledge and a feeling that this could really happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile Waste of Time","review":"The only way I could finish this colossal waste of time was to skim the final 200 pages.

Here's my advice if somebody gives you a copy of \\"Atlantis Found\\": throw it back at him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifth grade reading level","review":"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read, and looking at the reviews, it seems as though maybe I should give him another chance.I actually liked the plot and ideas behind Atlantis Found, however, I had a hard time getting \\"lost\\" in the book, as I love to do, because of the grade school level of writing! Also, I found the Pitt character to be such a cliche of a hero that I was hoping the bad guys would win just so there would be some sort of surprise.Even though I've given it only one star, I would recommend this book in one instance - as an assignment for someone learning English. The plot is interesting enough for an adult, while the English is simple enough for an intermediate learner to follow along. If I was still teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) I would definitely use this book in my class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Great, but not typically good Cussler ending","review":"I have always enjoyed Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. But, Atlantis Found disappointed me. The novel starts off in typical Cussler fashion, with a great premise, good background facts, and typical Dirk Pitt adventure. But, then, the climax and ending trail off, in an incomplete and unresolved manner. For example, Cussler tells us that there is a spy at NUMA (possibly Admiral Sandecker's secretary, Julie Wolff?), but there is no follow-up, and we never find out who it is. The significance of the magnificent obsedian skulls is never explained. The clues regarding the Nazi connection are thrown together in an uncharacteristically sloppy way. I was disappointed because Cussler is capable of better organization. I hope the next one is better (I'm sure it will be)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantis Found","review":"This was the first Dirk Pitt novel i've read, and I found it to be a great book. It was filled with action and adventure. I seemed to not be able to put this book down until i finished it. My only complaint was that there was too much detail about brands of items in the story, I don't think anyone honestly cares why Dirk chose to use one brand of scuba tank over another. All in all, it was a fantastic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler Not At His Best","review":"It seems that Cussler has faltered with Atlantis Found and has given a plot that seems to Indiana Jonesish with a new history of the world. Cussler's high points were reached with Cyclops and Inca Gold, but this one seems to drop down. While I did like Flood Tide and others in the series, this one was just like a history lesson and wasn't as good as other books of his I'd read. The beginning seemed like a copy off of Inca Gold, with Dirk Pitt saving scientist's from a temple and later realizes a clue that leads him to the villain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantis Found","review":"Clive Cusler has done it again. I have read every Clive Cusler book ever released and can tell you that the non-stop action, of his hero Dirk Pitt, is what makes his books so outstanding.With his fast paced narrative and the intricate weaving of several simultenous story plots, he keeps you on the edge of chair, waiting for that unexpected and exciting ending that is true Clive Cusler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have read - ever.","review":"This book was a great disappointment. The story line is completely rediculous. I only finished reading it, because I wanted to know if it would get any better, but alas it didn't. I use this book as an example for a bad book, if somebody asks me.plot - I guess Dirk is a superhero, he dodges every attack story line - can it get any more stereotyped?Never Clive for me again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? Is Cussler senile?","review":"I have read all his books and this one is just BAD (as in not good). Cussler will waste a whole paragraph on what the characters are eating or what color Pitt's eyes are (for the thousandth time) but he has no problem skipping over whole sections of the PLOT. I was repeatedly asking myself \\"is Cussler stupid, or what?\\" This book was SO unrealistic that I was left wondering why."},{"rating":"1","title":"500 pages too long","review":"Who is this guy's editor? I'd like to have a talk with him. Atlantis Found would be a great book, if only someone else had written it. Or if someone had, you know, proofread. I have to give Cussler credit for having good intentions and ideas, but his characters are more like caricatures (when they're given any sort of distinction at all), the dialogue is horrendous, and his tendency to write himself into the plot is a bit tacky. I also found it a bit disconcerting to find every boat, plane, cycle and piece of gear Pitt was toting described by brand and model...is Cussler picking up endorsement money somewhere? In spite of what most of the fan reviews are saying, Dirk Pitt has none of Bond's panache, and I can't understand comparing the two.Good science fiction makes the impossible believable. Atlantis Found even makes what little hard science it contains hard to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Maybe I just dont get it - this is the first Dirk Pitt novel I read and I found it predictable, dull, poorly written... and just plain bad. Lame dialogue... ugh the list goes on and on!I am all for James Bond type thrillers but this is just NOT it. I will never read another novel by this author as I just found this thing a complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cussler","review":"For lovers of Cussler, this is a classic. Exciting adventures, improbable rescues, and a great ending.Pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome grasping read","review":"Great read! A real page turner. I liked the idea of Atlantis being found and what would be a plausible story of the people who lived so long ago. Cussler has a way with words to grip your imagination and drag you into the story as you read it.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in naval vessels and Atlantis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Cussler Adventure","review":"One of his earlier books with a great archeological story, and top shelve villans, although, I would like a date with the woman villan... she was pretty interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, easy read","review":"I hadn't read a Dirk Pitt novel in several years, and this one picks up where the others left off. A stretch of imagination mixed with some science fiction, or at lease, we hope it is. The pieces tie together pretty neatly, although the ending is very tame compared to some other parts of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged kicking and screaming to Atlantis","review":"Why did I finish this book? It took sheer willpower and a niggling hope that a great plot twist would make it all worthwhile. Tedious and unnecessary descriptions were thrown into the mix. For example, Dirk would be scrambling over a mountainside with vast hordes in pursuit and Cussler would pause to describe, in excruciating detail, the shirt and pants being worn by our hero. Well, it wasn't as strange as all that, but it seemed that many paragraphs were throwaways and did little to move the story along. What was the deal with the gourmet meal of rabbit and sweetbreads situated in the midst of all the mayhem? It sure brought everything to a screaching halt. I think \\"Dad\\" should learn to write more better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Drivel","review":"I'm not a picky reader, nor do I routinely bash far-fetched pulp fiction. However, it seems that after 20 years of Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler wrote this book solely for money. The characters are cliched card-board cutouts with ZERO character development. And it seemed that nearly every character had cold blue eyes with bodies that Mr. and Ms. Universe would envy.But the biggest complaint I have, is the book read like the author was just punching out the words as fast as he could, and then running off to play golf. I like to read through books in one session, but this took me five or six.On the posotive side, the ending action sequence was neat. Lets just hope he ends the series mercifully, and not have it end up like the comic series Penuts..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been There Done That","review":"When you pick up a Clive Cussler novel, you already know pretty much how it's going to end. It's almost a foregone conclusion. I went into this book with a small amount of trepidation. I didn't really care for Flood Tide because I felt it went on too long. When I saw the page count on Atlantis Found, I was afraid yet again. But, happily, I was wrong. It turned out to be a very enjoyable book. I finished it after only a few days.The trick to Cussler novels isn't the fact that the heroes save the world at the end. Or that the villains are dastardly. It's the way Cussler takes a small piece from history (or a myth) and weaves it into a credible tale that makes you want to read. I have always read and enjoyed Cussler's work and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Formula","review":"Clive Cussler has once again written a novel based on his successful formula that has worked again and again. With the starting grand entrance of Pitt to the predictable ending of Pitt saving the human race. (Yes, Again.)What makes this book highly interesting is Cussler's theory on the people of 'Atlantis', what happened to them, and the legacy that was left behind. Cussler was able to tie in the crash of a comet, the disappearance of Atlantis, a vehicle built by Adm. Byrd, and the rise of the Fourth Empire (Reich).The ending by Cussler leaves the book open for sequels, with the start of a new NUMA book, (serpent) and the hints given in the book, one wonders if this might be the last of the Pitt novels. Overall, the book is predictable as a James Bond movie. The bad dudes gets what they deserves, hero gets a few scraps and bruises, but saves the world and gets the girl. But the theories and knowledge of the ocean and historical tie-ins are worth the time invested in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get printed?","review":"This was my first Cussler book. It was recommended by a friend. From what I've read, I have to conclude that Cussler heard a great story and then turned it into a miserable book.1. Dialogue - horrible. Unreadible. Its stiff, it tries to be funny, and it tries to be James Bond type wit. It fails in the worst way.2. Characters - Dirk Pitt, say it aloud: Dirk Pitt. Bad name. It doesnt't work. Also, let's review the character: an ex-marine, works as a diver for a government agency called NUMA, collects classic cars, and dates a beautiful congresswomen who adores him. That can only be a string of Cussler's fantasies fused into one person. Doesn't happen.3. Humour - whoever told Cussler he was funny should be shot.If you read this Cussler I'm sorry I don't think you're a good author. Take heart - you're obviously good at something, because the book seems to be selling well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"OK let's face it -- no one reads a Cussler book for the highbrow prose. He has GREAT plots. And this one is original for the way it combines two old plotlines (Atlantis and the Nazis) into an original story. It's well-researched, I might add. And personally I'm THRILLED that he ditched the co-author from the last book and wrote this one himself. Something about Cussler's writing grabs you from the first minute -- who wants poetic writing in an action adventure for Pete's sake? From the discovery of the skull in Colorado to the ultimate discovery in Antartica, this book is a thrill a minute. Who cares that Dirk and Al have been blown up more times than any of us can count? We all secretly want to be Dirk Pitt (and I'm a woman saying this!) surviving with aplomb and humor and worst anyone can hurl at us. Well worth your reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventure continues....","review":"As all my previous Cussler reviews have said, I read this series in order and they just seem to get better as I go through them.This series is simply the most fun you'll have taking a little trip through your imagination with Dirk and Al.It's over the top, full of more than a few cliches, and often has bad dialogue. (Most from the vile bad guys)It's also daring, action packed, and even a little informative at times.Everyone picks on Cussler for his dialogue but, they seem to forget these books are just for fun and take place in a pseudo-fantasy world.If you want \\"real\\" people living a \\"real\\" life, read Jane Austen or something.Enjoy Atlantis Found for what it is then read Valhalla Rising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting theory, but really !","review":"this novel caught my eye due to the inspiring title including the word 'Atlantis' and hence i thought that the book might be of some good thing substance. yet it was not, although the underlying theory was interesting and provide some mild contenment for somebody interested in the subject. it was in a way very similar to previous factual books by the likes of George Hancock and Charles Hapgood discussing the possibilty of Atlantis being discovered under Antartica. the incredulous character of Dirk Pitt does nothing more for the book than the manner in which it was written. an involving plot seemed to be the only bonus from the novel that was ultimately a James Bond story told in a slightly more interlectual way."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're baaackkkk!","review":"It is absolutely criminal that we wait 2-3 years between Dirk Pitt adventures. Clive Cussler weaves a tale like no other author I have ever encountered. You always begin his novels and say to yourself: \\"how can he possibly tie these events together?\\" The Lost Continent of Atlantis, professional hitmen, Colorado mines, comets, ancient caves, Nazis, etc. Cussler binds it all together like a pretty Birthday package. While I want to read on, I force myself to ration the book, for I know that the long wait begins as soon as I finish. Each and every chapter has you rooting for hero Dirk Pitt and constantly marvelling at his quick wit, skill and bravery. Of course Cussler has added a new twist to one of the baddest groups of all time...Nazis. To author Cussler, I say \\"Bravo\\" and sincerely ask...Couldn't you be a little more prolific?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula For Success","review":"I am a big Dirk Pitt fan, having read all of the books (mostmore than once). Atlantis Found, though, is a stinker. The plot istrite (Hitler's children; sappy romance with the Congresswoman) andfilled with flaws.

LMAO."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilariously outrageous page-turner","review":"Clive Cussler has done it again. Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino save the world yet again, this time from the diabolical plans of a German Nazi family. Even though the plots of the books are getting more and more out of the ordinary, the action-packed books of the NUMA-series are still a pleasure to read if you are looking for a typical thriller to help you through your holidays. Superhero and renowned macho Dirk and his witty friend Al never have a dull moment in their lives..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler read, and it is my last. A suspenseful prologue aside, this book is awash in shallow main characters, silly plot twists, and inane dialogue. Add a doomsday plot so implausible that it would make Ian Flemming blush. The dialogue between Dirk and friends seems to have been copied from some bad cop show, with tasteless, cliched, campy similes by the dozen. I happened to read this book in the audio form, which also had an awful narrator. Save your time and sense of self-worth, and read something by Clancy, Ludlum, or perhaps as one other reviewer suggested, the excellent novels of Patrick Obrien."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"If you dont have anything nice to say...\\"","review":"Alright, I'll admit that Clive Cussler has been, and always will be, a \\"popular fiction\\" writer, i.e. books that dont require thought. But his past books were NEVER this bad! I actually enjoyed his early novels, but Cussler's writing has become nothing but shoddy junk. Atlantis found is shallow and cliche. The only highlight I can find is that it isn't (thank god) tedious. But what bothered me the most was his need to explain things such as Precession, Diffusion (in relation to the populating of North America), and even sky charts (among many other things) for goodness sakes! I understand some people may not have ever heard of, say, the Theory of Diffusion, but they are capable of looking it up! Cussler need not badly attempt to work the definition into the story!! Ugh. Nothing bothered me more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"Badly written, cliched characters, dumb plot. Lines like \\"mudslides that were almost 30 feet wide or more.\\" (What's almost more?) Everybody has \\"white teeth\\" in this book. It's filled with the model numbers of the machines, but it lacks any development of the people. This is Judith Krantz with fighting instead of shopping. It's bad.What's more, the reader has little intonation and his voice grates. It's just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz Oh sorry, was I writing a review?","review":"I am about half way through this book and I just can't finish it. Its not usual I do that but it is just sucking my will to live.The dialogue is a joke. I can't stand the main character. I'm mostly just hoping that between dodging 'killers' and bombs, he gets wacked in the process.It seems every paragraph is just filled with the make and model of every piece of gear he has on. Do I care that he looked down at his x3-500 Supermega watch with intel microprogramming digitalizers? No. And no one else does either.Sorry but I just dont think I can finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because I have not read any of Cussler's other works, but I must say that I was severely dissappointed in this book. I finally gave up trying to be interested about half way through, and that is extremely rare for me. Considering the rave reviews I read, I tried hard to let this book win me over, but all I can tell you is I wont be reading any more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have actually READ this book!","review":"OK, can someone tell me why the average rating of this book is 4 stars! @$ I have been totally misled. It's so childishly predicatble, like a bad Hollywood action movie. Alright, the story line could be a PASS. But, my goodness, a flat lacking of narritive skills. It's my first time reading Clive Cussler and LAST. It's for kids age 8-10 only."},{"rating":"1","title":"dashrom","review":"Who edited this story? Dialogue was out of place, events contradicted themselves. Are we in too big a hurry to make a dollar? I want the job of editing the next attempt but it seems Dirk and Al are about to be turned out to pasture with their love interests. Does this mean we have to endure those two characters that surfaced two years ago in Cussler's collaboration with what's-his-name?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was really good","review":"Well I've read every Clive Cussler book there is....and this one is pretty good. I was expecting something A LOT DIFFERENT but it was still very interesting. I thought the intro wasn't quite as good as some Pitt novels....and the overall story wasn't as gripping as some....but it was still good. Too bad Dirk is getting old......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a horse with a broken leg, I had to put it down.","review":"This was my first Cussler novel. I had heard such great things about his books but I was sorely disappointed. Sure, the action was great. I love good action. However, the characters were so waaaaay over the top it became truly annoying. Dirk Pitt does everything so perfectly. He never makes mistakes. He is super-human and super-macho. The character is completely unbelievable. The book could have been great had the characters been more \\"down to earth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighteninginajar","review":"Only literary genious could conjur a doomsday episode utilizing the gargantuan Anartic glacier as a catalyst. Cussler engineered another captivating can't lay down novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, but would make excellent movie","review":"Uggg.I'll keep this short - Cussler writes as if his primary goal is not to write a book so much as it's to write a movie script. Cussler has great ideas, does a bit of research to add a bit of \\"meat\\" to his plot, but almost all of his books need even more research, an editor's touch, and much less testosterone to make anything plausible.Cussler's books are fine if that's what you like, and it's OK if that's what you're looking for - just be warned that this and most of his books are just an excuse for another screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much action!","review":"Im a new fan of Cusslers. Ive read a few of his books now in a row and this has to be the best. There were some long chapters but overall it kept my interest up until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo-Nazis Find Atlantis","review":"Cussler again delivers a weird, over-the-top, action-adventure novel featuring the perpetually hunky Dirk Pitt. This time, a shady group of people are killing archaeologists who find out about the existence of an advanced ancient civilization. Throw in death comets, neo-Nazis, cloning, and impossible shipbuilding for good measure. A fun read if taken with a pinch of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previous efforts - IMHO","review":"I've been a Clive Cussler fan for as long as he has been writing. I have each of his books in both hardback and paperback and reread each of them at least once per year.The latest book was a bit of a disappointment. It starts out well but then fades. It's almost as if Clive didn't write it. I was anxiously awaiting this book and read it in two sittings. However, it's not going to be a favorite of mine. It may get reread on occasion.There's not enough of Dirk and Al working together for me. They're often separate which means their witty reparte is missing. All of the main characters are in it, but it seems to not fire on all cylinders. The last two Dirk novels have not entertained me nearly as much as his earlier works. It's hard to put my finger on it but it's just not as riveting as others. A lack of the sense of urgency and danger is part of it.Better luck next time Mr. Cussler. I'll continue to read your books as long as you continue to write them."},{"rating":"1","title":"old stained book","review":"I ordered a new book and got an old stained book. It's never been read, but looks like it got wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far over the top it flies away","review":"The second worst book I have ever read. Dialogue is utterly atrocious and the plot just gets more ludicrous as you go.The first few pages seemed promising and having never read a Cussler novel before I was optimistic. After the first few eye rolling sections of dialogue I was starting to worry a bit, but we then progressed to Dirk Pitt's ridiculous stuntman abilities and I abandoned all hope.It reads like an Austin Powers movie plot line with a 80's Schwarzenegger movie dialogue.I like escapism as much as the next person but I just could not get past the awful writing. I had my wife laughing out loud when I would read out a paragraph. If you can read the \\"Hitler's Sperm\\" references without groaning then you might enjoy this action packed mess, otherwise try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it, you'll probably love it.","review":"Easily the worst the of the seven Pitt novels I have read. I mean, all of the negative reviews pretty much sum up my thoughts. I read books hand over fist but this one took me weeks to plod through. A jumbled mess in dire need of editing. Still, of the many fans I know of these books, this is one of their favourites, so whatever man. This is one of the least likely Pitt adventures, having virutally nothing to do with his career and almost everything to do with being a secret agent / commando. As crappy as a book it makes, it would be an outstanding movie. Cool villans and villanous plot, but in the end, not much comes of it but a gun fight. A little hollywood tweaking here and there and you've have a very fun and forgetable film for all your kids to waste your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitly not his best","review":"This was a major dissapointment to me. I have read every Cussler / Dirk Pitt adventure and relish the release of a new one.For lack of a better word, this book was \\"tired.\\" Every book as a lot of the same things and this just seemed like a retread of a retread. I think due to a comment one of the characters makes later in the story that Cussler realizes this himself and may put the series to rest.If this is the best he can do, than I think that's a good idea.If you are a first timer or have only read one or two other books - skip this one. If you are a die hard fan and must read, than do so -I hope you enjoy it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, weak plot, stolen ideas","review":"Cussler's story about a new generation of Nazis based in Argentina is largely built upon Graham Hancock's book Fingerprints of the Gods (a lost maritime civilization, earth-crust displacement, ancient maps, etc.). Cussler tries to create an action/suspense novel using this as a backdrop, and even if his writing weren't so poor - AWFUL dialog, weak characters, unrealistic action sequences - it would still have been challenging to weave a credible storyline out of these elements. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the author fails so miserably in his attempt to do so. At times he came across as an extremely lowbudget version of Tom Clancy, without the depth of knowledge and feel for dialog that Mr. Clancy has, thereby making a bad situation even worse. Atlantis Found is by far one of the worst books I have ever read, and I would highly recommend NOT buying it, and picking up Fingerprints of the Gods instead (and a couple of Elmore Leonard books as well!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"It's unfathomable to me how after writing this book Clive Cussler expects anyone to continue buying his books. I used to be a Dirk Pitt fan, but Cussler clearly couldn't care less about his fans any longer, either that or he has a very low opinion of their intelligence. A few of his earlier Dirk Pitt novels were amusing reads but this one just plain stinks. The writing is terrible, the characters are beyond shallow, the plot is full of holes and the dialogue is worse than an old Gilligan's Island rerun. To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. Clive's lost me as a customer... Try Patrick O'Brian's novels about the sea instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I have found the last two Cussler \\"Dirk Pitt\\" novels lacking in their usual excitement and knowledegable entertainment. There seems to be more violence and sexual innuendos than precious books. I feel as if Cussler gave his characters to someone else to write with. Having read every Pitt novel its easy to sense the subtle changes in his tales. The best novels are \\"Sahara\\" and \\"Raise the Titanic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same as always","review":"Dirk Pitt books are all fun airplane reading - lots of excitement, by the end of which Dirk and Al have saved the world. Same here. Somehow, though, while I can suspend disbelief pretty well for almost any science fiction and for James Bond, Cussler's work always seems to bring me to the brink of disappointing disbelief. And it always takes an effort to get past that. That is true for this book, in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler is the man.","review":"Let me make it easy for everyone. If you like Cussler you'll like this. If you've never read Cussler and your the guy who complains about the realism in an action movie you won't like it. It's suppossed to be fun, and that's all. Please don't take the english teacher's red pen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"I feel compelled to warn people that Atlantis Found is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I've enjoyed other books by Cussler, and appreciated them for what they were. However, this is so poorly written I almost felt embarrassed for the guy. I would under no circumstances recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasten Your Seat Belts!","review":"Cussler fans rejoice! Atlantis Found is Awesome! Clive Cussler's latest thriller will not disappoint the legion of fans worldwide who have been waiting two long years for a Dirk Pitt novel. Along with the classic Dirk entrances, fans will be surprised and pleased that Dirk's long time leading lady,Loren Smith, takes an active roll in the plot. Many suprises are in store for our heros as they battle the odds to save the world from a destruction beyond comprehension. Be prepared to spend a few sleepless nights reading Atlantis Found. You will have a hard time finding that \\"stopping place\\". Yes, Virgina, there is a Santa Claus. He delivered a classic Dirk Pitt novel just in time for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Dirk","review":"Dirk Pitt you are very annoying. I love James Bond, and i love Indiana Jones even more. But Dirk Pitt, you are neither. Your toys, interests and looks are overly cliched. I'm afraid you just bother me. This novel offered an interesting insight to this lost city, but it is hard to figure out what is fact and what is fiction. The story is quite outlandish. One thing i did appreciate about this novel was the answer to \\"why good guys' bullets hit, and bad guys' miss?\\" The answer...good guys aim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired!!","review":"I normally like Cussler, but this just seemed to be a similiar theme from an author that was tired of his characters - I got the feeling right from the start that it would be the last one in the series. It was a shame because it could have been so much better - there were plenty of noticeable inconsistences - not something I had seen before in his previous books. Never mind - maybe Cussler should invent some new characters, and move away from the global disaster theme! Lets face it - if it wasn't for the fact that the Bond stories are films (special effects, bond girls, corny lines, etc) then we wouldn't be interested in story number 12 (or whatever!). I suppose my point is is that it is time to leave Al and Dirk to their homemaking and scuba diving, and find another HERO!!!See yA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start -- Weak Ending","review":"This book got off on a strong beginning, lots of details in the middle, and then a weak and disappointing ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to reflect","review":"This was the best of Cussler's later books in the series. Pitt and Al are long time friends and this book showed yet another dimension to their history. I will miss them. My mom, 2 sons and I all enjoyed this adventure and read through it too fast. A second reading brought about a time to reflect back on a truly terrific team that has brought us many adventures and given my family lots of lively discussions! Good reading for any adventure or history buff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler book. However, I have read other similar adventure-type books in the past. Even though this book is action-packed, it does not leave me wanting to read other CC books. Dirk Pitt is nothing compared to Jack Ryan , whom Dirk mentions in the book. He is just another James Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go!","review":"As usual, I read the book straight through. Just when you think the story is climaxing, it just picks up and tears off again at mach 2! Don't make any plans for the day you decide to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Decent amount of detail of Madison's congressional career.

It was sort of a high school level book. Chick Parsons was an amazing guy and a real hero and this book doesn't do him justice. I'm sure there are better books about him that this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmare in the Theatre...","review":"Stagefright is simply put a fun, scary movie to behold! Although there is quite a bit of gore which is not really my style so you may want to close your eyes in parts if that turns you off. But what could be a better premise in a horror film than a group of actors being locked in a dreary theatre for the night with a psychotic killer stalking them at every turn dressed in an owl suit. And then the lone, final girl must try and defeat the villain before she becomes his last victim. All the elements of the post-slasher era are here as this was made in 1987. You have the infamous thunderstorm, people making bad decisions, a variety of interesting deaths and even a black cat crossing someone's path. Still, this is definitely worth checking out if you enjoy these films. This was originally released on DVD by Anchor Bay and now is being distributed by Blue Underground. I wish one of these companies would release the 1980 horror gem Curtains next (although released in 1983)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical \\"chocolate mousse\\"","review":"Il Viaggio a Reims has been quite a revelation for me. I do not particularly fancy Rossini's operas but I have to confess that this one is so delicious to listen at, that no one can resist the temptation of falling in love with it. It is like a chocolate mousse, ligth and rich at the same time. The stage production is vibrant, dynamic and innovative. It is obvious that both the audience and the singers are having a great time. I loved the closeups of some of the people in the audience, particularly the little boy that looks dazzled by the beauty of Rossini's music. Highly recommended. This is healing music at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable","review":"Simple (even silly) plot, wonderful music. This opera entertains and makes you smile, as can be seen by the faces in the audience.The music is typical (and great) Rossini. The opera is a product of a big group of very good singers. An opera that has many roles for many singers. The ensembles are just pure musical art.Gergiev proved that he can do more than Russian composers, and does it exceptionally well. The Russian singers are a joy to listen and watch.Highly recommended to enjoy good music, good singing and even good acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"The bridge pictured, with wide wings, is almost identical to one I've had for 40 years.

But in a way it was kind of disappointing because there were only 13 tracks on the CD. Now if you are a true Macabre fan you should know that's not normal. Sinister Slaughter had 20 songs, Dahmer had 26, Gloom (Re-mastered) had 27, and Sinister Slaughter/Behind the Walls of Sleep CD had 25.The music is still rockin and they still to this day jam out pretty hard. The drummer is bad *ss! And the lead singer is the craziest guy but very sociable at the same time.If you want my true opinion the best release they ever had was an EP. The \\"UNABOMBER\\" EP that came out in 1998 on Decomposed Records. It only had 7 tracks but those seven songs were worth every penny.Macabre ~ 8 stars out of 10 starsOther stuff by Macabre:Grim RealityGloomSinister SlaughterUnabomberDahmerSinister Slaughter/Behind the Walls of SleepMurder MetalMorbid CampFire Tales"},{"rating":"1","title":"sellout.","review":"Sounds to me like their audience was waning so they added some cheesy modern death metal elements which is really sad.

Being a woman, I can definitely say women DON'T like it. It reminds me of the over-cologned boys in high school, and it is a very young scent. I would put it just a step above something from Axe. It smells very young. Of course, my roommate practically pours it on, so that could be a problem. This stuff is very strong. It will linger in a room for 20 minutes after someone wearing it has left, and it sticks to anything it touches (pets, couches, etc.).So, if you wear it, please, mist lightly. Just one spray into the air then walk through it. I've realized men have the tendency to overdo it. I would recommend going to a more sophisticated and subtle scent for anyone over 20 or so.

To start off, the instructions are very vague, leaving you to figure out how to use the unit. The software, which basically performs all of your mapping functions, is spread out across 4 CDs with little direction, so again, you're on your own to try to figure out how to get a map and directions into your Palm Pilot and working with the GPS. And after waiting for 90 minutes for the unit to lock into a satellite, it never happened. Even standing out in the open with no obstacles. Plus the Palm processor is too slow to correctly run the maps. Save your money is my advice.

The track realism looks pretty damn good to me. I have a P3 700, with a pretty basic 3d card and only 64 RAM and this game runs fine. Look, I doubt this game was written for experts, and its probably targeted for the mainstream audience and general F1 fans like me. So if you're looking for the absolute best SIM, spend more... and get something else, otherwise this game is cheap and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"F1 2000","review":"I read some of the reviews out there for this game. Some hit the mark and others miss. For starters the complaints about the system requirements are accurate. I have a P3 650 ,64 megs RAM and a Voodoo card and the game seems to think this is a med-low system. As for the review that said it wouldn't run in glide, that's no suprise as it's Direct 3d only! Another said you can't blow the engines. Unfortunately I can atest to that being wrong too. Not only can you but I have! The game has it's frustrating points but it's fun and fairly realistic. It's hard to gauge the realism as I've never been in a real F1 car.But if you have good hardware to run it and like F1 anyway I would recommend this game to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very big dissapointment !","review":"After playing a demo of F1 World of garnd prix by EIDOS (recomended), I made the mistake and bought this EA Sporst F1 2000 game , I found out that altough EA sports made a lot of work with the exact cars drivers and circuits but the game is very unrealistic ! the sound is horrible ! also the forcefeedback is very low , and driving with my Logitech formula steering wheel was annoying , (This steering wheel is excellent with some other games). Anyway if your a F1 fan find out another game !"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets - for now","review":"Everyone loves to beat on this game, but don't believe the hype. It is the most realistic F1 driving title currently on the market. The sound, graphics, and most importantly the behavior of the car is incredible. The only problem with F1 2000 is the AI of your opponents. It's a bit suspect, but a patch is already out to help. You will also need a 450mhz machine with a good 3d card. If you like F1 and racing sims you will love it. Oh yeah - you better have a wheel to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest dissapointment of 2000","review":"Like everyone else who bought this game, I was looking foward to the new tracks, realistic pit stops, better graphics, and better engine notes(or 'realistic back-fire noises' as EA puts it).Please.For starters, this game will run on .01% of all home PC's. I had to do a $300 upgrade my computer, and it still didn't run like it was supposed to.As a Formula One enthusiast, this was the biggest dissapointment, especially from the company that brought us Need for Speed. The sounds sounded like a bad early 90's driving sim game, the cockpit view wasn't as realisitic, and like all other formula one games, it lacks pit stop action.EA, please do your homework again and try to get it right. It totally misses the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still the best available","review":"Everyone likes to beat up this game. It is a very entertaining and realistic F1 simulation. It's not an arcade game like need for speed. You will need at least 450mhz, a good 3d accelerator and a steering wheel and it runs great. The only problem with the game is the AI. Racing other cars can be tough - but if you make it through the start (not often) and avoid braking early it is pretty real. Just running hotlaps by yourself is easily worth the price of this game. The tracks were done great! Don't believe the nay sayers. If you like F1 and race simulations, you will like F1 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better F1 sims!","review":"This game looks good, but doesn't play well. After playing EIDOS's Official Formula 1 Racing, this game doesn't even compete (and OF1R is two years old)!

(AMD 750, Voodoo 5/5500). The game is sluggish even on my new machine. The game will not recognize my Video Card for Glide Support, which was detected on my older Voodoo 3/3000. There is no rain, and if you over-rev the engine It does not blow up. Everything else is great, the graphics are top-notch, the engine sounds are a litte weak, and the sim-factor is too-realistic (but fun). This game will not run well on anything slower than a P3 or a Athlon with a spendy 3d card and 128Mb of RAM. If you have the Horsepower, it should be a fun game. If you dont, It will just frustrate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some problems with this one","review":"I have been using Lonely Planet books for years and am surprised that it would turn out a guide as skimpy and shoddily written as this. The maps are useful, but the text's author, Wendy Yanagihara, seems to be unfamiliar with (or unable to get a sense of) Tokyo's character and its people. Yanagihara seems more bemused than informed, and one can only wonder why she was hired to write about a complex metropolis that she does not seem to understand.

There is no way you can do this by yourself, as you need to pinch the area and measure it at the same time with one hand. Also, it requires you to take all 3 measurements (tricep, illiac crest and thigh) because it will calculates a fat %, so it is limiting in that respect. If you want to be more scientific, I would get a manual caliper.It also is set up to measure and store 3 users, which may be an issue if you are training multiple people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's Fat?","review":"A little hard to take consistent readings but that's probably b/c it's hard to pinch the fat the right way.

Well worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I was absolutely disgusted when I opened the package, and the supposed \\"Improve your measuring skills\\" booklet was not included. I also need to mention that the measurements may be close, but the calculation is RIDICULOUSLY inaccurate. I sent a complaint to the company and recieved no response whatsoever. Manual calipers may be less convenient, but at least you can do the math yourself, and come up with an accurate number.

Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep. Impossible to do both at the same time. Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results. The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked. Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women. Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.

Since I started dieting, I've wanted to track my measurements and body fat, so I got the fat calipers and measuring tape.The fat calipers don't seem particularly accurate. Measurements taken minutes apart are very different, and, if you don't have a lot of fat in an area, it's almost impossible to pinch up an accurate measurement.As far as the tape measure goes, save some money and just get one from a variety store. It's very awkward to try and position and close, and, by the time you're done, you'd have been able to do the same thing better and cheaper with an ordinary tape from any sewing basket.If you really want to track this stuff, kick in the bucks to get something good, or use household measurements."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may have been good if it arrived","review":"I never had the pleasure to use this device since it never arrived and the vendor made little effort to send me a new one.

I don't doubt the caliper's accuracy, but I've tried measuring myself over and over and the values I get vary by as much as 15 mm. The instruction manual that it brings is far too basic and does not give a clear understanding of how to take measurements. I believe there are manuals for sale that are supposed to help you get consistent values, but I don't own one myself. Without such a manual, I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere. Also, the product description states that you can take measurements yourself, but unless you have four arms, it is impossible to do without someone to help you.The Myotape, on the other hand, is very easy to use and will give you accurate measurements every time. It is the only reason I rated this product with 2 stars instead of only one.

As far as I'm concerned this was a big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very acurate","review":"Purchased this product after losing over 100lbs. I needed to get a better sense of my progress on my weight loss program and how much muscle to fat ratio I had after such an extreme and rapid weight loss program. The calipers are difficult to use and often give a different reading each time I test the same site. Often the readings are extremely different and make no sense. An example would be going from 30% to 11% fat. Basically it's a cheap product that will do in a pinch to help with a very, and I mean very, rough estimate of my body fat percentage if used with extreme patience.

I've read two of his short story collections and liked a few of the stories but wasn't overly impressed.However, I've long been a fan of his poetry. I hadn't read anything of his for years so I was excited when a friend gave me several of his books of poetry for my birthday.Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this collection at all. As in, there wasn't a single poem of 159 poems that struck me. This really read like a man who was just spitting out words to make some cash.

There are many positives about this frame, from it's 800x600 resolution to it's price point (at the time). However, over the last 6 months (April 2009 to October 2009) all 3 have failed. The failure mode is exactly the same with all 3, you power up the frame and the display just does not come on and displays a random bunch of horizontal lines. The issue has to do with reading from the SD/MMC/CF/USB slots/ports because the frame works fine if I remove the card or usb key from it and power it up. However, this means you cannot actually put any images on cards and display them. 100% failure in 3 frames."},{"rating":"1","title":"great frame, might not last long though","review":"I have bought 3 of these.

As soon as I plugged it in it started making a high-pitched whining sound. The whining sound stopped when I dimmed the image to black, but started again when I turned up the dimmer so the picture was visible. I let the unit warm up and the whining was still there.

So this year I bought the 8-inch version as a Christmas gift for my aunt. Definitely a big hit with her, too!On both the 8\\" and 14\\" units, color is crisp and resolution is exceptionally good, unlike some of the no-name products I looked at. Backlight is strong enough for viewing in all but direct sunlight.Best features are:1. the Mosaic-View, which allows you to set up many effects/transitions between pictures, as well as \\"tiling\\" multiple images on the screen at once2. The variety of external memory types it supports - everything from the original CF chips right up through Ultra-SD and USB sticksAll in all, a great product and a reasonable price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The creme de la crem of smaller picture frames, hi-res and full on memory.","review":"This is a bit more in price than some of the smaller frames, but this one is outstanding in quality. Again, it has the standard multi-media card reader, MP3/MPEG playback, and 128mb internal memory (model 801 westinghouse has only 8mb). But the greatest feature of this model is the 800x600 pixel quality high resolution screen, which is even better than the 10 inch frame by westinghouse(800x480). Hard to beat quality for about $60 more than standard 7\\" frames with 480x234 quality. This frame also features the mosaic view (4 pictures side by side rotating), which is great looking on the high resolution. Check this one out, worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"I compared this model against the 8\\" Kodak SV811K and found the Westinghouse DPF-0802 lacking.Here's why:- Screen was initially very bright and then got very dull after 5 minutes. Viewing from angles was impossible. There seems to be no light sensor to detect lighting within the room.- No remote control. Controls and buttons are behind the frame.- OSD is very confusing.....if you can even figure out how to get it to come on.- After rotating pictures 90 degrees, wouldn't keep the settings. Very hard to even get to the Rotation setting.- If you plan on setting up a slide show with more than a dozen slides then plan on spending 30-45 minutes with the settings buttons.- The Favorites setting is prominently mentioned in the manual. Can someone tell me where it is?- Mosaic view is nice but you've got to be up close to see any detail in the pictures. Remember this is only an 8\\" LCD to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written JPEG Library","review":"My picture frame started acting strange. The screen would get all pixelated with bars and other graphical artifacts. Power cycling the unit would help things out temporarily but the problems just recurred.An email from Westinghouse technical support told me that I could only put \\"raw JPEGs\\" onto the frame because meta tags added by certain software can't be handled by their JPEG library. Most digital cameras automatically add tags. The suggestion was to open each picture in MS Paint and resave to get rid of any tags. Poorly written software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Frame!!!!","review":"Westinghouse 8-Inch LCD Digital Photo FrameI have owned this frame since Last year and enjoy it very much!!!

I checked and found one of the new pictures I added was in BMP format.It seems to work best with pictures in JPG format!! I deleted that 1 BMP picture and it is working great once again without hanging up!!!! Very nice for the price so I bought another one for my son!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, attractive, and nice LCD...","review":"Very impressed with this frame after reviewing many others both in-person and online. The quality of the screen is very pleasant, the high-res (800x600) compared to other frames, the simple but classy frame itself, and the price made this an easy pick. We bought these for both sets of grandparents and for our own home. Highly recommended. Combine it with some $8 1GB SD cards that can hold over 10,000 pictures at 800x600 and you've got an amazing setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resolution","review":"The most distinctive feature that set this frame apart from others is the LCD Resolution. There are tons of frames avalable but the resolution vs price is still unmatched.

After soaking his back with the wonderful fragrance, I caught up with him when he went into another room, and there was absolutely no lingering apple fragrance!

I already knew that the setup was going to be difficult. When I received it, I found out the insallation was impossible. With the directions they give you, you have to be a computer geek or proficient at dialing customer service. I gave it 10 minutes and I called for help. They were excellent with walking me through the installation. From what the service person walked me through, I knew I would have never been able to figure that out.

Both were needed to connect to my existing wireless router for remote devices. The Linksys product took me 5 minutes, painless, beautiful, wonderful. Then I moved on to this, the Trendnet Wireless Access Point. What a painful setup, and I'm an IT nerd. It was 2 hours of figuring out the right steps necessary to get this compatible with my wireless network. Any mistakes made during the setup process made the Trendnet completely unresponsive, forcing several resets to the factory default.

I needed something to rebroadcast the wifi signal on the second floor of my house because for reasons unknown, the wireless router set up on the first floor was sending a weak signal to the laptop in my bedroom.Luckily its alot more simple than I feared. Follow the manuals instructions to set it up and then go to the disks manual if you want to do something else.I finally have a strong steady signal in my bedroom and all the wifi devices on the second floor of the house are benefiting from the boost.

At first it would work fairly well, and I would see a jump in my wireless strength, with a slight latency, but after a short period of use (~30 minutes) the entire wireless network would melt down and become unusable.I'm actually seriously considering just getting a second internet connection, WDS requires nearly identical hardware/software (that supports WDS)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xbox 360 problems","review":"The reason I purchased this item was to hook up my Xbox 360 to the internet.

If you buy this, read the reviews on here of people who are smarter than the employees of TRENDnet to see how to actually set it up. Now to the review of why I bought it. It did work..... for about 10 minutes. Then it dropped the connection. I reset the access point. It worked for about another 10 minutes and then dropped the connection again.

Cuban is one of the nicest out there with the complete package: lyrics, style, charisma, hunger, versatility, etc. He deserves to be one of hip-hops premier artist. He deserves his shine.

If readers wish to read this type of writing, that is their choice, but if I purchase a book I am responsible for the contents to some degree. I am sorry I did not return it to the source at the time, it still takes up space in my home. If it is still possible to return it for a credit, I would like to do that, and order something more acceptable, as are the Alexander McCall Smith books.

Readers are introduced to Samantha Kincaid, a young prosecutor navigating through the judicial system in search of justice for the teenage victim in a brutal rape case. Ms. Burke, through colorful descriptions, interesting character development, and a tight, riveting plot, takes the reader on a memorable ride from the start to finish of a criminal case from the prosecutor's perspective, a perspective that has not been explored much by other crime/mystery writers. Ms. Burke appears to have a very bright future in this genre and this reviewer is definitely looking forward to future books featuring Samantha Kincaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was one of the worst I have ever read.

In spite of reading voraciously since then, all types of books, when I chanced on this website and started to browse, this was one of the first books I looked up. It is certainly memorable. It has a quality about it that separates it completely from not only any science fiction I've read, but also from other literature. It is a dreamlike quality that makes the story seem very real but just a little \\"off\\" our normal consciousness. Even the names are evocative but of what?

However, I certainly can say that I concurr and recommend highly that everyone read this book. The author is a kind of alchemist, weaving a tale that is compelling, hypnotic, perplexing and enchanting at the same time. I have come to believe that this story is an allegory - of the soul's innate craving for the pure, untainted vision of truth and reality that seems to forever elude it, while the wrapping of the mind and its manifold deceitful mechanisms lead him on to ever-changing phenomena and illusion. You will not remain untouched by this book, if you read it, as one reviewer has aptly stated. A very sad footnote is that author David Lindsay commited suicide at an early age, and thus the world was robbed of a brilliant writer who could cast a spell over his readers and make one truly consider the very nature of what we call \\"reality\\". Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Epic Voyage, Mostly Nonsense","review":"Read on a recommendation, I have no idea what anyone could see in this book. For the most part, the main character is just going from place to place having brief adventures that present obvious moral characteristics. Each little adventure is quickly left behind and forgotten, simply because the main character has a compulsion to head North. Its a poorly strung collection of nearly unrelated events that culminates in, what a bit of reading has clarified for me, is a poor expression of some very ancient and ridiculous religious ideas (gnosticism, as it turns out--if you don't think its fair to call a religious sort of idea ridiculous, read about gnosticism before you get upset). Sure, Lindsay describes some crazy environments, but come on, we all have imaginations, there's nothing too special there either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great suppliment for the C. S.

Not yet finished with the book but a gripping story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sacred text from the 20th century","review":"A Voyage to Arcturus is science fiction in the same sense that the Bhagavad-gita is a war story. .... Hmmmm, well,... you guys have read the Bhagavad-gita, right? The main character is preparing for war, but ends up being enlightened.... perhaps a bad analogy on my part.If you buy Voyage to Arcturus, don't pay $50-60 for a paperback. Get the Savoy hard bound edition at $75??, (something like that) its a wonderful ed. with some nice essays, but there are a few typos (can't anyone put out a book without typos??).you'll need to go to amazon UK to order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every review of value.","review":"Those who read it during their \\"formatory\\" years were left with an indelible imprint, some remembering the characters and scenes decades after reading this book. The same can be said for PK Dick's \\"Ubik\\" and \\"Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\" among others. To review Arcturus in any other way (eg literary) would be like a chemist reviewing an excellent wine from a chemist perspective without ever tasting it. As someone once said \\"there is a difference between knowing and knowing about.\\" Regarding the movie suggestion, maybe Tim Burton could pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Since C.S.

I can see why he liked its imaginative force and creativity and orignality, but I found it practically unreadable, depressing, confusing, and totally unsatifying, and I didn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, terrible edition","review":"This is an excellent book, one I have read many times. Five stars for the story. Never have I read it in such a garbled edition, though. Zero stars to Bison Books. Chapter one (which was as far as I got) contained ten typos, some actually changing the meaning of what was going on (\\"turned and confronted the party\\" becomes \\"turned and _comforted_ the party\\".) If you haven't read Arcturus, you'll just be confused by textual errors in what is already a demanding book. Nice cover, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grand gnostic allegory","review":"This is Lindsay's masterpiece, a visionary work of the religious imagination that reads like a Gnostic \\"Pilgrim's Progress,\\" with the hero, Maskull, progressing through various stages of human belief and error (philosophical, Theosophical, neo-Nietzschean, you name it)in his trek across the world of Tormance. Lindsay's sense of acosmic dualism, Good and Evil fighting for Man's soul, is at times almost Manichaean in its intensity. Harold Bloom's 1979 novel \\"A Flight to Lucifer\\" is a direct lift of Lindsay's earlier work, a sort of pale academic misprision of the luminous original. Read them both and see for yourself the difference between a Surtur and a Shaping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"This review is for the Fruit of the Loom V-neck Tee shirt.Horrible, horrible product.

I am a huge fan of Walter Egan's solo projects and of his work in his surf band The Malibooz. In my opinion, his 1999 solo album \\"Walternative,\\" with its eclectic mix of musical styles, is nothing short of a masterpiece. But this album just lacks any appeal for me. Song titles like \\"Wishful Drinking\\" lead me to believe that this album had potential, but the instrumentation is less than inspiring and the vocals also leave something to be desired.If, like me, you are interested in this album because of a love for the music of Walter Egan, you might want to think twice. My advice for the Egan fan: buy this one only if you are a completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"This band does nothing that hasn't been done before, and better, by many other bands.

You'll find it here in Martin Cruz Smith's intelligent and engrossing story of Tokyo on the eve of Pearl Harbour. Centered by the enigmatic Harry Niles, the story gives the reader insight into what it may have been like to have been raised as an American in Japan prior to the war. Niles character, similar in many ways to Rick Blain in Casablanca, walks a thin and dangerous line in trying to sort out his feelings for a very volatile Japanes woman, the friendships he developed growing up and his loyalty to the US.The novel is extremely well researched and keeps the reader guessing till the end. Well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I have enjoyed all of MCSmith's books. I guess I started with Gorky Park years ago.

I liked it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual!","review":"If there's a bigger Martin Cruz Smith fan around than your's truly I'd like to meet them. I sacrifice budget or food in the house when he has a new release. Maybe that's why I felt so let down when I finished DECEMBER 6TH.Another review nailed it. Casablanca goes to Japan! Thirty or so pages into this the comparison was way obvious. To me there's nothing worse than taking a classic storyline and trying to disguise it as something new.I wanted this to end. I didn't want POLAR STAR, RED SQUARE, or HAVANA BAY to end. ROSE well ... let's leave ROSE alone. It wilted OK?In so many other works by Smith I felt the chill of ice, smelled the cabbage boiling. I could see the colors of Cuba! Here, not only was it already familiar but it was almost a draft instead of a complete work.Bring back Arkady.

Gorky Park, Polar Star and Havana Bay are lush, descriptive and spellbinding. However, December 6 reads as if it were written by someone else entirely!The exposition is thin, the dialog wooden and the characters stereotypical. This is not the Martin Cruz Smith you're used to.

After all that had happened in the book I expected something a little more sad and depressing to happen in the ending, but what ended up happening was not like the rest of the book.

Crooked was merely just okay, with kind of under-developed characters and a rather lame plotline involving milk and kids from the bad side of the tracks. Was there a gun?

A great read in all other respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"The reviews for this book are fantastic and the back of the book makes you want to dive into the book head first. Its reviews state it was written in the perspective of two teenagers who find solace in each other after a series of misfortuante events in their lives. To be frank, this book has absolutely no flow. The characters suddenly go from strangers to friends. The language and dialogue is defintely not how a teenager would sound or feel. The reviews of this book are a misrepresentation. AS well, the writing is definitely 180 degrees away from a real teens POV."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Crooked\\" Has Many Twists","review":"As suspenseful, dark, and dreadfully realistic as Robert Cormier's work, \\"Crooked\\" takes the reader into the lives of two freshmen who are sympathetic characters. Not only are the characters likeable but the themes in the book are universal: negative body images, cowardism and bravery, coping with loss and divorce, beginning adolescent romantic relationships, and cliques. The twists in the plot are also engaging in that there are no clear trouble-free paths connecting the characters with their goals. Just like real life's various journeys during our teen years, \\"Crooked\\" offers no easy ride. The conclusion is well worth your time as well.

I happen to be a licensed massage therapist, so I may be a little hard when it comes to critiquing this book, but the book suggests using OIL to massage your dog! I can't imagine my dogs enjoying that, plus they have plenty of oil on their coats that you shouldn't need that. I would not reccommend this book because you can basically figure out most of these techniques on your own. Take a lot at other books that are published on the subject. It's not worth the money or the money to ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little starter book on messaging your dog","review":"This book isn't meant as an in-depth guide to massaging your dog, but provides humor with some simple techniques. The couple of techniques I've tried on my dogs seem to meet with their approval :-).

However the fabulous unaccompanied \\"Tenderly\\" and the intro to \\"Laura\\" are so gorgeous that you might think that Eric Dolphy has risen from the dead and is in your house playing just for you. They are playful and sinuous and every new invention makes you smile even when he cannot keep his flute from going sharp. The remastering throughout the set is very crisp and lets you hear every musician individually. It is fashionable to knock Prestige but I have a new respect for them now. If they can produce a set like this then I forgive them for out of tune pianos etc and even this rather annoying vertical format box that does not sit with your other CDs.

I was delighted and intrugied at the new way I saw the vampires in this book. I have never seen them mixed into society like it was done here. And YES there was sex in the book and it was to say at most steamy, but not repulsive, AND there is no hero or heroine having to have sex to save the world or increase the powers of others to complete the mission.

This is a kid who doesn't know the word 'conscious' from 'conscience.' I'm in trouble!' It got much, much worse. So nightmarishly badly penned that I would have believed it was conceived and executed by a 12-year old. Now I have to wonder what I DID to Amazon to make them believe I have such low literary standards!? If you buy this book, no matter how much you enjoy vampire novels or works of naivete, believe me, you won't make it past the first chapter, and THAT will be an agony.If it were possible to rate this a 'zero,' I would.

And how it ever got published is a complete mystery. I managed to read only three chapters before giving up in disgust. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and thought I had maybe not given the writer enough of a chance -- although I got the impression that all of the reviews were written by the same person using different names.

I read this book a couple years ago. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. In fact I was only able to get through one chapter. It was clearly self-published because there is no publishing house on earth that would publish something so badly written. It was full of typos and was a grammatic nightmare. When I bought this book, there were some wonderful reviews about it. I must assume that these were all written by the author's families and friends. And the book description was clearly written by the author as well. I think that is a shame. I asked for my money back after buying this book. And I would suggest that others save their money for a book that it worth the time and cash spent. Zero stars in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure the author is a nice guy but...","review":"Unfortunately this book is badly written, excruciatingly so. It has some good ideas but they are laid out as if the author was making a list rather than communicating his ideas to the reader. Maybe a good editor and a couple of rewrites could have fixed it, I don't know. I read a lot of paranormal stuff and I usually finish any book I start, including some pretty mediocre romances and science fiction, but this one...I just couldn't do it.

I was impressed from the beginning to end. For the first time in a long time I felt like I was reading a new story, not a group effort just plain and simple writing for writing's sake. Entertaining, thought provoking and very sensusal without too much smut. I hope there is more from this writer as I am telling everyone I know to get a copy, the sooner the better. I have opened up to this genre more than I ever thought I would, the character interaction in this novel is over the top, I think I am in love with Sarah who would have thought a vimpiress and a witch with so much to offer the mortal men of the world.

Each book looses more plot and increase more sex or something like this. FOr me New Authors bring to life new ideas or keep the plot the center of the story. A friend told me about \\"Memoirs of a Monster\\" so I logged on the web and here we went. I was so happy when the book arrived. Reading about vampires and detectives and lustful love in this manner was unbelievable. I eagerly await the second book. I have also sent my book to the author via his website to have it signed.

J. P. Taylor's book is the sine qua non for university students of European history. This is the real deal: Taylor was a genuine historian who never went further than his facts--and his facts are incredibly well researched, well documented, and bountiful. This is true historiography: the way history ought to be done! Plus, Taylor writes very well, in a lively and entertaining fashion. He has good language, wit, and trenchant observations.It must be noted that this is a history of diplomacy--with some political and military of necessity treated. What does this mean? Well, it means that the characters of Taylor's book are mostly forgotten professional diplomats, and therefore most of their names won't be familiar to those unschooled in modern European history--Bismarck and Disraeli excepted. But this esoterica only increases the value of Taylor's work; for it reveals these forgotten characters to us once again: a gem of historical literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This is A.J.P. Taylor's masterpiece of history. Taylor is an exquisite writer, with a unique style that cannot resist the irony and contradictions inherent in the very fabric of European diplomacy. This sprawling tale of folly and pretension is informed by Taylor's exhaustive reading of the official foreign affairs correspondence of the respective nations involved, as well as his own mastery of modern European history. His prose is consistently edged with wit on the verge of sarcasm, always keen to the absurd roots of tragedy. For Taylor there are no sacred cows: every class, every institution, every political party, even cynicism itself fumbles in the dark, toiling under the weight of its illusions and contradictions. One does not emerge from this book with an enhanced respect for statesmen, generals or revolutionaries. This is one of the few history books I plan on reading at least twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistaken identity leads to romance between prof and mechanic","review":"Salier's first romance effort falls far short of the standard in the industry.

This is a must read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Beach- a disturbing prediction","review":"As a child of the 50s and 60s, I found the book very credible.The most powerful thing in this novel is its immediacy to our own lives.We exist in an age when nuclear warfare is an immediate possibility.I was touched by the captain's insistence on thinking of his family in the present tense, and refusal of the woman, Moira's advances, in deference to his obviously married state (despite his awareness of the reality, the captain continues to think of them as he left them).As a person who, as a child in the 60s, learned to jump under my desk in school, during air-raid drills, I was profoundly affected by this story.Furthermore, I was very moved by this author's vision of how people might hold on to hope, at the same time that they accept, on various levels, the inevitability of destruction.I have read thousands of books in my lifetime, most of which I recall only slightly. I will never forget this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think this book just doesn't stand the test of time. It is such a praised classic that I had to buy/read it.

No matter how sad, I never cry over movies and books, but in order to finish this book I had to lock myself in the bathroom; I've never cried so much in my life. I finished it yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. Regardless of whether or not it was scientifically accurate, it drove home the futility of nations building up nuclear arms against each other. Shute's characters have dignity to the end - and his mention of how newspapers would rather have stories of (I'm paraphrasing) \\"pin up girls and indecent assaults\\" than stories like this was amazingly prescient and ahead of its time. This book broke my heart. Read it, read it, read it -but have a very large box of tissues at your side at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written and a Little Sad","review":"I enjoyed this book although it was sad. Mankind's swansong if you will. The characters are well written and engaging. I would recommend \\"Alas Babylon\\" to go with this.

Itwas atmospheric and scary. I figured that such a good movie must come from agood book.

If you're looking for a morbid, anti-climatic story with little plot and way too much superficial description, this is a book for you.On the Beach was written during the cold war, when the specter of a nuclear apocalypse was ever present. The book takes the \\"we're all gonna die\\" mantra to heart. Reading it during the times would have surely resonated, and this is the only real value of the book. It gives a peek into the morbid obsession with nuclear armegeddon.The book flatlines about 1/4th of the way through, and you spend the rest reading about the characters planting gardens, buying items, and other trivial boring crap. You keep expecting something to happen... but nothing does.If you want to read a good post-apocalyptic book from the era, I recommend Day of the Triffids or Alas, Babylon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and profound at 50+ years!","review":"I've found it's dicey business to revisit books I've loved some decades later.

It is supposedly a classic, but many of the members of my class agree with me that it does not deserve its award winning title. First of all the characters in the book have very odd relationships, not resembling those of real people. Secondly, human nature is to protect oneself and its offspring. All the characters in the novel are taking their death as it comes, but if they were smart they could build underground shelters, stay there for 5-10 years and then return to the surface when the radiation has lessened. All in all it was a bit of a dissapointment, however the movie is very well done and I would recommend that first and foremost before the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"again","review":"i read it about 30 years ago and found it fasinating so i bought it , a Kindle version, again because i lent the paperback to somebody who never returned it and now to revive the spell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 'on the beach?'","review":"The book, and the movie made from it, is one of my all time favorites. It's so compelling, that you'll probably miss the one line that explains the title. Nevil Shutes anti-war classic shows us how silly we are, running after all kinds of 'things' when, in the end, what we really survive on is each others love. The premise of the book(which I won't spoil by telling you, since he eases you into it indirectly)strips away all the clutter of life in one fell swoop, and shows with crystal clarity that beautiful and simple kindness 's we show to each other are the stuff that make the world go round.

Not your average end-of-the-world book!","review":"What I liked so much about this book was that it is not about saving the earth, by blowing up a comet or defeating aliens, but rather about the hopeless struggle to just hold on, and about the human reactions to this grim situation. Very stunning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a sad ending for the human race and the animal kingdom.","review":"I have never been taken to a lower state of emotion by a book. Shute does a great job of character creation. I empathized with every one. I can understand how people in such a situation would create fantasies to deal with their inevitable demise. I would like to recommend this book to the leaders of the world who have a nuclear program. Maybe they will feel the pain of the characters in this book and change course. Probably not. This book has been available for forty years, and it hasn't worked yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine","review":"This is a fascinating book, and Shute is particularly successful in building tension as the inevitable comes closer and closer -- i.e., the death of mankind. One proviso: I have far less faith in human nature than Shute does. Is it likely that people, knowing that their death is inevitable and near, will behave with the good sense and civility Shute depicts? I can't help but think that many would give way to complete excess, degeneracy and violence. It's ironic that Shute thinks man is capable of launching a nuclear holocaust, but will then behave with the utmost decorum when rules no longer apply and when all bets are off."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 25 years, this book is still in my mind","review":"While looking for new books on this website, I came upon the reviews of \\"On the Beach,\\" which I first read 25 years ago. It amazed me to find several negative reviews as I found it one of the most compelling and memorable novels I've ever read. In the late 70s, I casually picked up the book while visiting my aunt. With no review or introduction in mind, I started reading. The book begins in such a normal fashion with no hint of the coming apocalypse. When I realized what was happening, I was stunned -- almost sick to my stomach. I'm still amazed that Neville Shute also wrote \\"A Town Like Alice,\\" which is equally compelling, yet totally different."},{"rating":"1","title":"great topic - narrow treatment","review":"How would you react to the inevitable destruction of all life by a slowly encroaching radioactive cloud?

Hundreds of unrelated and disconnected characters too.. Some as ridiculous as a talking dog, and a robot duck... One could read this book from front to back, back to front, or from the middle both ways and not be able to tell the difference.. Thomas Pynchon surely must have been smoking something more powerful than plain tobacco when he wrote this debacle...

Well, lacking something to read, I found this book in a very small second-hand shop in downtown Helsinki. Here are my remarks so far:For a non-native speaker (I am Dutch) the English Pynchon employs, although seemingly authentic, is rather difficult. But once you're in the style, it's ok. And I have read weirder English anyway (Canterbury Tales in 'Old English' and Finnegan's Wake - some pages at least).I like the tale, and I like all those bizarre anecdotes, that, like rumours or crazy stories, hang around for a while and are then forgotten..And, although it is fiction, this book, I like it's historical plot with seemingly authentic behaviour of 18th century Englishmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Everyone should attempt this book-hint stick with it for 150 pages before deciding if you like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pynchon reconfirms his reputation.","review":"Mason & Dixon is alternately comic and cryptic, ribald andmelancholick, zany and ponderous, a book that flows like the river ofHeraclitus which modern reason strains to contain. It was Heraclitus who argued that opposites are one in reality; Pynchon's fiction seeks out the 'excluded middle', those zones of ambiguity which our world flattens out and levels down into blank facticity. Mason & Dixon bursts with energy, wit, fecundity of imagination and linguistic mastery. It may lack the despair and anger of Pynchon's masterpiece, Gravity's Rainbow, yet there is a warmth and tenderness, a genuine lyricism to this book. Mason & Dixon reconfirms Thomas Pynchon's status as one of the great novelists of our age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned and well-intentioned, but lacking greatness","review":"As a fan of Pynchon's previous^M books such as GRAVITY'sRAINBOW, I was disappointed in this book. I saw no need for thearchaistic language, with the capitalization of every noun--why strive for this sort of \\"accuracy\\" when on the other hand you have such obviously parodic, postmodern devices such as the narrator being called Wicks Cherrycoke and George Washington speaking in Yiddish? There is an inconsistency here which suggests that Pynchon, once so footlose in the Sixties and Seventies, has become dutiful and academic, wanting to do the \\"rifght thing.\\" Pynchon's speculations about surveying and the relationship between \\" the Line\\" and Enlgihtenment scientific mastery are interesting, but more in a \\"learned\\" way than in a way that would appeal to your typical reader of fiction. Pynchon is as good a writer as any alive today, but this book, though obviously well-researched and admirably serious, lacks greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me be the dissenting voice","review":"I've never read Pynchon before, and after wading through this monstrosity, I don't plan on reading him again any time soon. I absolutely despise this attempt at an 18th century novel. The language, spellings, and vocabulary are fairly true to time, but as any author who attempts to write a book in the style of another era is often just off the mark, so is Pynchon. It reads as pretentious rather than authentic. What could be a great tale is completely convoluted with talking dogs and other anachronistic happenings. I know Pynchon fans everywhere will want to lynch me, but if you are not a Pynchon fan, don't bother reading this. It's too long. Even if you are a fan of 18th c novels, as I am, you will probably find it difficult to get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too exhausting to get to America, even","review":"I read about 200 pages of aimless text (written in archaic 18th Century style), and then gave up.

It's a lot easier the second time around (although that's not saying very much, I guess). More importantly, with a clearer understanding of what (I think) he was trying to do, the book was both more understandable and more enjoyable. Still, I wonder at times if he isn't just being difficult for the sake of being difficult.But then, why SHOULD things always be easy?Anyway, the essay on \\"Mason & Dixon\\" in the New York Review of Books really helped me to clarify my thoughts about the novel.

The old English style takes a little while to get used to, but after 75 or 100 pages you realize that you wouldn't want it any other way. It is funny, and clever, and it has a real heart. I enjoyed Gravity's Rainbow and The Crying of Lot 49, but this was the first time I felt emotionally touched by a Pynchon novel. The friendship that slowly develops between the two main characters is a beautiful thing.Perhaps the best compliment I can pay is that, upon reading the last line, I very nearly flipped back to page one and started over again.Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion the best novel of the 90's","review":"I found this to be Pynchon's most entertaining novel, as well as the most accessible. Though it may take readers a couple pages to get used to the narrative style, it soon becomes very smooth. What really amazes is that despite the historical setting everything here seems so modern. Its hows that people are much the same despite the era in which they live.

So I feel quite out of place saying that I think Gravity's Rainbow is one of the most important books of the century and that Mason and Dixon is an excruitingly boring, sloppy, overblown, piece of unedited nonsense. Pynchon is a literary icon to me, but nobody should pretend that this book is as important or even as entertaining as his other works.

Pynchon devotees may love this but except for being able to say I've read most everything of his in print, I'm hard pressed to say more than: he can still craft long, grammatically-correct sentences and shows a real depth in writing.If you can make it to the New World, it gets easier but better reads are out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailing to Philadelphia","review":"I was inspired to read this book by a Mark Knofler song, Sailing to Philadelphia.

Normally accustomed to reading a book in a day or two, I have been savoring Mason and Dixon for several months, reading a short passage, thinking about it, rereading it and moving on. It is a book unlike any I have ever read. To review it is impossible. The reading of it is a unique literary experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult For the Sake Of Difficulty","review":"Okay, theres a point when an effort to create impressive prose and style actually becomes an obsticle to the story. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with having a richness of text, but fiction is about storytelling, and Pynchon gives of an air of \\"Look mom, I'm a writer!\\". He needs to spend more time telling a story and less time into trying to be James Joyce. If I want Joyce, I'll read Joyce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been better","review":"While there was some good information in this book, I was hoping for more behind-the-scenes info.

I have driven Porsches and ,although you can let off the gas at the wrong point in a turn and put it backwards through a hedge, they are the best handling cars ever made. And that balogna that you have to know how to drive them is so wrong. The 911 is the one car made that you can pretty much put you foot down and hang on.

Because you will find that in the process of trying to make the game have higher, Electronic Arts made it so you could not play two player mode on one computer.For me Electronic arts makes the best games, and if you like simulation games, you should check out other Electronic Arts games, including the sims series and The NFS series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"dude..this game rocks! I've played lots of racing games and this one is by far the best. The evolution mode starts you out in 1950 with just enough money for your first car and you slowly move up through the years until 2001. The test driver mode was way cool and challenging. The grapics are awesome though sometimes there was a glitch or two that the game quickly corrected. This game was so cool! You can buy and install hi-po parts for your porsche or keep it stock.

And I have a brand new 950MHz NVida HP, so I know it's not my pc's problem. But even if it didn't lock up, I don't think it's as good as NFS III. The tracks aren't as challenging, and the other race cars don't challenge you as well. The Porshe cars are cool, and the graphics good, but the fact that it locks up my pc and I have to reboot every ten minutes is rediculous.

Characterization is very good, and plots well thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a good book.","review":"The author had a good plot and enough basic knowledge of sailing ships to write a decent book. Unfortunately, he apparently lacked a strong editor to send the book back for a second draft. The vapid dialog needed re-writing and his characters could use a little more depth. In addition, there were several places in the book that read like a paragraph or more was accidently left out. For example, Kilburnie is suddently a captain, but the book doesn't tell us how he found out about his promotion. Finally, Mack's description of how the British Navy operated (for example, how Captains were assigned to ships) is very different from how every other author I've read has descripted it. Overall, there are many better choices to choose from if you want to read about 18th & early 19th Century sailing ships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the same league as O'brien, Kent, Lambdin or Pope.","review":"A very thinly fleshed out novel, with a bare minimum of the details needed to make it a novel worth reading. Mack's attempt to cover a period of Kilburnie career from before the mast to Post Captain didn't allow room to develope the book properly, making the book read more as a synopsis or outline instead of a stand a lone novel. Mack needs to do much more research about the Royal Navy of that period. His ending was a prime example of the lack of a serious attempt to write a seafaring novel worthy of O'brien and his peers. Capt. Kilburnie has his command sunk and he merrily goes to Scotland with no effort to get to the Admiralty or stand trial for the lost of his ship, which was standing proceedure for the time if all the other top authors of the gernre are to be believed. I suggest that Adm. Mack stick to novels of the 20th century Navy, with which he is more aquainted, also a new publicist couldn't hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book a cleverly disguised spoof?","review":"I have a collection of hundreds of tall ship volumes, and have read all the greats, but this one stands alone.

However, there is still a problem that the true audiophile will immediately notice - the sound is still not quite perfect. The reason turns out to be the atmosphere, it's just too full of dust, pollen and a mixture of gases that takes the edge off the divine sound these cables are capable of producing.A few grand spent on advanced air filtration systems for your music room or home theatre will make all the difference, but to enable these fantastic cables to really do their job you need to replace the sound-degrading gases in the atmosphere as well. Carbon dioxide has to go for a start, then if you're really hard-core you'll dump the oxygen as well - one atmosphere of pure nitrogen enables these babies to truly bring you the music of the spheres, you'll think you've died and gone to heaven.

While not written as such, the first few chapters indeed present themselves quite excitingly. One can tell that the early and Byzantine church was a period of which the author is very proud.However, when relating the history of the church in the early 20th century, the author tends to become a bit confusing, which is somewhat understandable considering the times in which the book was written.Most of the text is still relevant, but as the Iron Curtain fell, the position of the church in former Soviet republics changed. For historians of Eastern Europe during the Cold War Era, this presents a captivating viewpoint of a theologian struggling to advocate for a faith tradition that is long, proud, and storied, but for general readers this section may indeed be useless, because much of that information is now anachronistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Orthodox Church","review":"Timothy Ware has written an excellent but brief history of the development of the Eastern Orthodox Church from the Apostolic period of Christianity to the present state.

The first few chapters are strong, and I felt like it was really going somewhere. But the irksome, constant worshipping of the Macintosh desktop as the paragon of machine beauty really gets on ones nerves.The designs for computer enclosures are somewhat interesting, but they have a very distinct back-of-the-napkin quality to them. They are neither well-thought-out nor particularly well illustrated in the book itself.I am currently reading Interface Culture (Steven Johnson) and more thought has gone into each chapter of that book than all of Machine Beauty combined.If you're looking for a brief and slanted history lesson on the microcomputer revolution, ending in 1984 when the Mac made its debut, then this book is a easy read, but there are much better books out there if you're looking for thought provoking material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"This book was horrible. It's a real shame too, because David Gelernter is a fairly competent writer. He has a good idea, but I think his publisher dropped the ball here.Gelernter is talking about elegance in computing. He starts out by discussing old radios, and telephones, and even cars. In the first couple of chapters Gelernter does a wonderful job of stating his point, and starts providing very good arguments in favor.Somewhere towards the end of the first section of the book, Gelernter start with the Apple vs. Microsoft debate. He shows that he is a Mac fan, and spends much of the rest of the whining about the fact that Microsoft seems to have won. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gelernter is a genius.","review":"David Gelernter is a professor at Yale, and I took one of his courses.

The timing, design and effects are all marvelous and flawless. Occassionaly there are some cliche anime shots in order to save on animation, but they always give you some stunning artwork to dwell on while the stories progress. Each episode has a slightly different theme as you follow two young women who become traffic cops in modern Tokyo, live their lives and pursue their loves and desires.

I was not thrilled with the ending as it was left open (which I am sure is a prompt for the next installment in the series) but there is no concrete conclusion outside of the death of a rival and a revelation to lead us into the next game if/when it is developed.

The parts that have jumped out at me - The Elmo Hope session on Disc 1. The 17-minute version of Mal Waldron's \\"Soul Eyes\\" with one-of-a-kind late night atmosphere. Some of the other Waldron sessions with their sense of space and vibe. Some of the slick playing with Red Garland, Paul Chambers and other musicians on the later discs.If you don't have that much money - you might want to hold off. I mean, lots of this music is far from indispensible. I believe John developed into something more special than what he is on these recordings, subsequently, and I would recommend those subsequent recordings first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big bang for buck","review":"I like the novel because of the style it was written. If you are gay, black, and know how to read this is the best buy. It has sex, friedships, advice, and historical references that relate to being gay and black. And so much more about how to work on you, yes you, and your lifestyle choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the sequel","review":"I loved the book. It had a nice flavor to it that was different from the first book. I liked the flashbacks. It made me really get to know Raheim. He was the person that I really wanted to know about, probably because I can relate to him more. I just wonder if Raheim is ever going to come out in the future sequel/s. Mitchell's cool too. I miss his friends and philosophies. I guess I'll be expecting that in the next..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric Sequel","review":"Hardy's second book in the Raheim River's story is a watered down drink compared to the earlier ambrosia of B-Boy Blues. This book, similar to E. Lynn Harris's second novel, is told through two voices--Raheim and Mtichell's. Hardy's split of storytellers destroys the book's flow. What is worst is that Raheim's dialogue is unconvincing. Instead of sounding like a rough street man, his thoughts read exactly like Mitchell's-- only with slang. Unfortunately, this book does not have the same sexy presence of the highly erotic previous novel. Some people argued that B-Boy Blues was too sexy, almost pornographic, and it appears that Hardy didn't want readers to similarly crticize this novel. 2nd Time Around lacks eroticism and tastyness--flavor. Hardy needs to rethink where he wants Raheim and Mitchell to go, and then seriously decide the best method to tell their story."},{"rating":"2","title":"love story with real people working on real problems","review":"It is good to read a book that so honestly deals with love between men (who make love, rather than have sex).

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Time Around Isn't Always The Best Time","review":"I was filled with excitment as I opened the pages to 2nd Time Around. This excitement soon turned into boredom. Mr. Hardy did not live up to the expectations of the fans that he won with B Boy Blues.2nd Time Around was the wrost book that I have read in years. There were several times when I wasn't sure what was happening. This was becasue the book lacked a plot or a story line. The relationship between all the characters was so unrealistic that I almost regurgitated. Little Brother Man's brithday party was the most unrealistic.2nd Time Around also adds to the discrimination of effeminate Black men by constantly making derogatory comments about them.Mr. Hardy should have given this book away on some street cornor in Compton where I'm sure no one would have read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tractor and Guido break easily","review":"This is not made for kids.

As mentioned, there is a great deal of room for improvement in the script.. and also in some of the performances. But the most disappointing to me was the very uneven translation, full of errors in basic sentence structure, literal and awkward, and with several highly objectionable slurs. For awhile, I wondered if the translation was trying to be authentic to UK English, or to a character, but ultimately it's just a poor, distracting translation-- so bad, I really wished I could return this series!

Little did I know that some of the issues that I HAD with creating my work was related to my ability to see. These handy, lightweight Poros prism binoculars do a great job indoors and out, letting me successfully see things that are a little further away...and translate that information into details that I would have otherwise missed. I'm generally using these glasses to see things that are placed between 6 feet and 15 feet away. I already wear bifocals and have some other visual issues, so the fact that this pair has a diopter adjustment sealed the deal for me. The only potential down side is that they seem to flatten the field of view, but for translating a 3-dimensional object into a 2-dimensional painting, this flattening might even be considered a positive feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophomore Jinx","review":"Sweden's Power Metal phenoms have released a very solid follow-up to their auspicious debut album, with their second studio release simply entitled, \\"Danger\\". With \\"Danger\\", Supreme Majesty has managed to build upon the success of Tales of a Tragic Kingdom, one of the best Melodic Power Metal band debuts I have had the pleasure to hear.\\"Danger\\" features nine tracks totaling around forty-three minutes. Two of the songs, \\"Until the End of Time\\" & \\"By Your Side\\", are ballads with the remaining numbers being medium to high speed melodic metal, somewhat reminiscent of the hair metal of the eighties. The band's sound is augmented with some strings and two wonderful ladies with backing vocals.If you like any of the Epic Power Metal stalwarts such as Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, Rhapsody or Helloween, this should be right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Purchased one of these American Qosmio's, and imported it to New Zealand. The Qosmio lasted just one month longer than its one year international warranty and then the motherboard died. I have always liked Toshiba but after wasting so much money on one I will never get another.Pro's- Very nice looking machine loaded with features, nice sound (for a laptop), and very clear and bright screen.Cons- noisy fan, runs hot which probably contributed to the short lifespan .Power supply also gets very hot.Toshiba mobile services NZ wanted to charge me $1500.00 for a replacement motherboard and provide just a three month warranty on the repair. Toshiba eventually repaired the laptop free of charge, but by this time I had replaced it with another laptop (not as flashy but hopefully much more reliable). As much as I loved the Toshiba following the \\"system enhancement\\", I decided to sell it on because of my negative experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuff of legends","review":"I have read numerous book about the Arthurian legend, but my interest has always been Guenevere. She is not always present in the most flattering light by authors, and sometimes she is only a brief mention. This book, however, is extremely well written. It presents the rise and fall of Camelot through Guenevere's perspective, and it also is very careful about presenting both sides of her story. It clearly establishes a platonic love between her and Arthur, and the eternal struggle that she faces with as her forbidden love for Lancelot grows. It also presents the deep friendship and comradery of the Round Table, as well as the anguish of her childless-ness. In this version of the story, Lancelot and her raise Galahad as their own son, even though Elaine is the real mother.This is the final chapter of three books by the author, but the first one is unfortunately out of print. This was an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy this book","review":"This book is horribly written, little plot, horrible character development. Similar to a romance novel.

If the movie had ended after the first half hour, I would have given it at least four stars just because of him. But the rabid, mean-spirited homophobia that drives this movie (and I assume the Fassbinder play it was based on) to its thoroughly depressing and depraved conclusion just becomes unbearable. Technically it's very well made, and I'm grateful for discovering Zidi, but I wish I'd never watched this depressing, hateful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those with eclectic tastes... a great art house film","review":"Capsule review:An entertainingly dark sexual farce about the antics of a cranky businessman and his 19 year-old male lover when the boy's ex-girlfriend tries to rekindle the flame.

One thing I was a little disappointed in was the fact that you can not have a lot of outgoing mail. The little clip inside is not big enough to hold very much mail at one time. It needs to have another clip inside. We use it at a business and we have a lot of mail going out at one time. I have had to split up my mailing so it will all fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Break-In","review":"I bought three of these boxes for our neighborhood about two years ago. Two have since been replaced with more secure boxes. The last remaining is about to go after being broken into for the third time.The box was a cost effective choice and I would like it but for the fact that it is NOT secure. A simple screw driver can pry it open.Once the thieves figure this out, they appear to just bring the \\"key\\" on their \\"mail route\\". The two other replacement boxes, two different brands, were untouched.Since the point of these boxes is security, I cannot recomend someone get this box. It can prevent someone from just walking past and taking your mail on a whim.

It has a locked storage compartment, so you can go away for a week and not have to stop the mail. It appears well made with heavy gauge steel (and the mail stays dry when its raining outside).Because its rectangular, you want to make sure the post is plumb while it sets in concrete. You could always shim the mailbox with washers to trim it later if need be.Only issue is that it takes a bit of wiggling to get the key into the lock (the key hole weather shield sticks a little).Overall we are very satisfied with this mailbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mail Stolen From This Box","review":"My mail was just stolen from this box. Theives popped it open like a top. There is a design flaw that allows for easy access with a screwdriver at minimum to bust the door off. My neighbors both have different syle boxes than mine and their mail boxes were uncompromised. If you care about criminals accessing the contents of your mailbox do not buy this box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"The mailbox construction is top quality, no surprises. The instructions provided were also accurate. One issue is that my postman turns large envelopes (9\\" x 13\\") and the weekly free ads such that they don't fall into the drop area below. They're sitting in the top deposit door, so I always check in the locked drop area below AND pull the top door down, and find items in both locations. It makes me worry a little about going away for a few days - is it all going to be stuffed in the top hopper? One of the reasons that I purchased this mailbox was so that I wouldn't have to put my mail on hold anymore when I go away. On the other hand, the normal-sized envelopes seem to fall below. The bigger items, which have a higher probability of being junk mail, are the ones that don't drop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as secure as you might think","review":"I went to our local hardware store to look at the Oasis. The clerk in the store was explaining how it worked to another customer and I was looking on.

Needless to say neither I or the other customer bought this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good design and sturdily built","review":"When we decide to replace our mailbox, we went through the neighboring blocks and went on-line to see what's available.

I would have liked a lot more pages of Lance & Asia who didn't really get to work on their relationship until the last 80+ pages of the 291 page book and again the subplots take away some of those pages also. The only other reason is there are a few editing errors (a pet peeve of mine.) In spite of these things, the book is still great.By no means do I regret purchasing this book, in fact I strongly recommend it.

If you can't get a good satellite signal, there is no regular radio either. And getting a good satellite signal indoors can be difficult.

I just finished seeing it for the first time recently, and I can say hands down that this was far and away the worst movie that Steven Seagal has ever made. Although I am not a prude, the language was disgusting with Mother F***** this and Mother F****** that every 10 seconds. The plot went nowhere and it was filled with unnecessary violence.

Everything is substantiated in the Bible and is written in Jesus Christ's time line explaining everything from all the testaments. He brings His life alive and so much meaning, I feel like this book has brought me closer to knowing Jesus more than all the previous books I have read together! It is great if you already know the Bible, so you see how it Jesus fulfills the prophecies. If you haven't read much of the bible you will want to look up verses Sheen points out. I have loaned my book to many, everyone absolutely loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of Christ by Fulton Sheen","review":"This is a thoroughly concise writing on the life of our Savior.

Bishop Sheen (born 1895) brings reason to the Roman Catholic perspective from Jesus' physical body to the Mystical Body of Christ - from incarnation through transfiguration to ascension.The first publication of this book was 1958, and it has been enduring critical acclaim.

Not because it was boring, far from it, rather because the chapters were so chock full of wisdom and insight that I could only handle small portions. This is truly a rich and nourishing read.Fulton Sheen doesn't add anything to the story of the Life of Christ, rather he unpacks what is already there. He sheds light on the symbolism of actions, words, and objects found throughout the Gospels. This coupled with Sheen's writing style really connect the reader with the events of the gospels and bring them to life.I don't recommend this as a book for a plane ride, rather as a book which you have the time to slowly digest and ponder over. It's a wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Inspirational","review":"Fulton Sheen's Life of Christ is a very informative and inspirational biography of Jesus Christ. Sheen seamlessly weaves together the events from the four Gospels, always emphasizing Christ's mission to suffer and die for our sins, and showing how the cross casts a shadow backwards over all the events of Christ's life. Sheen does get a bit long-winded at times, and has a tendency to repeat the same ideas again and again, but still the excellent content makes this book well worth reading. I would highly recommend this book for all Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Shoe!","review":"My 2&1/2 year old daughter has a really wide foot.

As you are struggling with camera viewpoints and group commands and battle formations the AI is charging you. Obviously the AI has not to struggle as much as you do. The battle tactics of the AI are very good, so you are slashed and diced into sushi before you know it. The soldiers are blurry and all have the same color. The devolpers should have looked at the classic Total Annihilation before they made Total War. One star for the AI and battle ground graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Realistic!","review":"I really enjoy this game a lot. I got it today and I have been playing it non stop. Why give it 4 stars instead of 5 then? Well, the game is pretty confusing and it is very hard to keep your men doing what you ordered them to do. For instance my army of 120 archers somehow got up and walked into the enemies musket shooter men. I was wiped out and lost. Don't let this get you down. It really is a fun, realistic, and challenging game. It's well worth [the money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for us strategy gamers","review":"This game is basically a combination of Myth and Age of Empires series. The graphics are quite impressive, and the characters movements are sharpe and fluent. The strategy is a little different to that of the games i just mentioned, because you have such a large amount of troops to control at one time, which to me is what makes this game so much fun.

Electronic Arts (manufacterer of shogun) neglects the problem and refuses to patch their game to work with Nvidia drivers. The game also does not work on Windows Millenium computers.

When your archers fire, you see the arrows, you see them nock a new arrow, and you see them draw the bowstring back. And when you put your gunners in ranks of three, they fire in rotation. Marching troops actually march, they don't just glide across the screen. The variety and fluid motion of the camera angles accentuates astounding vistas that the armies fight on. The strategy portion of the game is not overly complicated allowing for a bit of a break after a hectic battle. My only real complaint is that the manual was not well written. It'll tell you how to move the camera and the basic commands, but you need to pick up the strategy guide to figure out how to really play the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!

I also take exception to the anti-gay sentiments revealed throughout the book. The writer reveals his true chauvinistic and homo-phobic tendencies with ungentleman like descriptions of women and gays. Reading pornography when I am looking for classic writing about a bygone era is like going to a boxing match and a hockey game breaks out, completely unnecessary. Sorry Dewey, but this one fell far short. I could not even complete the novel it was so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harold Robbins meets C.S. Forester","review":"If you like nautical fiction of the great age of sail (e.g. Forester, O'Brian, Woodman, Marryat), you will enjoy this opening volume of the action-packed, fast moving and realistic adventures of our tarnished hero, Alan Lewrie. While on water, this book is as good as any of the above writers, excepting of course the incomparable O'Brian. However, our author founders on land with trashy sex scenes more appropriate to a Harld Robbins potboiler. The author trying to model his protagonist on Fraser's Flashman, or Fielding's Tom Jones comes badly ascupper. These humorless sex scenes are perhaps why this nautical series is not as popular as many others. However, once back on the high seas, this book recaptures its pace and becomes highly exciting and enjoyable. One day, however, I hope to open a book with a handsome, brave, cunning and feisty hero in possession of a small penis. It will, however, not be written by the otherwise entertaining Mr. Lambdin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Fine Georgian-Era Sea Stories!","review":"I read this book, the first in the series, and didn't find it greatly attractive. But it was good enough to make me read the *second* book in the series, and, from there on in, they just keep getting better. This is, in my opinion, the weakest book in the entire series. So...bear up, give it a chance, and keep going. You may find your persistence rewarded.The research is excellent. The nautical details are first rate.The sex scenes are unnecessarily lurid. I could really do without all the sex and cussing.But...these are sailors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nautical porn??","review":"I have to agree with the comments of the other reviewers of this book but would also like to forewarn first readers that Lambdin has a fascination with ultra explicit sex scenes, and he embeds them liberally throughout his books. This no doubt makes the books more attractive to those who love modern literature but it is likely to be a bit disturbing to those, such as myself, who are more interested in nautical adventures than dime novel discriptions of sexual conquest. This hasn't stopped me from reading and enjoying his books but, as I now start on the fourth book in the series, I'm finding myself skimming through the sex scenes to get onto the real nautical stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy writing and editing. Readable stories.","review":"This guy is not even close to being in a league with O'Brian. His characters are inconsistent and obvious, thin cliches. He makes his hero smart about whatever he has to be smart about at the time, with no relation to his education or background. The writing is sloppy. Every time a leadsman calls the depth, he \\"mournfully intones.\\" The sex is overdone and over written. The author's basic attitude is adolescent. The ship handling and battle scenes are good enough to make the books worth a casual read. I'd call him 3rd rate, but that would mean he had 50 guns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seafaring adventure","review":"Comparisons to Forester's Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O'Brian are understandable because of the subject matter. Dewey Lambdin's Alan Lewrie has more in common with George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman than the earnest Hornblower. Flashman, an officer in the army, shirks dangerous duty at every turn. Lewrie is a cad and forced into the the king's navy. Like Flashman, he craves a life of comfort and sport. Although Flashman is an unwilling participant in the historical events of his day, his observations are always astute and on target. Similarly, Lewrie is a quick study and a natural seaman who often sees strategic moves that his captains miss.Interesting to read a historical novel from the British point of view as this book takes place during the American Revolution. Lewrie's ship is focused on taking prizes that are supplying the American war effort and his ship engages in a fierce battle against the new colonial navy at one point.This was fun. I want to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good yarn but I could do without the pornography","review":"This first installment Alan lewrie gets pressed into service. The story is interesting and deals mostly with Lewries difficulties adjusting to his new life as a midshipman in His Majesty's Navy. There are only a couple of battles in this book but it is still an exciting read. The one thing that I don't like is the VERY graphic descriptions of Lewries sexual exploits. It would be good enough to just let you know he bedded certain women. Those parts of the book are unneccessary. I am reading a naval adventure, not looking for pornography."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King's Coat","review":"This is the first book in the series and is well enough written to entice you to read the others"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I liked this book, very good on naval tactics and facts.

But when translated, most English editions split the behemoth Ten Years Later into a Trilogy (and some four - which make it all the more confusing!).So the reading list should be 1. The Three Musketeers 2. Twenty Years After and 3a. The Vicomte de Bragelonne 3b. Louise de la Valliere and 3c. The Man in the Iron Mask.

The story is much more interesting and although the in game movies suck it dosen't matter because most of the plot twists are in-game anyways. Special units have been created just for one part in the story, such as a huge robot, which is a nice touch.Although the music is being sold as faster paced and more like Red Alert it's pretty much more of the same. Graphics also don't change too much.The new units are pretty cool but the Reaper is the only one that I really liked, unfortunatly you can only use it in Multiplayer. The new Juggernaut artilery unit is alright but it can't really aim that well and the Nod Art. unit is still superior in my mind.All in all Firestorm makes Tiberian Sun a much better game and if you already have TS then by all means buy Firestorm."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for all","review":"I bought this CD for You're a Lady-a wonderful song that always pleased and haunted me.

ALSOS was the code name of the scientific mission that Goudsmit led to see how far the Nazi scientists had gotten on the atom bomb (without tipping our hand on how far the Americans had gotten!) Goudsmit was able to sift through German scientists because he knew personally every physicist in Germany capable of making an atom bomb.By the way, the subtitle (History of Modern Physics and Astronomy, Vol 1) is erronious, the book is the same ALSOS I read in the 50's and has no such subtitle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tiny Bit Disappointing","review":"Supposedly about the scientific intelligence teams that wandered through post-war (just) Germany trying to locate the Reich's scientific secrets...When I first ordered this book, I assumed that it would be an exciting blend of adventure and science.

Several times your squadmates and enemy will be standing a couple of feet apart and nothing happens... they just shoot at each other. Only positive is enemy AI does improve a little in the last stages of the game. Another bad point is the load time between missions/levels. It was so nice for the programmers to think we need a POTTY BREAK upon completion of each mission. Only good thing about this game is the surround sound!! Playing on a 5.1 surround system, you'll swear the enemy is setting up an ambush behind your easy chair. Note: I had to return my copy of this game due to sound cutting in/out.

If you use the mouse continually, this isn't a problem. The receiver plugs into an available USB port and has a light on it when it is receiving valid signals, which is handy. Unfortunately, on my desk machine, the USB ports are in the back which means I can't see the receiver during normal operation. I put a USB extension cable between the port and the receiver and clipped the receiver to the edge of my bookshelf which solved this problem. If you have a front USB port, then you are all set.

It is better then High Heat baseball by a lot, as Heat is simply boring. The online play in TP2k1 makes the game worth getting. Even with a 56k modem it is still easy and fun to play online. This game captures the feeling of the majors better than any other game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Game, but not 5 Stars","review":"This game has very good graphics, but seem to be tooanimated. Microsoft Baseball 2001 has it all over this game in termsof realism. However, this game is quite entertaining and addictive. Home run tournaments with Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire are fun..

Rock is about freedom! About noncomformity! Its not about some total a--hole screaming obscenities at 10 YEAR OLDS because he's disillusioned that his dreams of rock stardom never came to fruition. The Jack Black character was funny. This real-life rock warden is not.It bums me out that \\"rock schools\\" and \\"rock camps\\" are popping up everywhere. Even worse was a magazine article I read about a rock school for girls, which basically tells young girls that if they want to rock, they need to enter an all-girl school and join smarmy all-girl bands instead of simply working with likeminded musicians of either gender.Kids, if you want to rock, ask the folks for some classic cd's, pick up a guitar or a bass or get behind a drum kit. Do it yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"Gunaratna appears unwilling to engage with the causes of the Tamil insurgency or the atrocties committed by the Sinhalese Sri Lankan Army. Sadly this book does not rise above the level of right wing Sinhalese propaganda. There are few regional security implications from LTTE activities. Whilst the LTTE is undoubtedly an international organisation, all its military activities are carried out in Sri Lanka. Neither the LTTE or the Sri Lankan Government is blameless or heroic, but a more balanced book would have focussed on how ethnic conflicts can spiral out of control and the need for a sensible, conciliatory approach to such conflicts. This partisan book falls far short of that standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS AIN'T IT!","review":"Tull fans, beware! If you want to be happy, get \\"Isle of Wight\\" or \\"Montreux\\" (young and old Tull at respective peaks). But this mess...oy... It plays like a bad PBS pledge drive thingy, with uninteresting interview snippets interrupting mediocre song performances in front of a somnolent crowd. Poorly shot, poorly directed, ill conceived from beginning to end. And the supposed \\"reunion\\" with Mick Abrahams, Glenn Cornick, and Clive Bunker - forget it - a couple of short songs in a dingy pub where nobody in the band but Ian gets off at all. Why bother?

I couldn't watch this without think \\"Ok when's the next silly special effect coming or are they going to switch to that cheesy outdoor concert....\\". You can't listen to it because of all interviews between the songs. It's very annoying. Why did they even attempt to but in the Brittney Spears-like effects in the first place? It's a concert, let them play. The thing that surprises me is that all the interviews and non-concert songs could have been put on at the end as extra bits, it's a DVD for crying out loud, that's what you do! The music is WONDERFUL but seriously I can't say if I'll every 'watch' my copy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living With the Past","review":"This is a very nice concert DVD. The music is both clean and powerful. The talent is unbelievible. The only problem is the talking between songs. Anderson says this is the way to a concert film (because you lose the concert feel), but I think after each song is a bit much. The end of the show gives me flow of a Tull concert. If you are a Tull fan, I am sure you'll love this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much MTV mentality,show concert not the video effects","review":"I sold this dvd a few days after I bought it. I love Jethro Tull but somehow Ian Anderson thinks we want to see video effects. The small club shots are in chunky slow motion, whats the deal? What are people thinking? Are they trying to be artsy?Frustration! It is alot like what the someone did with the Cream Farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall... video effects completely obscure seeing the band.Rent this one...don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This is what longtime Jethro Tull fans waited nearly two years for? You'd think with technology being what it is today, they could have made this in a 5.1 or DTS sound format. Instead we get 2.0 from a band that would have sounded superb in 5.1.As for the video production, when will musicians and their producers realize true fans want a concert without all of the silly effects? And do we really need interview segments after each song? Make the interviews another segment of the DVD features.This is my all-time favorite group. Sadly, this DVD does not do Jethro Tull justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for the acoustic songs, otherwise.....","review":"Man - this has to be one of the lamest rock concerts ever filmed.I'm a huge fan and have seen Tull several times in the good old days (when they played music with PASSION) - but I don't know what was worse...the \\"don't dare get out of our seats, for we may not be able to find our way back\\" crowd, or the \\"make sure we play this song the same way for 20 years and try not too look like we want to blow our brains out\\" band.

I'm not very comfortable criticizing fellow musicians, especially in a public forum. But why not. Maybe good things can come of what I have to say. All I have to say is this. Get rid of Jon and get a real bass player who can bring out more in the band. Outside of that, everything in the band is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Copy of an Original","review":"This is apparently a photo copy of the original that is bound as a book.

Coltrane and Philly Joe Jones really shine on these sets.Even some harder to find albums appear on the first two disks of this set. \\"Bemsha Swing\\" from the MODERN JAZZ GIANTS album is a great Monk tune.Highlights include the jivin' \\"Trane's Blues,\\" \\"Aigrin,\\" \\"Half Nelson,\\" \\"Night In Tunisia\\" and \\"Blues By Five.\\"Not enough alternate takes for my total satisfaction, but none the less, essential music.Four and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This collection is a must- have for anyone who loves Miles or has had exposure to his more well known recordings, like 'Kind of Blue' and his Columbia discography. Discs 1-3 are in my opinion not consistently of high quality, but the early recordings of 'Four'; 'Tune-Up'; 'When Lights Are Low'and the recordings with Monk foreshadow his later brilliance and are enjoyable. Disc 4-6 represent the beginning of Miles' legend. His playing on these recordings are masterpieces. He is in such sync with Coltrane,and the precision of his band is astonishing. These are perhaps the greatest post-bop recordings of all time. If you splurge for this box set you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to be pleasantly surprised","review":"Jennifer Morrison shows surprising depth in this unusual, quirky, darkly humorous film.

While they have some nice graphics and physics going for them, it's just not well tested and sorted. One of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the inconsistent difficulty levels of the tracks. If you play at a challenging level on one track, you'll be way faster than the field on the next. Other than that, the game just isn't up to modern standards. The menus are clunky and slow. The \\"announcer\\" is annoying and often gets it wrong. The sound files don't sound anything like race bikes. In the original game you could restart a race if you crashed. In SB 2000 the documentation claims you can still restart in single race mode, but that feature is not actually available. It's interesting that several other \\"reviewers\\" claim that you can still restart. Makes you wonder if they're gamers or marketers."},{"rating":"2","title":"James bond music","review":"This new soundtrack to the new bond film is very good. all the music you hear on this cd you hear in the film plus it has a bond trailer on it which you can watch on your pc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please meet David Arnold","review":"Please meet David Arnold.

May he stay with us and Bond for a long long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I good as I thought it would be ...","review":"The overall quality of this soundtrack is far - very far! - away from soundtracks like \\"A view to a kill\\" or \\"Tomorrow never dies\\". I can only recommend the title song as being quite good to listen to ... the rest of the soundtrack is basically trash - especially if you are a fan of the music of John Barry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded With Synth","review":"This is an almost dissapointment to David Arnolds music. The whole CD is loaded with synth music and drums which is not a really good mix. Tomorrow Never Dies was alot better that this CD. Although Tomorrow Never Dies forgot most of the music on the CD. But back to this CD, it's missing some of the more enjoyable ques from the movie. Like when Bond and Elektra were about to go skiing. Plus the gun barrel scene from the beginning of the movie. There are only a few enjoyable ques form this CD. Such as Ice Bandits, I Never Miss, Submarine, and the akward titled Caviar Factory. There are only a few tracks that only use the orchestra. Which Arnold should have used instead of heavy synth and drums. Such examples is Submarine. Arnold should have leaned more to the Orchestra intead of heavy synth.In other words; The World Is Not Enough, well is NOT enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Less than Exciting","review":"Those that enjoy David Arnold's previous scores will not be disappointed in this fast-paced score. Plenty of techno-heavytracks, but the mix of electronics and orchestra is pure Bond. As noted in previous reviews, the gunbarrel music is missing fromthe soundtrack. (To any Bond fan, the opening sequence is as exciting any any other music in the film...the same feeling you get when you hear the 20th Century Fox fanfare before a Star Wars movie) This reviewer recommends that the faster tracks not be played while driving. It tends to give you a lead foot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising.","review":"June 25, 2002Any soundtrack junkies out there (like myself) shouldpick this one up.

It's really good, although i like fast tunes i even enjoyed the slow ones on this cd, it's definately one for you to buy. You also have to see the film-it's the best 007 1 made, i think the garbage song was boring at the begining-you know compared to the other one's like 'Tomorow Never dies' and 'Goldfinger' but once your used to it, it's like the coolest song u know! BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but still one AWESOME Bond soundtrack!","review":"I am a fan of John Barry's Bond soundtracks, and I must say that David Arnold is just as good. He uses much more 'techno' style melodies than Barry, and for a technophile like myself, this is awesome. The title song performed by Garbage is really cool; I like it better than most other Bond titles. Songs like \\"Ice Chase\\" and \\"Caviar Factory\\" are inspired, weaving the classic Dr No melody or the TWINE theme song into some pounding action music. The one problem is that many of the songs are either slow seemingly without much to them. However, tracks 2, 3, 8, 10, and 14, as well as some others, more than make up for that. I strongly recommend this CD to any Bond or action/spy movie soundtrack fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME VERY GOOD TRACKS","review":"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH soundtrack is a pretty good James Bond soundtrack. The title song is only O.K. but there are some good tracks on the CD. The best tracks are: 3(Come in 007 your time is up), 6(Welcome to Baku), 8(Ice Bandits), and 12 (Pipeline). Number 3(Come in 007 your time is up) has a lot of the James Bond theme in it and is a fast paced track. Number 6(Welcome to Baku) is a good steady kind of India-like version of the James Bond theme. It is too short though. 8 (Ice Bandits) is a good fast-paced track with a great instrumental of the World Is Not Enough. You know what I mean by instrumental. Not the entire song, just a few instrumental parts in Ice Bandits. And finally, 12(pipeline) is a very fast paced, tense, suspenseful, and exciting track. You really have to listen to it well for it to be a suspenseful track. All in all it is a good soundtrack. Minus one star for some boring tracks though."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Arnold is no John Barry!","review":"David Arnold (who is greatly over-rated in my opinion) gives us another uninspired knock-off of a John Barry score. If only Arnold had half the talent of John Barry this soundtrack might be worth a listen. I understand that David Arnold can't read music, and relies on a (better musically educated) co-worker to actually translate his \\"compositions\\" into a music score. Arnold's Bond scores are hackneyed and un-original. Adding contemporary bands like Garbage and Propellerheads (who are also as talentless as Mr Arnold) is a waste of time. Compare this garbage to Eric Serra's wonderful soundtrack for \\"GoldenEye\\" and you won't bother to buy this lack-lustre CD. Instead of using a poor-man's John Barry to score their movies, the Bond producers would do themselves (and the audience) a favor by hiring the real thing for their next 007 adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, this CD is awesome!","review":"As a huge James Bond fan, I had to rush out and buy the soundtrack for The World Is Not Enough the moment that it came out. When I got it home, I was not disappointed that I missed an algebra class to go buy it. From the first track to the last, this CD delivers everything that you would expect from a Bond movie. Now that I have the CD, it only intensifies my wait for the movie's release on November 19th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recapturing the \\"big-time Bond\\" feel!","review":"I think that MGM finally found somebody to take the reins from John Barry... David Arnold! He does an incredible job of keeping his score saturated with the familiar \\"James Bond Theme\\", yet he is also able to go off in his own direction and create some new memorable pieces. I particularly enjoyed \\"Elektra's Theme\\", and I found the pre-credits chase music to be extraordinary. Of course, Garbage does a great job with the title tune... it took me a couple of listens to really figure out what I thought about it, but it grew on me and I really now enjoy it.

Everyone plays well with good solos from all band members; Joey Baron really stands out - there's always something interesting happening percussion-wise. The front line of alto, cello, and trumpet is an interesting combination. The 'vocals' are sustained melodic lines sung in harmony with the cello parts - sometimes it's hard to tell one from the other.

I found that after repeated listenings, this album grew on me in a big way. What I noticed was a heavy, dark and complex work. It kind of was a departure from the bands other material. Out of the 2 Blaze albums, I'd say this was the better one. I've had a chance to see Maiden (w/ Bruce) perform some of these songs live and it came across better b/c these songs seemed to be more written for Bruce. It's not a Maiden album I can just pop in like Powerslave or NOB; I have to be in mood to listen to it. I find that enhances the experience. As for those who trash this album, you obviously cannot appreciate complex, epic pieces such as these. Go listen to some new Metallica or the Indigo Girls. A bit different, but this is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not the best","review":"There are a very scarce amount of good songs on this cd, one of them is sign of the cross. That is the only good song on the album and that's why I gave it 2 stars. I love iron maiden and this album is a dissapointment. If you like iron maiden, then I'd stay away from this album because there are better maiden albums out there like powerslave. I'm just glad no more maiden albums are like this because Bruce Dickonson made his return in a brave new world.(which is another awesome maiden album)This album just isn't good at all except for sign of the cross. This cd kinda made me think less of maiden until I heard brave new world which boost my love of maiden all the way up again.

Though the music is good by most other metal standards, it is not maiden without Bruce in the front. I like the current lineup with 3 guitars, but Bruce, Steve, Adrian, Dave and Nicko are the only lineup that ever put out anything worth buying.Remember this. Some of the most memorable music is music you can sing to. Bruce gives you something to soar with. This dude is a grunt. Just not a maiden romp. They classed themself into a metal genre, as opposed to definng it.But hats off to the guys for saying \\"F-you Bruce! We love this to much to quit!\\"Well, at least for a little while.

Good think I downloaded the thing before I bought it. Music is fine, but Blase Bayley kills this album. I can think of a hundred different people I would have sung lead before this clown. Even though he might try to imitate Bruce Dickenson, he cant even come close to his range, and his voice would be suited better for Death Metal considering that if he screams it would be an improvement over his singing. Its a shame, cause there is some good music here, but Bayley is so un-listenable, I cant even enjoy it. Maiden has so many other albums to choose from, dont even bother with this crapola. (Maybe one day the could re-record it with Dickinson)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sixteen dollars for this???!!","review":"Well, CD prices are reaching an all-time absurd high standard.

Then I got the album and at the time was dissapointed it collected dust for a while but afterwards I started listening again and it got someone better. Not a powerful performance by Maiden very dark,almost barely audible cd. Next to No Prayer this is the worst. Blaze's second and Final Studio release blew away this one Virtual XI was classic Maiden.

Blaze Bayley can't stand up to the great Bruce Dickinson. He is not a bad singer,(not great either), but does not have the personality or the voice or anything else to front Iron Maiden. This album does not sound like Maiden what-so-ever.

I own every other album including Virtual XI and when compared, this one takes the cake.The vocals of Blaze Bayley are powerful,energetic,and contain an amazing amount of emotion that Bruce Dickinson lacks.This album has a surreal look on darkness that can be seen in Fear of the Dark and No Prayer for the Dying.Blaze's deep operatic vocals are invigerating and soothing and can be considered a darker side of Paul Di'Anno(who sings much better than Dickinson.)I want Blaze to stay. UP THE IRONS! DOWN WITH DICKINSON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of Recent Times","review":"I do think that this is the best iron Maiden CD of the 90's. Blaze sings \\"tolerably well\\", but he is no Bruce. The songs here are to a man better than the latest \\"Brave New World\\" CD. For me \\"The Name Of The Rose\\" and \\"Falling Down\\" are true classic Maiden songs.

I liked Virtual XI, though I've never heard X Factor. I've heard X Factor is slow. I've also heard it Rocks. Something that rocks cannot be slow. I've heard Blaze has an emotional voice, I've also heard he has a better voice than Dickinson. I've never hear Dickinson. It's just funny. The same thing happened with the Misfits when they replaced their singer, when Judas Priest replcaed theirs, and when Metallica came out with Load. This is funny as Hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"X FACTOR BLOWS","review":"The problem is not Blaze Bayley. His vocals are good. The problem is the music. The first 3 tracks and \\"Judgement of Heaven\\" are pretty good songs, but the rest sound like crappy remixes of \\"Afriad to Shoot Strangers\\". The rifts are REALLY repetative and the lyrics are horrible. The agony reaches it's peak at \\"2 AM\\" when it music goes from slow down to a crawl. Anyone who likes X Factor hasn't been listening to Bruce. If you want heavy metal that goes a step up from classic maiden (rather than a fall on the a**), get Bruce Dickinson's \\"The Chemical Wedding\\". ========BAHUMUTH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I'm sorry to say it but this album was great disappointment to me.I've been a Maiden fan for 17 years and I must confess I haven't expected such a bad staff.I've been trying to accept this album since I've bought it but so far I haven't succeeded.The songs are slow, monotonous and somehow boring.The only decent song is \\"Man on the edge\\".Fortunately the next album \\"Virtual XI\\" sounds much better.You'd better try it instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"As a Maiden fan for 20+ years, I've spent many an hour singing along and banging my head to one of the best bands that metal has ever offered up. I don't even consider this a Maiden album, but it is so I have to compare it to the rest of the catalog. Blaze's voice is so flat and boring that it's amazing nobody questioned it during the recording/mixing; just listen to him saying \\"Falling down\\" on Man On The Edge. Paul Dianno didn't have half the range as Bruce, but he pulled it off just fine. The other thing I've noticed is that the compositions aren't up to the normal Maiden level. It seems like Steve just really wasn't into it or maybe he just lost inspiration. I'm not going to rip this album apart because it's just a small blip on the the legacy of a band that I couldn't hold any higher regard for."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-Factor","review":"As a Maiden fan I was very disapointed by this album. Not because of a new singer not because of the music was bad its actually some of the best but because of the lyrics. As someone who loved old Maiden for there ghastly images and mainly non-Christian subject matter I was dissapointed to here an album where a singer is essentually whining because God dosen't seem to like him and wants his faith back. To me this is an insult to the large Paganistic/Atheistic fan base Maiden has. This also makes them less like a early Slayer and more like an early Stryper. So unless you can turn off the lyrics and your a non-Christian don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE EXCUSE FOR SINGING","review":"First of all, I have been an Iron Maiden fan for 14 years but this album is horrible. For those of you who say Blaze is a good singer, you know nothing about music. He doesn't even sing in key half the time. The only song that is bearable at all is Edge of Darkness. There is a cool Steve Harris bass solo on the album but other than that, don't waste your money. Buy Accident of Birth and Chemical Wedding by Bruce Dickinson with Adrian Smith. Thank God they are back with Maiden. Maiden should have gotten John Arch(ex Fates Warning) or Michael Kiske(ex Helloween) instead of this guy. This guy is so horrible that he makes Poison sound like they have Opera training."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY good CD even though MAIDEN got a new singer.","review":"This CD is not as horrible as people say that it is.This CD is probably MAIDEN's most cleariest sounding CD in their discography.There is not a bad song on this CD at all.Yeah, MAIDEN got a new singer for this CD after Bruce Dickinson left, but hey, Blaze Bayley sounds a lot like Bruce did but with a deeper voice.Great guitar work on this CD.I highly recommend it to true MAIDEN fans.This CD is worth the money dished out for it.Well worth the money paided for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for the song \\"Man on the edge\\"","review":"When Bruce Dickinson left the band to go solo, Iron Maiden got Blaze Bayley on vocals. There was a big difference between the more high pitch approach from Dickinson and the low pitch Bayley. It's obvious who is best suited for Maiden. The material on \\"The x factor\\" is rather weak with exception of the fast and attractive \\"Man on the edge\\" - a song based on the movie \\"Falling down\\", starring Michael Douglas. You can easily skip this album, since there are at least 500 better albums to spend your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for sign of the cross","review":"THe one star here goes for Sign Of The Cross alone, because this is great song, no matter who sang it. The rest of the CD is junk, I can't even recognize it. But the blame is in the production shoulders. The songs could have sounded a lot better had not Steve Harris thought that he could make it. He could not. The exit of Martin Birch affetcted the band incredibly, and they never recovered from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY BAD.","review":"Ok. THis is Maiden. THis is Steve Harris and DAve Murray and Nicko McBrain. So, of course the playing here has its moments. But the trouble here is the production. It made the band sound weak and uninspired. The compositions are also very irregular. LOOK FOR THE TRUTH and FORTUNES OF WAR are the same song, they begin with the same chords at the same order!!!!!!But gone are the harmony solos, so great in the times of Murray / Smith. Gone are Dickinson's powerful vocals, strong and clear. (Blaze is great - it's just that Bruce is much better). Also, Maiden always wrote great albums when they recorded eight or nine songs per album. Now, we have twelve. So, quality drops.If you're a completist, you must own this album. If not, and if you have the Best of The Beast compilation, you're well served, because it contains THE X-FACTOR only memorable Maiden song, SIGN OF THE CROSS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome Back Bruce!!","review":"Great music; Horrible vocals!

MAIDEN released absolutely nothing worth your money since SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON. The nineties were a total mess in their previously immaculate discography, mainly thanks to the exit of Adrian Smith and, later, Bruce Dickinson. The bands clearly sounds tired in X FACTOR. I'm not gonna take time to talk about Blaze. Just the songs. They are and endless pool of boredom. Ok, I admit it sounds darkier, another vibe, but the doesn't mean it's good. Both Maiden CMC albuns (this one and Virtual Eleven) are below standard material.

Its like ten minutes later this is right back in the player. ITs just that good. ITs very dark and very melodic. I will say its a MUST OWN BUY IT RIGHT THIS MINUTE. I worship this album.

The band plays great, the songs are amazing and their isn't a weak track on the album. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. Ignore the critics and decide for yourself. If you are as big of a fan as you think you are, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Iron Maiden album comprised mostly of ballads...","review":"If you've been a fan of the powerhouse vocals of Bruce Dickinson, then you may be disappointed by the more tame tracks sung by the new vocalist Blaze Bayley on \\"The X Factor.\\" The lyrics are good, and the musicianship is great as always, but I fear that that the hard-driving tunes that we have come to expect from Iron Maiden are absent on this effort. However, if you are a big fan of their slower melodies from previous albums, then this will be a good one to pick-up and give Blaze Bayley a listen. Lastly, the rating of two stars is given in comparison to their previous albums, which are--simply--better releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR GOD'S SAKE, OPEN YOUR EYES!","review":"The trouble with Maiden in the nineties was not Blaze Bayley. The trouble was guitarrist Janick Gers, a talentless songwriter for Maiden style (while in Dickinson's first solo album, he did it alright), who could not help the band at all when Steve Harris' own creative talent began to wane. In X-FACTOR, the trouble is even bigger due to: bad production; lack of energy by the band; ausence of Bruce Dickinson; exccess of songs (making their level drop). ANyway, the guys have more money than I will ever have, and they deserve it every cent, due to great albuns, hard touring, honest approach to music and rock. But to say X-FACTOR is a great album it's simply not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaze is not Iron Maiden. Bruce Is Iron Maiden.","review":"I bought this CD because I haven't read any metal magazine for a long time, and I didn't know who is the replacement for Bruce. This is a totally disappointing album. I can understand that Steve can right darker moods of a song, but Blaze? PLease! He is a sorry excuse to be a part of Maiden. Ok, Blaze has a mysterious dark voice (that's why they call him \\"the Dark Lord\\"), but he can do better than that! My dog can sing better than him. Bruce's voice can be dramatic to operatic to volcanic. Air Raid Siren is God."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Paul Di'Anno or Bruce Dickinson","review":"Well Iron Maiden fans, here it is. Blaze Bayley is just not that great a singer. Musically, the cd is pretty good, with the songs obviously Steve Harris material, but they lack vocal intensity. Blaze just does not have the vocal range of Dickinson or the metal prowess of Paul Di'Anno, the original and best Maiden vocalist. If you're a Maiden fan, the cd is worth getting, but it's a poor choice for someone new to Maiden. A newcomer to the Iron Maiden fold would be much better served by the debut album,Iron Maiden, Killers or Number of the Beast (despite the horrible Gangland). There are a few tracks on this cd worth a listen; Lord of the Flies and Fortunes of War are pretty good, but the rest just fails to live up to prior Maiden efforts. Anyway, Dickinson is back (to bad it's not Di'Anno) and we should get some real Iron Maiden again."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT TO HAVE YA BACK BRUCE","review":"THIS WAS BY FAR THE WORST IRON MAIDEN ALBUM EVER.BLAZE WILL NEVER REPLACE BRUCE.HE TRIED AND HE FAILED.BUT GOOD NEWS IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE A NEW ALBUM OUT IN THE FALL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Who?","review":"Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson is not Iron Maiden.

A lot of the songs start out slow and then build to a crescendo and that may be the biggest flaw - maybe things are a little too slow.

I've looked at other books on medieval costume, but none have been as helpful or as easy to use as this one. The time periods are listed in order under the names of the rulers of England, with detailed sections for both men and women. Half of the pages of the book have beautiful black and white sketches of the costumes of the time period, and then on the page facing the sketches there are descriptions of the garments of the time period, down to the colours and fabrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great quick reference","review":"This is a wonderful quick reference of historical costumes in England. Half the book is black and white sketches of costumes through the years. The other half is a short history of the costumes worn during various time periods. The time periods are sectioned according to rulers (kings/queens) of the time. Every aspect of clothing is discussed from undergarments to headpieces. Because of the easy format, I use this book to look things up for quick answers. I am not an expert, but the accuracy of the content of this book is relatively decent as a quick reference. I would not recommend this book to those looking for detailed costume information. I would recommend it as a quick reference or for sketches."},{"rating":"2","title":"book of excellent drawings","review":"this book has excellent realistic drawings of the dress of the ages. I'm familiar with the 1066-1930 version.

These people include occupying German military, city residents, and other civilians who -- either by choice or by circumstance -- find themselves in Brussels during these terrifying and chaotic times.I liked the story for several reasons. One is because part of the tale concerns an aspect of the times not generally familiar to Americans and, especially, Americans who didn't live through WWII: there were evil persons systematically preying on the desperation of their own countrymen as the latter fled the horrors of the Nazis. This book is fiction, but the occurrences were reality.Also, the fact that Ms. Vogel clearly knew the geographic locations and lived the terror of those times is extremely obvious and effective. While she is not yet a seasoned author, she is certainly a WWII survivor with an important and affecting story.

It used an extremely strong compression process during manufacturing and it felt very heavy and dense for its size. In addition, the surface was peculiar, in that it would not slip at all, even when sliding it over a very slick surface, but would adhere to it in a very uncanny way. The new \\"SuperBall\\" is a very poor imitation: its bounce recovery is more like 60% and it is inferior even to a cheap transparent high bounce ball that I got as a freebie... It feels light and bears no relationship to the original...Sorry, but this ball does not qualify as \\"the real thing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This ball is just like any other bouncy ball.

Only the heat of the sun by the pool caused me stop and seek somewhere more cool. This book continues, where Infiltrator left off. I enjoyed the little references to present day events and trivia (star wars fans will find it amusing). I feel that the author really tried to be true to some aspect of time travel (if thats possible) and the way the original timeline keeps trying to reestablish itself. Saying more, would give away to much. Needless to say, it was an interesting twist in the tale.Anyway, if you enjoyed Infiltrator, you will look forward to reading Rising Storm (although, the title as very close Approaching Storm for the star wars buffs...same concept?)You must however read Infiltrator first to truly get into this book. I hope there is more in the series, since there were some loose ends that were not tied up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite literate continuation of the Terminator saga","review":"There are points in T2 INFILTRATOR and in this current book that I especially like.One is the fact that the present day characters are now on their own with no help from robots from the future. Then there is the nature of villains they face...not robots programmed to kill but cyborgs with some human qualities (but not those that will make them more likeable) directing terminators. There's the slow progress being made by Skynet which prompts changing strategies on the part of our heroes. Finally, we have the philosophical theories concerning time which suggests that any attempts to change the future are defeated by the nature of times itself. Rather a fatalistic, pre-deterministic stance, but interesting.Both of these volumes are highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"T2: Rising Storm","review":"Much as I said about T2: Infiltrator, T2: Rising Storm is a well-written sequel #2 to the second Terminator movie--Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In fact, Infiltrator and Rising Storm, written by veteran SciFi writer, S.M. Stirling, are a much better sequels to Terminator 2 than is the third movie in the series.I had hoped, in vain as it turns out, that the next movie (Terminator 3) would follow Stirling's series. Stirling is a powerful fiction writer and his understanding of combative behavior is refreshing. (See some of his other works such as Drakon and Island In The Sea Of Time.)This one is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, and cliche.","review":"I really can't recomend this even to people who loved Infiltrator. Which I did. I figured out how it would end less than halfway through. But then, there's the obligatory love interest, the disaproving mother, escapes that are too convenient, and the last one is by far the worst. A needless death of a loved one to turn a character from a sympathetic hero, to a hardened warrior. What a let-down. I could almost have enjoyed the book but for that last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Album but BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"As far as the record it self goes, this is a classic \\"now sound\\" release. Fat Moog synth, wordless vocals, the whole nine yards. I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about these being different recordings. Spaced Out is my favorite among the 30 or so Enoch Light records I own and this is the exact same album as my vintage Project 3 LP.However, here's the problem, this CD was clearly mastered from an LP. While the transfer isn't terrible, you do hear typical record noise which is really dissapointing. Add in the \\"low budget\\" packaging and lack of licensing information, I have to question the legality of this one.Still, you can't beat the price and if you don't want to take the time to burn your LP to a CD (or if you can't find a copy of the LP) this will do. Not an unpleasant listening expirence, but this album deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"bug-ridden but otherwise OK","review":"I'm amazed to see so many positive reviews.

The brothers use their street smarts to invoke their brand of street justice to avenge the murder of their mother.John Singleton was able to take the audience through their pain individually for how it was for them to lose someone they loved dearly, who had taken these unruly children into her home and made them her own.

The sons vow to find and kill the ones who did this. They later find out that it was not a simple robbery but that that their mother was followed and executed.The movie is full of senseless violence and makes Detroit look like a state of anarchy. Sofia Vergara has a stereotypical role as a dumb Latin lover of one of the four brother which looks like a role that will be a career killer for her.The ending is fairly predictable and the movie's plot and stupid dialogue often is an insult to anyone's intelligence.

Does it make the directors and actors money to be in such bad movies cause so many are made and released? Are these movies not being previewed before they are actually released? Are these movies shot with more details and durning editing they are so chopped up that they make no sense? What is going on I mean really reading this as a script had to have not made sense so why was it even made? If you just want a night of eye candy with no substance rent this movie.

Acting is solid all the way around, it grabs and keeps your attn until the satisfying end. Good action, suspense and whodunit factor. Great story line, just enuf character development to get the story moving well w/out dragging. And unlike so many other films of this genre, not alot of overblown hollywood effects to try to cover up a lack of any reasonable plot.

This movie is entirely too full of the casual abuse and obvious if unspoken affection brothers hold for each other. From the opening to the closing credits the writing in this movie shines bright. That said John Singleton deserves a great amount of credit, as do the entire cast Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjermain, and especially newcomer Garrett Hedlund turned in the type of stellar roles that on their own could elevate a \\"B\\" movie to \\"A\\" status."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"The acting in this movie is terrible.

I watched the movie in it's entirety and must say that it although wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it was borderline the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting was that of a \\"C\\" class rated movie and although the plot of the movie was somewhat of an alright idea, the writers could've definitely worked a little bit more on other things that had happened.I'd say that if you like bad movies with guns, violence, horrible acting and attempted witty banter, that this is for you; otherwise, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time & talent","review":"Defies logic and common sense.

Save yourself money and not go which would be the political correct thing to do as far as i'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot....","review":"What sets this movie a bit apart from the rest was the way the scenes were written; for example, the outcome of a scene, in particular the one where a brother goes to the cop's house, isn't what you'd expect it to be.

Do not waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother...","review":"Had a lot of potential, but played like a random collection of incoherent contrived scenes. Seems like the director went through his old idea journal and made a movie out of it. Great to see André 3000 in a movie, just wish it was done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt like it","review":"For one, the relationships between the four brothers does not come across real enough. Then on top of that there is way to much crimes being done by the foursome...in real life they would not get that far, especially in Detroit! This movie fails in my eyes because it does not explore the characters and the relationships they had with the adoptive mother on a real solid level. We see so much of the city of Detroit it makes us hope we never live there, and in the end it again, just has to much hollywood and not enough realism to make it worthwhile. I want my 2 hours back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes FIVE STARS , For an action/revenge movie most definately a great pick","review":"Great movie. From the beggining too the very end. You get attatched too each charachter. And whats better then revenge movies ? This movie will have you on the edge of your seat untill the end. Yes there was a few holes in the plot. But then again too people who got a normal head on there shoulders will realize the plot is simple. It is about 4 brothers mother being killed and they come back alltogether too find and bury the killer and go threw everyone and everything untill they catch him. Pretty simple for the people who were questioning that. But on the real subject. Great movie , Great Action , The acting was well done especially on mark whalbergs part. Like i said will have you on the edge of your seat untill the end. Well Done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Western well done.","review":"Four Brothers is dubbed an \\"Urban Western\\" in one of the special features on the DVD. The filmmakers hit the 'Western' imagery right on the head. With vigilante justice and unlikely bonds, the stuff of old-time Westerns, the film comes alive as brothers seek revenge after the slaying of their mother. Plot twists and action will hold your attention. Some portions of the film are a bit unreal, but that's so in every Western I've ever seen. In the beginning, it's hard, as a viewer, to apply the 'Western' style to a hard urban community. For me, the relationships seemed a little awkward in this style. But the angle is a brave and successful move for the writers, director and producer. The acting is also superb. All four 'brothers' bring something special to the cinematic table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Action Movie - Brothers Get Their Mother's Killer","review":"This movie was a great \\"vengeance/pay back\\" movie! Mark Wahlberg and even Sophia Vergara delivered strong performances. This was a good film without any slow spots from beginning to end. Well cast, and the action scenes were good. Terrence Howard delivered a smaller role well as a cop.This had a few surprises in it also, and was not as predictable as many of these types of movies that I have seen. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good action drama. Expect a little blood, some profanity and a great deal of action. Very entertaining. No wonder I like Wahlberg these days in \\"Blue Bloods\\" on CBS with Tom Selleck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Brothers [Blu-ray]","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

This isn't the type of movie I would usually go see but it sucked me in. There are some pretty detailed and accurate reviews on here already so I won't go into too many movie details but I will say that it is a roller coaster of emotion that makes you really feel for the characters. I would highly recommend this movie even if it isn't the type of movie you would normally see you should give it a shot"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye For An Eye","review":"If you like the old vigilante Charles Bronson type movies of the past, go see Four Brothers. It was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gunslingers' Revenge","review":"This is an entertaining film. There aren't any shocking plot twists, no clever surprise endings - it's just good, solid entertainment.There are stereotypical characters that act in predictable ways, but somehow it comes off as original and you don't mind it. The level of acting has something to do with it, for certain. Mark Wahlberg is great at playing a crazy M'Fer, Tyrese has come a hell of a long way with his acting abilities and Andre 3000 also turns in a solid performance.The movie will definitely hold your attention. It's worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"My reviews about the movies I order","review":"I loved this movie. I thought the characters worked well together, and there were funny parts throughout. Overall I thought it was a great movie. The writers made a valid point; no matter what color you are we're all considered brothers and sisters in God's eyes and long as you have family that's all that matters. I would definitely recommend people to order and watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Story Line","review":"My 3 teenage sons (17, 15 & 13 yrs.) watched this movie (more than once) and they really enjoyed it (by the way, these guys are real harsh movie critics). It has a very cool story line, quite a bit of action with a few comical scenes. However, what was most striking about the movie was to see four brothers of different races really interacting with each other as if they were real blood brothers. Kudos must definitely go to the actors and the movie's casting team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on","review":"This is a perfect blend of characters.

The biggest problems with this are not that it's all trope and no originality, though. The biggest problems are the acting, storytelling, and cinematography. This should not be sold. This is the kind of thing you put on DVD extras with a disclaimer when you've released a good movie. The camera is jerky. The lighting is terrible. The mic must have been hidden in someone's pants. The 'plot' gets moved along via phone call at the start (as in the trailer) not once but twice. There's maybe one good shot of the characters. The best you can say is that Billy Ray Gallion is pretty. If you're a 'Lost' completist, you might want to watch. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I isn't bother with this one. It's very short and at the I said \\"huh, what was that about\\".

I already own all of the Doors works on cds so I play those instead. This is a great boxed set. All the discs in it are album likenesses. Each disc is packaged like the vinyl original. Definately worth the $150 price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need in one box!","review":"I disagree with reviews by people who say they are disapointed with the box set. It is what it says it is, simply a collection of all of the Doors studio albums. With the added essential rarities CD. Nothing more, nothing less. And that is more then enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doors Box Set A Big Disappointment","review":"I consider the seven disk Doors box set a big disappointment. Upon examining the contents, I realized it was merely a rehash of the previous Doors box set and other stuff they released. I'm not impressed with their \\"remastering\\" of the six Doors albums. I expected,as most Doors fans did, the release of material in their archives that formerly appeared only on bootlegs. What became of Paris Blues? for instance. Additionally, there is an abundance of other Doors songs that rightfully should have appeared on this box set.I tend to agree with the commentator who angrily suspected that greed is the prime factor in the release of this ghastly, overpriced box set. I maintain that this box set is a repetition and a waste of money for anyone but a recent convert to the Doors magic. After visiting Jim's grave in Paris this year and devouring all the literature available on the Doors, I feel terribly disappointed by this box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skunked again","review":"I liked the remastering but I was really disappointed they remixed \\"Break on Through\\" so that the bridge reverts to it's original state. The original recording has Jim saying \\"she get....HIGH!!!!\\" but we were used to hearing \\"she get!!!\\" because of censorship concerns when this song was originally released.

All I could think of while watching it, however, is how little I learned about K and its bands. This is not a documentary in any sense but a festival of self-congratulation and self-aggrandizing (with the exception of the most celebrated character -- Calvin Johnson -- who comes off as thoughtful and nearly heroic). It quickly becomes a promotional spot for Beat Happening, though we never hear the name Heather nor hear from or about her -- and she wrote and sang nearly half their songs! The director assumes a vast amount of former knowledge about K and the bands, then proceeds to sell their wares to us. Alienating. Runs counter to the spirit of the times and the music. An utter shame. And I can only look back in my memory for the real deal, cause I was there, & this wasn't even an hint of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Shield Around' O.K.!","review":"This Heather Rose Dominic documentary beautifully depicts the indie mentality that is K Records.

The style and literary techniques employed by the venerable author here are not, at first, user-friendly. In place of a sequence of actions, a run-on assault of descriptions tell the tale of a seemingly immortal yet completely despicable Caribbean tyrant. Sentences last for pages, each chapter is but one paragraph, the narrative perspective changes in mid-sentence, etc: This anti-traditional approach proves to be extremely rewarding, I felt the ending was even better than the build-up. Worthy of a score of Doctorate theses--but none by my hand. Upon finishing this book you will be awakened to a unique artistic literary style by one of the century's greatest authors--then go out and buy yourself some more Marquez novels. The more straightforward \\"General in his Labyrinth\\" and the illustrious \\"100 Years of Solitude\\" I also highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"I like García Márquez's literature. Three of his books are among my favorites. But this one I didn't like. I must say that I usually prefer demanding readings over \\"light\\" literature, so it's not the \\"stream-of-consciousness\\" what bored me (I love \\"Ulysses\\", for example). But I did not find it interesting. 50 pages-long sentences must be really excellently crafted. I think in this work they are not. Perhaps for non-Latin Americans it is a wonderful tale about a bizarre Latin American dictator and the savage world over which he reins. But I knew right from the start that this would be a long mock and attack on dictatorships (which is perfectly fine), and I didn't want to read more. No problem, even the best artists are entitled to some bad results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made a long trip longer","review":"This was the wrong book to select for a road trip even thoughI loved two of his other books, and felt up to the challenge, even so was not able to handle the tediousness of the story of a failing dictator, nevertheless, its cruel images haunt my thoughts even weeks later, and if you think this sentence is run on, you won't appreciate Marquez's style which dominates and therefore diminishes the underlying brilliance of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if I restructure it, I will like it?","review":"Once in a while, in my masochistic phases, I will read a book like Autumn of the Patriach. This is like much of Faulkner's writing: Chapters made up of single paragraphs, made up of single sentences. As I read, I annotated to show some natural breaks.I know others who can dive into this kind of book and really get something out of it. I guess I should give it another chance and exercise my brain a little more. But if I do get into it again, I have a strong temptation to rewrite it in the style of Ernest Hemingway.I have all of Garcia Marquez fiction and some nonfiction available in English. This is by far my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Conduct of Life (Classic Reprint)","review":"The book was on time and was a brand new book.

Unfortunately, I could not relate to Lizzie Simon. She is elitist and she is very self-congratulatory. It is so embarrassing to read about her relationship with Nicholas, and somehow she thinks that she's the only one who could understand him. He can't understand himself!!! Needless to say, I don't understand what all the hype is when reading this book. I think there are plenty of people out there who have written excellent books on their struggles with mental illness (i.e Kay Redfield Jamison, William Styron). This book, though entertaining, is very base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all.","review":"I read this book several years ago and am still horrified. Lizzie Simon seems to be elitist, as others have pronounced. The book is certainly self-congratulatory, and her view of Lithium as savior is certainly narrow minded. My approach is lifestyle/faith based, does that make me a \\"crackpot?\\" It was also embarrassing to read about her relationship with a love interest (TMI), and how she thought she was the only one who understood him. I'm just thankful my copy was from the library, not bought with my own money."},{"rating":"2","title":"review for lizzie's simon book","review":"As both a clinical psychologist and avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, I found Lizzie's Simon's book to be extremely well-written, witty, poignant, and realistic. It is a haunting and illuminating portrayal of being young with bipolar disorder and yet, at the same time, an easy, fast read--a difficult feat to pull off given the heavy subject matter. I highly recommend it and will tell others, especially teenagers and young adults who are wrestling with any kind of emotional or psychological difficulties, to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, yet overrated.","review":"When searching through bookstores, on-line and physically, all I read was praise for Simon's book. What I was searching for was a book that displayed a group of young bipolar persons that I could not relate to but just maybe slightly through the pages connect with. In turn, I found slight biographies of people that all had warm, loving, wealthy, highly educated families. Although, some did not understand the illness, they were responsive to it's diagnosis. Not everyone has this response and maybe if Simon did a bit more research than a couple month road trip and considered a wider variety of people the book would have been allowed the reader to make more a connection. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Informative!","review":"Lizzie Simon's book is not only a terrific read, but an incredibly eye-opening revelation, shedding light on a disorder which few people really understand.

I got the impression something was stuck underneath, so I contacted the company asking how to open it up or clean it out. They never replied. The problem eventually went away.It's possible the damage to the mouse was due to travelling with it--I packed it along with other electronics into suitcases (but well-cushioned) a handful of times throughout the year.

Yes, the engine is very dated, but fans of this series will not be too put off by this. The new playable races in this installment are a nice touch, although I would say that with a dragon in your party you have a big advantage. This is because it's basic flame attack uses no spell points and does a lot of damage. The dungeons in this game are not as huge as MM6, which in my opinion is just fine.

It was all about the technical terms and the science and doctoral words. Andromeda seemed weighed down by those. The ending cut off too abruptly. The epilogue didn't flow with the story and there were no references to the future. What happened to the disease? Did it kill more people in the world? Did they get samples to study it furter?

Let's see those know it all doctors try to tackle this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Crichton's most famous work.","review":"I read this when it first came out, just before the movie. It was a masterwork about an unknown plague that came from space and constantly mutated. There were implications that the world might be destroyed, and two survivors, a baby and an old drunkard, who provided hope that there was something that allowed survival. through in a state of the art biological lab, and this became a masterpiece tale of the possible meeting the disastrous. This work really established Crichton, and was well within his Sphere of expertise. I recommend this novel to anyone who had not yet read Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Andromeda!","review":"My first experience with The Andromeda Strain was seeing the movie about twenty years ago. I absolutely thought this was based on real life and I watched it over and over and over! My neighbors were beginning to think I had a crying baby in my apartment! Awed by the story I was determined to find and read the book, so I searched the local library.At first my search was in the historical and science books sections, but I didn't find it there. So I looked in fiction and there it was! I was relieved to know that the story wasn't based on fact, but I knew the concept of biological warfare is a reality. I read the book and even though there were a lot of dissimilarities to the movie, the story floored me.The Andromeda Strain still remains my number one movie and the remake should not have happened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading!","review":"Thisis an awsome techno-thriller book. Action, mistery, a bit of science (biochemistry- medicine..) documentation also attached to a book of only 375 pages that you'll read in a blink of an eye.. After reading the superb \\"sphere\\" years ago, this book has live up to the high quality book that I read. I recommend it for all fans of science-fiction and mistery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Andromeda Strain grips from the first sentence and does not let go. Crichton lets you the reader know the same things as the main characters, and it is a mystery to the reader just as much to the scientists of the book what killed an entire rural town in one night. The book takes place over a four day period and it only took me 2 days to read it. The book is that quick and good of a read. I don't want to give away what happens but i was just a little disappointed by the end, but it made sense. I really enjoyed this book and i think that it isvery entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't all that good","review":"First of all, I thought it was very interesting at the begining. But as I reached the middle I found myself skipping paragraphs, just so I could get it over with. I can understand why they had to go through all those procedures but Crichton could have made it a little more thrilling. And to all the people who keep commenting about the bacteria itself, relax. Just try to imagine that such a bacteria exsists, it's only a book. Use your imagination !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Crichton - From peak to poop","review":"Michael Crichton has written two great books and one really good one. They are, in order of their appearance, Andromeda Strain, The Great Train Robbery and Congo. Having produced these, all of which were made into movies of greater or lesser mediocrity, Crichton started writing screen plays, among them, Jurassic Park (I may vomit), Lost Whateverthehellitwas (barf), and Disclosure (double barf, surely one of the worst books ever written). Andromeda Strain is a great piece of work - feasible to a non-scientist who couldn't care less whether a microbe like this could exist in fact, but constituted a very real threat in the world of fiction. Personally, I read this book twice in 24 hours (the only other one was Silence of the Lambs), and reread it with some regularity. Its really too bad that this represents the peak of a writing career for a skilled author with immense potential who tragically sold out to the Hollywood scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Me Hungry....For More Details!","review":"All in all, the book left me hungry for more details and deeper relations to the characters, a climax that was suspended or lengthened would have been nice, and an ending that didn't leave you feeling empty would have been much appreciated. Compared to Crichton's other works, this was a failed attempt to win millions of fans, but surely one that left you thinking. Instead of mesmerizing you chapter by chapter, he waits until you have completely finished the book, laid it down, and then he lingers in your head while you contemplate what just happened. If he wants you to remember this book, he should get five stars. If he wants you to like this book, two stars is the result!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST KIDDING, BUT U LOOKED! GREAT READ...","review":"...I do give it 5 stars! Although it helps to understand biology and some medical terrminology, the built in dictionary is thorough and very helpful.This story is one written with an obvious strict attention to detail and supposed accuracy. I read it in one day and forgot tk eat!Although not a science fiction fan, this book had me at \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"...So to speak.BEWARE of some other 1-stars. They contain SPOILERS! Will people ever learn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undoubtedly the WORST book I have ever read!!","review":"The first and ONLY book I have read by Mr. Crichton, I expected a book of great suspence and action from an author so widely known. BIG LET DOWN!!! For one thing, the storyline seemed to constantly leave things unexplained (maybe it was just me). In numerous parts of the novel, I found myself reading back two and three pages, thinking I just somehow missed something, but it never did explain what I wanted to know. Also, many terms used could've been, to me, some newly invented language. Maybe it's just because I'm not a science freak. In any case, I thought the book was boring, draggy, and, take away the very first and last few pages, extremely uneventful. What amazed me was the number of acclaims that were listed at the beginning of the book. Were those critics reading the same version of the novel I read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a science degree before reading","review":"For some reason, even though this book is highly rated, I didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not huge on science, so the technical mumbo jumbo throughout the book was a little to much to handle. I know that I'm not the only one either.I guess I was expecting \\"The Stand\\" when I picked up this book, so you can imagine how utterly disappointed I was. I felt like Crichton was giving me his resume and showing off his med school mind instead of focusing on making the book enjoyable to read. I kept waiting for the climax....and waiting...and nothing every happened!I give a two star only because I try and reserve 1 stars for terribly atrocious books. This pushed the envelope though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scientific!","review":"Crichton is a master of detail and tells a very complete story, but this one was just too scientific for my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"undoubtedly Crichton's best","review":"Andromeda Strain ranks as Crichton's most compelling and fascinating book (with Jurrassic Park a close second). Every aspect of Crichton's storytelling: the characters, the scientific insight, the suspense, are all at the top of their form. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book","review":"This is an excellant book about all that scientific stuff. This is the best book i have ever read that doesnt have any human or animals for bad guys. Andromeda Strian is put together well and is one of his best. It starts out pretty slow but it picks up towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is by far my favorite book!","review":"I read many books by this author and others like him. This is by far the best book I have ever read! I reccomend this book to everybody who likes books that lead you to different conclusions about the virus every chapter. I feel this book is for mostly adults, however I am 13 and I loved this book. The reason I think mostly adults will like this book is because you need to have a backround on biology. You don't need to know much, just a little bit. I know most of my friends like and understand it, but some people don't. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic idea, but a little too old fashioned & technical","review":"The basic theme of the book is that an outer space bacteria enters earth and starts affecting people - this is a life form which is unfimiliar to our environment and bodies, and a group of scientists are assigned to explore it and find a cure for it.The book itself is full of suspence and makes a good read, but I think the author did overdo the technical bit a little, especially since they are really old fashioned and are either irrelevant or known to many people nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm... I wonder why everyone else gave good reviews","review":"I give it a 2 star rather than a star because the idea was good. Unknown bacteria causing disease on Earth.It was really too bad that I read Sphere first because I saw too many similarities in the two books. For example, the suspense scenes with the doctor climbing through the underground 5 level lab was just too similar to the main character in Sphere climbing up the submarine to get away from the squid. Maybe its just me, but I would not recommend this book.Go read \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card or \\"The Golden Globe\\" by John Varley because they will give you your money's worth. Don't waste your time on Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!","review":"Although I tend to absolutely hate science fiction I loved this book! I am a 15 year old girl and was surprised that I enjoyed a less main stream story line. I was interested the whole time, even through the quasi-scientific parts. I kept on forgetting it was not actually a true story. Chriton's ability to incorperate \\"facts\\" was amacing and really enhanced my experience. This is a must read, and goes more quickly than I would have liked, because I was dissapointed I had no more to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strain? It's more of a stretch.","review":"I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to think I should just quit reading Crichton's books. \\"Prey\\" was OK; \\"State of Fear\\" was pretty dreadful. Thankfully, those and this book are the only ones I've read so far. I'm not even going to touch \\"Next,\\" from what I've heard. I picked up this early book of his, hoping maybe it'd be different. But no -- it's the same old cardboard characters whose quirks are told to us rather than shown (did he never attend even one writing workshop?). The same old making science into an image that fits the plot, bending facts at will and just making some up (eg, having the guys swim open-eyed through some mysterious disinfectant, like that's going to get all the bacteria...). The same old blunt-force foreshadowing. The same old lecturing and moralizing. Ugh. The one saving grace was that it was a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andromeda Strain","review":"I'm not sure why this clumsy book has been re3-introduced to the public. Perhaps because thoise who saw the movie so many years ago have either died off (from causes other than deep-space viruses) and the publisher hopes to dupe a few additional readers. The basic concept, of an unexpected deadly virus being brought down to earth, isn't bad. It's just a bit too unbelievable here in the 2000's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Andromeda Strian Reviewed","review":"The Andromeda Strain comes across as a book that should be an on the edge of your seat, nail biter type of read. This was my misconception. The book is actually very information and a little bit interesting for scientifically gifted people. Most of the book uses many techinical and scientific terms I was not familiar with, but I could catch on. The last part of the story really carries the weight of the entire book. There is not much progress in about the first fifteen chapters of the book, but near the end it picks up and the plot thickens, making a person nibble, not bite their nails. Overall I found the book to be satisfactory, but not a best-seller in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better books!","review":"I have read many books by Mr.Crichton. This book is not one of his best. I have read over 21 books for my reports this year and I wrote this opne was one of the worst. The book Postman was the only worst one. The character development is very impaired. I am unable to assosciate with any of them. Association to a character is something I need to get into a book. I belive other books such as Sphere and Jurasic Park were much better. The content in both books were closer to sci-fi than other books. Empidemics are something we are used to reading and seeing nowadays. I teachers at school taught u to write with adjectives which this book is lacking. Do not read this book if you have something better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess of a novel","review":"This book is thought of by many to be a sort of modern classic, but I really didn't like it. It's full of plot twists that lead absolutely NOWHERE. There are certain revelations that make the preceding part of the novel seem a total waste of time. The character's efforts have no effect and eventually, the book is resolved when the virus mutates into a harmless form. The whole book is a waste of time. The characters are useless. The book is just a way for Crichton to show off medicla knowledge. All in all, it's a mess"},{"rating":"1","title":"A doctor that doesn't know biology?","review":"As a biologist and a med. student I am appalled that Crichton made a basic and blatant error that his entire book rests on. If you have a population of organisms, and there is a mutation, THE WHOLE POPULATION DOES NOT MUTATE TOGETHER. The majority of the population stays in the old form. In this book Crichton has a population of organisms that all mutate together into a few scary things and then finally into something harmless and that saves the day. If this were REAL biology we would have a separate population surviving after each mutation. At the end of the book there would still be a population of rubber-eaters as well as a toxic population, etc. Needless to say this \\"Deus ad-lib\\" was a huge let down. Crichton needs to go back and read some of his biology texts. No wonder he doesn't practice medicine any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but too much futuristic stuff in the weird lab","review":"I liked this book a lot. It was a fairly good(and fast) read. It was not as good as The Lost World, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I listen to books on cd commuting on the highway so I'd like a little more action. This struck me more like science class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good build up but disappointing ending","review":"I loved the way the book starts off and right away you are in the thick of the plot. I espically like the way Mr. Crichton sticks to the main story but as I start see how few pages are left to read, I begin to wonder how he wraps up the story in so short a time. Now I am on the last chapter and it seems that when Mr. Crichton was writing the novel, he just decided he had had enough and just banged out a few pages to abruptly end it.The abrupt and shallow ending spoilt what could otherwise have been a classic. Maybe someday Mr. Crichton could go back, delete the existing last chapter and actually finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical and anticlimactic","review":"Tough book to get through. Very technical and anticlimactic. Not the thriller it was billed to be when I did the research. Hopefully his other books are more like Eaters of the Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspenseful story about a virus of extraterrestrial origin","review":"A great story about scientists who rush to contain and find a cure for the andromeda strain, only to find that it adapts and that they have no way to control it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"As a college student, I have very little time for extra-curricular pleasures such as reading. Luckly, this book was a VERY fast read (once you get past the initial chapters) and it kept my interest the whole way through. I read the last 40 pages in a half hour. I was crusing! The climax was pretty good, I've read better, but very nice. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I just started reading Michael Crichton and The Andromeda Strain was the next book on my list. It is definitely a Crichton classic and will keep you guessing. It has that similar theme of some of his other books, man and technology. Man is his worst enemy, creating things that ruin. There were also alot of technical terms. My main problem was that I found it to be a little anti-climatic, especially at the end. It's a good book, but it was one of his early ones, so don't go into it thinking that it's going to be like Jurassic Park. It's written in a form as if it were non-fiction. Crichton even said himself that people actually thought it was a true story, after a while he gave up on telling them that it was fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Believer","review":"Why is Crighton so popular? Why is Andromed Strain so great? I read this book in thirty minutes, because I skimmed through 80% of it. I would rather read a car manual. The climax is drab, the characters blend into each other, and the \\"shocking\\" scenes are so unexploited, they leave no impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I was assigned this book to read, and I found it to be very slow and really dull. It starts out allright, drags slowly throughout the middle, and ends entirely wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore strain.","review":"Okay. I really didn't like this book. The characters were too blah. The story and setting really needed a tune up. After the frist chapter I was yawning and popping Hrry Potter into the DVD player. There were no girls characters (and I found that sexist),and if the ending would have been decent Michael should have at least given a little effort.Don't get me wrong. I think Michael Crichton is a great author. I just think this book was really tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good- Until the disappointing ending","review":"I have enjoyed the Michael Crichton books until I read this one.

I'm not a dorky brainer either. I just like the books. He puts things into simple terms. I've read: Congo (which was sooo boring), Jurrasic Park, Lost World, Sphere, and of course Andromeda Strain. I'll admit, it's not the best thriller, but I've read it 3 times already.

Read it but try not to be dissapointed when you read the final chapter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book!","review":"For all those who believe that The Andromeda Strain is too technical, I believe that you should read at least the last two paragraphs of the acknowledgements in the front. Right there Crichton states that it \\"is a rather technical narrative, centering on complex issues of sciences.\\" If you don't feel comfortable about technical writing, don't read the book. I believe that it is a very interesting \\"documentary,\\" explaining important issues of alien life killing humans which may still be a threat as we try to explore other worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love science & medicine you'll like this book","review":"I found the concepts fascinating & couldn't wait to find out what was causing the terrible problems & how the scientists could put a stop to it!

I felt cheated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out promising but then turned very disapointing","review":"For thr first 30 - 40 pages I was really into this book. But then it just got worse as every page went on. It took me 2 weeks to read this book, which is way too long for a book this short. It was just too dry. It seemed more like a scientific manual than a novel. I like reading Sci-fi but it almost seemed like you had to be a Dr. to understand what was going on. Michael Crichton is a very good author but this is defenitly not a good example of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and relevant even now","review":"I think this was one of the best \\"first books\\" of any author I've read. It seems even today to have this uncanny timeless quality, as if its plot could be going on right now. Oddly enough the characters seem better developed then his later works, they seem human. The book did provide some interesting theories to trifle with, a little bit of mystery, and even a smidge of psychology thrown in if you look hard enough. The only real complaint I have about it is I found it a bit anti-climactic, but in being so it was certainly unique. It is deserving of its reputation and place in science fiction literary history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The man does his research very well.

And the capsule carried an organism from space, that killed the whole population in a small town, except two survivers.

But not right now, no, astronauts can come back and go home immediately instead of going through a 3 week decontamination process, since no life form have been found anywhere in space... Yet.This book was written in 1969, and remember that time has changed, and beliefs have changed, so don't read this book and laugh at the idea because 2000's and 1960's are totally different eras.Anyway, it was an intersting book.

We bought this grinder to replace a very old one and it took us twice as long as it did before to grind packages of venison.On the plus side, I returned the grinder to Amazon and received a full refund, which included shipping. While the grinder wasn't good, we will continue to order from Amazon because of the quick and kind customer service.

What I got was an increase in number of bowel movements, that appeared to be cleaning stuff out of my system. I also liked that this cleanse included other organs as well as the intenstines. I found it to be very reasonably priced and I will probably do this again several times per year.

His theory is based on one 6 steps formulawhich is repeated over and over again. I think he is good in marketing because he covers same formula with different packages. There is nothing new in this book than his first book.However if you never listened or read his books this is the most comprehensive one.

I mean, how many programs does he need to come out with? Its like everyone is the one to change your life. Its all the same repeitive stuff.

It was a ok read with not alot of action and the ending I wish could have had a little more excitment.The interaction between Jack and Daisy seemed alittle forced with her telling him he's not her type and there was no chemistry between them, something was missing there for me. The way Howard described Jack - graying hair, thick neck, body builder, is that supposed to be attractive? I felt Howard wrote more about the puppys antics than she cared to write about the romance or action. The book was worth reading if you have nothing else to read or important to do. It just could have been so much better. Not up to Howards usual books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, erotic, and great!","review":"I must say, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. Linda Howard has this incredible ability to make the reader understand the ins and outs of her characters. You find yourself knowing how they will act, and loving every moment of the brief period of their lives that you get to enjoy.There were many times when I found my self laughing out loud, and one time that I laughed so hard my wife just had to know what had me in stitches. When you start reading about the \\"Party Pack\\", don't eat or drink. If you have anything in your mouth at all, you'll make a mess. Trust me on this one.If you like books with romance, killers, and lots of laughs, don't pass this one up. It's rare that I add an author to my \\"must read\\" list, but Linda Howard is now on it, and this book is at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is only one Linda Howard in this world?","review":"I just don't believe that I read a two star book from Linda. After I read Mr. Perfect, After the Night and Dream Man, and I saw this book in the book store I almost had a fight with another costumer for the last one (just kidding), and when I started to read it I just couldn't believe what I was reading, if this book were written by other person I just would't finish it, but I said: give it a try and then I was in the middle of the book so I finished it.The main story of the book is hard enough to remember, this book goes out of story so many times, for example: it has a full chapter when Daisy went to make her hair and make up, so what with that, who cares! Another is when her new pet destroyed her new house so what! And many more.When I saw this book I thought that I would laugh a lot and have a nice time, so please Linda, make another book to take me this bad flavor of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sabbatical?","review":"Has Linda Howard taken a sabbatical and someone else written this book using her name? This book is mediocre at best. It certainly is not up to her standards. This stands as a hastily written, rapidly produced product for profit and certainly not worth reading. Linda, if this is what you are going to start turning out, count me as a former reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay the ransom! Please!!","review":"After reading the last several Linda Howard novels, I can only assume is that she was kidnapped about five years ago, and her publisher decided it was cheaper to hire a ghost writer than to pay the ransom the kidnappers demanded. All I can say is: Pay the ransom! The real Linda Howard wrote such wonderful romances for Silhouette and several early on for Pocket, but this \\"ghost\\" can't begin to match her emotional depth, plotting or characterization. Get her back before her reputation is ruined past redemption!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to the Linda Howard romance?","review":"If you're looking for one of those heart-throbbing romances, typical of the old Linda Howard, you're going to be disappointed with this. Unfortunately, Ms. Howard has been slowly but surely drifting away from her gripping love stories and venturing more toward--well, simply telling a story. Yes, there's a romance here, but it's just a small part of the whole, instead of BEING the whole. I was left in awe when I read Mackenzie's Mountain, truly half in love with Zane when I finished Mackenzie's Pleasure, wistful by the power and strength of Kell Sabin from Diamond Bay . . . . Open Season, however, insomuch as the story was enjoyable, left me with little more than a closed book when I was finished reading. Sorry, Ms. Howard. In fact, I'm one of your biggest fans. But I miss the love in your love stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"linda howard does it again","review":"For those of us who are sick of picking up romance novels that all follow the same basic plot, \\"Open Season\\" is a welcome change. Linda Howard combines a compelling love story with witty character dialogue, and a plot that is full of supense and intrigue. It is wonderful to read a book that offers an enjoyable romance and a mystery in which it is easy to become totally engrossed. This a wonderful read for romance and mystery readers alike. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No suspense but a charming romance","review":"I've been slowly working my way through the Linda Howard oeuvre, and while I generally love her alpha male heros and frank sexual scenes, she is pretty formulaic in most of her stories. (Luckily, she has a very readable writing style that pulls you along.) But this is the first (only) time when Howard actually demonstrates that she has a sense of humor, and a good one at that! The heroine's transformation and her tentative romance are full of funny pitfalls and awkward moments, and I was charmed the entire way.Most reviews are right on about the suspense aspect being extraneous and half-hearted. It's criminal that this book was marketed that way, and readers/reviewers are justified in feeling victimized by the bait-n-switch. But if you know this ahead of time, and enjoy the romance aspect, the book actually proves to be one of Howard's better romances and Daisy one of her best heroines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I use to be a big LH fan when she first started out with the romance novels. However, I have not been able to make the transition to her mysteries. I have read about 3 or 4 of them and I can honestly say I have not enjoyed any of them. The last one \\"Mr.Perfect\\" was so so, but this one was just awful. I say she should just stick to romance and leave the mystery to Nora Roberts. The plot was extremely weak and I did not find any chemistry with the two main characters. Save your money and pass on this book. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't say enough about this book!","review":"I didn't really get that excited when I picked up this book this afternoon. However, it only took me about 6 hours to read! COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! It was wonderful.

You can't go wrong picking this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise","review":"If you are looking for one of those heart-throbbing romances, that Linda Howard typical writes, you are going to be disappointed with this. To my very disappointment, Ms. Howard has been slowly but moving away from her wonderful love stories (my favorites: After the Night, Shades of Twilight, Duncan's Bride, Loving Evangeline, to mentioned a few), into stories without any heart felt, heart moving stories that just that \\"stories\\". I would like for Ms. Howard to read some of her old love stories to capture the feeling again.Whatever happened to characters such as Zane and Joe, as well as Duncan (and the characters from Shades of Twilight, Roanna and). With the power and strength of their characters that made their stories so compelling and pleasurable to read. . . . Open Season, however, made me wondering if I was reading a book written by Linda Howard. I am one of your biggest fans and I miss your love stories. Both Mr. Perfect and this last one Open Season were a big disappointment to me,"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I have read every one of Linda Howard's books and rarely have been disappointed in anything but there's always a first time. These characters were not developed, there was very little insight into why they acted as they did, no real plot development and an ending that was just plain flat. This one is going back to the store. I do not recommend a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A touch better than fluffy teenage romance","review":"The story was simple and very predictable. It was easy reading and fairly entertaining but Linda Howard is capable for more. This seems like a half-hearted, half-baked and tired story that churned out just for the sake of launching a new book. The author could do more to develop the character and add more plot twists. I will feel sad that if there is no difference between Linda Howard's books and those fluffy teenage romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linda Howard wrote this?????????????????","review":"If this had been my first LH novel, it probably would have been my last!! She must have had half a brain when she wrote this. NO dialogue, NO plot and NO suspense. Buy this book used if possible, because you will be upset if you paid full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"This book was a bit different than most of Linda Howard's books. It was still basically a romance, but it was very funny (laughing out loud funny!) and didn't seem to concentrate on an extraneous plot as much as some of her other books. I loved the book and will definitely keep it and read it again. BUT, the second half of the epilogue makes you flip back through the pages and try to figure out what you missed and why this jerkwad badguy/hitman is now being portrayed as this wonderful human being who is going to help \\"save\\" someone from their horrible past. Give me a break! I loaned the book to a friend but told her not to bother reading the last two pages of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story - but lacking","review":"I liked the story, but found the characters at times lacking, the story predictable, the names bazaar and well, weird. There were holes in the story where I could see a plot twist, yet there wasn't one. It felt like a really good first draft of a novel, that maybe her editor didn't have time to do a thorough read through of. This is my first Linda Howard novel - so forgive me if this is an exception to the rule about her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got everything","review":"This book is absolutely great. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. It has everything to keep the reading going. Action, suspense, Romance and humor. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon's canceling system is screwed up.","review":"I got the book in plenty of time and the book was in good condition. The problem I had was I accidentally ordered to many books. One book was sent to me, the other was sent to a friend. I only wanted it sent ONLY to the friend. When I tried to back out of the sale, this was minutes after it got sent to me, the form Amazon has said I had to tell them why I was backing out. The problem was the space for telling them would not allow me to write anything in it. After 30 minutes of fooling with it, I just quit. When I ordered the book it was late at night. I could not contact Amazon to help me with the problem. The next day would be too late. I took the book and Iike I said there was absolutely no problem with the book only Amazon's system to cancel a book is F*** up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, rainy-day read!","review":"This was a quick, enjoyable read. A friend passed it on to me and frankly, I thought it would be a bore. I was so wrong! There's romance, humor and suspense, and I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"This is not the type of writing I am used to from Linda Howard. The storyline was uninteresting as were the characters. A desperate attempt to keep us interested is made when a puppy is introduced into the story & we have to read about his antics. Please! I agree with the reviewer from Dallas that it's hard to believe someone who wrote a book like Son of the Morning could come up with this boring waste. I'd rather Ms. Howard wait until her writer's block is gone before handing her loyal readers this kind of garbage. Sorry, but I'm really upset that I bought this book & I expect much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Season","review":"This book is a total disappointment. The synopsis on the book jacket was more interesting than the actual book. I have read a large number of Ms. Howard's books, and for the most part enjoyed them, but this book was a total snooze. This is one book that I wanted to return to the store after I had read only 10 pages, but I kept going hoping it would get better--it didn't. The book jacket implies that there is going be a great mystery and romance, you get neither one. If you still want to read this book, wait for the paperback, save yourself some money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!","review":"I'm sorry to write this review. I have enjoyed much of Linda Howard's writing but I just found this book too predictable and quite frankly boring. Daisy's persona just bothered me to no end. She was just too naive for me. There was no thrill of the chase with her and Jack. The romance just happened and she just happened to be the eyewitness of a crime and low and behold, her new lover is the Chief of Police coming to save the day. It just lacked substance. It was almost as if Linda Howard didn't have any idea for a story and just deceided that this one would have to do. Too predictable and lacking any luster!I'm really bummed out that I wasted my time on this one and I don't write this lightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Attempt","review":"Open Season appears to be a failed attempt at a lighter romantic tone. The herione is such a ditz she set my teeth on edge. This book is far from the quality of suspense/mystery/romance of her last two 5-star efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen to Linda Howard?????","review":"Linda Howard's last two books have really been bad, bad, bad!! And, that's a compliment. What happened, Linda?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"I haven't read that many books by Linda Howard, so perhaps my standards for her writing are not as high as someone who's read everything she's written, but I enjoyed this novel more than I did Mr. Perfect (which is not to say that I didn't enjoy Mr. P. as well). I think the development of the relationship between the protagonists was better, and Howard has a lot of wicked fun with her characters. Her sly wit is a delight to read and she throws in enough mystery and suspense to keep it interesting. She does an excellent job with the secondary characters as well, and I liked that she tied up a few story lines at the end. All in all, certainly worth the time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad we don't all like black Ford trucks","review":"I have always enjoyed Linda Howard's books and I thought it was incredible that in this book she could take subjects like rape and murder and weave such a humorous story that I laughed till I cried. Her portrayal of the stodgy old-maid who suddenly realizes life is passing her by was terrific and both Daisy and Jack were people I would like to get to know. I loved this book so much that I was a little amazed when I read negative reviews but then if everyone liked the same thing, everyone in the world would own a black Ford truck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Novel","review":"I am a lover of Linda Howard's novels and this one is just another example of her great works. I absolutely loved it - I laughed so many times over the situations that Daisy gets herself into, especially with Jack. They are both believable characters and the mystery surrounding their lives only adds to the anticipation. Job well done, Mrs. Howard! And I loved hearing about Midas. :) If you want another recommendation of one of Linda Howard's books, then I would suggest Shades of Twilight."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Linda Howard's best","review":"I have been a fan of Linda Howard books for a long time. I love this book. I read it in paperback and I am so glad they created the kindle version. It is funny and sweet with the right amount of intrigue. I hope they put more of her older books on kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I like Linda Howard and have read all her books but Open Season is bad. The book cover reads \`Seamlessly blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue'. Seamlessly blending it was not. It took Ms. Howard twelve chapters to remember there was suppose to be some intrigue in this book. And calling it intrigue is really stretching it. The ending was also a disappointment. It's as though Linda Howard knew how bad the book was and just wanted to get is over with. There is no comparison between Mr. Perfect and Open Season. Mr. Perfect I recommend, Open Season - forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Linda Howard but this isn't her best","review":"Linda Howard's writing strength is strong, take charge women who take action when faced with adversity. Mr. Perfect was great, it made me laugh out loud and I even read parts of the novel to my husband (who definitely doesn't read romance) but he laughed too. She has written characters who move us quickly through the story and we really care about.In this character, I just couldn't care. She looked to others to solve her problems , someone to do her makeup, someone to answer her questions, and even her mother and Aunt told her it was about \\"time\\" she did something with herself. I felt the same way. She seemed out of her depth with clothes and just the simple \\"girl\\" things. It didn't seem like she even had close girlfriends even though she grew up in the town and had never left. I kept wondering if no one else cares why should I."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute story","review":"I was really hoping for a lot with Open Season. I loved Mr. Perfect. It was my first Linda Howard novel. Anyway, Open Season was not quite a Mr. Perfect, but it definitely wasn't An Independent Wife book. In other words, it didn't totally stink. I thought Daisy was a cute character and I did like Jack. The plot was good too. It is definitely worth a read. There were some cute scenes, like the condom part, which I thought was funny. Anyway, if you like Linda Howard, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I'm a huge Linda Howard fan and have all of her books, I was disappointed with Open Season. The story is unfocused and Howard has all of these tiny subplots that are never developed. For example, the ending has nothing to do with the two main characters; instead, it's another tiny subplot that's just sort of thrown in there. After finishing the book you're left with a feeling of confusion. If you are a Linda Howard fan I would say go ahead and buy the paperback, but it's not worth the money to buy it hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"daisy meets her match","review":"Linda Howard does a great job showing both the innocence of Daisy, as well as the strength of her character. Jack makes a good contrast with his background as a SWAT team member. Looking at the relationship between the two, readers will laugh out loud at the way these characters interact. Howard's plot that Daisy unwittingly see's a murder without realizing it fits right in with her character. There are some extrememly funny moments when Daisy and Jack come together. However, while Howard does a good job with the characters and their interaction with each other, the development of the plot isn't as well done as her other novels and the climax was a little disappointing. Despite this, it was still a good novel, intertaining, and for Linda Howard lovers, I definately recommend the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Fast paced","review":"Dacinda(Daisy) Ann Minor, a character who can only exist in a little southern town, is the archetypal small town spinster librarian. But this particular old fashioned, next thing to a virgin, wants to get married and have babies. On her thirty fourth birthday, she decides to do something about it, and that's where the fun starts. She gets a makeover, moves out of her mother's house, witnesses a murder (unintentionally), buys a puppy, and starts something up with the town's hunky sheriff, who is far from a \\"good\\" ole boy. Now the romance in this book is more of the slam-bam-thanks and lets get married-ma'am variety than a Grand Romance, and the action is very secondary. What drives this story forward is Daisy, and then eventually Jack, and how Daisy's evolution changes them both. This is a very fast paced book- everything takes place in less than a month, but it's definitely worth reading if you enjoy a character-driven plot and laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Froth & Bubbles","review":"This book should have been published by Mills & Boon. Just a romantic supposed \\"thriller\\" that just doesn't quite make it. It did have some good parts but not enough to save it. Boring, boring and how anyone could give this five stars is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A can't put down read!","review":"This is a book that you'll want to read again and again and again. I first read it many years ago. I had since lost my original copy, but still wanted to reread it. So I bought another copy. Linda Howard has several books that tell stories that are timeless this is one of them. Enjoy your read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining; over all, disappointing","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought it would pack the same kick as some of Howard's others; boy was I disappointed. Although it was entertaining to see the machinations of small-town America, the two main characters were so clueless as to be from completely different books. I never got the sense they had much chemistry, and the way the main character went from not liking anything about the man to loving him seemed a little too far-fetched. The plot was also cliche, dating back past all of the thousands of reincarnations of the plot of Pygmalion. All in all, I'd suggest skipping this one and wait for the next Howard book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed with Open Season","review":"I was thoroughly dissapointed. This book failed to keep me engaged. The last book I read was Prey and was equally dissapointing but was slightly better than OP. I hope soon Ms Howard will dish out a mind blowing thriller romance as she had done in the past...this one really didn't possess her usual signature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Romantic Suspense","review":"This was a great read. The love scenes were really steamy!! It will get your blood pumping!! I love Linda Howard and if you do too you should read this book!!! The characters were superb!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good news: Fast read Bad News: Boring","review":"After this story, I will take Linda Howard off my \\"read\\" list. This was truly a ridiculous story. Ugly ducking at age 34 turns into swan and falls in love. And along the way, there is a supposedly a mystery going on. Mr Perfect was quite good. Too bad this wasn't also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go, Daisy!","review":"I have been a fan of Linda Howard for a long time, even way back during her Silhouette novel years. Open Season is one of the funniest. I highly recommend all her novels. Suspenseful and very romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Linda Howard Read","review":"*Stands and applaudes* Excellent book by Linda Howard. She brings together steamy romance and mystery once again in this funny book. Daisy is a caracter than most women about 30 can relate to. Her transformation, although awkward also gives cause for laughter. It also brings to light a real problem we are facing in this country; date-rape drugs and smuggling of young women into the country to be sold. This book is an excellent read, and I had a hard time putting it down; it ranks right up there with \\"To Die For\\". Way to go Linda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blecccchhh!","review":"Had the time period for this book taken place in the early 1900's, Daisy's naivete and goody two shoes demeanor could possibly be forgiven but since it was current all I could do was roll my eyes. I could not force myself to go beyond 80 pages before I threw it against the wall...pure drivel. At times the dialog was so corny and silly I squirmed. This was my first Linda Howard book and my last. I am truly amazed that someone actually published this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself Some Money!","review":"I have read almost all of Linda Howard's books and have found them to be quite enjoyable--with the exception of this one! The book jacket implies that there is a great mystery and romance in the book--you get no mystery and a mediocre romance. You know who did what after the first chapter. Take my advice and avoid this book!!! If you choose to ignore my advice wait until the book comes out in paperback and save the money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I'm a fan of Linda Howard, and I loved Mr. Perfect and After the Night. After reading the summary for this book, I expected it to be good, but I found the story slow and the main character boring. I read most of it but stopped 3/4 of the way through it because I just couldn't take it anymore. This is one of the two books by her that I didn't like...everything else is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"i really enjoy linda howard i find her books to be witty and entertaining. so when i ordered this book i thought it would be no different, boy was i wrong. there just was not that same passion,and danger. in linda howard books you usually find a mix of love and escalating danger. but in this book a lot of the story was left out. i wont give anything awayso if you decide to read it you can make up your mind, but you can find better books by Mrs. Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"OPEN SEASON","review":"AN AVID FAN OF LINDA HOWARD, HER PREVIOUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN 4 AND 5 STAR BOOKS.

In any case, I still don't have the book and I did track it. There's confimation that it was received by post office on Oct 8, 2005. I have retrieved my mail a few times since than and still no book.

Ms.Howard is a rare talent, I will buy anything with her name on it!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this story!","review":"I was expecting, like other readers, more suspense, violence, gorry details. What I got was a good love story with a slight detective angle to it. I put this book on the list of one of my favorites because I like to see relationships grow, know more of the characters and less blow by blow violence. Daisy and Jack are good together, as are all of the secondary players in the book. Sleepy little town, nothing changes, then the main characters take over and wham! A very good read and I recommend to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I can't believe this is the same author who wrote \\"Son of the Morning\\", Kill and Tell\\" and \\"Heart of Fire\\". I wish she had spent less time with the make-up tips and gone more deeply into some of the other charcters (especially Todd, Sykes and Jennifer). Do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly a waste of time!","review":"This story is a very typical \\"makeover and get the guy\\" romance. The characters I could have really cared less about and the author spends more time talking about shopping sprees and interior decorating than she does on who these people really are. I was expecting more from Howard, but didn't get it. I recommend this book if you have nothing else left on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks..","review":"Despite a few moments that were honest-to-god funny or entertaining, overall the suspense aspect of the plot was horribly lame. Not to mention I hate the plot line of makeover makes an otherwise spinster into a beautiful, confident woman.. please spare, me! Like i've said with other books by Linda Howard, this seems to be nowhere in the league of her better books. I will give her that the book has some good parts, but overall I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Songs kids wouldn't even know or have fun singing along with. Brought it on a road trip, wasted space. Wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea","review":"This was a great idea and I bought it for a road trip with the kids last summer. We enjoyed parts of it. But most of it, unless you know every single song by heart, is hard to follow. It would be nice to have the singers singing back up through more of the songs, or at least have better intrances cues. I am fairly comfortable with music and singing with my kids, but I have never learned 'Cielita Linda' well enough to sing it with only the words.All in all, not worth the money for me, though my kids do love the drum solo song where all they have to do is bang on stuff to a cool beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book left me more confused than when I started.

It is still fresh and remains one of my favorite cds of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This book covers the basics of herding. It presents the concepts clearly and provides some good trouble shooting sections. The diagrams could be improved and I could do without the cartoons. They were very hard to understand. The author obviously knows herding dogs and conveys very well what it takes to make a good \\"working\\" dog. I would recommend this book for anyone who is beginning to work a herding dog or who is considering purchasing a Border collie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most comprehensive, easiest to understand training book","review":"An excellent job of detailing often complicated and difficult scenarios encountered when training.

It includes how to train dogs with different personalities which is very helpful. It focuses on the Border Collie which is the ultimate herding dog and take to herding more naturally than probably any other dog. It may take longer to teach another breed of dog which has instinct but if you work at it you will end up with a dog that herds. It is very good at explaining why you do certain things which helps you understand your own dog which is important in training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple working dog instructions","review":"After having had this book recommended to me by a family member, it has turned out to be every bit as good as i was told.

It was provacative, and scary, but not in a bad way. It was an alagory, which is why, if you don't understand the alagory, was boring to some people. I would reccomend that children under the age of 10 should NOT read this book without parental guidence. The only problems I had with the book were (a The ending was awful . . .it left you hanging . . and (b release . . . . the reason you should have a mentor preveiw it, or read it with you.

His show spotlighted her early work, beginning with her CD \\"Peppermint.\\" Coppe's sounds reminded me of a cross between Bjork and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Bristol trip-hop meets Tokyo techno. At least that was my first impression. Coppe mixes many electronic styles from the most fragmented Mouse On Mars blips and squeaks, to dreamy Sakamoto-like ballads. Sort of like Yoko Ono after two martinis. The adventurous will find many musical variations on her latest, \\"Papa My Buddha.\\" The outstanding track of the album being the sensuous yet playful \\"Blue.\\" This one sounded great on the radio and continues to sound tasty on my cd machine. Coppe has cool sounds and cool friends too (like Kris Weston from The Orb). Any of her three discs, \\"Peppermint,\\" \\"Mercury,\\" or \\"Papa My Buddha,\\" is a good place to discover the unique musical world of Coppe."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what shows in the picture!!!!","review":"Great quality part, but it wasn't what I needed.

Fortunately, this book did leave out for the most part, the I love Faith, I love Faith syndrome that Tim has been going through over the past. The book is a nice have if you want it just to have it, if you're looking for a good read on country music, try one of the older books on Waylon, Willie, Merle, or anyone that has actually had something to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it come with crayons??","review":"I couldn't help it, when I heard Tim McGraw had a book published I had to laugh, and laugh hard. Yes ol' Timmy's doing pretty good for himself. His CMT sheep will buy whatever they are lead to. Tim doesn't write songs or play an instrument, so I doubt he had anything to do with this book. Much like Gene Simmons, he'll sell himself out with whatever junk producers decide to put his face on. He'll sit back and laugh at how a talentless man became a celebrity in America. Only in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Family Man","review":"I bought this book as a present to myself. I knew that it would be interesting. I just didn't know how interesting. What a great man. He takes care of what is important to him... his family and his closest friends. He is honest and doesn't care what anyone else thinks or what everyone else is doing. He is his own man. The stories were funny and real! Not like most super stars. Tim is very real. and I think that is why he wrote this book.

We, too, have a volunteer fire department and a chief of police who had a day job. Many of the people in this book are known to you if you ever have lived in such a place.

The only subtitles are in French. Lovely movie nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Ain't Hogwarts","review":"Alas, poor Rupert Everett: he's so hopelessly good-looking that he makes people forget he's actually a fine actor. In this British boarding school drama, he gets to ponder the meaning of his privileged life. In the secret world of school prefects and gods, everyone dallies in same-sex relationships, yet assumes they'll go on to respectable marriages. Not Guy Bennett (Everett), though - he's hopelessly in love with a recently-graduated former classmate. He risks his future for his ideals of sexual equality, but finds some measure of acceptance from his ardently Communist best friend, Tommy Judd (played by a young Colin Firth). (It raises an interesting question: are Communists born that way?) The acting is good, and I applaud the movie's message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Country","review":"Another Country, while very entertaining, lacks the necessary elements of a really good plot. Most of the men in the movie are beautiful and that makes it difficult to know which ones were involved in homosexual activity and which ones were not.Rupert Everett was very young during the making of this film and to be honest his Oscar Wilde films (The Important of Being Ernest and An Ideal Husband) are far superior to this one.Gay people can oooh and aaah over the pretty boys; but there's never any actual homosexual activity--not even kissing that would make this move more enticing to watch.Colin Firth has gone on to do wonderful films. This role was a little weird in that he had what I call a speech impediment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Country, Another Movie","review":"I was bored to tears!!!

(Instead of the bizarre things the BBC does to continental ops.) And it started great-I finally settled into the rhythm of the the subtitles-very fast-and got into the characters. Lovely-and then the subtitles disappeared for whole stretches. I returned the product sadly. Please better production values!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detective Montalbano","review":"If you don't mind sub-titles, then this TV series is very enjoyable. Montalbano is a detective you'd want in real life. Some humour, doesn't like to be given the runaround, and is very simpatico with victims. Luca Zingaretti is perfect as the detective as is the rest of the cast in depicting modern Sicily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zingaretti and Camilleri are stars","review":"Between them they have produced a thing of beauty.

Have begun reading the books too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Montalbano is better on DVD","review":"At first the sub-titles were a little disconcerting but I got used to it quickly. The settings and the plot are excellent and the actors are a joy to watch. I had only previously read \\"The Shape of Water\\" (the third DVD in this first series) and I found the DVD followed the plot of the book with the added joy of watching a setting I have never visited. The detective novel \\"The Shape of Water\\" seemed very \\"wordy\\" to me while the DVD sub titles went to the heart of the matter. Again watching the supporting actors (like the \\"wronged\\" wife in DVD #2) was also real pleasure. The sub-plot involving Livia ties the separate plots together and gives a real humanity to the Detective that other detective plots often lack. Anyway, this is not Ho-Hum viewing. If you are up for an adventure, go for this Detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commisario Montalbano","review":"Just occasionally you find a TV series which faithfully reflects the books you enjoy and so it is with this DVD. The Italian production reproduces the books very well and, even better, the casting is credible. Also unlike some other adaptations the subordinate characters are not reduced to monosyllables. Of course it's been subtitled but it works. I enjoyed the ones I've watched so far and will buy some more sets.Detective Montalbano: Episodes 1-3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one star away from perfect!","review":"I've read all the books with much pleasure. These films are a faithful representation. I found the production values very good. The actors are well cast, in my opinion, and the stories are engaging, funny, sad, and mysterious.

It drives me nuts. But, He loves it- and that is all that matters. - also important to note that this isn't a purchase for Chicago breezes.

If you are new to Buffett you'll get the best assortment of old and new and an idea of what the concerts are like. I have been listening to his music since I was 14 and this is another one of his records I keep in heavy rotation in my CD and MP3 players. His remake of the the classic rock hit Southern Cross is the best I have ever heard. He adds his own escapism attitude and tropical sound to a song that is an anthom in the south. This is an enhanced CD.. There is a 20 minute Quicktime video file where Savanah Jane (Jimmy's daughter, parotheads should know this) takes you backstage to show you what behind the scenes concert life is like. If your a phan of Jimmy's older music..check out American Storyteller.... See you at the next concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Brings Back Awesome Memories","review":"Jimmy always plays his last show in West Palm Beach -- so we were treated to the last show of the Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday tour for Beachhouse on the Moon. This concert was *SO MUCH DAMNED FUN* -- listening to this cd puts you right back in the mood of the party! Oh, and parts of this cd were recorded in Orlando, too, not just Wisconsin -- so you'll hear mention of the space coast and whatnot. It's got a good sampling of the songs he plays live, enough to whet your appetite for the next tour! Or at least tide you over while you're on the beach sipping coronas or drinking margarittas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Older, more comfortable leader of the Phlock","review":"Finally, Southern cross on a CD, more then enough of a reason to buy this one. Disregard the hype, the lost verse to 'Margaritaville' is on the 70's live 'You shoulda been there' dbl CD. 'Pencil Thin Mustache' is a comfortable nostalgic romp, while 'Tryin to reason ...' is an off pace revisit of this classic, that comes across as more contemplative then ever. Well after all, the Chief ParrotHead is 52. I have most of Jimmy's CDs and this one has become a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MUSIC ON THIS ONE, BUT THE ENHANCED VIDEO IS...","review":"This CD contains good Buffett music. I especially thought that \\"Southern Cross\\" was a great addition to the album. I have no problem with the music. It was classic Buffett, with some new songs(Southern Cross and Brown Eyed Girl) thrown in as a bonus. HOWEVER, I did have a problem watching the enhanced video that is on this CD. It was hard to pull up, and then was not of good quality. It is hosted by Savannah Jane Buffett, which is interesting, but the picture quality was not great. Maybe this was just a problem with my copy of the tape. The music on this one was good. I just wish I could have seen Savannah Jane a little better. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"TUESDAYS-THURSDAYS-SATURDAYS","review":"What can I say? Jimmy Buffett had done it again. Tuesdays- Thursdays- Saturdays is Jimmy's first release from his new home at Mailboat Records. This new live album has many of his popular parrothead party hits, such as Margaritaville, Come Monday, Cheeseburger in Paradise, and Son of a Son of a Sailor. It also has many hits that only true fans would know like Tin Cup Chalice, Tryin to Reason with Hurrican Season, and Love and Luck. This album covers all of the basis with a never released Jimmy Buffett track called Southern Cross, originally recorded and written by Crosby, Stills, and Nash. This album is definitely for anyone who needs an escape and for any Jimmy Buffett fan around."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is pure fun in a box!","review":"This CD is great because it puts many of my favorites in a new grouping.

It's a craving I can't control, even If I tried. However, I'm very disappointed in this record for the fact that it is like all of his other live recordings. He used the same songs again and again. His live recordings of Come Monday, Pencil Thin Mustashe, and the like are vertually identical to the other recordings. How many versions of the live songs do you want me to own? Jimmy, please, I beg of you, produce an \\"unpluged\\" CD of your old music. This would truly make all things right with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Buffett will always be Jimmy Buffett","review":"I suppose it is because I am 56 years old and can identify so well with this man's journey is the reason I like this CD so much. A Jimmy Buffett concert always says to me there are new places to explore but don't forget what got you here. I have heard this CD and as soon as I am finished with this review I am placing an order. The only change I would suggest is I wish he had included A Pirate Looks at Forty (50?).I read a review earlier that suggested Mr. Buffett record a CD live & unplugged of all of his old stuff and in a somewhat mellow but upbeat style. Make sense to anyone? It does to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buffet","review":"This album was classic Buffet at his best! It is live so the songs all have a different feel from the studio versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parrotheads will love this.","review":"This excellent live album from 1999 will please Buffet fans.The collection wisely mixes classics like \\"Cheesebuger in Paradise\\", \\"Volcano\\", \\"Fins\\" and \\"One Particular Harbor\\" with lesser known songs such as \\"Pencil Thin Mustache\\" and \\"Trying to Reason with the Hurricane Season\\". You truly get the feel of the excitement and variety of a Jimmy Buffett live show.Not to mention the variety of his vast catalog of songs.The album also includes a full-lenghth version of \\"Margaritaville\\" with the infamous \\"lost verse\\" left intact (It had been cut to make the original single shorter). \\"Southern Cross\\" by Crosby, Stills and Nash receives a nice cover. So does Van Morrison's \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\", which Buffett has been doing for years. All in all, this is a live album that's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor vocals and song selection","review":"There are a few highlights on Tu, Th, and Sat. Tin Cup Chalice, Cocunut Telegraph, and Fins. As others have said before, the song selection is very similar to Feeding Frenzy. Where's Changes in Latitudes (Changes in Latitudes)? What about putting Havana Daydreaming and Manana in there? Why must Volcano be on there?The vocals are pretty painful on some songs. Particularly Southern Cross, which I don't like the version on there. I could also do without Brown Eyed Girl. Tryin' To Reason With Hurricane Season is too slow.I like some other people's ideas of doing box set live album with the hits, obscure old stuff, and an acoustic set. That would've been great. If you want live Buffett, opt for Feeding Frenzy. Versions and vocals are better on there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffitt Live:...","review":"Comon Jim. If you've burned out, take that cruise, compose, and give us another \\" Bannana Wind\\". This CD is nothing but a rehash of old songs that we already have. You're marketing people are hurting you. I'll save my $15 on this one. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy \\"McBuffett\\"","review":"Do we really need this? As an Australian, where the \\"new\\" album retails for $29.95 and where Buffett has not deemed worth touring since 1987 it is hard to see any value in this release at all. If you own any of his previous live albums, save your money. Sub standard vocals, re-re-hashed content and all would be forgiven except that he murders one of the great sailing songs, \\"Southern Cross\\". It sure is disappointing condsidering the quality of \\"Beach House On The Moon\\". \\"Feeding Frenzy\\" would be a much better album for those who need to have a live Buffett album or better still, any of his studio efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parrothead Paradise","review":"Buffet is not just an author, sailor, or musician--he's a way of life. Put on your khakis, flower emblazoned shirt, rev up that blender, grab your bottle of Tequila, put \\"Buffet Live -- Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays\\" on your system and chill.Being there live puts you right into the audience. Swaying and smiling and singing right a long. If you cannot catch him in concert for these memorable tracks--try one of his restaurants! The \\"margarita lava volcano\\" is unreal. A great addition to *best of* collections. Hand me that cheeseburger please!I appreciate your interest & comments--CDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is one of the most awesome albums in my collections! I finally get to hear Southern Cross whenever I want! This is definitely an album you MUST BUY! Thanks Jimmy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like being there","review":"This CD is exactly what every Parot Head needs. Listening to the live songs brings you back to his outdoor summer concerts. Anyone who has ever seen Jimmy Buffet in concert can feel like they are back there for a short time. Anyone who hasn't been to a concert can pretend they are. The only down side to this CD is that it's too short. It would have been good to hear some of the older songs that he plays live. But it's a great way to get you through til next summer when we can do it all again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and energetic, great live album","review":"Jimmy gives us 15 classic hits and a few covers. His version of Southern Cross and Brown Eyed Girl are very well done. The CD makes me feel like I was back in Chicago at my first Buffett concert.

It's a neat bag, but I think that's going a bit overboard. The bag is relatively good looking, though a bit geeky in my opinion. It is extremely functional though. Very well thought construction, and easily stores my DSLR, point-and-shoot, and video camera, along with all the necessary cables. The laptop slot is also handy, though it fits at MAX a 12\\" laptop. Don't think you're going to shoe-horn your 15\\" macbook (much less a 17\\") in there.I don't use it as my primary laptop bag - I have a nice Tumi for that.

Otherwise-a fantastic pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits my back perfectly","review":"I purchased this Kata Bag after reading reviews here on Amazon and I love it. I was a little concerned about whether the material would be too hot on my back, but I used it on a two-hour hike in the Blue Ridge Mountains with no problem. Fits my back perfectly and makes my camera gear easy to carry, even when using hiking poles.I carried my Nikon D80 with 18-200mm lens attached, along with an extra wide-angle lens. My HP 14-inch widescreen laptop fits in the computer pocket.My only (small) complaint is that the webbing on the shoulder pads is a little rough, but only when putting the pack on or taking it off. On the shoulders it sits well and feels great. The straps are very easy to cinch up, and the size is roomy enough for gear without being too bulky to carry on a plane.

Very light-weight, comfortable (despite no waist-band) and ergonomic. However, it is not built to last. Within a year, of frequent (but not unduly heavy) use, the fabric ripped all around the upper zips, rendering it useless. I've used Lowepro for years before this and nearly all the bags are still going strong - entirely different quality construction (though even one of the zips has gone on the cheaper one of these).On another note, having pictures of recommended contents (laptop, camera, phone, ipad etc.) on the outside may look funky and fun, but it also acts as a red-light to muggers and thieves (I live in Nairobi, Kenya - I know).Don't buy if longevity is a requirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking to buy a used Kata Ergo Tech Series sensitivity V personal Gear Backpack","review":"Hey All!

Perhaps their European roots leave them ill equipped to understand the real roots of American music, and especially the blues.Friends of Jimi Hendrix have said that before his death he had talked about playing with Miles, moving more toward jazz. Jazz appeared early in the Experience recordings, in the Mose Allison influenced \\"Up From the Stars,\\" and other songs. Jean-Paul Bourelly did play with Miles, and I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that he understood Jimi's vectors exceptionally well.This is a superb album by a gifted player. It's also an honest tribute, in the artist's own voice, to one of the forces that helped shape it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and ambitious","review":"I have never heard anyone try to reproduce the music of Jimi Hendrix so authentically. Most people just resign themselves to the fact that he was a one off and it should be left that way. Jean-Paul Bourelly has very ambitiously undertaken to produce a sound so authentically Hendrix that he almost pulls it off. Particularly ambitious in this case is Star Spangled Banner. This is the best reproduction of the now legendary take on the American National Anthem from Woodstock that I have heard yet. All the tracks on this recording have something to offer and it comes highly recommended from me and all my friends who have heard it here in Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hear My Brain a Cr -u - umblin'","review":"Jean Paul is a very fine guitarist but he should never have released this. From some place too close to the Planet Jazzrock, JP has bravely, (i.e avoiding Experience material in the main), set off towards Jimi's blues planet and quite simply overshot. He has missed the point, (not lost the plot, just never found it), and failed badly and sadly to sense what he should have been seeking and would not have needed to seek had he, perhaps innately, understood the blues origins of Jimi's music.

For example, don't say \\"Thank you\\" to Indians after they serve you a meal... It's a form of repayment, almost an insult and doesn't build relationship. Rather, invite your host for the same hospitality. That's how you build business relationships!! Also, Brazilians tend to be more analytical than their Latin American counterparts!

Very useful for someone traveling to a new country for the first time. Or so I thought, until I read the portion on India. While most observations seem OK, the naming convention of Indian Muslims caught my attention. While most Muslim names used in India are derived from Arabic, I haven't seen anyone named or using 'bin' or 'binti' as in the Arab world. So my 2 cents - read it, but do check the facts before you tout about your cultural knowledge in a client meeting.

Well, at least I got a concise one.I've been in some 20 countries and for most of them, the suggestions of this book would range from useless to misleading. Data about religion, for instance, seem to have been collected from old books, when the Latin America people could be classified as 97% Catholic.Suggestions about dressing is also outated, with recommendations like 3-piece suites.The greetings are also outdated: despite not being American, I know that currently, in USA, women (especially the 30-something and under) use to kiss each other in informal occasions, but this is not even mentioned.And, as a Brazilian, I became marvelled to know that some people in Brazil speak \\"various Amerindian languages\\".

There is a strong political filter that runs throughout the text that taints what could be a great reference for those of us with heavy-use passports. There are also descriptions of ethnic groups which can only help in propagating damaging stereotypes that are simply not the norm that one encounters in these countries. My advice - save your money for the trip! Learn the basic social taboos and a few key phrases from the Web or other sources before you go. Then, keep an open mind, learn from the people you encounter, and enjoy the adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could not finish it","review":"The first two books in the series were good. What I noticed about this, one is that Phillip's character has changed dramatically. To the point where I don't recognize him anymore. The scenes of intimate nature in the previous books in the series were not very detailed which I prefer. In this one, however, he not only goes into detail but most of the encounters he spends pages on are horrible! I have never read so many rape scenes in my life!! (one is too many) one of these victims is only 10, the poor girl. It seems to ramble through the early 1800s with no real point in mind. There are places he will stop at and jump forward in time then flashback to where we just left off. I like to read to end my stressful day and go to sleep. This book near the end has done neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"weakest of the Kent family chronicles, thus far.","review":"this book does not seem to contain the excitement of it's predecessors, the Bastard and the Rebels.

I am torn as to whether to dump this seies or continue to the fourth book. THe family represented is interesting but such hard work to get through it. I read this series when it was first published and thought it was great literature. Therefore I was looking forward to rereading it.

Inspired by Ben Franklin's 13 virtues for positive living, Andrea expands and redefines those virtues and calls them 'qualities,' then offers a weekly format for developing those qualities within one's self. She also illustrates with personal glimpses how she acquired the qualities which improved her own life. Sharing our stories allows others to relate and feel less alone, and structuring ourselves to meet a daily task commands committment. Some of us need that structure, and this book affords the opportunity with a coach in the background who has lived the experiences herself.Isa \\"Kitty\\" Mady, writer/artist"},{"rating":"1","title":"52 anecdotes, not exactly life-changing...","review":"This book takes Benjamin Franklin's \\"13 Virtues improvement plan\\" and expands it into 52 \\"qualities\\". Each quality (honesty, sense of humor, grateful, etc) has its own chapter in which the quality is (pedantically) defined, a short anecdote about the author's life that relates to the quality, and then the \\"lesson\\". The lesson consists of 1. \\"Ask to be.. (insert quality here), 2. Affirm your desire to be..., 3. Act as if you're..., 4. List or celebrate... so on and so forth, ad nauseum (52 times).A few of the anecdotes are amusing, but this book is a failure as a self-help volume, more of a disjointed autobiography than anything else.

You cannot have one Subspecies movie without the others; they are all connected like one big long movie. The VHS versions of Subspecies 1-3 are even out-of-print, so there is no way to get the entire series anymore! This is terrible for fans just getting into the series and as a result they are forced to purchase bootlegged copies.

This installment,however, was so hard to get through! The challenge was not to put the book down (as in \\"A Warmth in Winter\\") but rather to keep picking it up!! So much whining and insecurity from all sides of the story lines. Pages and pages of the same stuff. Heavenly Daze books usually focus on a few islanders in each book and that has worked in the past, but not this time. Bobby and his pet were just obnoxious, Dana's and Mike's kiss and make-up was shallow, Annie's tomato project was lightly written off and the Cleta-Barbara thing was totally overdone although it was given the most acceptable resolution.

Nice also to be able to weigh in a multitude of measurements such as grams, kilograms, ounces, pounds etc. The USPS scale is only pounds and ounces.

When you start to make a custom bag by sealing one end, it often does not seal the first time. When you add your items and begin to seal, you may find yourself standing over the machine for what feels like eternity trying to push hard enough for the seal to form. I have found that after using my machine, my wrists hurt from pushing down so hard to try to get a seal, and often, the seal is not complete and all of the air rushes back in. In addition, if there is any kind of liquid in the bag when the air is being sucked out, the liquid comes out with the air and pools inside the machine. This automatically shuts the sealer off and not only do you have to start all over again, but you also have a huge mess on your hands. When it works, it keeps meats fresh for months in the freezer.

This episode is both hilarous and touching, as Holmes shows a side of himself very rarely seen. Though Holmes and Watson are brilliantly played, the superb acting of the supporting characters makes this one stand out: the character of Mr. Henry Baker as a down-on-his-luck, aging intellectual is given with inspiring dignity, and the poultry merchant at Covent Garden steals his hilarious scene with his inexplicable hostility toward inquiries about his precious geese.

I almost didn't want to finish it but I had to see if it would get better, it didn't. Do not waste your time with this movie. There were no powerful or memorable songs or parts and there was no plot. I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. It was just dumb. Beyonce was all right as Carmen, she has a beautiful voice but that's all that kept this movie going.

For crying out loud, I can come home from work at the wrong moment if I want to listen to kids yelling at each other. Yeah, they used some awful words too; but they were unlikeable characters for the most part because of their endless banter.The movie had an endless potential for good adventure: an entire universe. Yet, the story revolves around their little house the entire time, and the perils repeat themselves rather than introducing something unique.Don't see it thinking that it in some way relates to Jumanji, like it did in the book either.

It's like a \\"What if Jumanji was in Space?\\". The action is clear and impressive. The best part is probably where the robot goes psycho and seeks the boy that spun him. That or when the Zorgon invade the house. The movie has some neat twists and turns. I remember when everyone in the theater gasped(literally) when the younger brother swears at the beginning. Yeah.

It's one even our 3 year old son will watch all the way through as well as our 8 year old daughter. It is a simple storyline children can follow but with lots of action and adventure - space, robots and flesh eating Zorgons who are about on the scary level as Dr Who villians. There is a very human element with siblings who fight like cat and dog in real life but pull together to survive through the Zathura board game experience. The older sister and the handsome astronaut give it a greater interest to younger teenagers too. My children find this more entertaining than Jumanji and it has just the right amount of suspense and mild terror to keep them hooked. The actors are great, the plot is very entertaining and the setting is fantastic. My children must have watched it at least 20 times and they still laugh when the bicycle falls out of the sky at the end. Well worth purchasing at less than 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great FX makes for a fun movie","review":"When \\"Zathura\\" was released, I was head projectionist at Wichita's Warren Theatre and I recall being impressed with the visuals but I never got to see the whole movie. (A projectionists work is never done) So I was glad to get the BluRay for not a lot of money. For the \\"family sci-fi crowd\\" this is a very entertaining film and is was fun the see \\"Twilight girl\\" Christen Stewart in an early role, not to mention Dax Shephard from TV's \\"Parenthood.\\" The real star of this movie, though are the special effects. absolutely breathtaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarity and Profanity ruin a potentially good family movie","review":"Once again Hollywood has chosen to ruin a potentially good family/childrens movie by including foul vulgar language. How some can label this as a good family movie is beyond me. I have higher standards and values for my family I guess. Yes this is suppose to be a Jumanji sequel but unfortunately Zathura was made in todays society where the norms of lewd vulgar and profanity are being accepted as healthy family values. This society is sicko."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimaginative","review":"Saw this on televisian. There really was nothing better to do at the time.Special effects are unimaginative. Settings nice.

It's not as BAD as Jumanji, the special effects are much better in this one (not saying much), and it's not as ANNOYING either, thanks to the absence of Robin Williams hogging all the screen time and stepping on everyone else's lines... but if you've sat and suffered thru THAT mess, there's no need to sit and suffer through this, it's the same setup, the same plot (now set in outer space instead of a jungle), and the same ending. Why was this even made?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservatives Beware","review":"I do not approve of the language used in this PG movie. One of the most helpful reviewers mentions that the language is language her children hear at home anyway.

As for myself, the third reason is the most important. This version is the best I've seen for accompanying analysis. It has a number of essays and an interview by Arthur Miller himself and reviews of the play by others. The works written by Miler were of the most interest to me, but there is plenty here. Admittedly, if price is most important to you, there are cheaper versions out there, but you won't get what this version offers. To me, though, this version is worth the money.And do I need to mention this is a damn good play? But, as I said, you'll get the same play regardless of which version you pick up (at least, I would hope...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pippi Longstocking","review":"Very disappointed.

I've had the original release of this on tape for years. I LOVE it for the second track (Om), a constant \\"drone\\" with voices, that is the perfect vehicle for putting one in that \\"nothingness\\" state.The let down here is that on the original version, the Om track runs over 40 minutes (of uninterrupted bliss), whereas the CD has a 17 minute version! I don't know what possessed the record company or the artist to change the original format, but I would like to have seen an indication of this on the Amazon listing details.So, I don't know who to point the finger at here; Amazon for lack of detail or the revised CD format, but I'm really disappointed.Be Well"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Healing Music","review":"This CD is simply one of the best healing music available.

I used to get an illegal disc error whenever I popped in any non-Verbatim disc.Many Japanese firms are have extensive hand in glove arrangements and try to work out deals between themselves to fleece the customers. This doesn't mean Memorex or TDK is worse than Verbatim.The official NEC site offers an upgrade to the burner's firmware. After this simple firmware upgrade, Ritek media (which is what Memorex uses) works like a charm. NEC supports both 4x and 2.4x. I suggest using only 2.4x which is what Memorex (and Ritek) is rated for.For DL recording, I strongly suggest that you change the booktype in the firmware to DVD-ROM.

And the mouth piece did not come close to aligning properly - it rested around my chin. Returned it the next day for a full refund, then bought a different one at a local Kohls.

Low cost = lower functionality","review":"It is certainly warm enough although the mesh opening around the mouth allows a fair amount of wind chill to the lips. The down vent over the nose is not formed so it allows the escaping breath to rise and fog glasses/goggles. The velcro closure is bunched and is somewhat difficult to align and seal. It is fairly tight, if you have a large head like me, and that also makes it a little difficult to adjust. It took weeks for me to gt this item as it did not ship on the date promised from the manufacturer. If you are looking for high functionality and to get a balaclava in a hurry you should look at one of the more expensive options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and overpriced","review":"A polemical diatribe that simply tries too hard. Considered purely as a novel, possibly in the thriller genre, it is poorly done. The characterisation is pathetic. Just cardboard. The dialog is utterly repetitive. The two secondary heroes are just sounding boards to the main character. Sherlock Holmes' Watson was hollow, but still light years ahead of these secondary characters.Then there is the plot itself. All too reminiscent of the Y2K scare. Remember that? Planes falling out of the sky. Pacemakers freezing up. Utility companies' generators stopping. Just like Ed Yourdon and others peddled Y2K in the late 90s, this book has the same feel. Hysteria combined with an opportunistic grab at the topical problem of terrorism.Purely as a $8 paperback novel, it is lacking. But as a $35 book?? Strewth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written","review":"This book is a slog to get through. It's an exploration of the world of whitehat and blackhat hackers, the FBI, and well, I really couldn't get through it because the writing wasn't very good.

Obviously I'm in the minority here but I found of the selected works to be dated, overly long, and dull. The ending of at least one story (That Only A Mother) made no sense at all. There are of course some exceptions, like Bradbury's Mars Is Heaven. A no-brainer for any collection. And a little tale called It's A Good Life will give you the chills.

It provided plenty of entertainment for the dogs for about an hour, and now it's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not last","review":"literally did not last within the few hours i gave it to my 4 month old puppy. I have had the AKC fox in the past and that lasted about 2 months, however this goose was cooked from the beginning!I would love to find how to write a review to the company itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"for my Lab","review":"My Lab loves this toy,its her baby. We've tried getting different kinds of squirrels but she won't play with them. We've gone through many of these because she likes to play tug of war with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small toy -- not recommended for medium or bigger dogs","review":"I wish the description had specified the size of this toy -- for $7.99, I got a toy that measures approximately 5 inches -- far too small for my 45-pound dog to play with. If you are used to buying the larger, more standard sized AKC Outdoor Series dog toys, please note that this specific item is the small size. I've never returned anything to Amazon before, but I might return this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loved it","review":"My Jack Russell goes through toys in minutes. She had holes in this one pretty quickly but its still around in her toy bin. She loves going after birds...she can get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected...","review":"Life-like dog toy. My Lab and Golden carry it around and it has only had one \\"surgical-sew-up\\" procedure since it arrived. It has been machine washed many times and has not fallen apart. The squeaker no longer works all the time - it got worn out. Caution - would not leave any squeaker toy like this with my pets if they were unsupervised as it could be torn out and swallowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest Little Fox","review":"I bought the Fox for my 9 lb mini schnauzer puppy. It is so cute. It's like a miniature baby fox and my puppy loves it. It's made so well and so nice, it looks better in person than the picture. I would like one for myself. I think a big dog would eat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dog toy","review":"My little dog loves her squirrel. Plays with it all the time. Chews away to make it squeak. It is her favorite toy.Great buy, good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy - Dog Loves It","review":"My boxer-pointer mix loves this squirrel. Somehow we have kept him from destroying it though the tail is easily and quickly \\"de-furred\\". I kept finding tufts of squirrel tail all over the house. Once we got that under control, toy has held up nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, A Squirrel She Can Catch!","review":"I bought this for our highly energetic Australian Shepperd. She took to the toy almost immediately and now knows it by name (\\"go get the squirrel\\"). The toy is well constructed and it took her a whole month before she got the squirrel guts all over the living room. It was not diffiult to clean up and the toy is just as good with out stuffing. There are 2 squeekers - one in the body and one in the tail. I thought the squeeking would be irritating, but it seems to stimulate her and its actually funny. I would buy another one or one of the other animals they make."},{"rating":"1","title":"morte the squirrel","review":"First, his little nose went, then his paws. Now his head is hanging off. My keeshond puppy insists she did not do this, but no one else in the family tends to attack squirrels, so I doubt her story. Rest in pieces, little squirrel-you had a full life in your three days at our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart in less than 30 seconds","review":"This is not a dog toy, this should be sold as a stuffed animal to put on a shelf. In less than 30 seconds my dogs had all the stuffing out of this toy and the tail was ripped from the body. I don't know what they sewed the seams with but it needed to be reinforced. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"chipmunk","review":"This is another one of the AKC toys that I bought for my dog (does this stand for THE American Kennel Club and do they recommend these toys???)If they do, they should not. All but one of these brand of toys quit (the noise makers) within a few minutes after giving to my dogs. My dogs love the squeakers and do not want them after they quit working. The only one that held up in this brand was the raccoon. We have several toys of a different brand that have worked well for years - even after washing them - the squeakers still work!Bob"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maggie & Moxie","review":"For my ferocious terrier who loves to tear her toys and devour the throbbing heart which is their squeakers, the akc squirrel and sheep are longest lived. I hope Amazon will continue to carry these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up","review":"One would like to think that if the AKC would allow their name and \\"brand\\" to be associated with a product, they would make sure the product would hold up. My dog had the squeaker out of this toy in 20 minutes, the stuffing followed that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that this toy is best for a medium-sized dog. The goose is a little plump so it's harder for a smaller dog to squeak it. I have a medium-sized dog and his specialty is ripping the squeaker and stuffing out of toys. I continue to purchase the AKC toys because they are more realistic looking (rather than crazy, brightly colored toys). If you're dog is a \\"killer\\" these AKC toys are very easy to tear apart, but luckily they're cute and fairly cheap so I don't mind. If your dog is the opposite and never tears squeakers out then this toy is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs Like Them, But a Hairy Situation","review":"My dogs stood up on their feet for 2 minutes straight while I was taking the backing off both the SMALL and LARGE sizes of these squirrels that I got them. They loved them at first sight. They continued to love them. However, there is some of the tail hair coming off and I find wet blobs of tail hair near the dogs and toys. So I am a bit concerned about that and the thought that they could swallow some of that material and it could be bad for the dogs. So I watch them more carefully as they play with the toy. I am considering washing them in the washing machine a few times just to get all the lose hair off and hope for the best that I do not totally ruin it. Very inexpensive online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Toy; Well Made","review":"I like this toy almost as much as the AKC Mallard. This little guy is really sturdy; my labs love to compete for this toys and it often ends up being the object of a tug-o-war contest. It's surprisingly life like too. It's a favorite around our house; I will purchase this one again when the time comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Chippy lasted two days....not a toy for dogs who like to chew.","review":"I purchased this chipmunk for my 7 month old Beagle puppy. She's about 15 pounds - not very big at all. She destroyed the toy within 2 days. My puppy opened a seam on the chipmunk, pulled out all the stuffing and turned the toy inside out. I was very disappointed with the product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"Purchased this toy for our small 6 pound Yorkie. Within 15 minutes of play, the stuffing was coming out of the beak and the seam had completely opened on the underside.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than Expected - not very durable.","review":"This toy is quite small and is not very well-constructed. My dog destroyed the squeaker and removed the legs and ears immediately. I would recommend the Coleman brand of dog toys, they are tough and much better value for the money.This fox toy is cute, but lasted less than 4 hours with my Brittany. I do not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment- BAD SQUIRREL!","review":"I Paid extra because of AKC Label. The dog has had squirrels before and they have lasted two or more years. This one is split open in one week. Dont buy THIS squirrel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AKC Squirrel Dog Toy, Small","review":"This squirrel dog toy looks exactly like the AKC squirrel dog toy I had purchased from Camping World. It lasted about one year with two Italian Greyhounds playing tug of war with it everyday. However, this one purchased from Jakks Pacific through Amazon lasted only one week before the tail came off and the stuffing was all over the house. The description online stated that it is an AKC squirrel dog toy but is actually an American Classic squirrel dog toy which can be purchased at Publix for $3.59. I paid $12.00 for this one. Totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I bought one of the AKC squirrels before and my dog loved it, it took him weeks to destroy it. I recently bought this one and he had it ripped open in 10 minutes! I checked it out and its not the same quality as previous, the quality is why I was a repeat customer now its the reason I WONT buy AKC products again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"My 1 yr old Husky/Lab mix had this toy for about 1 1\\\\2 days before it started to fall apart. First, she took of each ear individually then worked her way through the threading from there it seems. After the second day the squirrel was in shreds. I wouldn't recommend this if your dog is any kind of chewer or has anything resembling teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"AKC Classic Canadian Goose","review":"This is such a beautiful toy that I hesitated to give it to my dog.After I gave it to her, the squeaker only lasted for about15 minutes. Needless to say, this brand of toy is not built very tough.I have bought several toys in this brand. All of the squeakers go out very fast. If you are buying a toy because your dog loves to squeak them, I would not recommend buying these for your dog. My dog did not want to play with these toys after the squeaker quit working. We havesome toys that are a few years old and the squeakers are still working.Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, Fell Apart Quickly","review":"My hound dog loves to play with stuffed animals.

It's fun to play with and was very satisfied with quality of the product. Would definately recomend this toy. MB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves this goose","review":"My german shorthaired pointer/chocolate lab loves this goose.He can make the goose honk for an hour and never get tired of it.Correction...That is until he tore it apart and took out all the stuffing and the honker. Fortunately, the interior of this goose was easy to empty out once he tore it open and the \\"honker\\" is wrapped up so that it is not a danger to the dog. I removed the rest of the stuffing and he still loves to throw it around.Having said that, have your dog play with this or any other plush toy while supervised because eventually your dog will tear it up.On Amazon the goose costs less than I paid for it at a retailer, so I have gone ahead and ordered my guy another goose, a duck and a rabbit.Will he tear them up too?Count on it, but until he does he can make the goose honk, the duck quack and the rabbit squeak to his hearts content.Ahhh... if only life were always that simple.Honk. honk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toy in the dog's toybox","review":"The squirrel lasted less than 48 hours. Generally the least expensive stuffed toys from pet stores last 3 to 4 months before the fabric rips. My dog likes to \\"kill\\" the toy, have someone throw it, retrieve it, play tug-of-war and start the process again. In a matter of minutes the fur was coming off. After the third or forth \\"kill,\\" stuffing was flying all over the living room. Never have I bought a toy that fell apart as quickly as did this squirrel. I will sew the rips and see if we can get another few hours of play as my dog really liked the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Pomeranian LOVES it : )","review":"This is a great toy for small dogs. It has two noise makers, one in the tail and one in the belly. My puppy has trouble getting other squeaky toys to squeak, but this one she was able to squeak from day 1. I bought her a back up toy, so she will have her favorite toy for a while to come ! ! !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small rabbit did not hold up to a small puppy","review":"My [now 12 week old] miniature schnauzer loves this toy, but it did not last. Within one week, the [then 7 week old] puppy had ripped open the seam along the back of the toy, so we took the squeaker out so she wouldn't choke on it. She wasn't big enough to squeak it herself anyway. I've let her play with it a few more weeks, and she loves to chase and attack it, but I have to take it away now because there's too much stuffing coming out the top and back of the toy, where the seams ripped. There was never any rough play or tug-of-war with it. This is just clearly not a well made dog toy. It seems more like a child's stuffed animal that they just slapped an AKC endorsement on. I expected better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Boston Terrier Proof","review":"We gave this to Lola, our 1 and a half year old active Boston Terrier. She loved it immediately. She chases squirrels in the yard, so we thought this would be a good substitute. It does look like a squirrel, have a nice crinkly tail and a nice squeaker.But, within 15 minutes, she had surgically removed the crinkler from the tail. Another 5 minutes, and she removed the squeaker. She managed to do both without removing any stuffing (she's talented), but that was next.The weak point of this toy is that the big, bushy tail is stitched all the way from the squirrel's rearend to halfway up his back. So, a dog that's apt with his or her forepaws can easily hold it down and rend with her teeth (which is exactly what our dog did).Lola loves stuffed toys, but they don't last long. I would pay good money to get her a toy she could love on that would last more than two months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doggie hedgehog","review":"Our Greyhound Andy has a big hedgehog like this one. It is his favorite toy. Another dog got a hold of it and now its squeaker doesn't work any more. We bought this one, not realizing that it was smaller. He prefers to play with the big one, although he misses the squeaker. This one is too small for him. The quality of the toy is excellent, it is just too small for our Greyhound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy, and It's Durable","review":"Our dog loves these squirrels. She plays with them endlessly. It's the favorite of the many toys she has. And it has stood up much better than most of the other toys.
