I was pulled into the plot at the beginning because it was fast paced, and suspenseful, but as the movie progressed, I was really starting to get bored. After the ending (Which was really strange and very unsatisfactory), I was kind of mad, at having wasted a perfectly good weekend with my friends watching this. I suggest you definitely rent this one before even thinking of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good (or has that review title been used here already?)","review":"Other reviewers have noted the brevity of several great actors' scenes, but Mr. Del Toro's scene at the jail was at least twice as long as it should have been.There was some fairly good work here by some excellent actors--which was outweighed by ridiculous camerawork and editing. The attempts at surrealism were more often tedious and annoying. There were just too many such \\"Oliver Stone Moments\\", which gave me the impression that the main focus of the directing was on gimmickry--rather than on story-telling.Speaking of the story, that was a bit weak, too. Why did the film end the way it did? I could see no logic or cause/effect relationship between the events in the final scenes.What motivated the detective to run to the child's mother? Either he thought there was danger, or he didn't.Wierd, and disturbing? Yes. Thought-provoking? Yes.It provoked the thought, \\"Why have I wasted my time and money?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine moviemaking and existentialism","review":"This film caused quite a debate with my 20 year old son who found it \\"pointless\\". I recalled that the writer Durenmatt was an existentialist. This explained the story. Nicholson's character, after years of acclaim, is slinking away into retirement. But he makes this last promise, uses his skills developed over many years, and is convinced to the point of obsession that he is right. Everything is set for his ultimate triumph in front of his peers, the woman he loves, and the family he made the promise to.But a chance accident not only kills the murderer but incinerates the car, not even allowing the cops to recognize the \\"black wagon\\" that Nicholson had talked about. Thus due to a chance accident his life is destroyed and he sinks into madness and alcoholism. It was the perfect ending from an existential point of view. I agree with most of the other reviewers on the performances and direction. Sean Penn is slowly becoming one of our best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"I read this to my 7 year old and she was having trouble following the story. Just very choppy and a strange story. She didn't even want me to finish it. Not very well written at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too dark and creepy for our 6-7 year old daughter","review":"This was disturbing to my very bright daughter when she was 6-7. She asked me to get rid of it, which she never asks me to do. Auntie Claus is very strange and more than a little creepy. The pictures are gorgeous, but the story just didn't make a lot of sense. Another writer said that better, but then we dumped the book several years ago. However, the author is great and my daughter is now 10 and she adores this author's Secret Order of the Gumm Street Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"undeveloped characters and plot","review":"This story should have been a novel. The characters are not well developed. Sophie's new compassion for her brother is not grounded in anything that came before, and is not believable. Auntie Claus's role at the North Pole is never explained -- what does she do there?If she is Sophie's aunt, why don't Sophie's parents know what she does? Etc.etc.If Primavera had written a full length novel she would have had room to answer these questions, develop the characters more fully, and give her plot firmer foundations.This is a frustrating book because she had a good idea, but developed it so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Pass On This One","review":"Cute premise, but...this book just doesn't do it for me. I have been holding this book in my Amazon cart for a few weeks, waiting until I placed a large Christmas order. I'm glad I read short bits of this book in the bookstore before ordering it. The storyline is not entertaining in my opinion. Also, holidays such as Valentine's Day and Halloween are mentioned. My family and I do not celebrate Halloween, so this is another downfall of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Fabuloso!","review":"I like this book alot. I asked my mom to read this book because some words were too hard for me. It was funny when Sophie's little brother cried. Sophie's little brother looks like my brother. I can't wait to read her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Loved It!","review":"My children (ages 3,5,6) loved the illustrations and the story...they were convinced more than ever that a BB&G list really does exist! A fun book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!","review":"Every page feels like a magical adventure. I love reading this book to my baby nephew! and the colors are great as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delightful drawings, poor plot","review":"Seeing mixed reviews, I read this book in the bookstore and I was glad I didn't order it. The plot is very weak and the morale of the story is a stretch. The story never shows or describes why it is better to give. It just throws the morale out in the end. Too bad. Because the drawings are delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Treasure!","review":"As a First Grade teacher, I found this book to be one of those that I will look forward to reading over and over again with my students. The artwork is stunning, and the story truly captures a child's imagination. It is a wonderful story about remembering what is really important during the holidays. My students can't wait for me to read it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A William Joyce rip-off!","review":"From its New York setting to its actual plot, Auntie Claus is a rip-off of William Joyce's SANTA CALLS. For the real thing, I suggest reading Joyce's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THINKING OF OTHERS","review":"I bought 2 of these books for my nieces. (I'm known to them as \\"Auntie Sue\\") Colorful & fun to read. The main point of the story is thinking of others before yourself. We all can get caught up in \\"What do I want for me\\" at this time of year. It also shares a family secret that gets passed on to the next generation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MLB 2006: The Show should be cancelled!","review":"I was quite upset to hear that there would not be an MVP Baseball 2006 and after buyign and playing MLB 2006: The Show I was even more upset. This game is a joke compared to the MVP series. The fielding is horrible, trying to run the bases is impossible, and the absence of the throwing meter on outifeld and infield throws just plain stinks. The graphics are great, the music is good but the gameplay is horrible. Compared to MVP Baseball this game would be like going from PS2 back to Atari!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...What a Dissapointment","review":"This game had so much potential but from the very beginning it proved itself to be awkward and a terrible baseball game. The hitting engine is pathetic and it's nearly impossible to see the pitches right. Every player has huge legs and a funny pasted on face that slightly resembles reality. The graphics are OK but older versions of MVP trump them...actually MVP 2005 kicks this game into the gutter. The fielding dynamics are frustrating as well, and there is very little control over throwing and jumping/diving. Then there's the management part of the game, trading sucks, and the whole roster management is fragmented to a maddening degree. My advice, wish this game had never been made and wait till MLB 2k6 or give up until EA can make MLB licensed games again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Average Game\\"","review":"Pros: 1. Copied many concepts from MVP 2005 such as hot/cold zones, pitching meter, anologue stick power.2. ESPN like replay quality with the two teams playing each other shown.3. Good broadcasting.Cons: 1. A clone copy of the two other games from LAST YEAR.2. Poor Graphics.3. Limited announcing phrases.4. Wasn't having nearly as much fun as with usual video games.Overall: This game had more negatives than positives. I liked last years version better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst baseball game ever!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is horrible!!! I played it at Best Buy and it sucked so bad I couldn't play it for that long!!! The graphics are horrible, I mean the players don't look good!!! It looks like they have generic faces!!! The graphics are nowhere near Major League Baseball 2k5 or MVP 2004 or 2005!!! The gameplay is the worst I have ever seen in a baseball game!!! Don't buy this game!! Wait until MLB 2k6 comes out!! It already looks like it has alot better graphics and gameplay, plus it has the World Baseball Classic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Improvement Over Last Year","review":"I bought The Show as soon as I could after it came out. After buying MLB 06 last year on a whim, I fell in love with the gameplay and graphics of this game. It was vastly better than any of the other games released last year.The main problem I had with last year's edition was that the game tended to freeze up at key points, like when I was simulating a week or two of games, and I was afraid that the malfunction would be present in The Show as well.Thankfully, it had not frozen up on me once so far.I agree with the other reviewers that the commentary and gameplay is highly realistic. If you want in depth control of the baseball experience, great graphics, and the feel of watching/playing in a real game, then The Show is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"MLB 06 The Show Video Game for PS2","review":"Arrived quickly. Package and game was NEW. Like it better than EA Sports MLB 05. Would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little data, lots of space, only good to hit batters","review":"When I was told I could have this game I was pumped. When I loaded the game and saved my data, it took 3000 kb for rosters, profile, and dynasty. That and it was hard to play without setting everything good and taking about 750 kb. The only way to set the ball in the strike zone is to try and pitch it high. My way of hitting is to just swing and see what happens. Hitting was fairly easy, and playing on easy, I was losing 19-1 in the 3rd. My favorite part of the game is to......... hit batters with fastballs. So overall, 2 over 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"MLB 06 The Show","review":"Great MLB game for the ps2. Easy to pitch, field, steal, and bat. Has a ton of different modes of play. A lot of editors have given MLB 06 The Show a better rating than MLB 07. Do the research it's a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MVP!!!","review":"I played this game at my friend's house recently and I was very unimpressed. I was highly dissapointed that the MVP series wasn't making any more MLB games, so I decided to try this one, since I needed a new baseball game. UGH!!!How can anyone say these graphics are good. It looks like your playing on a gameboy. The entire gameplay feels choppy also. No where near as good as MVP 2005. Career Mode does seem kind of cool, so that is the only thing going for this game. Overall, I guess I'm going to stick with MVP 2005 again and just update the rosters because MLB 2K6 sounds terrible also. PLEASE EA SPORTS, COME BACK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"coaster","review":"everytime a game system seems to become outdated for the next bigger and better version, the companies seem to dump games like this on us,if you liked MVP baseball by EA sports previous efforts you will definately not like this release from SONY, and please don't anybody say the graphics are better because they are not..........i just bought a forty dollar coaster...mmmphh"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst baseball game i own.","review":"If i could give this game a lower rating i would. This game is the worst basball game I own. The graphics are average at best, but i dont buy a game for graphics. This game plays horribly. If you have ever played a version of EA sports mvp baseball you should avoiod this game like the plague. Its hard to hit, hard field, and the overall game play is just plain terrible. Go buy a text game before you buy this, it will be more fun. Not to mention it locks up from time to time. Save your money and buy a pizza or something for dinner, you will get more enjoyment out of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"a reveiw by jay","review":"pretty good graphics and great gameplay give this game 4 stars overall. The only problem with gameplay is that there is a cut off every time you through from the outfield. The game has great features though, like the career mode where you create yourself, someone else, or just someone you just plain made up.They usally start in triple A but you can train and get better. You can ask for a trade, complain, or asked to be called up. Sometimes they call you up on their own though. Dynasty mode can be hard with budgets however though, but i've always had a hard time with budgets, so if you understand budgets ignore this part. However, if you smack the ps2 with a baseball bat though over budgets don't get this game. I dont like budgets but i can tolerate them so its all good to me. Whatever you do though don't get mlb 2k6 its got bad graphics and the gameplay is confusing. I hope this reveiw helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game; average gameplay","review":"This game has great graphics for Ps2. The franchise mode is deep and fun. There were glitches. Whenever a pop fly was hit over his head (either by a little or a lot) they would run to it take a couple steps to a different side than the ball side and go back over and dive and make this amazing chatch without even looking with his glove strethced out at torso level. What is up with That?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More carnage","review":"If you are a lawsuit happy whacko stay away from this one. It's not for the family, unless you happen to be in the Manson family! This game is a one player, 1st person shooter. There is a cable link option and if you are lucky enough to have two TVs, two game consols and two game CDs then you can have some real battles (same goes for the original DOOM)as you blast your way through violent, disguised communists or declare war on your playing partner. There are several levels and most get a little tougher as you finish each level. The music can be turned off to make the setting even more realistic. Lots of suprises and weapons keep this body count classic fresh. Nothing like a point blank double barrel shotgun blast to the face to really make you mad! A great deal at this price for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Doom Game for husband","review":"This was a gift for my husband, he loves playing this game. He plays it with the grandkids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Me Frame the Argument...","review":"The book is dated but fascinating. It introduces the notion that much of what we argue about is really not an argument about facts but one about definitions. It is fascinating also to note the players in the 1930s and to see what their predictions became. A wonderful introduction to semantics with the caution that if you let an enemy select the terms of the argument, he has already won it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destiny' s Child \\"writings on the wall\\" ...","review":"Cd Is Off The Hook. The Production On This Cd Is Solid wit a lil bouncy-feel groove to it. That's Why I Gave It 4 Stars.

In The Future I Would Like To Hear The Other 3 Members Bless Us With A Solo Every Now & Then On The Albums, & Continue Having Much Success With The Group As Well As The Two New Members Who Recently Joined.

This album has hot singles as well as other songs that werent singles. It is really good and would make a good addition to anyone's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A CD!","review":"I can say without reservation that \\"The Writing's On The Wall\\" is THE best of the three DC albums thus far (I would dare say even better than the solo releases as well). This, of course was before, Michelle Williams as this was Beyonce, Kelly, LaToya and LaTavia that did this one.My favorite songs off of this are \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", \\"Confessions\\", \\"Temptations\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jumpin'.\\" I think the comparisons to TLC are somewhat valid too. While I think TLC was better, no other girl group has had the impact in R&B/Hip-Hop that DC has had since TLC. Only En Vogue and, before those three groups, Salt N Pepa could make that claim as far as impact and influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Get Destiny's Child \\"The Writings On The Wall\\" It's Hot","review":"Destiny's Child has been working together for at least 9 or 10 years. Therefore they have been practicing together, been through things, and so on. And from what my eyes see and my ears hear. I think it paid off. Because I am sure that the CD will go 2x Platium. But if you guys go buy it or tell your friends, relatives, or etc. about the new CD or single they can go beyond 2x Platium. Ya Heard! So keep Destiny's Child (DC) in your prayers. Aight!

THIS ALBUM IS 100% BETTER THAN THE FIRST! It's got a hype sound and gives good listening pleasure, and I am glad they all are writing. But, even though I love Beyonce' I think that their management should let LeToya and the others sing more. I mean aren't they a Group? They should take advantage of their different, unique, soultry voices!And they need to pump up on more meaningful songs, not just about no' good brothas. All in all this is a great ALBUM! They have obviously worked hard and no one can knock them for that! YA'LL THE BOMB TOYA, BEE, KELLY, AND TAV!!!!!!! GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonce Lays It Down!","review":"Destiny's Child is my fave R&B act, ever since the chorus of \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" hooked itself into my head. The true reason I bought this was because of the song Bug-A-Boo, the single at the time I purchased this. I totally was hooked on their vocals & beats. I slowly listened to the whole cd, finding my favorite tracks to be \\"If You Leave\\", \\"Hey Ladies\\", \\"Bug-A-Boo\\", \\"Jumpin', Jumpin'\\", and \\"Now That She's Gone\\". I like all the rest too, but these five are what I consider to be the best. I enjoy this CD alot, and listen to it more now than I did when I got it a year ago. I can't wait for \\"Survivor\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, so good, so good...","review":"This album is da bomb! My favourite songs are IF YOU LEAVE (with NEXT), SO GOOD, TEMPTATION, STAY, HEY LADIES, BUG A BOO and WHERE D'YOU GO. These girls are really tallented. This goes out to Beyonce: if there's any talent going spare, can i have some!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sophomore Effort","review":"With the release of their second CD, Destiny's Child have proven that they are not just one-hit wonders. From the number one smash \\" Bills, Bills Bills\\" to their current chart-burner \\"Bug a Boo\\" these 4 young women have definitely got it going on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Original CD","review":"This was the first Destiny's Child CD I ever bought, and it is probably the most played disc in my CD collection. Whether it's sassy anthems for women, sultry ballads, or anything in between DC can do it, and they can do it well. Although the intro, with the girls attempting to speak in Italian accents, may cause some raised eyebrows, keep listening-no song on this sixteen-track disc is remotely bad! Standouts are the [appealing] \\"Temptation\\", the thumping \\"Bug A Boo\\", their mega-hit everyone has heard, \\"Say My Name\\", and the reflective \\"Sweet Sixteen\\". the album ends on a perfect note with an a cappella rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\", with almost Freakily good harmonies. in this outstanding CD, every girl has a chance to shine vocally, not just Beyonce. It's really worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best songs are.............................","review":"- Bills bills bills - played to death- Bug a boo - played to death- Now that shes gone- Whered you go- If you leave- Jumpin Jumpin - played to death- Say my name - played to death- Stay"},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened? The old Destiny's Child was \\"So Good\\"!","review":"Before they went to their pop sellout album \\"Survivor\\", Destiny's Child released this classic, \\"Writing's On The Wall\\". This album is a brilliant mix of old-school & modern r&b, as well as some hip-hop flavor with guest appearences by Missy Elliot and Next. The stand-outs here are \\"So Good\\", filled with smoldering beats, \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", \\"Temptation\\", \\"Bug A Boo\\" as well as \\"Hey Ladies\\". Of course, no one can forget about the phenomenal club banger \\"Jumpin Jumpin\\". Still the best track on the album holds as the classic single \\"Say My Name\\". This song is excellent, there's nothing more to say. Of course, since then, the group has sold out to the pop/r&b genre of today. However, \\"Writings On The Wall\\" will always be remembered as a Destiny Child classic. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUMPIN', JUMPIN'","review":"Yes Destiny's Child 's new album, THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL, had me mezmorized. I loved this album. With their own commandments before each song, I knew that a lesson was going to be taught.The most tentalizing songs include \\"Confessions\\", \\"Say My Name\\", and \\"Hey Ladies\\". Wow was this an amazing cd for anyone who likes R&b/SOUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divas of Generation Next","review":"Beyonce, LaTavia, LaToya, and Kelly are the names of four Divas of our generartion. These girls bring forth a soulful and mature sound in the quality of their voices. Yet the subject matter of each and every song is something that every teenage girl and young women can relate to. From the soulful ballad \\"She Can't Love You\\" to the make you wannna party song \\"Jumpin' Jumpin'\\". These girls bring it to you to let the listners know that they may be young but they definitley have got it going on. I also had the oppurtunity of seeing the group perform live while they were on the Fan Mail tour with trio TLC, and the energy presented in person is just as great in live as it is on the CD. So go ahead and make that purchase TODAY.Everybodies doing it! Remember it's Destiny's Child; \\"The Writings on The Wall\\". I guarantee that you won't be disappointed and by the second day you get you'll know every word to every song!

Better that than THIS. The constant annoyingly catchy songs just nver seem to end (especially once the chorus just wont stop playing in youre head) and the lyrics just become more and more pointless. bug-a-boo? couldnt they have come up with a real word or phrase like \\"for god sake dont touch our album\\". All they sing about are boyfreinds, clingy boyfreinds, cheap boyfreinds, lazy boyfreinds, etc etc. Oh yeah and bug-a-boos...? Basically this album could be described perfectly in one wod.

I mean they are all very pretty, they can sing like nobodies business, and they are famous already. The only bad thing I think about them is that like almost all girl groups, they diss all men in their music. Not all people are cheaters and players and jerks. But I guess I have to deal with the fact that that is the way that all of them do their thing. I really like this cd, and it expresses all of their thoughts in the songs all over track. Way to go DC, keep it goin'!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I am sorry but Destiny's Child doesn't compare w/ TLC. TLC had like one hit single, wow, who cares.

I understand this music is selctively geared toward african american females 12-30, but the singing is flat and the hook lacks melody. Did I mention the lyrics? As for Bills Bills Bills it too lacks creative musical arrangement but I must admit it was catchy enough for the usual cd consumer, Female. I like some TLC. Erikah Badu can be great at times. The monotonous sound of Destinys Child is prevelant now in 2000 and aside from their good looks and relationship with female peers their music is candykorn dispensable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"This is a GREAT CD for those with insomnia.

LUV IT Confessions-YAWN, BORING! and WHERE is missy elliot in this song, she's supposed to be featuring! Bug A Boo-a great girl power song, it's so cool! Temptation-my favorite ballad on this album! it's kinda like that 'knick knack paddiwack' song, like 'Pussycats'by mya Now that She's Gone-kind of boring Where'd you Go-THIS SONG ROCKS! great beats Hey Ladies-THIS IS MY FAV SONG ON THE TRACK! THIS ROCKS! THIS RULES!I CANT GET ENOUGH OF THIS SONG! If you leave-snooooore. boring Jumpin Jumpin-AWESOME PARTAY SONG Say My Name-another classic! this is so cool! the rest of the songs, she can't love you, stay, and sweet sixteen suck. overall, destiny's child ROCKS, the songs on this album should be admired by other artists"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply standard","review":"Say My Name is the only cool song on this.The rest is just weak.Bills Bills Bills is blatently ripping off No Scrubs.Go by a real r&balbum instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYONCE and Destiny's Child","review":"This cd is by far the best by destiny's child. This cd can be played straight through. The intro is long, but it explains why the title of the cd is \\"the writing on the wall\\". The way the cd plays is like the group has written there own comandment's. My favorite song is \\"stay\\" #14. It is a lovely song about wanting to keep you man right where he is at. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes R&B. The one problem with this cd is that all you hear is Beyonce, she sings lead on almost all the songs, although when Beyonce is singing adlibs you can hear Kelly. The only thing that would have made this a better cd is if they let everybody get a chance to sing lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Converted Man","review":"I'm a totally changed man.

The hottest slow songs, Confessions and Temptations are So HOTTTT!!!! they just burn by themselves. I love those songs!!! there slinky and sexy. I only wish that everyone else got vocals too.

I liked all of songs except the introduction. In the introduction, the Godfather theme was out of place, too long and is barely audible. I liked the fact that this album maintains a theme and each song reflects a variation of that theme. Destiny's Child does a good job in reciting the drama of today's modern relationships such as in \\"Bug-A-Boo\\", definitely in \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Bills, Bills, Bills.\\" This album is definitely worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...there are a few good songs, I guess","review":"\\"Bills, Bills, Bills,\\" \\"Bug A Boo,\\" and \\"Say My Name\\" are pretty good but....that's it. Even those songs aren't nearly as catchy as the ones found on Survivor. And their beats are so feverishly all-over-the-place, these songs are nearly impossible to hum along to. I've really never liked \\"Jumpin Jumpin,\\" it's SO overrated. It's way, WAY too slow to be a dance song, and the verses are incredibly aggravating, the chorus is the only fairly catchy part. And what in GOD's name these girls were trying to accomplish in the Intro is absolutely beyond me, it's downright disturbing. It is NOT the DC I know and love. It's like a scene out of Godfather or something....wtf are they smoking putting crap like that as the first track on their album, it gets it off to a horrible start!! DC's first two albums suck, and Destiny Fulfilled sucks too....the only album of theirs I can really recommend is Survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the groove?

It's really hard to stomach.This is the same \\"cut and paste\\" disposable R&B that seems to be polluting the airwaves these days.In contrast, check out TLC's Fanmail...it has alot of jittery, nervous stuff going on, yet it's balanced by some incredibly creative productions including hard core rap, techno R&B and a couple of Babyface cuts.

But the production side, which is obviously responsible for the crisp finished product that is advertised as \\"Destiny's Child\\", could have steered this release a little further toward originality, and not just the same old tired \\"my man cheated on me\\" and \\"I cheated on my man\\" nonsense. Still better than bubble gum pop, but lacking the soul that makes some acts great while others are, as the reviewer says up front, \\"disposable\\". I saw them live on their first tour several years back, and I wonder... if Wyclef hadn't pushed them so hard, would many people have been saying their name in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Compared to their first Cd, Destiny's Child hasn't gotten better. Too many songs on here sound alike, too much alike. And the lyrics are sometimes corny and simple. The only standout tracks are \\"Bills Bills Bills\\", \\"Say My Name\\" and \\"Where'd You Go\\".

This new album offers nice beats and great production. It has good uptempo tracks such as \\"Hey Ladies\\" and \\"Jumpin', Jumpin'\\". There are also some nice ballads like \\"Now That She's Gone\\". Other noteworthy tracks includes \\"Say My Name\\" produced by Rodney Jerkins, \\"So Good\\" the song dedicated to all the haters out there and \\"Sweet Sixteen\\". The sophomore album is definitely more mature than the first and shows off their talent more. The album can relate to basically anyone and has originality and potential, so it would be a good purchase for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"This is probably one of, if not my number one favorite Destinys Child album.

The best party songs on the cd are \\"Where'd You Go\\", \\"Hey Ladies\\", and \\"Jumpin Jumpin\\". You all know the hit \\"Say My Name\\" and you know this joint is on fire.

I own both this CD and TLC's Fanmail, and while this was Destiny's Child put out an incredible disc, TLC released a one full of all hype and no talent. While TLC has become successful by their attitude rather than their singing or rapping, Destiny's Child has four very talented girls that show remarkable vocal ability for their age. DC seems to add a special touch to every song. While Bills(X3) perfectly conveys its message of sadness and betrayal, No Scrubs lacks no substance. Alll of the songs are great, especially Bills(X3), Bug-A-Boo, Temptation, and Jumpin Jumpin. As for Beyonce stealing the show, she has a voice that compete with any of the young r&b divas, except for Monica. The other three members have not complained about not having the leads, although all of them are capable of singing quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very respectable.","review":"Although I don't care for about 60% of the album, I am lovin the music.

Hey, if a director wants to get his or her jollies by recutting a movie, go for it, but at least make sure the original theatrical version is available. I've seen this movie many times, but the additional mish-mash of scenes on the bloated director's cut detract from the drama and tension of the original. Historical inaccuracies aside, this was a thought-provoking movie when it was released; Now, in it's current incarnation, it only provokes. When I see the director's cut, I am taken out of the movie with thoughts of how much better it used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!!!!!!!","review":"Oh my goodness this is a bad film.

It is more truthful to the jfk assassination than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Overblown Tripe","review":"I always find Stone and Costner movies overblown and their supposedly knowledeable insider views misleading at best. This movie is for conspiracy and other nuts only. It assumes that it is right and a realistic view of history.

I just loved this movie on VHS - but when DVD came out I just had to buy the Special Edition. It's got 17 extra minutes of footage not in the original. Those extra minutes do add to the movie. JFK is a fast-paced flick that will keep you going. It will get you thinking about the past & about who knew what & who did what. Donald Sutherland as Mr. X brings in some insightful information - that keeps you guessing. This is such an enjoyable movie. It will take you on such a ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Oliver Stone's best films","review":"I liked this version of JFK better than the original version because the extra footage helped to explore the conspiracy of President Kennedy's death and Jim Garrison's attempts to uncover the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many more JFKs to come?","review":"I understand that when DVDs first came out we wantedd to get all of our favorites ASAP - Right Stuff, JFK, Total Recall, etc. I name these three because they were all released and then re-released with new stuff. The new stuff was cool, and it came much later than when the DVD was originally released. However, this is the third JFK DVD to be released already. How many more should we expect. What makes this one anymore special than the Director's Cut. I appreciate trying to get as much stuff on the DVD as you can, but why could it not have been done on the second one.

I am also a huge fan of dvd. But give me a break. The director's cut is horrible. Fans of the movie as they saw it in theaters will probably be disappointed by the additional footage. Furthermore, dvds are supposed to offer us variety and extra features. If they are not going to give us any special features, then the least they could do is make one side the director's cut and the other side the far superior theater version. This is dvd at it's worst, with the possible exception of \\"Last of the Mohicans\\", another bad director's cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I don't always like watching a movie that pretends to be about history and takes all kinds of liberties.

Although they don't really give you an answer of what happened. The depiction was SUPERB! Kevin Costner, Joe Pesci, John Candy, etc. They were fantastic in this movie! A little long...But you know what? Over thirty years later, people are still trying to figure it out...So I think 3 hours to explain what happened is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of all conspiracy theories...this is one of the worst!","review":"You need to go no further than the empirical evidence to show that Oswald acted alone. As a film, this makes a good story, but I hate to see young people buy into this nonsense as some sort of \\"fact\\". It is nothing more than silly speculation and conjecture. With all the conspiracy theories being strongly refuted by computers and technology the last few years, It's beginning to appear more and more obvious that Oswald did act alone... no matter how un-exciting that may sound. Even historians that believe in a conspiracy will tell you that the one featured in this film is one of the weakest to be considered. Good filmmaking, great entertainment. Very irresponsible of Oliver Stone. Not history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the President's Men","review":"I am thrilled to have found this movie -- none of my local stores had it -- and now I just click on Amazon when I want a movie or TV program.

Even if you ignore the homophobic, paranoiac re-writing of facts, the film seems to be the work of an over enthusiastic college student. No, make that junior high school. Agonizingly bad writing, self-indulgent acting . . . Oliver Stone used to be a decent film maker, but I wish he would just get his frustrations out on an analyst's couch and leave the rest of us in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense by any other name is still nonsense","review":"Persons who think this movie to be based on fact would do well to examine the evidence a tad more carefully than this travesty of a film does."},{"rating":"1","title":"JFK","review":"Was VERY saddened to the fact that this is a two disc special edition and the second disc was MISSING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"When you have a historical movie, I don't think you can just judge it on its dramatic effect. I think you have to also judge it on whether it is accurate. On the latter, JFK fails miserably. If you read the best book on the assassination CASE CLOSED by Gerald Posner, you'll see that this movie totally slanders Clay Shaw. Clay Shaw was found innocent in a court of law, the evidence since has held up his innocense, and that a paranoid like Oliver Stone should make slanderous crap like this and that people should praise it, is deeply deeply disturbing. I think the making of this movie was, in fact, a criminal act. (How would you like it if, after you died, someone made a movie about you, saying you had killed Nicole Brown Simpson...and a bunch of people on Amazon.com rated it 5 stars. Wouldn't be too fun, now, would it?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my favorite films on DVD - I SHOULD be ecstatic","review":"One of my all time favorites is treated like dirt on DVD. A HORRIBLE transfer. Keep you VHS copy until they rerelease this. It also has next to nothing for extras and it's a dual layer (flipper) disc (long movie of course but not long enough to warrant this since DVD holds 4 hours on each side). This was one of the first films to be put on DVD so maybe all this isn't surprising and I'm sure it will be rereleased... but c'mon Warner Bros., HURRY UP ALREADY!So if you are considering buying JKF on DVD - WAIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blu-Ray transfer","review":"I had this - for me - best film ever, in my library for a few days. I just thought to have a look at it the other day, but I watched the complete movie again. What a wonderful transfer according to the old DVD. However, I had to adjust the colours just a bit. The picture looks warm and a little grainy, just like the Godfather on Blu-Ray. It is clear and beautiful. The sound of the film is crispy and overwhelming. This is a must-have, even if you have all other formats like Video, Laserdisc and DVD on your shelf. The additional book package looks great and all collectors like me will welcome it.

The line \\"let the truth be known or the Heavens fall\\" is from a Hollywood writer and was never stated. In actual fact,Garrison wasn't even at the courts at the time of the court's decision.

But the cast is great and the main points are convincingly made. If you choose to believe Oswald acted alone, then the question is why? Just the incoherent act of a madman? Whatever. The bigger question is what happened to the age of assasination? It was over relatively quickly. Could it be because the people responsible finally got the kind of country they wanted? A country where no one gets elected without the backing of big corporate money and Washington acts at the behest of big corporate money or it doesn't act at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"Riveting movie, Magic Bullet Blaster, Truly worth the purchase price, could not ask for more, Excellent acting from everyone involved, not to mention the best directing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Costner's best movie, besides \\"Dances...\\"","review":"I am a major conspiracy theorist, don't get me wrong, but I do not believe all that is theorized in this movie.But recently, I have seen a few programs on Discovery or A & E, that have led me to believe our government was covering up something major.

Without going into too much detail, Kevin Costner plays the part of Jim Garrison, proving again that he can act better when he's not directing. Donald Sutherland is brilliant, albeit his one scene (10 min.) If you follow the camera and angles, it looks as if the scene was shot in one take. Given Oliver Stone's penchant for details and cinema verité perfectly, it probably was.When the movie is over, you have this feeling that JFK was assassinated in a conspiracy, as opposed to the Warren Commission's report of a single bullet theory. In the end, you'll be thinking twice about whodunit! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver Stone's masterpiece","review":"This controversial film by Oliver Stone on the JFK assasination has taken on a life all its own. I recently saw it again on HD Net and I was drawn into it all over again by the brilliant performances, Stone's direction and the story itself. Many people have criticized Stone for taking liberties with the story but this is not a documentary this is a drama!! Costner is brilliant in particular and his summation scene in court is belongs to his best work (also counting his role in Eastwood's \\"A Perfect World\\"). The aim of an artist is to make us question the truth and Stone has certainly succeeded at that. Remember how many people felt the plot in \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" grows eerily factual as time goes by!! If you are repelled by the current events now unfolding before us--the Iraq war, the recession--do see this film again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JFK....well....not really","review":"As a movie, it's fine. As history, it's absurd.Based on one man's neurosis (albeit, hard to tell if that one man is Stone or Garrison), JFK purports to explain the \\"conspiracy\\" behind the Kennedy assassination. If you choose to believe it, you delude yourself. No good evidence exists that has not been explained logically in coherence with the single-assassin-Oswald theory. Sadly, many more people will believe Stone's fraudulent tale than will ever consider investigating the details of the murder in a logical, un-hyped analysis.Better not to see it at all....."},{"rating":"1","title":"JFK or at least according to Oliver Stone.","review":"JFK .

Too many cutaways, and too many half assed historical \\"facts\\".Stone's best work will always be Platoon. That movie had it's over done scenes, but, it never went overboard like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday . . . well, all his flicks since 1987's Wall Street.For anyone foolish enough to still retain affects from the conspiracy talk . . . it's just a movie from a bad director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Bull","review":"If Garrison could bring his load of bull to court,I can see why their are innocent people in prison and on death row.

If you like Oliver Stone, watch \\"Platoon\\" instead because it's a much better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Stone's Lies are criminal!","review":"This is a great film except the only factual event portrayed by Oliver Stone was that JFK was assassinated! Jim Garrison is one of the more despicable figures in American history, and Stone glorifying him is downright wrong. I find it interesting that Stone's version of events stops short of Garrison getting hauled into federal court and ordered...ordered! by the sitting federal judge to leave Clay Shaw alone. If you don't believe me, read False Witness by Patricia Lambert. She de-bunks the Garrison myth with actual facts. In fact, the History Channel just aired a documentary based on her book, and Oliver Stone refused to be interviewed for it. Read the book, throw away the movie.

Everybody might have been on it and the hunt for the killer of JFK will reopen in the year 2029 by the federal council of Washington. This was a great movie you'll love to watch and conspicuiousy is in the air of Los Angles and Houston during the 60s, how America fell after the death of one of the greatest presidents in American History and how Cuba came back.

But, of course, ........ will probably think my pointing this out is too controversial for my review to be posted. More controversial than Oliver Stone accusing an innocent man of murder. I'm glad his and Kevin Costner's movie careers have slid into the abyss. It's what both men deserve for slandering Clay Shaw.

This one is more all-out thrash than something like Expanding Senses which is a little more reigned in. There's really nothing more I can say about this album, except buy it.

The cinematography in this film was very well done, and Saffron Burrows was really good in it. The film dealt with a lot of differen't character's problems, so I can't explain all of it. Saffron Burrows's character was a twin that was seperated at birth and when she sees her twin in an airport, things get a tad confusing for her.

I suggest you see this if you like the less main-stream movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutally Beautiful","review":"I can't begin to describe this picture, to do it justice. The film is a series of short vignettes (some that are plain bizarre) that start to make sense only at the end. Figgis is on top of everything: the beautiful composition of each shot, the music, the editing, and the story. Taken as a whole, Mike Figgis just might be the most versatile and multi-talented filmmaker today. Can we start to make comparisons to Bergman? Do we dare?In all, this movie isn't for everyone. If you fall asleep for a moment, it's all over. This is one of those litmus test movies. If you love it, you'll start to evaluate all your friends on the basis of their appreciation of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of nakedness","review":"Although the other reviewers mention the meaning of the movie and the cinematography, I imagine few will consider these things when watching this movie. Most people will check this movie out just to see if there is as much sex in it as the title implies. It won't be anything more than a softcore porn. And for you folks into watersports, this movie may be worth looking into. It is quite possibly the only publicly released non-porno to feature pissing.

I've seen and enjoyed plenty of other silent, artsy, foreign, or otherwise \\"non-mainstream\\" movies, and this is one of the most dull and boring by far. Make that painfully boring. No message, nothing to chew on, no insight. How can a film be considered poignant when everything in it is so blatantly obvious? Not to mention pretentious. The slow panning landscape shots were lackluster and poorly chosen reeking of a low budget and lack of creativity. The only moment that broke the mold was when full nude Adam and Eve urinated in front of each other. +1 star for WTF factor.I tried to like it, I really did.

Finally, and thankfully, the various strands are gathered together to make a few trite and adolescent points. Dreadful stuff. When I was 15 years old (in the 1970s) I would have regarded this movie with awe. Now, I simply wonder why a fine director would make such a silly and self-indulgent film so far into his career. Mr Figgis, please return to making movies for adults. Viewers, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Blink...","review":"this movie was definitely a mind-engager. It isn't the sort of film you can chat through, or you might not understand it at all.

The scenarios are loosely jointed and have little to do with each other, but the characters' emotions are poignant and realistic.

The photography was sometimes blurred, the soundtrack uneven, and the editing uneven as well. For example, the famous striptease scene near the end of the film on this version on screen consisted only of a women's stocking flying in the air from the right border of the picture. While stockings and belt are the only clothing items removed by Sophia Loren, the viewer does not see her take them off.I have seen other versions of this movie and bought this copy only because I could not obtain one of them.

I did, and instead of the version from NoShame that the seller promises, what I received was a low quality dvd that was dubbed in English, with a completely different slimline box cover from an inferior no name manufacturer.

It was apparently transfered from deteriorated film elements, horrendous (jolts) pan and scan with an annoying monophonic dubbed soundtrack. This DVD release does not do justice to this Italian cinematographic jewel. It should not be in the market.

Which is the biggest shock, since this was written by David Webb Peoples, the on responsible for Blade Runner, 12 Monkies and Unforgiven. Here he is trying to cross the Sci-Fi genre with the Western genre and comes up with a boring knock off of every movie in those genres. And what should have made up in unorginal ideas in the script should have been the action scenes. But yet another surprise happens. These action scenes are no good, even boring. The surprise being that the movie was also directed by Paul Anderson, who directed the fun martial arts film Mortal Kombat, which was supported by it's incredible martial arts scenes. Produced by Jerry Weintraub's JW Productions, which also produced The Avengers, and like The Avengers, Soldier had everything going for it, and just collapsed by it's lack of originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kurt Russel fights the good fight, says 2 words in movie.","review":"The plot and content of the movie was very origional and different, and the director had a interesting way of showing scenes which was out of the ordinary. Kurt Russel says all of seemingly 2 or 3 words the whole movie \\"yes sir\\" and \\"No sir\\". Wow, that really exictes me. Dont ask me why they thought that having Kurt Russel practically mute and socially completely retarded would make the movie more entertaining. I would have thought it would have been cool if he learned how to get along with everyone and actually start to speak at one point, but I was let down cause this never happened. The action in the film was exciting and different, but the movie ended and I was like \\"Thats it? \\" Its a movie to rent, not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, lots of guns and gore do not a movie make...","review":"Well, the previous reviewer,I categorically disagree with you: if actions speak louder than words, let's make a mute movie! True, there are moments in the movie (in its first half), when Soldier's terse behaviour arises pity in the viewer, for this is the man robbed of normal human behaviour, who can't even name the feelings that rack him. And curse the ones that created him such. However, when they pictured a flashback into the past when Soldier kills a child, my sympathy evaporated for good, and no other cheezy scenes of him saving and holding children could not save him.To make things even worse, when the \\"bad gyus\\" landed on the planet, I went to \\"fast forward\\": guess who smashed and routed two dozens of \\"death machines\\", regained support of his demoted comrades and blasted the whole planet with a nuclear bomb without uttering five words in a row? If it comes to that, I'd better watch an old copy of Rambo..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent study in wordless communication.","review":"This film tackles the dogmatic dehumanization of the military, extrapolated with futuristic technology. Kurt Russel gives a brilliant performance as an automaton struggling toward human awareness. His ability to convey a broad range of emotion and turmoil - without words - makes this film riveting, as his acting enters your awareness at the speed of light, not sound. The range of nuances the viewer can percieve on his visage deepen the impact of the emotional growth he experiences so nakedly before us.Although likely thought of as an action film, I find \\"Soldier\\" an uplifting and hopeful study in the desire of one man, stripped emotionally bare as a child, to recover a life that he has never known, yet yearns for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Watching","review":"Kurt Russell is a test tube bred soldier, taught from birth the discipline and destruction that a perfect human soldier requires, that is until technology improves and he becomes obsolete. A well-shot film with maybe not the most intricate plot-line but one which definitely entertains. I can't give too much away, it does have large explosions and little speech but nonetheless communicates very well by pictures alone. Not only an action film, it manages to encourage feelings of compassion and sorrow for he who was a killing machine, due to all the things he was robbed of. Definitely more than meets the eye and well worth buying on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Action Flick!","review":"Soldier is an action sci-fi film. It is quite entertaining compared to many in the same genre and has more credibility compared to Universal Soldiers. First of all, unlike Van Damme, Russell can act. Secondly, the BS in the other film about dead soldiers walking about and being bullet proof is way too far-fetched. Soldier is also supported by a very good cast notably, Gary Busey, Connie Nielsen and Jason Scott Lee. Okay, the story is old and there's not a lot new but if you view it as just an action flick, you will enjoy it. See it and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sci fi","review":"I thought this was an OK developement of a short story scifi idea. Kurt Russel didn't have to work his way through sonnets (which seems to be the main critism) he played the part to fit the role perfectly. I think if you look at this as a story, rather than a vehicle for actors, it's really very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape from Earth?","review":"I've loved everything Kurt Russell has done since Escape from New York,however this story seems rather one-dimensional. You can pretty much predict the following scenes way before they happen,as well as the ending,due to following old formulas that have worked well in the past for less demanding audiences. Action being of paramount importance,this production delivers,meeting all expectations. Special effects,while not top notch,are only marginally below what might be expected for a high budget si-fi. Emotional behaviors of men trained exclusively for war are well conveyed throughout,but may miss the mark for those not exposed to the rigors of diversity. The DVD version has both widescreen and standard formats,something that should be included on all discs. Well worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurt Russell does it all with his face.","review":"As much as I like the storyline, what makes this film is the fine job Kurt Russell does with only a half-dozen or so lines. It is the lines on his face that convey what is going on inside this charactor whose only feelings are \\"fear and discipline\\". This is a terrific story of awakening humanity in an individual deprived from birth of such things, and some of the best scenes are between Russell and Connie Nelson's character as he tries to fit into the frightening world of normal life. I knocked off a couple of stars for \\"borrowed\\" plot lines from similar-themed films, and gave one back for Russell's fine performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great action movie, a must see for action lovers!","review":"I first went to see this movie I expected a O.K. action movie. I new that Kurt Russell was a good actor so I thought it would be decent. What I saw, though, was a excellently done action movies with good special effects. Also another thing about this movie was that the way he reacted in certain situations seemed lifelike, such as when he was battling the new army. Kurt Russell also did a great job in acting, and he really did not even talk that much at all, which would be extremly hard to do, when he is used to talking in his movies. This was alot better than I thought and a must see if you love action movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurt Russel Strikes Again!!","review":"Kurt Russel is phenomenal in this awesome sci-fi action film.

When I went to see this film with a couple of friends I almost died laughing. The acting is terrible. Kurt's character's word repertoire doesn't pass 10 words during all the movie. I'm thinking that with my Commodore 64 I could have done better special effects when I was 6 years old. And I'm still asking myself (and everyone who watches this movie) \\"Why someone had to produce a film like that and why did Kurt accepted to play this movie ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most under-appreciated sci-fi action film finally on Blu Ray!","review":"Not really a thinking mans movie but it was fun to watch. I enjoyed the cinematography. Kurt Russel did a great job acting seeing as he hardly spoke. Director did a good job with the budget given.

What on earth was he thinking when he accepted this part. Reel Two Dialogue Two- Shoot, Soldier Grut. Shoot, Soldier Grut. Well, that about sums it up for this diaster.

Doesn't even deserve the 1 star.","review":"I watched this film with some friends a few weeks ago, and it was memorable due to the fact that it was the first time we all had ever agreed on anything. We all agreed that we had just witnessed a truely terrible film. The laughable plot is cliched from beginning to end - we were able to guess major 'twists' throughout the film without much difficulty. There is no depth to the story - the makers seems to have picked up the book 'How to make an action movie' and made a film (complete with villian with twitchy moustache) that followed it to the letter. The film was just so bad in the end it left us whincing. If you don't believe me, then buy the film and you'll see what I mean. Kurt Russell has no shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stay away","review":"I'm sorry but I feel the need to protect the general public from this movie. Bad story, Bad acting, Bad action.

Some movies have good points and bad points , you can say the script was very bad but special fx saved the day. But it is not like this at Soldier. You can see better sepecial effects while playing Atari version of Moonpatrol.I generally like Russle's acting but in that movie there was nothing to act i think Kurt was unnecessery for the movie a good crafted wood would do the trick.I hope they stop making that bad movies ...

Sure it is predictable but what is special about this movie is the tremendous photography and the outstanding acting talent of Kurt Russell. I cannot recall any other movie where the leading actor imparted so much emotion just using body language and facial expressions. The DVD includes an extra soundtrack where the movie soundtrack is subdued and the creators of the movie are giving a running commentary about the movie and why things were done certain ways, I found this extra soundtrack fascinating to listen to while watching the movie.

Sadly, this one is only a shadow of what it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Good to keep on as background noise if you are working around the house. Although in retrospect, the radio would have been better.The only good thing about this movie is that Kurt Russell must have loved it because he had only about 2-3 lines in the whole movie, the rest of his on screen time was taken up by head nods, blank stares and of yes, more black stares. Did I say blank stares ?Don't waste you time. There are a lot of good free movies on Amazon Prime.... this just doesn't happen to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Science' Fiction it's not....","review":"The basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society. Yes, it's been done before but still holds promise. The plot was adequate.The acting was believable - no complaints there. I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as 'Mace'. And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor.But what ruined the movie for me was the science. I'm not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies. And I realize that movies are not 'real'. But I've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie. My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.I could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night. It spoiled the whole movie for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell's worst movie","review":"This is Kurt Russell's worst movie.

That's exactly what happened to me with Soldier, but this movie was made in 1998!!This is the kind of movie, acting, and directing that gives sci-fi a bad name outside a few franchises, and ensures we don't get much in the way of original movies. Kurt Russell packs wide-eyed looks into the camera as a substitute for acting; the director uses generic music and sudden and *dramatic* slow-motion shots to add 'feeling' to the movie. The world is eternally dark and gloomy, only lit by the constant over-bright fires.Kurt Russell is too big a name for this movie, and none of the other parts are done any justice by the terrible acting.One of the worst movies I've seen in a LONG time! Ranks up there with Battlefield Earth and Lost in Space."},{"rating":"1","title":"abysmal","review":"If you are going to make a film in someone's back yard, at least there should be some gripping dialog or novel character development. This film was horrendously bad, trotting out all the scifi and action movie clichés, without adding anything to them. Russell's macho posing can't hide the utter lack of thought that goes into his character. This movie was made on a shoestring to take advantage of people (like me) who are stupid enough to see anything that smacks of scifi and action. No more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"We just happened to be channel surfing and came across the opening credits for this movie. We had no idea what the name of the movie was, but it sure peaked our interest! Every time I wanted to change the channel, I kept going back to it because I didn't want to miss anything!! I dont even like futuristic movies like this! I love Kurt Russell and he barely said anything in the movie, but it sure didn't matter. I had to google this movie just to get the name of it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, poor editing, some cheezy scenes","review":"The original plot and awesome fighting scenes make this one a winner. The only problem i had with the film was the editing. Some parts of the film were very choppy and did not flow well. One really cheap shot was when Sergant Todd was barred from the village and they showed a side shot of him crying....it was really horrible to see. If you can bare to see some really corny scenes, you'll enjoy this movie. Hey, another stupid scene was the christmas party/battlefield metaphor. What a crock! Well anyway, it was well worth the $3.76 i spent to rent the movie. I may buy the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspension of disbelief is difficult","review":"Good Kurt Russell.

I know a lot of people don't like the theme, but if you consider Hitler and other people of that type, you can see how such an idea for such a negative soilder might develop - which is a good premise for a sci-fi type of theme. It should be interesting to the army buff or sci-fi buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starring Kurt Russell-- and the Commish!!!","review":"Every once in a while (actually, pretty much every time Kurt Russell makes a movie), a movie comes around that sucks so bad that you really have to love it. Soldier is such a movie. From the asinine plot to the cheesey special effects, this movie blows-- but I loved it so much that the first time I watched it, I literally had to watch it twice in a row! I really don't see how anyone could not love this movie, especially since it also stars Garey Busey AND the Commish (who knows his real name?). So despite sucking, this movie comes with very high recommendations. You WILL be entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked the idea behind the film","review":"First of all, I like most things militaristic. This movie is sort of inspiring to the military types; with Kurt Russells utter lack of visible emotion and stringent discipline. Perfect! It is what every truelly dedicated soldier/sailor/sniper/grunt would LOVE to achieve. The only thing that I feel keeps the film from being in the five star catagory is just a couple of things. I would have liked to see more of the childhood. Maybe a touch of inner dialog from Todd. And then towards the end...wish I could know what happened to the colonists and the soldiers. Wanting to know these little details is what promoted my interest in the film to the point that I wondered if the movie was based on a Sci-fi book of some kind. If anyone is aware of a written version of this film I would certainly like to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really","review":"i did not really like this movie i like kurt russell but not in this movie u could tell that is was sooo totally fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Jewel","review":"The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it sounded incredibly dated, with nasal vocals and songwriting that lacked any semblance of craft. First impressions could not have been more wrong.Buy this record. Be patient, stay with it, let it draw you into its unique and haunting world. The honesty, sensitivity, and sheer melodic invention of \\"Genesis\\" is simply astonishing. The songs have a musical logic all their own, with layers of complexity that only repeated listenings can reveal. The wonderfully psych-y Crystal Fountain song is my favorite, but magic permeates every cut on the album.The harmonies are Beatlesque, always reaching for the unexpected interval. No boring, predictable triads here--musical surprises abound.If you're weary of today's shallow, uninspired, and self-involved singer-songwriters, you need this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful vocals, fine songs","review":"Hippyish sixties soft vocal rock never sounded this good. To be fair, the tunes rock out in places too (great bass playing throughout!), but the mellower moments really stick with you and 'by the sea' is tremendous and heartbreaking. The Flower sisters?

Wow, what a blast of truth and a fresh new realization about everday life in south central Los Angeles. Toomer, narrator and main character, lives a life and experiences things everyday that most people could never deal with. I never expected a book that deals with all the bad things about inner city life to focus on the little bits of happiness and joy that its inhabitants find and turn those bits into something much bigger and more meaningful. I laughed, cried, and did not want the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing yet accurate","review":"It is hard to believe that a child can go through so many dramas at such a young age. Sunny Toomer witnessed a tremendous amount of violence that no one should have to experience. I never knew San Pedro had that much violence. Even though some of the stories in the book were disturbing, like the one where Angel and Yancey cut the hitchhikers finger off, the book was still really good. He had an interesting life. My favorite story was the last story when Sunny helped deliever the baby.

Without this device, you can set some of the dimmer options manually, but I found it confusing and sometimes my changes didn't seem to take. To cross-link one dimmer to another, you have to set one up to listen, then run to the other one to talk; a lot of running back and forth.This device, along with the \\"Homelinc\\" software (there are other packages available) discovers new devices, allows you to set ramp rates and on-levels for each dimmer, allows you to cross-link one dimmer to another, tests dimmer controls, saves backups of your entire configuration, and can control all lighting from the computer, either immediately or by a schedule.

In most cases, labels never combine songs that were recorded under another label. That is the reason that most artists have more than one greatest hits cd. Additionally, this cd includes many songs that were not singles, but some that I always felt should have been released as a single (specifically, Aint No Love In The Heart of the City, Same Old Story (Same Old Song), Let Your Feelings Show, and After The Best, which I think can compete with any country song currently out there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!!","review":"I bought this CD because it had one of my favorite Crystal Gale songs \\"Baby What About You\\", which isn't easily found on her so-called \\"greatest hits\\" CDs. All tracks have been digitally remastered and they sound GREAT. Although I bought the CD for that one song, I was pleasantly suprised to find that it's loaded with good ones. It's almost like going to a small, jazzy club and listening to her sing. Her voice is at its beautiful best on this CD.

It seems to me that this needs to either be removed, altered, or attached to the underside of the bug shield, the latter of which did.3. No extras are included in package, i.e. if you happen to drop one of the plastic pieces screw plugs, good luck finding it; to EGR's credit though they will ship you replacement's free of charge.Finally: I would repurchase this product and recommend it to a Highlander owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Jimmy Stewart!","review":"My boyfriend introduced me to this movie.

Meg Ryan was the daughter of the woman who owned the shop in the original and Tom Hanks' grandfather used to date her. Perhaps they were the original characters.

This is the original cast, director, and story. There are imitations such as the Tom Hanks' \\"You've Got Mail\\" or the 1950's musical version, \\"In the Good Old Summertime\\" starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson. For my money this 1940 classic still tugs at my heart. And it can be considered a Christmas movie since it climaxes at the holiday's eve.No one could ask more than Jimmy Stewart and Margret Sullivan in the leads. And the supporting cast, character actors like Frank Morgan andFelix Bressart, are gems that are not to be found today. Its message is love and companionship without all the pretenses we build in our day to day lives. This lesson is a true Christmas present, gift wrapped and given to us by Ernst Lubitsch in a way no other director could.

It had the romance of the 1940's, was simple and straightforward, yet held my attention for the entire movie. It also had great subplots, unlike the modern version with Tom Hanks. I like old fashion movies, and this is one of them. It was romantic, without being Shmaltzy.

What I really wanted to comment on was how great the cover art for this DVD is! Wow, a real improvement of the old cover art, and really, just a great image! I love the little picture of the guy chasing the girl along the bloody blade. Pretty much fits with the creepy movie, about an author who struggles to survive a night of unrelenting terror at the hands of a mad stalker, all set in an isolated castle in Greece. Great movie, a definite recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake widescreen!","review":"While this 2003 version is better color corrected and clearer than the full screen 1999 dvd release, it is just hacked off the top and bottom.

All modern wide tv's have a zoom feature that allows you to watch 4x3 video in 16x9 if you wish. The only way to see all the nice tidbits (especialy actress wardrobe malfunctions etc) is to view a full screen version. (dvd releases that are especialy bad about this are; \\"1 million years bc\\" with Raquel Welch, and \\"Vampire lovers\\" with Madeline Smith. 2 good releases are, \\"embrace of the vampire\\" (alyssa milano) and \\"Two Moon Junction\\" (sherilyn fenn). They have both versions on the disk. Though like I said, black masking is worse than useless. The up shot is that there is still no good dvd release of this little gem of a movie.

I did not do that in the case of Every Sunday. This book was horrible from every angle. The characters were stereotypical, one dimensional at best, the dialogue was childish and the plot a complete and utter joke. To be brief: Before the older father dies, he tells his son to say goodbye to his long time mistress. Turns out the son meets and falls for the mistress after they meet. The mistress is a professor at Brown University. The son is an uneducated goombah with gold chains around his neck who runs his dead father's hardware store. The son's big claim to fame is he knows someone at the parking violations bureau to get your parking tickets expunged. You couldn't make up a dumber plot.

That is anoing and boring.If you want to read this book go ahead but if you are board then you shood of have listened to me and not of have read the book.

He thinks about a blue car speeding down a road saying the car still gets many miles still needs to go before he sleeps.The main characters of the book were Jack, Blue, Yellow dog named Sky it just talked about the day. The main idea was how the dog was and the boy Jack the book described them about how they look and how the boy took care of Sky.I think this book was interesting because what it talk about a blue car and a yellow dog. But it was of for a person that likes poetry cause on every page it was pages. It was a little hard to understand and when you read it changes what it talks about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Better","review":"Love That Dog by Sharon Creech is written in a poetry form. Normally I would enjoy that type of story, but the poetry was a little dry. The reason I think that is because when I was reading the book I constontly thought of ways to say things that would make the story more interesting without changeing the plotline. If you were to read this book, the story is about a boy who hates poetry. Later his teacher teaches him to enjoy poetry. If you would like to read a book in the format in poetry I would reccomend Witness, by Walter Dean Myers."},{"rating":"1","title":"love that dog","review":"~*LOVE THAT DOG*~Love that dog is about poems, and only poems. You would think it was about dog, because of the title but its not, I thought it was about dogs so I got it, but its not at all about dogs, It's hard to follow because it's written in poetry writing. It's very boring. And also that it only about hundred pages, and its really easy to read. In conclusion, if you don't like poems then don't check this book out if you do like poems then go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love that dog is nothing about dogs what so ever, and I thought that it was going to be all about dogs. This book is about Poems. I would have never read it if the cover never said Love That Dog. This book is hard to follow because it written in poems and it is really boring and does not interest me at all. I think that if the poems were about dogs then I might have read it?Another things that I thought was that it is are easy to read because it only had 100 pages. Some other things I know about the book is that it switches from poems to poems. I am just trying to let you know that this book is about poems. If you like dogs then this would not be the book for you to read. In conclusion I do not recommend this book unless you like poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That DogLove that dog is a book all about poems. Well, to be honest this book wasn&#65533;t that a great book. Every poem doesn&#65533;t go together like a regular chapter/story book. If it was a poem or a rhyming book that would go together like a storybook, then I&#65533;d read it, other ways I would never read a poem book again. If your wanting a story about dogs this is definitely not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Poetry To Life.","review":"Most simply stated, LOVE THAT DOG is a book about poetry and a boy's love for his pet dog. However, it is more than that. The book uses poetry to tell the story of how one student grew to appreciate and love poetry through the helpful encouragement and advice of a dedicated teacher. The story is told completely through the perspective of the student, Jack, and is written in the poetic stanzas that he writes (almost always unbeknowingly). I really enjoyed reading this book and find it's is a great book to use to help get students interested in poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"jack can write poetry","review":"I think this book is okay. You have to read between the lines to fully understand it. Jack thinks only girls write poetry and he can't. Thoughout the book his teacher guides him to be very succsesful. This book almost reminds me of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry and People","review":"Now I love poetry, but the idea of a novel written in a series of poems had me stumped. I thought \\"This is never going to work. I am going to hate this book.\\"Well, I was wrong. I LOVED this book. I am frantically recommending it to everyone I know because of the unique way it presented one boy's fascination with poetry.Even if you think you'd hate a book written in poems, I recommend reading this book because the story sucks you in, despite any trepidation you may have about the format. It is a very quick read, and well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love That Dog Is Superb!","review":"I love Sharon Creech's books! Love That Dog has become one of my favorites for several reasons. First, it's an easy read. Reluctant readers will gladly pick it up to read. (It's short, but it's jam-packed with good stuff!) Second, the main character, who feels he's incapable of writing poetry, uses poetry to journal his learning of poetry! (The irony!) Kids who don't think they can write poetry can be encouraged from this. Teachers can use this book as a springboard to poetry. And finally, Love That Dog is simply a touching story. It made me cry. I think I might go read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the U. S.","review":"Love that dog is a great poetry novel for all boys and girls who have dog at home. I strongly recommend it especialy for the whole famly to enjoy.The author Sharon Creech is a winner of the Newbery medal for Walk Two Moons. This book is about a boy named jack learning to write a poetry. He chose to write poems about a yellow dog named Sky. This is really good for all ages. If you haven't read it, I strongly recommend you read it because it is a great book for all ages. Hopefully you will like this book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Lve That Dog Too","review":"If you are like me and you don't like to write you will like to write after you read this book. Love That Dog is a good book because I could relate to a boy named Jack didn't like to write and I didn't either. After he found an inspiration and I did too. He wrote a poem about his dog and I wrote a long story about my dogs. That's why I think this a good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Approach","review":"This could be a great new way to approach many things that our kids see as only meant for specific genders. The \\"Act Like A Man\\" concept has us teaching our youngsters that certain things aren't masculine. We as adults know that literature is for everyone, and what a great way to express it.

Using the students poems as a way of communicating with his teacher, the author and winner of The Newberry Medal presents a delightful tale for young children. I think adults will also enjoy this book. And as an added bonus, in the back of the book are the poems which the teachers uses to illustrate her lessons.Do not miss this book if you or your child enjoys poetry or wants to try writing a bit. Even if you're not all that fond of this medium, see if this book doesnt' convince you to read a bit more or even take pen in hand and truy to create some of yoru own poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Almost Died","review":"I almost died of boredom.

A beautiful romance that ends tragically-but draws you in and makes you really feel for the characters. I was weeping after this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film - super sloppy DVD","review":"This is a fabulous film but it is Public Domain and by the Asian writing on the cover I'll assume it is one of many poor quality DVD transfers.

Watch the film if you can but pass on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and Memorable","review":"My mom introduced me to this movie in the 1970's. It is one of her favorites and is still one of mine. Vivien Leigh's ethereal beauty and her delicate portrayal of the crestfallen ballerina are unforgettable. And Robert Taylor gives a buoyant performance as the officer who loves this tragic heroine. For those who have never seen Robert Taylor, he was one of the most handsome leading men of his generation.And the scene where they waltz to \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" certainly must be one of the most romantic and tender scenes in movie history. This is a 5 star tear jerker. Just lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine service - product as described","review":"No complaints with this DVD. It arrived promptly and was just as described.

I almost feel like I know Al Jarreau, having never met him (smile). His music is brilliant, and he is one of the few, very few, musicians I would buy, on sight without the benefit of hearing the music.The above said, this CD is great, but a little tame compared to the Al Jarreau I grew-up with. I like the CD because it's Al's voice, but if this CD had been my first exposure to Jarreau, I am not sure if the 25 year love-affair I've had with his music would have been. If you really want to hear Al Jarreau listen to Live In Europe... I wore the grooves out of that album in high school. ....singing the song shobedo, while birds and rich folks flew-right-on-by... we got by.... (raw Al Jarreau.. the good stuff).Al is still my main-man, but if you want to hear Al's music that took us hard-core Fans by storm look to the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a refreshing and positive album","review":"I heard the cuts from this album on an XM Live Broadcast. I immediately picked up the albumn and was thrilled to hear wood...(acoustic instruments, piano, bass, drums)...this reminded me of his much earlier \\"This Time\\" album which had such a nice jazz flavor to it. I was never a big fan of his pop work as he is such a talented singer, I like it when he puts his talents to the right music.Upon first playing this cd, I noted the similarity to Diana Krall's last album, and I was bemused that they actually back him up on this cd.I particularly liked his rendition of Waltz for Debby, one of my favorite Bill Evans compositions and particularly, his Dizzy arrangement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it!","review":"Al Jarreau is one of my all time favorite jazz vocalists. This album is another example of how wonderful of a vocalist he is. Not only does he sound wonderful, but the band is extremely impressive. It's oftentimes hard to remake others songs and have them sound even better than the original, but Jarreau seems to have done it with ease. As soon as I found out he released a new c.d., I bought it and I am so happy that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Al's best work yet!","review":"This new CD is like sitting in a smoky jazz club listening to Al and his band just groove. From his classic style of scat, to nice twists on old ballads, Al presents us once again with a collection that is sure to thrill all Al Jarreau fans. Thanks to Mr. Jarreau for bringing it to us again with heart and soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of cheap plastic","review":"It looks nice, it looks metal, but everything but the bar itself is plastic (the shower clip, the knob, and the parts that keep them on the wall).

If you like good Folk music then give him a try he sings about political stuff and some of his stuff can be quite funny despite it's serious topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs, Memorable Melodies","review":"In the tradition of folk art, this album tells the stories of those who often can't speak for themselves. From a handicapped lady who considers those of us not in a wheel chair to be \\"temporarily able bodied\\" to the plight of the Nez Perce to the story of Larry the Polar Bear who finds himself under the Artic sun, all the stories are fun or inspiring. Highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Nightingale\\"","review":"This is indeed a lovely story and beautiful interpretation...but simply lacks the \\"pizzazz\\" and \\"sizzle\\" necessary to capture the attention of today's electronically charged child...too slow moving... such is our digital, electronic world. We need to slow it down, but \\"The Nightingale\\" is not a part of the solution. The translation of this story from the book to the screen, in this case, does not work as the pages are too similar in artistic content and graphics, they do not add to the story, unfortunately. Glenn Close's narration is soft and soothing, but ultimately becomes \\"just words\\" as the pace, tempo is too languid.One classroom teacher's opinion only, take it for what it is ... or is not!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No static electricity","review":"The bear wood stove top steamer has made our winters much less \\"shocking.\\" Before adding humidity via this attractive steamer we couldn't pet the cat or turn on an appliance without causing a \\"spark\\" of static electricity. This product does exactly what I purchased it for, and looks good on my black wood-stove. I thought the water would last longer because of the size of the steamer, but when the fire is going full tilt, the bear needs quite a bit of refreshing. IF you burn your stove while you are away, you might want to put the steamer on a cooler part of the stove, if you have one, or remove it to avoid damaging the glaze on the interior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listener-friendly country blues","review":"If you're frustrated by the scratchy sound of old country blues recordings and long for something with good production values (but an old-time sound), then Book might be your man. This collection contains a nice assortment, with a few real gems (\\"The Ballad of Amazing Grace and Side Show Dan\\" is worth the price of the CD). Informative liner notes, written by Book, add to the vibe (\\"Wrote this one on tour up north somewhere, missing my best girl down in St. Pete...\\"). Recommended for those who enjoy country blues done right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd in excellent shape.","review":"Thanks for having this hard to find cd.

However, although some interpretation's on this album are quite acceptable, and some of the material quite intriguing, the arrangements used by Hal Mooney's orchestra are at times really IRRITATING (only a handful of songs is recorded with other orchestras).Even when the emphasis is not on the strings, the music still sounds corny...Just in order to be sure I'm not too strict (being a jazz fan) i gave this album more than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thing of Beauty - Lost Forever","review":"A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Hedy Lamarr had a body which was absolutely beautiful.One scene in Ecstasy showed her beauty, with full frontal nudity, at the young age of 18. It was included in this movie for all the world to see, and appreciate, forever. However, when I puchased this DVD, that particular scene was not included. Some idiot editor deleted that scene.So, now, thanks to some idiot editor at Amazon, that thing of beauty is lost - forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Abe","review":"I love all things Abraham, but this DVD is particularly good. For one thing, it is 222 minutes long, so you really get your money's worth time-wise. Also, a wide variety of topics are covered in unique ways. Abe always gives a great perspective on life -- uplifting, wise, and always spiritual. Abraham Hicks will be the salvation of the 21st century. Seriously. If you have not yet discovered this philosophy, it is time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham is good.","review":"I never get tired of listening to the wisdom of Abraham.

I am on my second read-through of the series, and this time I am buying them as I read them. I have never been interested in the sea or ships or the military, (I used to wonder why anyone would have a painting of a ship in their house, waste of wall space), but now I have a whole new respect and admiration. Patrick O'Brien brings the English navy to life in a way that evokes feelings of pride, sympathy, horror, elation and pure heart-pounding anticipation. The contrast of the main characters, Aubrey and Maturin, is amusing sometimes, often heart-warming. The galaxy of supporting characters is rich with personalities and details. The only character I really don't like is Diana, but she does lend another facet to Stephen's persona. All in all, I highly recommend this series, they are the best historical novels I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The letter of Marque\\" Patrick Obrian","review":"Historically accurate as usual, characters come alive on the page- my knees are sore from holystoneing the deck!\\"The letter of Marque"},{"rating":"2","title":"Treason's Harbour","review":"A fine book, consistent with all of the entire series of Aubrey/Maturin books by author Patrick O'Brian.

The best sax man in Latin was the \\"Stan Getz of Cuba\\" Chombo Silva but he recorded almost nothing. So based on this Spanish language title I hoped for some Latin saxophone, at least. Strangly this bargain basement album has no Latin elements at all, strangly each cut is preceded by sounds of ocean waves breaking on seashores and sounds of seagulls! Surprise, the two musicians appear to be Gringos-pianist Jim Roberts, sax man John Orsini. Serendipity however, this album of long and cool jazz sounds like Bill Evans if he played with Ben Webster! Reminiscent of a walk down bistro with an awning overhead, a dark, dank midnight at a sultry lounge in New York-or Paris-the jazz offerings are terrific!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1973 filming","review":"The plot of the story was, i admit, enticing and well thought out. However, the film quality is horrible. Mel Gibson himself stated that he wished the film never saw daylight. It's a cheap flick you can find in bargain bins for a buck fifty, i know, thats where i got mine. The only reason it's part of my collection is because im a die hard and dedicated mel fan...thats it. You can't get through the entire movie without turning it off...the sound is horrible, and the picture is very unclear. Very low grade flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best debut I've ever seen","review":"A very interesting movie and great acting for a debut film, if you can get past the very odd camera angles and ocasional dumb old joke this is a worth while great film Mel Gibson all the way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taos, New Mexico","review":"This book was my Christmas present to me.

These guys weren't all that as they say today and it shows. In order for material to be \\"timeless\\" it's gotta be good and the people that made it have to have real talent and expertise. These guys were half-baked players at the time they cut this stuff and they are garbage band players even by today's standards which means they suck. They are so bad that I don't even think MTV would let them posture and jump up and down, even if they smoked cigs, had tatoos, and jammed all kinds of metal shards thru their lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight ahead Ballads and Blues w/ seriously mellow groove!","review":"You can't go wrong with this CD. With Lester Young, the listener always knows what he/she is getting: soft, silky yet full bodied sax with a heavy groove. It is one of THE classic, late night mellow mood pieces. Many of the songs contain wonderful trumpet and piano solos, adding a truly majestic depth to the music. This is a great place to start a jazz collection; also consider Stan Getz (or Lester Young) with the Oscar Peterson trio. Finally, if you want to get addicted to jazz, please consider the all time classic by Zoot Simms and Joe Pass: \\"Blues For Two\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"THe hard case broke with in 10 days with out any dammage.

Then started stalling mid-shred. In order to get it going you have to reverse it out and push down on the paper to get it to start shredding again, and I'm talking about 1 or 2 sheets of regular paper. Another way is to shove more paper in, that seems to start it up. So, unless you like manhandling your shredder, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Priced for about $40, this shredder is quite expensive for what you get: A Piece of Junk! I bought this and it jammed the first second I used it! I put in three sheets of paper and it made a motor-grinding sound, generated a burnt plastic smell and then completely stalled. I had to constantly hit the reverse and forward buttons until the papers cleared.

At least I had the last laugh. I estimate it worked ok initally, sometimes shredding 2 sheets at a time, but not easily for the first 300 sheets. After that it would only handle 1 sheet at a time. To date I estimate Ive shredded about 800 sheets with it. Today it wouldnt even do one sheet without jamming. It always jammed meaning it clogs with paper and you have to reverse it or clear by hand each time. It looks like a shredder but it really isnt one. Dont waste your money. I owned it for about 6 years and only do light household shredding, tax forms and credit card applications and old bills, not that much to ask, but I guess it was. I'm looking for a replacement now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better flavors","review":"I have tried almost all of the La Briute flavors as I travel to places that don't have kosher services rather often.

Remember these are by no means gourmet but it is sufficient considering what it is.As a general note the chicken ones are pretty good, the beef ones are simply OK, and the vegeterian ones are not fit for human consumption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special book!","review":"Although they were different in many ways, The Wasp Eater reminded me a little of The Secret Life of Bees. If you liked that one, give this one a try. This is a wonderfully told story by a writer who knows how to describe certain the details of something in such a way you already perceive them but didn't realize you did until you read his description! Such talent! I hope to see future work from Mr. Lychack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"William Lychak is a brilliant new writer who captivated me with his poetic yet insightful examination of a relationship between a father and son. He creates a heartbreaking tale about loss and longing in his novel about every child's desire to keep his family intact despite the ramifications and touches a nerve that resonates for each reader. If you appreciate beautifully crafted prose you will certainly appreciate this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wasp Eater, A Brilliant First Novel","review":"This book is a real keeper! Not the typical summer best seller or beach book, The Wasp Eater brilliantly depicts basic elements in the tragedy of a broken family. Coming from a child's point of view, the narrative sensitively reveals Daniel's movement towards understanding. Through the development of his characters, Lychack demonstrates his perception of our tragic inability to communicate our needs to one another. Using the poignancy of idealism and hope opposed by inevitable weaknesses of character, the writer has produced a timeless and universal image of growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS ONE - TRUST ME!","review":"Beyond a doubt, this is one of the best bits of writing I have come across in several years. I would hate to classify it as a novel, per se, as it is more akin to a short story, or short narrative. The author's use of language is wonderful, lyrical yet rather shocking. The author touches on so many emotions and does it so well, that this one is bound to stay with you for some time. Very highly recommend this one, and I promise you will not be sorry after reading it. Hope we get more of the same from Mr. Lychack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"This is a thoughtful well-written book that explores many facets of family relationships.

This is the lazy way to release an old film. Nothing could have been easier than to have re-worked this film in a full-frame version with the NASA footage sections returned to their original dimensions, which are naturally full-frame. You'd think it would have been a breeze with the available technology and software. Instead of being able to advertise a newly restored version that's better than the original theatrical release ever was, they end up with a DVD that's getting pathetic reviews and which isn't likely to sell. Sales from the corrected version would surely have offset the cost of the easy re-working of the film. The problem here lies with whoever is responsible for marketing this stuff. Come on MGM - you're supposed to be better than this. How about actually THINKING first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst in my collection","review":"As an aviation enthusiast, and particularly the X-15, I eagerly awaited the DVD to come out. I went over it in less than 2 minutes. The important scenes, the NASA footage, are so badly stretched beyond recognition, that I will keep my VHS copy from TV broadcast as my main copy, at least the plane sequences were ok there. Terribly disappointing.Will have to wait until spacecraft-films will release their documentary on the X-15 (announced since last year). Shame on you, MGM !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Fix The Anamorphic Stretch","review":"Being an aviation enthusiast, I welcome any DVD release pertaining to aviation. \\"X-15\\" is no exception, even though this picture leaves much to be desired. I am especially critical of the official US Air Force photography of the X-15, the B-52, and the F-100 and F-104 chase plane sequences. Originally shot in the \\"flat\\" format, then viewed with an anamorphic \\"scope\\" lens, the images are stretched, so that these sequences are very distracting. I saw this film in the theater, and it was equally distracting there. With a now very sucessful director like Richard Donner and a studio like MGM, you would have thought the DVD release could have been corrected. A true disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideously distorted visuals, lousy plot and characters","review":"As others have said, the archival NASA footage that makes up much of the film is s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d to fit the Panavision format, resulting in grotesquely distorted aircraft and people. And unfortunately, the film wasn't very good to begin with. My advice: stay away from this stinker. If you want a good (not great, but good) rocket test pilot movie with undistorted archival footage, try \\"Toward the Unknown.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I remember","review":"The movie is just as I remember it all those years ago.

It looks like most conventional TV's are 4.33:1, so.... what does this mean? My 4.33 TV stretches this movie out the picture twice what it was meant for. The images are squished looking. The B-52 in this looks like a flying Queen Mary.

It is helpful to my young son whom is learning Violin. Nice quality, thick, and suitable for framing."},{"rating":"2","title":"violin chart","review":"This wall chart is much larger than I expected which made finding a spot on my wall to put it a bit of a problem. It is great for showing the parts and names of the violin and the bow, but I was hoping for a chart that addressed itself more to the actual location on each string of all the notes. Yes they are there, but the violin is placed horizontally on the chart - I would find it easier for me to find my notes if the violin was placed vertically on the chart. Yes, I could hang the chart differently and I may have to do that. Also, there is other information on the chart, that, for me as a novice violinist, is not adequately explained as to meaning. I will have to take the chart to my instructor and have it explained. I don't want to discourage you from buying it. It is a good visual aid, I just think that with some thought it could be improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The horror...\\"","review":"Originally released in 1970, Arnie's first film made it to video in 1991 and quietly died on the shelves. This re-release gives us a chance to see him in his Mr. Universe prime and is absolutely one of the most inadvertently hilarious movies in the history of man. The thing that kills me is the dubbing. Schwarzenegger could hardly speak English so they dubbed the voice to hilarious outcome. After seeing this, you might also want to check out Pumping Iron, an excellent documentary in which we see Arnie utterly humiliate Lou Ferigno (in front of his parents!) and play the cruelest practical joke ever. I love this guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!!","review":"Words can't describle how cheesy this movie is even by 1970 standards. But that is what makes it so funny. This is a great movie for watching on a lazy rainy afternoon after you've called out sick from the office. The best scene is Hercules fighting the escaped grisly bear in the park. The bear fights standing up and is throwing punches like a boxer. Hysterical!!! Monty Python would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"greekgodawful","review":"On a budget that makes Blair Witch seem like a Hollywood blockbuster, with production values that would be shamed by your child's high school play, with actors designed to make Arnie seem like Lawrence Olivier, with a director whose only experience was apparently shooting his kid's birthday parties, with a writer who doesn't know he writes comedy, here is a movie you can laugh at, not with. It fascinates like a train wreck and speaking of children, watching our governator get his start makes you feel proud. It also makes you feel that no matter what you have done, you can still be a success. I read that the guv donated a couple million of his 30 for T3 back to help finance the special effects. If he has any pride he will do the same to re-do this one. I think it was all done for about $29.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"As a huge fan of both Greek Mythology and Arnold Schwartzenegger, I loved the movie. I prefer the version where you hear Arnold's real voice instead of the dubbed version. The first time i seen it it was dubbed and that was kind of cheesy, it was much easier to watch with his voice. (Of course I think his voice is pretty sexy) It is great to see Arnold when he was only 22 or 23 years old. I would definately reccomend this movie to anyone that is a fan of either Greek Mythology or Arnold Schwartzenegger...........but if possible, watch it with his voice, not the dubbed over version"},{"rating":"1","title":"did we watch the same movie?","review":"THis has got to be the biggest waste of resources to produce this DVD. I don't care if they restored the Arnold soundtrack, it didn't help. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The only thing worth it is if you want to see Arnold 10 years before his career really took off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arnold uber alles!","review":"I watched this last night on AMC (because this is, obviously, a classic). They showed the version with Arnold's real voice, what a hoot! Enjoy a young Arnold (still approaching the peak of his bodybuilding career, and proportioned much differently than he is today) walking around New York in ill-fitting sweaters and sans-a-belt pants, scoring a swinging girlfriend, and getting mixed up with mobsters. Believe it or not, there is a plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This old film wasnt so bad...","review":"If you like old New York specifically of the late sixties and seventies then you will probably find some real interest in the film. I have read reviews in which some one said it was so terrible it was good. Not so its actually in my opinion a good film and kinda timeless. It has humor, can appeal to many ages and you get to see Schwarzenegger in his prime. The whole story fits as light hearted comedy of sorts akin to a movie such as a Chevy Chase, Steve Martin or other late night comedy film might be. In this sense though it is indirect. Not quite a full comedy more a fairy tale fictional fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Receipent loved it","review":"Hi, DVD was a gift for a friend who remembered movie from his childhood.

Not only did it look [inexpensive], but the acting, my God the acting! I am usually a fan of Arnie's films(other than Batman & Robin)but I couldn't stand hearing that voice of his, well actually it wasn't his voice. Just a campy dubbed version of what a muscular guy would sound like. I guess I could give Arnie a break, after all it was only his first film. If you haven't seen this film yet, I strongly recommend it just for a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOOD FOR THE GODS!!!","review":"Whether you're up for horrible direction, terrible dialogue, bad dubbing, rod iron lightning bolt throwing, immigrant Austrian bodybuilders wrestling men in bear suits, or the world's greatest drinking game; you can't go wrong with the first starring vehicle of an almost prepubescent Arnold Schwarzenegger in the celluloid classic that is \\"Hercules in New York\\".So dim the lights, crank up the original Arnold audio track, and prepare yourself for endless hours of fun and laughs between you and your friends. Remember, when in doubt, \\"Smile!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"cult film for bodybuilding fanatics","review":"This film is a must for those who love bodybuilders. It is actually a comedy, but every 5 minutes or so you see Arnold take off a piece of clothing and flex. This was his first film so his bod is more beautiful than in any of his other films.

It's no wonder this movie never did well at the box office. The storyline and the acting was extremely bad and very cheezy. It should be considered a spoof, rather than an actual movie.

If you want to see poor acting, this is YOUR movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad that it's...really awful","review":"The dual billing of Arnold Stang and Arnold \\"Strong\\" is the first hint to this film's cult legacy. Old-timey comedian Arnold Stang and the future gubernator team up in this hammy and cheesy fish-out-of-the-Mediterranean film from 1969. Most of the supporting cast is made of petrified wood, though veteran actor James Karen was somehow enticed into this Z-grade effort. Horrible production values approach the night-as-day scenes inImpulse, including car horns evident on Mount Olympus.It would be eight more years before Schwarzenegger made a proper introduction to audiences inPumping Iron, and I suppose there is a certain charm in seeing the big guy for the first time. But Hercules in New York would really only be worth watching with snarky commentary. The only reason I didn't rate it one-star is because of the laugh factor. But the laugh factor isn't high enough. The pity factor, on the other hand, is off the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dubbing Arnold's Voice= Genius","review":"The main reason to get this movie is to hear the dubbed voice it's so ridiculous I could'nt stop laughing the movie starts with Hercules going to N.y. where he meets an older gentleman named Pretzy who coincidentally sells pretzels late he meets a pretty women and try's to woo her more hilarity ensues, the begining of the movie is great where you hear the voice actor the most,Later Hercules goes into wrestling to pay his debts(it gets boring themovie slows down from here) later is chased by mafia men who he owes money(the chase scene is way too longthe editor needed to do a better job) another thing I love is Arnold mannerism's in the movie and pretzy's facial expressions I only saw the movie with the voice actor's voice It's painful and very hard to understand Arnold but it can be funny at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"Great product.... fyi make sure you get the arbor for it.

Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured; either way, these two books were not that great. The sixth one was especially aggravating! The character development was poor; the plot was choppy. It was as if the author was trying to minimize words, frequently giving summaries of what had just occurred, rather than allowing you to enjoy it yourself. Without spoiling, the romance aspect of this book completely failed, and was completely unbelievable. Stick with the original four and skip the latter two."},{"rating":"2","title":"SATISFYING SEQUEL TO \\"BEYOND THE GATHERING STORM\\"!!!","review":"As an avid christian fiction reader, I eagerly await new books by my favorite authors.

I was incredibly pleased to see her continue on last year, with \\"Beyond the Gathering Storm\\" and I have been anxiously awaiting this book. It is supurbly written and was satisfying in the end. There is just enough suspense to make it impossible to put down. It is a book that reminds the reader how important faith in God really is and that if you listen to Him, you will not choose the wrong path for you life.

All arguments for and against Mr. Eliot can be countered easily and each have in them flaws that are substantial. T. S. Eliot cannot be read like most poets. Like the eastern scriptures he so loved, Eliot will take a lifetime for the reader to digest. Read and re-read. Question and re-read again. I became familiar with his works years ago. I have yet to tire of them. Eliot will grow with you, for his poems are the story of a man always growing and always searching. Discount the fighting that academics have over him. Read him for yourself. Immerse yourself in the spiral of darkness and light that is his poetry and judge for yourself. In the end, no matter what you think, you will not be able to deny his effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Yep, this is a great collection of Eliot's works.

This product has a chrome, not a non-stick, finish but nothing sticks to it. the simple trick - and I assume it would work with failing 'non-stick' products also, is to heat the basket to grill/fire temperature before putting the vegetables or fish in it. Sure it's a little more complicated, but the results are worth it. Just used ours for the first time tonight. We heated the basket on the grill then opened it up (still on the grill) poured in the vegetables which were marinaded in an oil base, closed up the basket and cooked for 5 +5 minutes each side. Veggies came our perfectly grilled, nice grill marks on them from the basket not one stuck to the basket.

Amazon is great they took it back and gave a credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEWARE","review":"This game is highly addictive. I got this for Christmas and we played it non-stop for the whole weekend. Many different cards and ways to gain points make this game a little more complex than the board game. After playing it a couple times, you get the hang of strategies needed to win and can pick it up pretty easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game...","review":"When I ordered the card game, I was hoping it would be like the standard board game. This is not the case. Initially my fiance and I weren't entirely sure we enjoyed the game but having played it a few times, we're hooked!An average game seems to take about 75 minutes to complete. I still have yet to win a game as I seem to be too caught up in the newness of the game to be concerned with strategy (at least that's what I'm telling myself!).In terms of fun, I still prefer the board game but the card game is a nice alternative when you're lacking a third player."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun, but not a quick game","review":"I really enjoy playing this game. It is a little different from the original board game in that there is more luck involved. Also, it doesn't take an hour to play, as it states on the box; it's more like 2 hours or even 2 1/2. But if youy have a friend and a free afternoon, it's a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"janetsi venezuela","review":"este producto esta bien en la condiciones esperadas, entrega por el vendedor a tiempo, sin ningún problema segun lo requerido gracias, lo recomiendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"nunca recibi el producto","review":"estoy muy insatisfecho xq nunca recibi este producto, lo enviaron y lo entregaron en la direccion equivocada porque nunca llego a la direccion de destino, favor exigo que me entregen mi producto o me devuelvan el dinero"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon is the best","review":"What can I say?

The Wenger brand tends to cater more to the economy market, and I think it shows in this Eau De Toilette.It's a decent fragrance, but like another comment said, it doesn't last very long. I'd also add that it's not very distinctive. It reminds me somewhat of the old Brut cologne or an aftershave. Keep in mind that it's an \\"Eau De Toilette\\"; it's a little weaker than a \\"Parfume\\" -- which isn't bad, it just means you have to use a little more to get the same level of scent.I'm not unhappy with it, but I don't think I'd get it again now that I've tried it out.

But i dont. The problem isnt the recipes, they are well authored, there is a lot of information about the ingredients, there are several variations of many recioes. The problem is the kindlization of the book. There are two indexes, Subjects and Recipes. Neither contains page numbers or location numbers or hot links. So they are just a list of things you could,at best, consider to be search terms. However, you cannot rely on their finding anything useful. Case in point: the subject index contains the phrase \\"tips for starters\\" as in sourdough starters. If you enter this term in your kindle search, you get one result: the listing in the Subject Index. Circular and useless. I own many Kindle cookbooks. This one is poorly crafted and frustrating to use. Stick to paper on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extensive Resource, Great Recipes","review":"I have made over 10 different breads from this book. All have turned out to be perfect! I have read over 10 other bread machine cookbooks and find this to be one of the best. Great tips throughout the book. This will work well for bread machine beginners or advanced bakers. I cannot understand why some other reviewers have been so negative towards this resource. The instructions are clear. Her section for beginners literally takes you step-by-step to make a perfect loaf. The troubleshooting section is somewhat slim, but it did solve a problem I was having. I wish the book had a glossary and nutritional listings for each recipe. I think this is money very well spent.

It also has great facts about bread-making and the author includes short stories about where each recipe originated, which I think makes the recipes more than just a recipe. The only thing I wish I knew before I purchased this book was that almost every recipe calls for vital gluten. Which I'm having to place a specialty order to get it. I'd prefer to buy all the ingredients needed at the local grocery store. But the author does provide an explanation for why they've included this ingredient and it is vital :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"A pretty thorough book that keeps it simple and explains a lot of things so that when you put it down, even if you don't have a recipe for what you want exactly, you are pretty sure you can wing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make note: MANY of these recipes don't work!","review":"I rarely write reviews but I was so disappointed by this book that I felt moved to share my dismay and even warn others not to buy it. I've made lots of good bread in my Zojirushi from borrowed recipes, but the first recipe I made out of this book just yielded a panful of baked crumbs! I couldn't even imagine what went wrong--I had followed the recipe to the letter, and it wasn't a case of bad yeast (although the author's discussion of yeast is confusing and makes one doubt the validity of every recipe in the book). I wasted 4 and a half cups of good whole wheat flour on this recipe, not to mention 3 and a half tablespoons of vital wheat gluten--now if that couldn't make the crumbs stick together, nothing could! I wish I had taken these one-star reviews more seriously before I bought this book. I'm wondering now how to return the first book I've ever returned to Amazon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Almost all of the recipes involve using gluten of which I have unfortunately not been unable to find in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to read, too much like a text book","review":"This book had many, many words and great descriptions, but it was a lot to read - probably great if you're a serious baker, but we're much more casual and would have preferred more pictures, fewer words, and something more simple to take you from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!

I was so impressed that the author included a breakdown for all measurements that are not on the usual measuring tools.Making bread requires exact measurements and many recipes will call for a measurements that most cooks do not use and this book has taken out any guess work and you can just refer to the listing that goes into great detail and you, the cook, does not have to take the time to calculate anything, it is all covered by the author.Many recipes are given in many sections for not only a finished baked good but also toppings. This book has been so helpful to me and has improved my knowledge on baking and learning many short cuts that are so useful in daily cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The best move I made towards having always freshly baked bread at any time of the day, after buying a breadmaker!!! Easy to use, easy to find ingredients, for a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my bread maker from the back of the cupboard!","review":"If you gave up the desire for making your own bread because the recipes that came with your machine are just OK, find your bread machine in the back of the cupboard, get this book, and discover the joy of breadmaking. I received it as a Christmas present and it's amazing! The recipes are so easy and delicious. I purchased a dorm sized refrigerator for in the basement to store all my flours and seeds. I love to bake but would have never imagined the enjoyment that I've received from using the recipes in this book and my family reaps the reward! You will not be disappointed in your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfactory cookbook","review":"I have tried very few of the recipes in this book. The reason is, well, I am lazy. The book is written for machines that produce 1.5 or 2 lbs loaves. My family is small so I opted for a Zojirushi Mini that makes 1 lb loaves. NOW, I am perfectly capable of doing the calculations to divide the 2 lb recipes in half, but I just don't care to do so. I grab my Bread Machine Magic cookbook because it has tables in it for the ingredients and is set up for 1 lb. Reading the table is so fast, that I can toss together bread in just a bit longer than it takes me to set up the coffee maker. And I have enjoyed the outcome of the recipes, so that is my GO-TO recipe book. One of these days I will branch out and try more of these recipes for variety or something special, but I have a feeling that my BMM cookbook will be filled with notes and comments long before this book is pulled off the shelf. If you have a full size machine or don't mind doing calculations, it's probably really awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Bread Lovers","review":"I love this book, it has so many wonderful tips for using my bread machine and so many unique breads and dessert breads that I couldn't really believe it. This book is a must have a for anyone that loves bread and baking it. The author has done the testing work and made it easy to just add the ingredients and enjoy the bread! I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a bread machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book to experiment with bread making","review":"I bought this book in conjunction with a West Bend bread machine about 10 months ago. I'd never baked bread before by hand or otherwise so I thought a good book about it would be helpful. This book has been well used! For a while, I was actually trying to make every recipe in the book. I've made around 100 recipes, making bread 2-3 times a week. My family especially loves all the pizza doughs and pizza recipes. I didn't buy the bread machine with pizza in mind but we have it every other week now! We especially like the corn meal dough but they've all turned out quite well. In fact, few of the breads didn't turn out. Mostly it was my error in measuring or turned out to be too sweet for my family (big sourdough or French bread fans). I still have hardly tapped the recipes using starters - that's my next step."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the simple to the complex, many recipes to choose from","review":"I have made several recipes from this book and all have come out really well. The franskbrod bread came out just beautifully multiple times. There are recipes ranging from the simple to the complex so if you are in the mood for easy or challenging, this book has it covered. The measurements are very clear and easy to use with items you probably already own such as measuring cups and measuring spoons. As with any bread machine recipe, it is well advised to also own a water thermometer so the water temp is in the correct range unless you own a bread machine that takes the extra time to bring ingredients up to temp, which I do not. The only ingredient that you may have a hard time finding if you live in a small town is Vital Wheat gluten which is used in many recipes. If that is the case, the Betty Crocker Bread Machine cookbook doesn't use gluten in the ingredient listing so you might want to try that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bread every time","review":"I received a bread machine and this book for Christmas and they have been used at least once a week since then. I usually make 1 lb loaves by halving the 2 lb recipes and it has worked really well. The 1 lb size is ideal for two people and the shape of the loaf works for sandwiches. None of the loaves have been a disappointment so far. I had never used a bread machine before and found the introduction to bread machines and their ingredients very helpful. I compared it with the user manual for my Cuisinart machine and there were no contradictions. The book provides more information than the manual. I used to make yeast breads by hand, but I think those days are over for me!I love the Honey Wheat Bread and Vienna Bread recipes in the book. They're great, and the Vienna bread has a wonderful texture - I have a loaf on the final rise in my bread machine right now and can't wait to eat it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This book was just okay. Some of the recipes are nice and then there was the disaster I tried to make! I should have known better too! I tried the sweet bread with the crushed sugar cubes mixed in (I forget the name of the recipe in the book). Adding sugar cubes (even crushed!) to a non-stick bread machine bread pan is NOT a good idea! It totally ruined my bread pan by severely scratching the non-stick coating. AND I got nice non-stick coating flakes in the dough. Did I do something wrong? I don't know, but it seems some of these recipes have not been thought out very well or not tested or something.It has a lot of recipes, but it's almost too many. If this is your cup of tea and you want some more exotic breads, this might be for you. Just DON'T use the sugar cube bread recipe or you'll be shopping for a new bread pan for your machine!! I never used this book after that incident. I have found other, much better and simpler bread machine books since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to cook them all!","review":"I have a Zo (the large format 2 lb. loaf one) which I dearly love, and I was looking for more recipes so I could get more variety in what breads I make. When I received this book, I started working through it with my favorite recipes first. The results have been fantastic. This is the first place I have found an authentic recipe for Portugese Bread, for instance. I've had to book for a while, and it sits out on my table and sometimes I just sit and read it. Every recipe has been delicious and has worked well in the Zo. I highly recommend it for any serious bread machine baker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celiacs beware!","review":"I was reading through this book and noted recipes for Gluten free bread. One of the recipes listed \\"White Spelt Flour Bread\\" This recipe also included oat bran. Further reading found that the author suggested Kamut as well.The simple truth is that both Spelt and Kamut are in fact wheats. It is a violation of FDA regulations to claim such products are wheat free. Recently, January 06, a popular bakery was raided for doing just that.This book simply perpetuates fallacy and risks the health of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After trying two recipes I am frustrated with this book! I've made the basic white bread, then the loaf with a banana. Both were flops. I noticed that the amount of flour seemed to be way off in the bread with banana. It was a sloppy mess without the addition of a lot of flour. Or could it be the addition of gluten?? Maybe I'll try one more, but that will be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No recipes for one-pound loaves","review":"Recipes are for one-and-a-half and two pound loaves only. I could find no methodology or formula in the book for adapting recipes to make smaller loaves. How much more serviceable this volume would be, and how much wider its audience, had the author included a third column with each recipe giving directions to make one pound loaves, as Donna Rathmell German does in all her bread-machine cookbooks! Further, be aware that this book is a tome, very heavy and awkward to handle.Not for use with the very popular Mini Zo (Zojirushi BB-HAC10 Home Bakery 1-Pound-Loaf Programmable Mini Breadmaker). Not for use by people with manual disabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I have this author's older book, \\"The Bread Bible,\\" and love the book. I anticipated that this book would be as good but for the bread machine. I have a 1 pound machine and was surprised to find all recipes in book are for larger loafs. She instructs to just halve the recipe (2lb) to make the 1 pound loaf, but after my first attempt to divide 1 7/8 and 2 5/8 I gave up. I'm not a complete math dummy, but I don't care to do this math every time i wish to bake a quick loaf of bread. A couple of recipes that were evenly divisable, I did try and they could not have been tested. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"This book is so informative & simple to understand. It works with all bread machines with an option of preparation without machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME collection of recipes - a must have!","review":"This hefty volume of bread machine recipes offers a little something for everyone. And then, it offers it in a variety of ways. I have found 4 favorite wheat bread recipes alone. The dinner roll recipe is an absolute favorite!There *are* some difficult or time consuming recipes in this book. But, there are a number of 4 ingredient recipes as well. It has something for the novice as well as the expert wanting to try something new.One reviewer took exception with the ubiquitous use of vital wheat gluten. Yes, it is in many of the recipes. Until I got this book, I'd never used it and now I won't make bread without it. It makes an incredible difference in the texture and rise of each loaf. It is pretty inexpensive and definitely worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread maching cookbook","review":"I purchased this book because many of the reviews for bread machines (I ultimately purchased a Sunbeam) insisted that I had to get this book. I agree that the book is very helpful for making many bread recipes. However, a vast majority of the recipes in this book require the addition of gluten. Good luck finding gluten in the grocery store. I ended up purchasing a 3.5 pound keg of gluten on Amazon.com. It would have been helpful if the review for this book suggested purchasing gluten at the same time, so I am hopefully helping the next person to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinner rolls and bagels and pizza, oh my!","review":"Based on some reviews that this book was not good enough, I was a little nervous about buying it. Thank god I ignored them! I have not been able to put this book down since I got it. It has everything I could ever dream of making: white breads, wheat breads, sourdough breads, herb, nut and seed breads, pizza dough, foccacia breads, sweet breads (such as dessert breads and an awesome section on holiday breads), dinner rolls, bagels, english muffins...the list goes on and on. I can't wait to try them. Don't wait another minute. Just buy this cookbook, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bread Book","review":"I've only done a couple of recipes from this book, but my husband and son loved the results. The recipes that usually comes with a bread machine isn't the best so I knew I had to find an alternative. I just wish there were pictures in the book because I'm a sucker for pictures. Other than that I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results, another Hensperger hit!","review":"I, too, was hesitant about buying this book, based on previous reviews I had read here. I own almost all of her books, and they all have fantastic recipes, instructions, and information. I decided to go with her past successes and asked for this book for Christmas. I have used 3 or 4 recipes so far, and each one has come out perfectly. I did not have to make any adjustments at all; the ingredients were right on. There is a wealth of information in this book, definitely the best book I have seen on bread machine baking. I have had not-so-great success with bread machine cookbooks by other authors. This book has everything you need to know on this subject, and then some. Also included are tempting recipes for jams, preserves, butters, spreads, etc., plus creative ways to use leftover bread. I highly recommend this book, whether you are beginning or experienced at bread machine baking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"After reading the reviews I went out and purchased this cookbook. I was hoping to find a cookbook that would inspire me to use the bread machine that has been in my cupboard for the last few years. I brought the book home and started at the beginning. Country White Bread,how basic can you get, right? Boywas I surprised at the loaf my machine turned out! It's the best loaf I've ever made! I am anxious to work my way through this book and really put my bread machine to work. If the first basic recipe is this good, the rest must be fantastic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bread machine book I've found","review":"I bought 3 books when I got my bread machine and I got 4-5 from the library. The rest are collecting dust and this book is in my kitchen at least once a week. No recipe has failed me yet and there are a variety of interesting different breads (many whole grain!). It also explains how to go about changing or creating your own recipe with the correct proportions of ingredients. Like so many other small kitchen applicances, my breadmaker might have been relegated to an impulse purchase if it weren't for this book. It's a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book, hate the text","review":"I agree 100% with the reviewers who rave about the recipes. I've made several loaves and they have all been wonderful. I bake weekly, and this has eclipsed all of my other bread-machine books as the go-to volume. My only complaint is the printing. I'm 60+ and still have great eyesight for close work, but I need my reading glasses for this book. While colored type is pretty and often sets a book apart from others, I just can't see the brown-on-white very well; I'd have given a black-type book as many stars as Amazon allowed. Normally I can read any print larger than a phone book's without assistance, but not here. Other than that, the book is great, and I wish I had purchased it years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this close to throwing this book out the window","review":"PROS: Good recipes.CONS: 1. print that is IMPOSSIBLE TO READ it is so small and light green in color, because presumably elves are the major audience. Trying to read ingredient amounts even with a magnifying glass will make you crazy.2. a useless index. If you try to look up recipes you can make using the delay timer, forget it. You have to go page by page and read the whole recipe through because this useful information is close to HIDDEN.3. directions that you often will guess at. In one, for Tecate Wheat Bread, the author says check the dough after ten minutes. She means ten minutes after the first kneading. Many users will know this. But even those who do will have to waste time wondering if this is what she really means. In another recipe, she lists molasses as an ingredient. Dark molasses, light, blackstrap? You're on your own, reader.Who designed this book? Who edited it? Someone asleep at the bread machine. no doubt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Disappointed in this book.

She loved it. I also purchased one for myself. I have found great references in it, very basic questions answered. My first attempt at a recipe in the book turned out very well. I would highly recommend this book. It would be nice if it laid flat though. Perhaps spiral binding?"},{"rating":"2","title":"newbaker","review":"I love this book. It is detailed,teaches more about the products you use. It also helps you to fix your problems or why things went wrong.. I am new to baking bread and since I got this book I have been baking bread every week. I am even thinking of expanding to bake more than just wheat bread. Stick with her directions and use King Arthur's flours, you may not buy bread from the supermarket again. I have purchased a few other bread machine cook books. I have yet to use them since I got this one.Happy baking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those that want to experiment.","review":"I just bought myself a Zojirushi bread machine, so I bought this book to go with it based on the overwhelming positive reviews. The recipes in this book seem quite amazing and surprising at the same time. I never knew you could make bread with so many different kinds of ingredients. While I haven't tried very many recipes yet, I have booked marked all the ones I want to make in the near future. I only give it four stars instead of 5 stars because it takes a week to get the book ready to ship, so even with Prime, you are waiting a good week and a half to get your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The yeast discussion is confusing...","review":"Yes, the book is big and has tons of recipes, but the whole yeast discussion is confusing. Just tell me how much Active Dry yeast I need - all she lists for her ingredients are SAF and bread yeast, and here I sit with a full jar of Active Dry. I also don't want to have to stand at my machine to add ingredients, and make the other adjustments that seem so prevalent in many of the recipes. Thank goodness I got this from the library and didn't put out any money for it. The Electric Bread book, while much smaller, has a variety of easy, basic recipes, with only a few of them calling for gluten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add 1 tablespoon gluten!","review":"Nice recipes but the reason I make my own bread is to have healthier bread then what I can buy. To me, that means more alternate grains, no preservatives and less gluten. Most, if not all of the recipes in this book call for added gluten, not just the gluten that is already present in the flour but an extra tablespoon of gluten. Not very useful for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"This seams to be a well writen book. But, I can not figure out the plus listed refers to. It doesn't appear to be with the gluten. I am thinking it is additional water if you have a welbuilt machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By the Title!","review":"This is a great bread book, but a stupid bread machine book as almost all the recipes you only use the maching for initial kneading of the dough; after that, you take the dough out and bake it in the regular over - totally defeating the purpose of having a bread machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook","review":"I just made the sample (1lb) size brioche in my little Zo and am extremely happy with the results.

Once I got this book that all changed. So far I haven't had to buy any bread since I opened the package with this book in the mail. The only problem I've had is with the Cracked Wheat Bread recipe. It goes up over the top and burns a little on the sides and is a real pain to even get the pan out of the machine. I dropped to the 1 1/2 pound recipe and it still when over the top. My family thinks it's great and call it Frankenstein Bread and I usually cut the top off and they eat it while it's still warm. I guess I'll have to play with it to get it right. At least the mistakes still taste good. I've learned so much about making bread from this book. It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I love this cookbook. I've used it for almost 2 years now. Love the wonderful whole grain recipes in it. There are a few favorite loaf recipes that I stick with for our daily consumption, but I also like experimenting with the specialty breads. We never buy bread anymore. Even make our own hamb/hotdog buns. This recipe calls for white flour only, but I make it with 1/2 white, 1/2 whole wheat and it works great for me. Not only does this book have great recipes, but Beth Hensperger has loaded it with some great information and helpful hints throughout.After seeing and tasting the products I've turned out using this book, both of my daughters talked their husbands into buying them bread machines. Of course I did my part by ordering a copy of The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook for both of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential if you own a bread machine.....","review":"I recently inherited my bread machine.

Would recommend to anyone who loves to cook and experiment with new recipes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't expect to be kneeding!","review":"I love my bread machine because my husband makes the most amazing breads that make the house smell wonderful. I expected this book to provide him with recipes that require the breadmachine to do the work but just about every recipe requires taking the dough out of the machine, kneeding it and bake it in the oven. What's up with that? I thought, \\"that's not what the bread machine was designed to do\\". So I'm stuck with it! In a busy world the bread machine was designed to give us fresh breads investing very little of our time other than piling up the ingredients and letting it do the work.Oh well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun!","review":"I've had a bread machine for years but with this cookbook, I am finally using it, making bread nearly every day for over two weeks now! With such a great number of recipes, there is always a new one to try. The hamburger rolls are fabulous in taste and general appearance. I like more 100% whole grain breads but once you get the general proportions you can experiment. I use instant yeast and no gluten and I haven't had one failure. Unless you call rising to the very top of the machine a failure! I love to cut the top off and eat when freshly made, sometimes with butter and sometimes without to get the true taste of the bread. With my family, it never lasts long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bread Machine Book","review":"I've been baking with bread machines for awhile now and this is the best book I've found on the subject. The bread is delicious everytime. The book has recipes for all types of bread including quick breads and breads that you knead in the machine and bake in the oven. It's basically the bible of bread machine baking. It covers everything. It even gives you a tutorial for beginners on making different types of bread. It also discusses the different types of machines that are out there. When people ask me to recommend a book on bread machines this is *always* the one I tell them to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Heard about this book from others at work that were baking tasty loaves.

I love the diversity of the recipes - whole grains, sour doughs, etc, even ideas for using your leftover bread. In addition, it is attractive and in an easy to read format.I originally borrowed it from the library. After browsing through it I immediately went to buy it! My family especially loves the honey whole wheat recipe. After my mother-in-law tried the bread, she decided she needed a bread machine!There are 2 things I couldn't put down. This book and my cup of S o y f e e. It's made from organic soyabeans which you brew just like coffee. No caffeine and I don't miss it either. Look for on the web at www. S oycoffee.com.The recipe selection is fantastic - everything I've made has turned out beautifully and tastes extremely good. I highly recommend this cookbook as absolutely essential to anyone with a bread machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When the basics are wrong, what _can_ you trust?","review":"After looking carefully at specific aspects of this book, I'm not only able to agree with the other reviewers about the problems they found but also can identify two very fundamental flaws: 1) Hensperger gets the \\"order of adding ingredients\\" backwards for the Zojirushi. Did she get the others right? 2) In many recipes she says \\"unplug the machine\\" at one point or other in the process, making it very clear that she's not familiar with how machines work....or the simple expedient of pressing the reset/cancel button to achieve the desired effect. When an author is so far off on basics like this, there's no point in wasting time finding out about the other mistakes, or in wasting money on the book. There are number of bread machine books out there that give the diversity of recipes Hensperger attempts, and do a far better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For a small Bread Machine","review":"I bought this and did not realize that this book is NOT for a small loaf. I have a 1lb loaf machine .The recipes are all for a medium 1-1/2 or large 2lb loaf. NO SMALL RECIPESYou cannot just halve the ingredient amounts, unless it's truly a large, pretty full 2 pound loafThe larger recipes are too large for the small machine but too skimpy if you halve them.I don't want to practice getting the amount ratios.Also, Almost all the recipes call for Gluten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"My experiences with my bread machine (West Bend) were very poor. Could not make a good loaf of bread. Then came this book!!! Outstanding. So far, I have made three recipes from it (just got it recently) and all 3 were excellent. I made the basic Pizza dough on page 390. Excellent. My family said it was the best pizza I had ever made. I also made the Cinnamom Swirl Bread on Page 432 and it tasted just like Cinnabons!

I thought I was doomed to use mixes as that was the only thing that came out tasting great. iI have even left an ingredient out on some of the recipies because I didn't have it or made a small substitute and it still came out great. I've made several of the breads, all wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra gluten in each recipe","review":"I wish that someone had written a review that informed me, before I purchased this book, that almost EVERY recipe calls for extra gluten.

Every bread you could imagine is here. Thanks for a great book. I can now bake bread like the pros."},{"rating":"2","title":"great recipes","review":"I bought this book for my husband he loves fresh baked bread and likes to experiment with his bread machine. He poured over it Christmas day and decided on one to try the next day. Soon our house smelled wonderful! He has since tried many other recipes in this book and all have turned out delicious. A hint I'd read in reviews, was not to use the larger measurements as the dough rises too high. So he used the one pound amounts and the loaves were perfect! Any larger and they would have been hitting the lid. One other detail is there are many recipes calling for an unusual ingredient you wouldn't normally have on hand but the majority of recipes were fine or you could easily find most ingredients at your local store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best and Most Complete","review":"I have used a bread machine for years and have made bread on a weekly basis most of my life as has my mother before me. I own or have read nearly every bread machine cookbook out there but Beth Hensperger's text is far and above the rest. The recipes are clear, consistently good and logical. There is a breadth of variety as well as detail (should you want it) into how different ingredients work together. There are plenty of basics for the novice baker, yet enough to hold the interest of the more experienced. She also includes lots of additional recipes for bread accompaniments such as Hot Artichoke Dip, Goat Cheese Butter, and Whipped Honey Butter. This is one volume that every baker (bread machine or not) should have in his/her library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great recipes!","review":"I haven't tried every recipe yet, but the ones I have made all work wonderfully in my bread machine.

It's fun to sit down and pick a new and exciting recipe to try for my husband,myself, friends and family. There are many different bread styles to choose from than can help inspire new meal options. My current favorite is C.R.O.W.W. bread which stands for cinnamon, raisin, oat, walnut, and whole wheat. Yummy bread that takes me back to the says with my grandma. Another nice thing is trying different flours and ingredients broadening my my horizons. The only criticism. I would have is mot having weights of the ingredients versus cup. Thank you Beth for a great resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected, and broken.","review":"My wife bought this off my wishlist for my birthday. I had put it on my wishlist, because I was under the impression that the keys felt piano-like instead of keyboard-like. When we pulled it out of the box, though, that supposition was quickly contradicted. Also, one of the keys was broken. The \\"G\\" an octave and a third above middle \\"C\\" was sticking up above all the other keys, and clacked when pressed. It was obviously missing some sort of dampening pad internally. Thankfully, Amazon has a wonderful return policy. We opted for the Casio CDP-100 digital piano. It is about the same size/weight as the M-Audio PROKEYS 88SX, and feels very piano-like. In fact, the Casio digital pianos feel closer to a real piano than any of the other digital pianos I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the price","review":"I've been using this keyboard for about a month now. I was pleased that it comes with a USB cable to let you port your masterpieces to your computer as well as a sustain pedal. The sound quality is surprisingly good: when you hit a high note, you'll swear you can hear the hammer hitting the cord. If I have a complaint with this piano, it's that the included pedal isn't very responsive and will often fail to recognize that you are standing on it. Perhaps this is because I'm using it on carpet? In any case, the pedal was free, so I can't complain.First-time keyboard buyers should be aware that this does not come with speakers of any kind. You'll need to buy headphones or speakers separately to hear what's being played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy this item from 3rd party","review":"After two months all LEDs were blinking.

However, on the inside cover of the instruction manual there is a big sticker saying there are chemicals used to make this keyboard which cause cancer and birth defects \\"so please wash hands after using\\". Is this for real?!?!? I cannot believe Amazon would sell such a product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book? Hardly!!","review":"This opus is nothing more than a pamphlet consisting of cut and paste, quotes from others and lists of organizations and government agencies. Not an original thought to be found anywhere. Sorry excuse of a 'book'. Author is feckless in his attempt to 'educate' the reader. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had no choice, I had to give this film one star, but it seriously deserves NON.!!!!!!!!","review":"This is probably the worst film I EVER SAW. I always try to see the best in every film, BUT THIS...The film don't have any plot, just a confused priest walking around in indian country, and if that's not enough there's also a indian dwarf stumbling around. The whole vhs is silly, stupid action scences, bad actors and all in all non wachable. I really wonder why on the front of the vhs it is said\\"packs twice the punch of dances with wolves\\". That's maybe the stupiest thing i EVER have heard. Twice the punch my ***.If you like indian kinds of films you should go for something like Geronimo, The Last Of The Mohicans, Dances With Wolves, Apocalypto, Into The West, The Missing etc.etc Just don't go buying this dvd/vhs, Its not worth a penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in Every Way","review":"This film is so unHollywood that it is refreshing and moving. It is superbly acted and directed. The sets and costumes are so authentic that the viewer is drawn into the characters' lives immediately. This film is a winner.

What should be BREATH TAKING visuals are rendered merely impressive by a low quality transfer. 2.0 audio track is uninspiring. no chapter or scene selections. At least they didn't cut the film length..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent filmmaking;distorted facts;BLACK ROBE is a dull film","review":"Having watched this film several times over the years, I am still forced to come to the conclusion that as beautifully filmed and musically scored BLACK ROBE is,it still is not the absorbing film that perhaps it could have been. Long treks up and down rivers and over mountainous terrain and dense forest with little dialogue is not compelling enough for me to rate this film higher than 2 stars. Historically, it is not accurate in regards to the tribal customs of the Iroquois people.Lothaire Bluteau as \\"Black Robe\\" is a far more effective actor when left to speak French in his other film credits. He seems unsettled and unemotional in his English speaking roles.Bluteau is far more effective in JESUS de MONTREAL.I enjoy historical drama and actually prefer a well developed story that might move slowly; but BLACK ROBE still fails to inspire me in any way, other than looking at the mountains of Canada to Georges Delerue's music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Priest trying to save the damned","review":"This is a wonderful movie and it shows how reprobate our society are. it shows how, even in bad conditions and even death, that we will must preach God's word. The part where the priest baptizes that women who was dying with the arrow in her neck shows the true charity of what the Jesuits were doing. He was a man who was tryin to save a hopeless and ignorant people. It shows that some people are just destined for hell and how few get on the road that is narrow. The priest litterally takes on evil and satan when he goes into the forest. He deals with abandonment, torture, and death. But in the end people were saved and the greater glory of God shown, and thus his accomplished his mission as far as saving some souls. A wonderful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic; Too Simplistic","review":"Although this may come as a big shock to those of us who by now are so used to watching \\"reality\\" shows (as they seem to be the new attraction), a good film need not be so graphic and crammed in with disturbing and disgusting scenes to faithfully portrary the essence of events that took place in history. Those \\"things\\" rather can be simply inferred by a minimal application of reason and common sense. As far as the \\"faith\\" of the Jesuit priest in the film, it is at best a laughable caricature of the true heroics, sanctity, and wisdom of the Jesuit missionaries who IN REALITY manned the mission territories. No doubt, the simplistic and conflicted character portrayed in the film exists to only validate the worldly, humanistic spirit of this present age which can never be reconciled with what the Catholic Faith teaches. One mocks and ridicules in a state of shame what one cannot live up to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not a barn burner though","review":"Interesting movie, little short on the story line, some of the actors were not as believable as they could have been (the native americans), the romantic scenes were over emphasized, ...I love the period in history, is the only reason I remotely like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I am unable to really review this video. The sound track is trashed. Beware of buying video's from zshops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native Americans? Europeans? History? Not this movie.","review":"Why such lengthy, passionate, sometimes angry reviews? Because this exquisite work of art confronts nothing less than the Human Condition: The heartrending beauty of our lonely planet, man's inhumanity to man, and the forlorn yearning for peace. The endless battle between hope and despair is depicted with painful clarity--the endless struggle to cope with the apparent absence of our own Creator.Where is God and why are we here?That's a tall order for a movie! If you haven't seen Black Robe, try not to read reviews that give away the story, but be forewarned that this masterpiece gets very close to the flame. Fire burns, but it also anneals. I would agree with a number of reviewers that this is the best film ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical movie","review":"The Black Robe offers entertaining insights into the cultures of Native Americans in the face of approaching settlers/pioneers. The focus is on a Jesuit Priest who has left France and then the safety of a French Fort to venture into the wilderness in hopes of connecting with an Indian tribe. The movie conveys the commitment and utter sacrifice the priest makes to reach these people.I think this movie offers an accurate glimpse of how the Indian tribes lived and clashed with each other and with the elements.The interaction between the humans and each person's inner questioning and conflicts reveals much about faith, acceptance and life in general.The scenery of the movie is amazing and alone would make the movie worth watching.The story has sparked my interest in the events, so that I want to look into reading the book. It looks like the author and director were sincere in their efforts to tell a historically accurate story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Robe","review":"A magnificent, stunningly photograhed movie. Nomovie conveys through its cinematography as wellthe starkly beautiful yet brutal and inhospitable winterlandscape of the greatlakes region which confrontedFrench and English explorers and settlers in the eighteenthcentury. The plight of the young French priest who vainlyattempts to install a foreign religion and philosophy amongthe unwilling native tribes is heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction","review":"This is a great movie if you like historical fiction or have a connection to Canada and the french or First Nation people such as I do. I found this movie very moving and informative, it was great to see the way some of my ancestors lived and to see how life was back then. The soundtrack is very good, just wished they all spoke French with English subtitles, it would have made it seem more authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time. Needs to be watched several times to pick up all the nuances."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Liked Last of the Mohicans, Do Not Miss This Film!","review":"Few movies of recent memory arrived with such little fanfare but had such enormous impact on the viewer as did Black Robe. As powerful a tribute to good film making as Dances With Wolves or Last of the Mohicans [1992], this film transports you back to the North American wilderness of the seventeenth century, and gives the viewer a dose of realism that will live in your consciousness for days on end. Epic in it's scope and historically accurate in it's story, this movie captures on film what few others have accomplished for this period of history. If your idea of good cinema is an opportunity to be educated as well as to be entertained, and to relive a time in history long since past, then DO NOT miss this fine film! It is a must see movie for all history buffs... Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, scenic, violent, with tremendous sound.","review":"Similar to recent \\"Last of the Mohicans\\", but more factual, showing the difference between the French and English methods of dealing with the Indians. The priest, (Father La Forgue) and the Indian guide, Chomina, gave notable performances. The enmity between the Iroquois and Huron, apparently dating from before the white man's appearance, was highlighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Husband bougth this!","review":"This story is very graphic and bloody! I cannot watch it! But then again I think it is a guy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly weird","review":"It was a very odd movie, will not watch again it was that weird. I had to watch it for a history class i was taking. really weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"The violation of true relationships in this film is astounding. It demonstrates the sheer violence that can be perpetrated against a people group that you feel has no value as human beings. Sometimes we get so caught up in our \\"mission\\" that we forget that we are all made in God's image and we all have value in God's sight. To ignore the incarnationality of Jesus within each one of us is to deny the great gospel message of Christianity. This film shows how a mission without regard for culture can result in devastation beyond all imagination. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Hateful and cruel.","review":"This movie has a scene of a young girl being blackmailed and raped. It's disgraceful and hateful. Totally unchivalrous. Disgusting. Don't watch this movie if you want to sleep well at night, or if you have a conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Robe","review":"The black robe is such an incredibly sad tale. The scenery made me feel as cold as the characters in the elements and I found this movie to be really intense and dark. Some of the scenes were very disturbing but there is no doubt it did happen this way many times. The sadness of what the Huron and Jesuits experienced is overwhelming. I would highly recommend this movie but would caution the viewer about the brutality of some the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Indian","review":"If you have ever wondered how it was, what were they like, here it is! The whole milieu, beautiful, but cruel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"The movie was immersed in historical accuracy, from the clothing, cultures, and attitudes. The \\"Black Robes\\" were trying to convert the 'savages' to find paradise to which they did not seek, they had their own religion and their own paradise to look forward to, where their loved ones would be. The black robes were also their to help the French colonize the area, making it safe for others to come over if they all had found the same religion, they could be safe. The Movie showed how the Indians tried to syncronize catholicism with their own culture and how the Black Robe had gained an insight to their understanding and had compassion for them, with a love for them without trying to exploit them as ignorant savages. The movie takes you from Champlain to Huron and the trial and tribulations of the 17th Century. An easy movie to watch and gain valuable insight without too much westernization as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly outstanding","review":"I first saw the movie in the early 1990s. It made a profound impression on me, and watching it for the third time now, the impact is just as strong. Visually stunning, with landscapes not usually featured in film---the northern wilds---the land overwhelms the people in it, as it must have in the 1600s. It is probably as close as we'll get to experiencing the fear and wonder of the collision of the native peoples and the Europeans before the ending was revealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Girl-Power Volume","review":"Yep, I'm a feminist that reads comics. I first associated with the three leading ladies through Batman, Justice League Unlimited, and other random sources online and via Cartoon Network. Huntress is her lovable, violent self, while Black Canary is every bit as fiesty and fun as she always is. Ladies, just because there is cheesecake doesn't mean you can't read it! This stuff is full of empowering, well-written female characters and I highly encourage you to pick it up. Gail Simone, now writing Wonderwoman, is a fantastic writer that emulates the ways of womanhood perfectly; \\"700 sit-ups a day.\\" She captures the essence of feminism and strength while the artist keeps the story appealing to men as well. It is rare that something this good comes along in the history of women protagonists and while I love Supergirl, her skinny blonde self can't hold a candle to these fierce ladies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new hobby","review":"I got this book in an attempt to figure out what type of trunk I have and how to refinish it.

More postmodern literary interpretation run amuck...On the bright side, this book has some really nice charts and timelines (although I disagree with his map where he superimposed Middle-Earth over Europe - I believe it should be far more to the west than he has it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Full of Errors","review":"I sat down in Borders and read this in half an hour. I am a huge Tolkien fan, and know all his works backward and forward, and this was such a terrible thing to see shelved in the bookstore.

Peter O'Toole is captivating as the eccentric scientist and David Ogden-Stiers has perpetuated his typecasting with his role as the arrogant intellectual.This is the first major movie role for Ms Hemmingway and she shows flashes of the talent that made her so famous on TV a few years later.This is a love story with a cast of suporting characters that make it shine. It also asks some very serious questions about the medical establishment and how terminally ill patients are treated. Your hopes will be raised and your heart be broken by this movie. It is well worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware-Bad Pan and Scan","review":"I love this movie, but I HATE, HATE, HATE this DVD. It is the worst transfer I have ever seen on a DVD. It is full screen, but the pan and scan is terrible. You lose about 50 percent of the image from the VHS version. There are scenes where you can't even see the people talking in the scene because they are on the extreme right and left. You are left looking at a mostly empty room.

What was more science fiction when it first shown is now very possible. The love of a man to spend his career working towards creating his dead wife of thirty years from her cells. A young woman helps him with giving her eggs and falls in love with the doctor/scientist. In the end love is seen as the \\"The Big Picture/Eye of God\\". The young assistant to the doctor shows the power of love when he spends what could be the last thirty six hours of life of his love (who is in a coma). While there is a good outcome for all, the movie does make me cry for the power of love exhibited by the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creator","review":"Peter O'Toole is perhaps one of the greatest actors of all time.

(I should say at this point that I am an expatriate Brit.) I have seen the movie conservatively about 16 times. Mariel is superb, Vincent and Virginia are marvellous and O'Toole is magnificent. Even David Ogden Stiers' performance is richly drawn. The story is essentially about love - both letting go and fiercely hanging on. The lines from the movie that remain indelibly etched in my mind are \\"Nothing in this world of any importance is ever accomplished without passion\\" and \\"Tell Sid, 'The Big Picture.'\\" Do yourself a favor, own this movie and watch it with your significant other."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE ROCKS","review":"This is probably the best movie i've ever seen.

Peter O'Toole is as charming as ever and the love story, in the end, will leave you crying for joy that all is right with the world.

This movie is definitely for the hopeless romantic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Toole rules!

My advice for people is to either look for an uncut dub copy or try to seek out the Astro DVD version which was released in Germany but sadly is in German with no subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE UNCUT VERSION!","review":"This film is titled \\"Anthropophagus/Savage Island, etc..\\" in other versions which are UNCUT with all the gore missing from THIS version, \\"The Grim Reaper\\". I got a copy on video from Midnight Video under the original title, \\"Anthropophagus\\" and it was great! There are two key scenes that I know for a fact are censcored from the U.S. realese \\"Grim Reaper\\". The first scene is the infamous fetus eating scene where George Eastman eats an unborn baby ripped from a woman's crotch. The second scene being the end where the beast gets a pickaxe to the belly, where afterwards he proceeds to eat his own intestines. Bottom line it is a must see film for any gorehound, but beware of ANY version, unless it is titled \\"Anthropophagus\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF THE DVD LTD \\"GRIM REAPER\\" EDITION","review":"And I mean really beware. It's not about the movie itself which is quite good and considered by many as a classic horror - it's about the edition. First it doesn't even have a menu. But that's a minor misdoing. What's more important - this is a TOTALLY cut version. All the scenes that are loved by viewers and because of which the movie became famous are not here. And I mean ALL.Wait just a little for a new 2-disc Media Blasters' \\"Anthropophagous\\" edition which has to be a full-verison. And this one... Maybe in 10 years it will become a rarity and you'll be able to sell it profitably :) Who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T FIND A GOOD SLEEPING PILL? THAN BUY THIS MOVIE!","review":"Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the \\"One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era.\\" line on this back of this movie case. I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99. It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is. I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times. If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento. Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible. Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles. The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"What a pile of poop, this is a very , very boring film, and stripped of the gore scenes, you better save your money for something better, banned in the UK, if you saw this version you would think we were all mad in the UK, uncut version - The Anthropogous Beast - hmmm - quick somebody get the uncut version - Anchor Bay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather poor quality","review":"I am not sure, but I think that this movie is still banned here in Germany. The more I was looking forward to see it in its original, that is uncut, form.However, the quality of this edition is rather poor. While it seems to be uncut, the sound and picture quality (even considering the fact that this whole thing was shot on 16mm) is a major nuisance.The opening sequence (with a young girl being killed in the water by the cannibalistic George Eastman) was shot in German language, but it took me (as a native speaker) a while to realize that this was neither Italian nor English! That's how bad the sound quality is.The movie as such besides its technical flaws, is...also a disappointment, at least in my book. Bad acting, bad directing, a minimum plot, quite passable special effects...this is not enough to satisfy me. (I have to admit though that I am not too much into late 70s/early 80s Italian horror flicks, so my opinion may not be of too much relevance here.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad version, heavily cut with horrible sound","review":"Okay, first off, I did not buy this version of Anthropophagous (or as it's titled here Grim Reaper). I'm writing this to let ALL of you know that this version is not worth the buy. There is, however, a place to get this--FULLY uncut with all the restored footage (including the fetus-devouring scene and the last scene, the self-consumption of the entrails). Go to [website] and visit their DVD section. They've got it there, along with dozens of other obscure horror, gore and exploitation flicks.

Two scenes in particular of unsurpassed gore -- and I've been watching horror for 30 years. (No, I won't write any spoilers.)I saw this film when it was first released in the theaters in the early 1980s, and then on VHS, and then on this DVD set.But this 2-DVD set is POORLY MANUFACTURED.I bought this 2-DVD set last year. It kept freezing in my JVC DVD player. So I returned it for a refund.But this is such great film, a year later, I ordered another 2-DVD set. Maybe I'd gotten a bad batch before?AGAIN, the DVD froze in my DVD player. So I tried it on another DVD player. It froze in that one too.I had to wait for the DVD to jerk past the scene, and nudge it along, trying to get it to play smoothlyGreat film. It's sad they have such a low quality control at whatever factory they're using."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Anthropophagus?","review":"Of all the gore-miester, gun-for-hire directors Italy produced in the early 80's, who enjoy a cult following, Joe D'Amato has to be the worst and most undeserving. Anthropophagus is supposed to be one his best, along with equally so-so Beyond The Darkness. Void of style or suspense, all Anthropophagus consists of is a handful of shock kills, and a tedious, nearly incoherent framework to fill out the run time. The ghoul-man is creepy to behold, but few who sit through the whole film are going to walk away feeling fed.D'Amato's films often feature hard-core sex, and he would later focus exclusively on porn, which makes sense when you consider his \\"money-shot\\" and filler style of filmaking. Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are porn films, but my standards for horror are a little higher, and I choose my hacks with greater care."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Was BAD; Very Bad! Bored to the Bone!","review":"Many individuals have certainly heard of this cult classic. After a painful viewing, it was discovered to be slow and very boring. There is nothing that could save this film. Missing this film is an asset, but do not take my word for it. Go ahead and waste the money to see it for yourself. Then you could write a bad review. I did read some of the good reviews, but I just do not get how anyone could find this movie better than one star. No stars would be a better score for this snail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Buy?","review":"Why would anyone even buy this knowing it's the [terrible], heavily-edited version? This makes me sick.

But I didn't get it. I have no idea why this movie was banned so much. It's not that gory. Even uncut, it isn't that sick or terrifying. Just a little creepy. In fact, the gore scenes that are here are really not that great. Even the one where the ripper rips a fetus from a woman's womb and eats it isn't really all that disturbing. The fetus was just a dead rabbit the producers bought at a butcher's shop. This film had a real bad reputation when it debuted, but, watching it today, I really don't know why. It's no big deal. George Eastman, the guy who played the weird cannibal, moves about like a really slow zombie. Except for his complexion, he's hardly a threat. Or at least, he shouldn't be. The people in the film he catches and kills must be really stupid if they let a slowpoke like him get to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that started my business..","review":"First off, I'm really rating this 4 1/2 stars (I've never rated anything 5 stars).

The original vinyl has the Anniversary of WW3 as the last track so when it went silent, you took the record off 'cos it was over. The Anniversary of WW3 is a fine piece of silence and a good joke, but who's going to listen to three minutes of silence every time they play the album?

It really puts across the innocent, hopeful nature of the early Hippie movement at its best. The band never became as popular as they deserved. They are witty and their vocal harmonies are excellent. Sure, the message is rather dated now -- anti-war, the newly found joy of sexual freedom, and such -- but it worked then and if, like me, you find the current \\"pop\\" with the voices electronically corrected and in large part dependent on videos with elaborate dancing (which obviously doesn't come across when just listening to the music without the video), it works now. Clever, interesting, and very enjoyable. It's dated in many of the themes, but the music is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Volume 2","review":"But not as good as Volume 1. Experimental indeed, 1:32 of pure silence on WWIII...it was the 60's man.

The last one (a Capresso semi-automatic) self-destructed when the rotating shaft snapped and the entire mechanism exploded.The Gaggia took a few days to get used to - fineness of grind, pressure when tamping and experimentation with the \\"Perfect Crema\\" device. It now delivers reliable espresso and cappucino with very finely ground regular coffee solidly packed in, or decaf ground somewhat less finely and packed in less solidly.

In this Debbie Reynolds is a young girl perusing a Broadway career just until she gets married. She had mapped out her entire life, just doesn't know who the husband will be. Frank Sinatra's ego as a ladies man is hurt when Debbie refuses to got out to dinner because she doesn't want to waste her time on someone that would not be a husband candidate. Funny, entertaining, light hearted comedy I will enjoy again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated But Still Entertaining","review":"THE TENDER TRAP is a movie about a New York bachelor (Frank Sinatra) who has a bevy of girls flowing through his New York apartment to the amazement of his old friend (David Wayne). Wayne is a married man from Indiana who is visiting without his family and staying with Sinatra. A seemingly naive but determined young actress (Debbie Reynolds) from Scarsdale eventually puts an end to Sinatra's fun by springing her own tender trap. Before this happens she gets a lot of competition from a slightly older woman (Celeste Holm). At one point Sinatra is engaged to both women.The film may be quite dated but it is still entertaining. The supporting cast includes Carolyn Jones and Lola Albright.Charles Walters also directed EASTER PARADE and HIGH SOCIETY. THE TENDER TRAP received an Oscar nomination in 1955 for Best Song (\\"Love is the Tender Trap\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tender Trap","review":"The opening sequence, where Frank walks toward the camera and sings the title song, is more than worth the price of admission.

Filmed in Super Panavasion 70 on locations in South East Asia, the film looks breathtaking in this excellent DVD transfer that has been remastered in high definition. Jack Hawkins narrates as well as appears (sadly, after he had had operations for throat cancer so his rich voice has lost some of its magic) and just when you think the story is reaching a conclusion, James Mason turns up for another chapter. Bronislau Kaper's music score is one of the greats (also including lots of Asian gamelan instruments) and decades ago was a collector's item LP. This anamorphic transfer recreates the visual impact of the film's initial theatrical release and the Dolby Digital sound is knockout. O'Toole heads a fine cast and the film's uncompromising finale will surprise many. First-rate sea adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Classic transformed on the silver screen","review":"Richard Brooks adaptation of Joseph Conrad's fascinating work Lord Jim, was received in 1965 to mixed reviews.The movie is an attempt at recasting Conrad's work in the action adventure genre. What is perhaps one of the most compelling works of character in English literature losses its power in the process. What it then becomes is lavishly told, ploddingly paced action adventure fare. And in this category it suffers greatly by comparison to the more recent Indiana Jones series of movies.The novel presents numerous challenges to the lead actor and director: the structure is complex, Jim speaks infrequently, and (most importantly) it deals with the inner substance of Jim's character. Bringing this together in a well told visual tale is an overwhelming challenge.Richard Brooks and Peter O'toole should be congratulated for their effort, but the results earned them only a plodding \\"B\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, crappy connectors, heavy","review":"This product works exactly as stated and it is the perfect price.

One of the most useful was wiring it to my thermostat, eliminating batteries for that. That thermostat was going thru batteries like crazy. No longer. This adapter, or power supply, is for low current applications, but I have found them quite handy for tinkering with projects as I am a retired electronics tech. I also used it to hard wire my smoke detector as well and set the voltage to 9 volts. Whenever the batteries got low on the smoke detector it would chirp at odd hours, like 2 am. Anyway, I'm also using it to power a slew of LED lights, just over 200 to be exact. These are to provide lighting in my backyard continuously at night and they turn off via a photo switch (see review)."},{"rating":"1","title":"jWIN JA-C52AC Adapter","review":"I have tried two different samples of this AC adapter which has an attractive price particularly with the settable outputs. Both samples failed to work as advertised. I tried using them with a Chamberlain intercom system that can be either battery operated or with an AC adapter with 12V input. These chargers made the intercom malfunction totally. Fortunately, when I disconnected the AC adapter, the intercom works fine on batteries and I will continue to use only batteries on the intercom. I did put a voltmeter on the output of each of these units and it came as no surprise to find that the output was not as rated but much higher. When set at 12V it was giving 22.8 V at the plug. When set at 6V the output was 11. Both samples behaved similarly and would not work with the intercom. This is junk and I will try to get Amazon to give me a refund on both units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Professor","review":"The book is as moving, enlightening and unique as I expected.

However, I have a severe complaint about the slovenly manner in which this book was prepared for ebook reading. I presume that the transfer was made via OCR; but didn't anyone at Kindle check the result for errors? I found dozens of errors in this book, and all of them could be attributed to slovely or lazy checking of the OCR reading. Indeed, perhaps no check was made at all. I expected greater care to have been taken.

Dr. Delaware, the star of several of Kellerman's books, is called in by the treating physician to convince the parents to consent to treatment. Before he can meet with the parents, however, the boy is taken from the hospital. Dr. Delaware's concern with the young boy throws him into an adventure, focused on finding the boy, where he stumbles upon horticultural prowess and cultists that may be more than what they seem. There is less of a psychological twist in Blood test than in some of the other Kellerman books, but plot interest will keep you reading until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"A preposterous plot, an unlikable protagonist, set in a relentlessly depressing context.....why did I finish this book?

The beginning of the book was a bit slow (which could be because I didn't read the series in order). However, once I got to know that main characters, the book was clipped along at a fast pace. The last part of the book has many twists and keeps you wondering how it will all be resolved. The last 100 pages go very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I was enthralled by the writing style of Kellerman in his previous book, When the Bough Breaks.

I found it har dto believe it was written by the same author.The unsympathetic characters are so cartoonish it is hard to develop any sort of empahty for them.

The additional fact that virtually everything they produce is so well recorded, performed, and packaged is another bonus.The present recording is no exception. It presents alternate numbers written by Donizetti as additional or replacement material for several of his operas. The overtures are pleasant enough, but it would have been nice to have even more vocal material, for the selections included are truly fine.The singers are up to their assignments, with the notable exception of Rockwell Blake, who has lost the freshness and ease of tone found on his Mozart and Rossini discs during the 1980's. However, Nelly Miriciou once again does herself proud, singing with dramatic intensity and excellent technical aplomb, while newcomer Garry Magee takes the baritone roles with beautiful tone and full commitment. An excellent disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute perfection, worthy of six stars, not just five!","review":"I read an interesting book by jazz critic Will Friedwald, and he mentions his favorite \\"desert island\\" jazz vocal albums, and Billy's Best is among those. So I decided to try it, and it is in every way perfect. There are some bonus tracks here whcih don't really take away or add anything from the original lp material. However Eckstine's rich baritone voice, with just the right amount of vibarato, always hits the spot(think of a male jazz singer with the talent equivelent to Sarah Vaughan). His voice soars thru songs of all eras leading up to the 50's, starting with the 30's hit Bouolevard Of Broken Dreams right up to Desi Arnez's theme song Babalu. Wonderful arrangements with orchestra and strings only compliment and uplift Billy's jazz phrasing, making this the essential jazz/pop vocal lp, by any non-Sinatra male singer from the late 50's. A great disc thru and thru."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious spoof with great performances!","review":"\\"The Sandman\\" is a hilarious yet dark and moody adaptation of the classic tale. It's hard to describe the odd mixture of humor, darkness, and absurdity that permeates this film. Despite this, or because of it, it manages in a strange way to both move and illuminate. The energetic performances, far from subtle, fit the tone of the film perfectly. And yes, believe it or not, The Sandman's role is played by Will Rokos, the writer of the Academy Award-winning \\"Monster's Ball\\"! There's even an improvised musical performance in the film!

At one point, we are told of a grid that measures three point nine four meters by two meters. That's exactly how it's written, too. And at no point do we get to see why the dimensions of the grid make the slightest bit of difference to the players ... oh, characters.

But if not, then you might want to skip it.The characterization is OK, and obviously Wright has been watching her TOS videos. In fact, that's part of the problem for me. This book is a by-the-numbers pastiche. The characters all say and do what they would in a TV episode, but who cares? There's no real story. It's all a matter of tying up loose ends from the TV episode and creating some new loose ends for the other 6 books in this Gateway series. This book owes its existence to a marketing strategy, not to artistic inspiration. It exists only to fill the TOS slot in the Gateway series.And be warned: this book ends in a cliffhanger that you have to buy the hardcover book to resolve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Susan Wright may be the worst writer...","review":"that the editors of Star Trek employ.

The movie was so good, I HAD to buy it. The story is really cool and I thought it was neat how they didn't focus on one character like they sometimes do. I recommend you buy this movie instead of taping it because it's a lot better the way they set it up on the video than Cartoon Network did. I absolutely LOVE this movie and I give it 2 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing Endless Waltz","review":"It was a very good movie. The sad part of the movie that the Gundams where gone for ever. A true master pice, the uncut DVD is better then the uncut VHS. My favorit Gundam is Wing Zero, the why that Zero dies is sad. If you like Gundam Wing your going to like Endless Waltz."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Gundam Wing explanation.","review":"I just want to say that if you liked Gundam Wing, you must see The Movie: Endless Waltz. This is just the best part of Gundam Wing. It finishes the series not so good ending, it gives you a little bit of info on the past of the pilots & the complete explanation of Operation Meteor. Plus, you get both sides of the story here. You get the original 3 uncut OAV episodes, plus you get the uncut, added scenes, movie version. What more can you ask for? Excellent features? Got it. From its Mobile Suit Gallery to the Textless Endings, this DVD is the perfect addition to any Gundam collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz","review":"Endless Waltz is Gundam Wing at its best.

It introduces the customized versions of Gundam Deathscythe Hell, Wing Gundam Zero, Gundam Sandrock, and Gundam Heavyarms. This movie also is the first to introduce the new Gundam Nataku and the Serpent Gundams. In \\"Endless Waltz\\" after the war between the Mobile Suits came to an end, the Gundam pilots, Duo, Trowa, Quatre, and Heero send their Gundams into the sun to be burned. But then a young teenaged rich girl has her men kidnap Relena Darlian, and another war begins... In lamest terms, this movie would knock you off your seat! It is a must-own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Animation At Its Best","review":"First off, the film \\"Endless Waltz\\" is a masterpiece. It tells a solid story that expands the Gundam Wing universe and has gorgeous animation. The DVD has great features as well. This is the only place where you'll find the original OAV version and the theatrical version. There are trailers for other animes, though this is kind of cheap. They are only commercials, but good ones nonetheless. The video is crisp and the audio is nice and clear. If you've seen this an episode of Gundam Wing, then buy this DVD because it's twice as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I have watched the entire Gundam Wing series and some episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam and the 08th MS Team. I loved them all. This is a good movie and a great way to end a Gundam Wing fan's hunger for more Gundam Wing. It gives us a real ending to the saga and pretty much rapped things up. The DVD has some nice extras too. The movie was good, but not great. After seeing it 3 or more times it tends to get boring. I would have gave it 3 1/2 stars, but I could either give 3 or 4 and 3 was too low so I gave it 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing the Movie: Endless Waltz","review":"One great Movie to end the Gundam Wing series.

Buy the other Gundam Wing video's too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless Waltz... the ultimate gw movie","review":"This movie displays incredible animation and has an awesome story line. It helps you understand what happens after the hit series Gundam Wing. I highly suggest purchasing this video. All the things children wonder is... what happens with relena and heero? Who does Lt. Noin get hooked up with? All these questions are ansered. Even the secret to trowa's identity. What amazed me is the awesome animation on this video. It looks like it's completly drawn by computers but it's not! Trust me, this is one video you HAVE TO GET. A must see. Thank you and enjoy your day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Gundam","review":"This was the secind animie movie i have watched but like the first it feed my desire to see more or this genre. I like this because it is a mix of funny and serious and it is non stop action it from the start had me interested in the gundam serise and made me want more of them. i would recommend to anyone wanting to see what anime is and get them started in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Ending To The Gundam Wing Series","review":"What can I say about this movie? I think that it's a fitting end to the Gundam Wing series which ties up most, if not all, the loose ends. We find where the five Gundam pilots end up and see that peace is finially reigning over the galaxy.You also get to see the new design of the Gundams(which was cool) and also where and how Heero, Quatre, Duo, Wu-Fei, and Troia started as Gundam pilots.Overall, I think that this is a great anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"Other then DBZ, I would have to say that Gundam Wing is the best Anime title out there, and the movie just makes it better. The Animation is the best I have seen since transformers the movie, which I also highly recommend to any big kids out there. It really does wrap up the Gundam Wing story line very well, even if there are some small flaws in it, like with the Gundams being different then the ones in the series, that does bother me that they didn't keep their Gundams. Don't get me wrong the new Gundams look great but it would have been better if they made an explanation in which the Gundam Pilots upgraded them, but all well its only a small flaw, at best. Other then that this is a great movie and I must say that Talgesse III looks great. So for now, GO AND BUY THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Conclusion....Definitely a MUST SEE!","review":"Where many sequels/conclusions in the past had failed in living up to the expectations and standards of their predecessors, Gundam Wing Endless Waltz is a five star OVA and is in equal standings with the television series. Continuing the story of what happedned after the war, and what has become of the great, heroic Gundam Pilots. Another war has come about, during AC 196 Chrismas Eve. The foundation that had come up with the original Operation Meteor has waged war on The Earth Sphere Unified Nation. The gundam pilots remember and confront their pasts and beginnings as pilots of their beloved mobile suits as they fight to save the Earth and humanity once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundamtastic","review":"This was an excellent movie. Having it on DVD is a major plus. Picture quality and sound quality are perfect. For any Gundam Wing Fan, or in fact and Gundam, this is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I don't understand why this series is so popular. I rented this movie to TRY and get into it. And I tried HARD! But as this movie went on my mind got bored and went elsewhere. I began thinking about a funny episode of \\"Family Guy.\\" Then I realized I missed an important scene in the movie. Not that I understood a single thing in it in the first place. The plot is so dry but what makes it dry is the voice acting. Somebody please get these characters personalities! They all talk in this flat, straight, serious voice. It's like they're all asleep and their mouths run on copilot. I think this could be a pretty good anime. The animation is beautiful and the character design is well done. But all the boys are a little too pretty if you ask me. I've heard rumors some of them are gay. At least if they were it would make the story a little more interesting. My only real complaint is the voice acting. Get some actors who have more than one tone in their voices and this movie might be pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"Personnally, I thought Endless Waltz was a MAJOR let down. The actual Endless Waltz series in Japan is MUCH MUCH better. This one, they just automatically turn into the new upgraded gundams, yet at the conclusion of Gundam Wing, they were using the Mid Staged Upgrades. If you notice the Alto-Long gundam, Wu-Fei's, has completely changed between the series and the Movie, and it give no explanation. Along with the other gundams undergoing a complete change. Also it has a horrible plot to it. I think this movie sucked bad. If you want to see the REAL continuation, Watch the actual Japaneese Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I liked this movie until I found out how much it rips off Zeta and ZZ Gundam. I mean, what the heck? Mariemaia is such a blatantly condensed copy of Mineva that it's almost funny.Another problem I had is Wufei's random alliance switch. Also, I think the ending was pretty dumb. I mean, no war again, forever? That's just too hard to believe.Yeah, I know I only touched the very surface... but it's Wing, not worth too much of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella & Loius","review":"This is the sweetest album I have.

Ella & Louis are, of course, the standards by which all other jazz vocalists learn and are judged; the songs are the brightest gems from the jewel box that is the great American standard songbook; and oh, by the way, the accompanists are the redoubtable Oscar Peterson trio. Just the best in the biz, that's all. If you're a jazz aficionado, you'll find a wealth to love and appreciate; if you're a casual listener, count on it!...This is music that'll just make you happy.

The key concept Milani introduces is regenerative economics, in contrast to the increasingly conventional notion of sustainability. As the name suggests, Milani's approach is about designing economic activity so as to improve, not simply maintain natural systems. While Hawken/Lovins/Lovins are awash with technical detail and appeals to the business ethics, Milani asks us to consider community organizing as a key element to green economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, though some songs are uninteresting","review":"Some of the songs are slow and boring, but this CD set has some stuff that's hard to find. It's probably worth $10 just for Chick Corea's song \\"Fickle Funk\\" which is on an album that is very hard to find and has to be imported (Secret Agent) and can't be found on Itunes. \\"Party Sex\\" by Roy Rogers is also very exciting and upbeat with a rippin' vibes solo, and \\"Hot Stuff\\" by Wayne Henderson has a great groove. My other two favorites are \\"Candido's Funk\\" and \\"Lord of the Golden Baboon\\" which is pretty wacko and awesome.I am a drummer too young to be alive in the 70s, so of course I am a poor authority on 70s jazz-funk, although I do play those styles of music today. Enjoy! or get some Weather Report or Return to Forever's Romantic Warrior album or Mahavishnu Orchestra's Birds of Fire. Yeah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This is an awful movie. Westerns which attempt to portray actual characters, or events, ought to do a better job with their history. The Long Riders is a good western, and really good history, with the same subject which shows it can be done.Movies are movies, though, and Gladiator doesn't suffer from its laughable depiction Roman Imperial politics.

While I don't expect any film to be a completely accurate by any means the beginning of the film is one of the most fabricated and unbelievable retellings of why the James brothers started robbing banks. Jesse James was a hero to many people and that is accurately portrayed in the film. The acting and lines are forced and corny and the locations where it was chosen to be filmed are poor, yes mainly in Northwest Arkansas but the mountains in Minnesota were the worst.

It gets pretty stupid. Everything about this movie is stupid, the plot, the over-'acting', the script, etc...I cannot believe these people allowed their good names to be associated with this film.

In this movie he tries to do the same thing, but fails. It has some very chaotic scenes and scenes with dark humour but this movie just isn't shocking in the way that Chainsaw was.Judd is a pretty good character, somewhat similar to the Jim Siedow character in Chainsaw, but most of the things in this movie, including the plot, is not very interesting.This movie can be worth checking out for \\"Chainsaw\\" fans, but don't expect too much from it. If you're not a fan of \\"Chainsaw\\" or Tobe Hooper - don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"This review is for the 2-Disc Special Edition of Eaten Alive:Based on what I read about the plot of this movie and the fact that a young Robert Englund acted in this film, I thought Eaten Alive would be worth the purchase, especially seeing how I'm such a fan of the horror genre.Well, once I finished watching it, I was set straight. So allow me to do the same for you: Don't waste your time or your money. It's really that simple.Dark Sky must have had to work extra hard to restore this film and it's still a grainy mess! Grain ran for over 95 percent of the movie, which seem to enhance the atmosphere, but it was way too much. I imagine the original negative was not properly cared for.The croc looked half real and half fake depending on the angle it was shot. The nudity was okay and the idea of using a scythe was kind of original, but the whole damn mess was poorly executed.Stay away.

He kills people and feeds their bodies to a large pet crocodile he keeps in the swamp beside his estableshment. Also of note is a very young Robert Englund as Buck the local punk. although not even close to Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre it does have bad acting, gratuitous nudity, and a splattering of gore to make it viewable as a friday night B-movie. . FYI This is ranked against other B-movies. To rank it against Hollywood blockbusters puts it at about 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Tobe Hooper","review":"Chainsaw is the perfect horror movie, and although this is no chainsaw, it is definitley the work of the same man. This is about as good a terror film can be without being TCM. The film is never boring, the villian is ultra creepy (think drayton sawyer from TCM running a hotel), and the cinematography is perfect. I'm not exactly sure what everyones problem is with the music, it seems to fit seamlessly. Well I'm sorry folks, I just gotta say i like this one. The gator effects however do leave a little to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but not terrible","review":"First off, let me warn you: this is nowhere near The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I do have to give the film credit though, as it holds up considerably well, being in the shadow of that master film. It's about a crazed redneck feeding irate motel customers to his pet crocodile (or was it alligator?), and Hooper tries for the ambience of Texas Chainsaw, and it's emotional intensity. As for how well he did, let's just say that you should put Texas Chainsaw completely out of your mind while seeing this, or you'll be very disappointed. But if you like a little backwoods horror, this one's not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eaten Alive","review":"Eaten Alive is a underated classic. Certainly my 2nd favorite Toby Hooper film which was his follow up after The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Its a very dark and strange and has a similar feel to Chainsaw. It actually has some pretty good kills with veteran actor Neville Brand playing a a demented motel clerk. Robert England makes his film debut in this movie. It's definitely worth checking out although i would probably just watch it on Netflix before buying or wait until a possible Blu ray release."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was Tobe Hooper Thinking!","review":"Ok. \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" was great. \\"The Funhouse\\" was just okay. But to say \\"Eaten Alive\\" is even worth 90 minutes of your time is stretching it. The story is...well let's just say there is no story. And the killer, well, wouldn't even frighten a five year old. The sets look fake, the costumes are cheesy, and the music stinks. Needless to say, \\"Eaten Alive\\" is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only reason I gave it two stars is because there are a few pretty decent chase scenes that can keep your attention for a while and get your mind off how horrible the film really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Cheapie.","review":"As disturbing as anything I've ever seen.

These authors evince clearly that there is no biological concept of race. Any effort to compare races is simply false beacause even anthropolgists and biologists cannot decide the cutoff point in races.So why do psychologists put people in categories that do not even exist? Ideology.The authors of the Bell Curve have no way to define the boundaries of race- even so there is no such thing as racial purity. In America 20% of whites have black ancestry. Unless psychologists can clearly delineate where races end and begin, books like the Bell Curve have no scientific legitimacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basso Profondo from Old Russia","review":"An incredible disc - magnificently recorded - including mainly sacred music from mesmerizing chant to soaring anthem but also a taste of patriotic and popular tunes. The amazing impact of the Russian \\"Oktavists\\" has to be heard to be believed. The sound of performers, singing an octave below the normal bass range with clarity and beautiful resonance, has been compared to the 16 foot pedal registration on a magnificent pipe organ. I am a musicologist and conduct classes from time to time on musical appreciation. I have lost count of the number of students who have ask me to get them a copy of this disc after experiencing it during my presentations. If you have never heard the Russian Basso Profondos you are in for a not to be forgotten experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible bass singing.","review":"While I do not give this a five, it is truly a CD of awesome MEGA bass singing. It is difficult to think that some mens voices can, indeed, sing such incredibly deep notes. It inspires awe and an appreciation of what the human singing voice can do. \\"The Orthodox Singers\\" male choir provides the background music, making a perfect platform for the extraordinary, very deep voices to shine. As always, I am also very impressed with the a capella singing in Russian Churches. It fills ones soul with the beauty of the music and a longing to be at peace with God. The only fault I can find is the \\"sameness\\" of some of the music.

Tolkien, and out of the books I've read by him this definitey is one of the better. It may not be better than the Hobbit (There and Back Again) though I think it is much better than the Fellowship of the Ring. The first hundred pages might be fairly slow but that would be what it would be if it were real life. Also, the pages after the first hundred are more gripping and exciting than almost any section in the entire Fellowship of the Ring. Even after the boring pages it is still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 2 continues Tolkien's epic of rings and Hobbits.","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"MW's Rave Review","review":"In The Return of the King, Frodo and Sam continue their perilous journey to destroy the Ring of Power in the fires of Mt. Doom. Throughout the book there are many exciting battles and scenes, and the end of the book is worth reading all of the books just to see how it ends.

I strongly recommend reading The Return of the King."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Kindle Edition","review":"Why is this book not available on American Kindle yet?

For some reason I liked the first one better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I did not like this book, it seems as though Tolkien ran out of words, so he started describing things that didn't need describing. The whole boook was good till the middle, it started slowing down, till it became boring. I read the first book in the Lord of the Rings series, and I liked it. But it seems as if Tolkien lost all sense of anything interesting. Don't bother to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trilogy is all borring","review":"I have read all three of the trilogy and a great number of other fantasy works. I have no choice but to say that while Tolkien made a indepth backrgound for his story that was all he did. Tolkien built a world, but he never wrote a story. I have never read a fantasy book less entertaining than these. He bores you with the details. Textbooks have fewer appendixes than his books. The only two redeming bits are the symbolism and world building. However, he missed one main concept, its all as borring as can be. Only a few obsessed people out there learn to speak elvish, for the rest of us he could have spent some time on an action scene and just written gibberish because thats all it is. His symbolism is certainly not deep enough to make the books worth reading either. The first and foremost reasons to write any book thats not a textbook is to entertain or make a point. He makes a simplistic point and keeps you saying, 'This sucks!'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would encourage this book for people with high reading ability, to read this book. Two Towers' is a very action packed book with lots of emotion and glory. Before you read this book you should be sure to read the book The Fellowship of The Ring or watch the movie so you can get some background information. I like this book because it shows the friendship of each other and their willingness to stay together. The hardships that they are faced with are very trying and testing of themselves. \\"But if we hold true to each other we will do what needs to be done.\\" This is a quote from the book. The two Towers' is totally a book to read if you are into action and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too long","review":"I would give this book four stars out of five. This is because the book is good with all the twists and turns, you don't know what's going to happen next. But the book is so long that the author spends too much time trying to describe places or towns that the book starts to get boring. I couldn't say that I was surprised at most of the events that happened in this book.He should of put a few random twists and turns. So this book is ok.The book starts in a place called Middle-Earth, a dark lord called Sauron created a ring, which had the power to destroy the world. Now Frodo and Sam have that ring and are on a quest to destroy that ring.This book was created by a man named J.R.R. Tolkien. He was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa in 1892. His father died during his childhood. After school, he joined the army. After that he found his wife and started the Lord of the Ring books."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of the return of the king","review":"The Return of The King which is the third book in the series The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is an amazing book. Tolkien tied up all the lose ends that were left from the other two books very eloquently. He doses a great job of not leaving out to much information. Closure is brought to almost everything in a detailed manner so that just enough is left to the imagination. Just when you think the book is getting dull or boring Tolkien throws in a few small plot twists to keep your attention. On the way home from there adventures the group which you come to know very well though out the series says its good byes. These are very touching and heart felt. As the book nears its ending you think everything is calming down and going to be peaceful. There is yet another surprise awaiting the hobbits when they get back to town. Overall these books is very well written and keeps you entertained on guessing what is going to happen next till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weseeeeeeeeeeeeeee","review":"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeree eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee e e e xxx ed f d xxx Chaucer .

The main characters are Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. The main part was the war. I like this book because it is very challenging.

I loved this book because it makes a whole new world of imagination and has description that it makes it seem like your actually apart of the journey. I also liked it because of the adventure and action sequences that take place in this book. But even though this book has action and adventure there is also the emotion that may even make you emotional.

I like the second book the best because I was surprised with that part because the movie left alot of things there out. I had seen the movie before I read the book. I liked in the first book when they won the battle of Helm's Deep. I also liked when Gandalf broke Saruman's staff. The book has a great ending even though it is not happy, it leaves you hanging. the movies did a bad job,in my opinion, of illistrating the books. I liked the character Gollum.He was very strange, though. I also like the fearsome Uruk Hai. Very neat charaters. The Ents must have really been hard to make up. They were pretty off the wall.

Being the second part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy it is the heart of the story. The book starts off on the run and stays that way for it's entirity.Tolkien creates a world, Middle Earth, that is so real and so believable, it seems to be an actual place. This makes the book better than most fantasy tales and provides a backdrop which works perfectly for the characters, which are very unique and diverse.

So many bad reviews came in for The Fellowship of the Rings; who would even want to come to this page?! I think this book is AWESOME! Tolkien is a genius. I love how he takes time to develop each persons character. Some say that the characters are flat and two-dimentional, but if you think that, *you're* two-dimentional!! The 'heroes' have flaws (even Aragorn), the antagonists have their good qualities (however few). Particularly, this is where we get some really good insight into the characters of Gimli and Legolas. Fellowship is a good start, but this is the best for characterization because by Return of the King you already know what everyone is like.

Pippin is in trouble with the Nazgul. And Sauron is gaining power. This is the amazing conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary trilogy. Merry becomes a soldier of Rohan, and Pippin becomes one of Gondor, Boromir's home town. Both of these armies prepare for an upcoming battle with Sauron's army of orcs and Ringwraiths. Along with them are Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf. Meanwhile, in Mordor, Frodo and Sam have been betrayed by Gollum, and Frodo is in the hands of Orcs. But soon Sam frees him, and they are off again to Mount Doom to toss the Ring into the magma and destroy it. Gollum makes one more appearance, but what happens I'll let you find out.

I like this series a lot and this book is a worthy successor to \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\". The only additional comment I'll make is that I like this series much more as an adult (I'm almost 30\\" than I did as a child. There is a lot of interpersonal interaction & emotion and not so much swordplay & action. Consequently this series is certainly acceptable for children but I think it's more geared towards the adult reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"All good things must come to an end","review":"The conclusion of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is an excellent read, and is only the least of the series when compared with the quality of the first two books. By itself, 'The Return of the King' is a tale for the ages. It ties up nearly every loose end. Readers might wonder why the book does not end where it seems like it should. Not to worry, for it continues because there is still one more adventure... one more challenge waiting for the Hobbits when they return home after completing the Quest. Our heroes are forever changed from the individuals they were back when we first met them in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' as are their surroundings. Such is the nature of the Hero's Quest. As with any good fantasy adventure (though 'Lord of the Rings' can be interpreted as a mythology of sorts), all characters within the story earn what they receive, and those that do evil get what they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR 2","review":"The box was squished in the corner but all the CDs are intact.The product looks a little worn but I haven't listened to it yet and I don't see any scratches so I think it should be fine.

I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"this is the second book to the lord of the rings. this is a phenomenal series. this is an awesome book. sometimes hard to get into but really good. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closure on an Epic tale","review":"Tolkien is fabulous at revealing the atmosphere of the worlds that he creates.

I will probibly read this over as there is just so much to absorb . Beautifully developed and wonderfully woven. The first part dives into the battle for Gondor and it is dark.

These decisions that they make, take each character on its own path and the events that take place in this book really help in developing the complete tale.The whole story really takes shape in it. Loads of things start happening, and many different characters take center stage. There is a lot more action, and the plot takes a few unexpected twists.Unlike the first part (The Fellowship of the Ring), this second book actually does have a season finale ending! so make sure you have the Return of the King (3rd part) close by, because you will want to start reading it straight away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a great and provoctive book, in my mind one of the best books of the century.

Tolkiens collection of creatures runs fromkobolds to hobbits he is the epitimy of what all fantisy writers should be like.The Two Towers I believe is his best book in the trilogy and to which all fiction writers should set there compasses.

If you are going to write a book about dwarves, do so. But, to write a book about dwarves, elves, farries, gnomes, wizards, and dozens more creatures is a bad move. The language of this book is excellent. It is very discritve and flows wonderfully, but the differences betwen what an elf is, and what a gnome is, is confusing. The plot I think is predictable. The characters seem to make a long journey through a woods, tunnel, mountain and meet another species in every chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGHHHHH!","review":"This book is SLOW. The characters aren't real at all, and they each have about 50 names. Take Aragorn for example: Strider Aragorn, Estel, King Ellisar, Plain Ellisar, etc. The names are unoriginal, like Arwen and Eowyn, different by one syllable. The book is rather confusing by itself, then if you read all the appendixes, you don't know who is who. The whole book is simply fighting and killing, with an occasional appearence by Gandalf. Merry and Pippin are the only source of humor, if they ever come up in the book. Did I mention that the characters are totally fake? Their actions are random and unpredictable, even for a fantasy, their speech is ridiculous. The \\"Greatest Fantasy Epic of our time\\" is a silly name for a book this long and boring. Totally overrated, this book stinks. What's worse is that it is the best book out of the series. For once the movies are better than the books. Even if they are saturated with special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated piece of garbage...","review":"I came into this book thinking it would be out-of-this world good, only to be disappointed. Maybe I had too high of expectations, or the fact that I had only read the Hobbit and the Two Towers, skipping the Fellowship of the Rings, might've thrown things off. Maybe it was because I knew what was going to happen(destruction of the Ring) and couldn't wait. I couldn't stand the long drawn out fluff details of the book or C.S. Lewis style writing about the \\"color of the landscape\\" for twenty pages. I would give this book .5 stars because I only enjoyed 1/10th of the book(the last part of the book that really didn't have much to do with the earlier portion), but the smallest rating a person can give is one. I would only suggest this book to people that have read the first three books in the series(people that would probably read this book as no matter what...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"New, but OLD","review":"The book arrived quickly and it was obvious it was never used. It was also OLD, as the pages are yellowed with age all around the edges. The cover 'cracked' after the first chapter and I'm hoping the book stays intact long enough for my 5th grader to finish it. I did not like that the cover image shown on Amazon (circa 2001 Peter Jackson's movie) was not the version we received. The cover image on our book was a cheesy 70's graphic, which explains why the book is in such brittle condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The book was in the condition that was described and arrived promptly. The spine is in perfect shape and so are the pages. The dust cover shows some wear but that is to be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...but I'm glad the movies are out!","review":"Love this series and love the final book. I just re-read it to prepare myself for the movie. As much as I love the books, I'm so glad Peter Jackson veered from the book and beefed up the roles of Legolas, Gimli, in addition to the battle scenes. Tolkien was one of the greatest creative minds of all time, but he didn't do a good job with the action, nor with Legolas and Gimli. I do love how he wrote Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Samwise and the other hobbits. All in all, a great book and a great series (and an amazing set of movies!). I wish Tolkien were still around to write more adventures. I would have loved to know what happened to some of those guys and gals!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, I know this will be an unpopular opinion but.....","review":"To some, Tolkien's greatest stregnth is creating a different world. To me, that is to some extent, his greatest weakness. He seemed to indulge that creativity too much in the third book. I found that the story and character development was greatly hampered by the constant description of locations. I know some love that aspect of the book, but to me, it made it unbearably slow at times. As soon as the action began, Tolkien would launch into detailed descriptions of places and their relation to other places. I could have skipped half this book and not have missed a thing. While I did enjoy the ultimate conclusion and happy ending, as well as the farewell between characters, this book largely could have been subsumed in the maps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"It's a shame to give this book only 1 star, so I gave it 2. There was nothing good about it except that it had a bit less description than The Fellowship of he Ring and it took me less time to finish reading. I think the plot was sort of unclear and it wasn't very interesting. The characters vere very unrealistic and unlikable to me. This book might be good if you're older than I am. (My dad liked it.) It was difficult and boring for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is incredibly written, and it keeps you hooked. Around every corner there are new things being introduced, and there are several new characters to met. The way J.R.R. Tolkien writes, you think that you are right there beside the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, MUCH better than its predecessor!","review":"This book definately bests its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less description and thank god, less SINGING! The part of the book that really won me over was Book 4. And especially the last 2 chapters! I don't want to give anything away, but I read them in one sitting. It was great. At one point, it got me crying. This is definately the best part of any book in the trilogy! The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because of Book 3. I found it pretty boring, except for a few surprises here and there. If you read the Two Towers, just skip straight to Book 4 and fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a great ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you possibly miss this?","review":"This book is the second part to a fantastic triology. I can't understand how anyone would miss out on story like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better","review":"This book is better than the first one as all the ground work has been laid and I was familiar and attached to all of the characters by this point. It was really interesting to discover more and learn more of the character Gollum and to meet other creatures and life which wanders Middle Earth. This book was FULL of surprises that I didn't see coming with a wonderful ending that kind of gave me the creeps. I'm about the start the third and final book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic Battles with Mystic Creatures","review":"The book, Lord of the Rings the Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien is great!

I mean, when I thirst;there is water:when I hunger;there is food. Now I am home-sick for Middle Earth; does'nt it exist?! Only a master writer like Tolkien can explain a world that creates such a yearning that invokes such a question. He was an avowed Christian so the answer may be in Heaven with him. If so,I wonder,is Middle Earth still \\"in\\" Tolkien, or is Tolkien \\"in\\" Middle Earth now ?

Boy was I wrong.This book has so much description, it is unbelievable. It makes you want to start talking and writing with more description. \\"In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mt. Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of Ephel Duath from those who climbed up the path from the west, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched in blood.\\"This is a great story about good vs. evil, Where an unlikely hero is asked to do the unthinkable.....

Powerful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Come True","review":"Most young or adult readers dream about having a great book with a little bit of everything. This book has a great mix of suspence,fantasy,action, and adventure. It is divided into two parts, the adventure of Sam and Frodo, and the adventure of the rest of the fellowship of the ring. This book is much better than the first but to read it you have to read the first book. The thing that astonished me the most was how the author developed the characters, making us readers know their personalities as if they really existed. I would recommend this book to any good reader, for his dream of a great book might come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The two towers","review":"I dislike the second part of the two towers although I did enjoy the first section because it moved much faster then the 2nd section. And the characters seemed to take forever to move from one spot to the next. However the characters themselves were devloped well and had distinct personalities.My favorite part of the book was the ending. Where Sam and Frodo were attacked by the spider like creature Shelob. This happend after thay had walked through caves for days and were betrayed by what they thought was there loyal and faithfull guide. Then beliving his master was dead Sam left him ther and went on only to find out later that his master, Frodo was only stunned.The charaecters were very vivd to me because of there ability to use what they had in the wild. They also had vey distinct personalities. The plot was very easy to understand even though it did move slowly at times. Over all I would recomend this book to people who have alot of time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I loved this book because it was one of those you just can't put down. This sequal to the Fellowship Of The Ring is just as good as the first. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and it keeps you guessing. I loved this book because it feels like it actually happened and you are hearing from someone who was there. J.R.R. Tolkien puts so many creative creatures and characters in this book. He makes up a history of wars and detailed maps, it is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the plot going","review":"I didn't enjoy this as much as the first part of the trilogy, but it was still pretty good. Strangely divided, though. The events of this book take place simultaneously in two locations, and rather than skipping back and forth, Tolkien for some reason tells all of what happens in one place, then jumps to the other parallel story, occasionally giving chronological markers -- while such and such was happening in the great battle to the north, yada yada. Still, a good, and obviously crucial part of a great overall story."},{"rating":"2","title":"100000 million stars","review":"im sorry but there is nothing i can say about this that hasent been said in the 100000 reviews for this book on amazon!

I would not recommend this book for some one who is reading it for school because it is hard to journal about or to summarize. This book is for people who like fantasy and books with a large vocab.

Then Bilbo (Frodo's uncle) had to leave the Shire. So Frodo took the ring. Then, Frodo went to Rivendell were he met Legolas and Gimli who helped on the quest to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt. Doom, which was in Mordor. On the quest Frodo got separated from all of his companions except Sam.I liked this book because it has a lot of action in it. I also think that J.R.R.

My favorite character is Legolas because the way the author writes about him is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part Two of the Epic Trilogy","review":"The Two Towers is another amazing book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Be sure you have read the Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring before reading this book. The only difference in this and the first is that the action heats up at the begining, right where the first left off. There are parts with Marry and Pippen and the tree people (the Ents) that can we boring, but you won't be able to put it down. The novel is filled with many battles, surprises, wit, and wisdom.

Part 2 is very well written with vivid battle scenes and intricate plot twists that were completely unexpected by me or anyone who i know who read it. The way the timeline of when the movie is set is congruent with the introduction of explosives and tactical warfare. The two towers in otherwords is a well written book that sticks to some kind of historical guidelines.

Otherwise, it is one of the best books that I have ever read. I'll admit, the first 50 pages were kind of slow, but when Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, everything is swept along from there. I liked how Frodo almost tamed Gollum, bringing him away from the lure of the Ring. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite succeed. Gollum delivers Samwise and Frodo into the hands . . . er-claws of Shelob and . . . well, I won't tell you the rest.

In this land, Middle Earth, are enchanted forests, grueling mountains, vast wastelands and glorious fields, all of which are setting to a great tale. A tale of hope, darkness, joy, pain, love, hate, triumph and sorrow all interwoven with masterful skill by a masterful storyteller.

We tried to remember to view it as a spoof, but it was just so truly horrible we just couldn't keep watching.Lucikly I could speed forward to the part I actually had wanted to see, which was a miniscule part of the movie and not a very good representation of her abilities, at all.We couldn't WAIT to turn this movie OFF ~I think this would make an excellent choice for anorexics, who might want a little help in throwing up.I would give this less than one star, if i could. Can you guess that this is not our cup of Tea? lolBut i don't pretend to know that it is not very funny to others. Just not for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd expect from Adam Sandler AT ALL","review":"I bought this movie thinking it would be funny considering Adam Sandler stars in it but it was a very low budget movie with HORRIBLE female acting and no nudity at all. I wouldnt say its the worst movie cuz it has its moments. I couldnt believe Adam hardley said one funny thing, alot of things he said I think were supposed to be funny but werent and whenever he tells a joke its a piece of s**t like \\"why did the chicken cross the road?\\". So I really wouldnt recomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"Great Story and second novel in the trilogy. I wish he would have written more. The crew of the AURORA continue their quest for normal lives after Earthblood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story, well sustained","review":"I thought this was a very unique little book, and it kept my interest from the first to last page because its characters were not predictable. I liked the heroine more and more as the story progressed...she was such a strong person. And I liked the twist re. her attitude toward her little boy. Not stereotypically female at all! I don't want to spoil the plot (not at all like the movie - much, much better) but I would encourage people to read it. It's a lot of fun and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of an afternoon","review":"This book was so bad I threw it in the trash after reading it. The only point I could get from it were that the surviving spouses were \\"star crossed lovers\\" just like the ones that died, so in the end they understood why they had been cheated on. The daughter mentioned on the cover is in the movie, apparently the person who wrote it didn't even bother to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Something drew me to this book in the store (probably the cover). It started off okay but then got very predictable. On the back cover, it mentions that one of foursome has a \\"daughter and a dog\\". It was a son, not a daughter. I really hate mistakes like that. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Pilots Wife","review":"I see by the reveiws that there seems to be no middle ground as far as like or dislike. I will not go into the story line as a lot of the other reviewers have so there is no need to. I read The pilots wife. Watched the movie and read the book Random Hearts. Of the two I thought the book Random Harts was by far the the best in all respects. Suspence, characters, story line, allso the ending was much better in Random Hearts the book. I feel it was better than the movie but that may be because I am not a big fan of Harrison Ford. As we all do not like the same books, if you feel like you would like to read this one, do so. As the old saying goes. One persons garbage is anothers treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this!","review":"Great plot starting out. It really sounded like it had promise, which I am sure is why a friend bought it for me. Two people running away from their marriages die in a plane crash. How would the surviving spouses react to their affair? I like romance and all. But, I could barely finish it. What a waste!How many ways can someone find to say \\"I love you\\" within 5 pages??? This was so trite, with so little character developement I cannot even recall the characters' names. But then why would I even want to do so? There are very few books that I have read that I could not find something in them to like. This was one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly awful book","review":"This was a true waste of time. The characters had no redeeming values. The self absorbtion and total devaluation of the child were abhorant. I read it all thinking it would redeem it's self in the end but it only got worse. One of only a handful of books that I wish I'd never read. The Pilots Wife is a wonderful book dealing with a simular situation and betrayal."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a perfect world this book would never have been written","review":"This book starts out quite well but once the adulterous spouses die in the plane crash the novel also takes a downward plunge. The behaviour of the surviving partners is quite impossible to credit, their motivations hard to comprehend and the romance between is unbelievably cliched and in bad taste.I somehow can't imagine that this mishmash can be made into a successful film so I think I'll give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and oddly unsatisfying","review":"The start of the paperback had me very interested, but halfway through, I began losing interest. The behavior of both surviving spouses did not seem logical, (such as the boy's mother leaving him for months, with his grandparents, with one or two phone calls with him.) I finished the book, but did not feel anything. I will feel regret that the pleasure of reading it is over, when an excellent book is finished. It may be a better movie than book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly awful book","review":"It is the reader's misfortunate that all of the characters do not die in the plane crash that occurs at the beginning of the book.

The playful, provocative, effortless romance of Jobim makes this a must-have for your collection. My first experience with it was on a 3 and 1/2 hour road trip, driving in the rain alone. The time seemed to pass in minutes. Having arrived at my destination, I was tempted to turn around and go back, just to extend the moment. The booklet, the interviews, even the unique wrappers around each CD were obviously done by someone in love with the man and his music. This box set wasn't created to make money but to honor the life-work of a master. Please don't let the price slow you down. This collection is extraordinary in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Greatest man from Bossa tunes","review":"I am simply glad for being allowed to write about this compilation CD, the greatest stuff in the Bossa Nova years can be found in this collection.

I personally think that the story is a very good one, and I think it's interesting to see how each person was selected for the mission. I showed this to my classroom of students in preparation for a trip to the Buehler Challenger and Science Center, and they really enjoyed this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHATABOOK!","review":"Of all the books that I have read, this is the best. Nobody does it better than David Eddings. His style of writing is so unique in a way that you'd think he's actually been there. The words that describes the scenes and objects that the characters see just sinks into ones mind.The characters' actions, characteristics, and the way they talk makes them alive. And it almost makes you believe that your right next to them and seeing all the action in front of you, but you theres no way you talk or respond to them.The way Belgarath and Garion communicates with wolve, and the way they describe wolves is so unbelievable that it's great. It's like seeing and feeling how wolves acually are.David Eddings description of how Torak was slayed and the action of the other gods were incridible. Nobody is better than David Eddings himself"},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"Just another example of why fantasy is considered pulp, and suitable only for 11 year old social outcasts. I read this when I was twelve and found it to be childishly written and poorly conceptualized, with paper-thin trite characters to boot. Oh well. If you read this series, and still want to give fantasy a try, read \\"Memory Sorrow and Thorn\\" by tad williams. It is everything these books are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh god let it be over with","review":"Well this last book was so drawn out I could barely finish it. I believe the series would have been better if it was in one 500 page book. Not to bad of a series but my god was it draw out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"What's love got to do with turning to the dark side, anyway?Even the god Torak thinks Polgara is a babe it seems, trying to convince her and wizard boy that his ideas are pretty cool.Needless to say, they disagree, and the heart of the matter will be a giant-sized magic sword fight between Belgarion, our hero, and the dark lord.Or, this is the end of an archetypal completely light, fluffy, devoid of consequence and disposable fantasy series for younger readers where the major characters are generally clearly stamped with 'not going to be hurt' markers, and all will be good in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably as low and ridiculous as it gets.","review":"This entire series is just a bunch of clichés gathered in one place. Some village-idiot grows up to become king over half the world and gets a magic sword (pulled from a wall--hmm..rings any bells? [The Arthur legend]) then he sets off on some silly quest to rid the world of all evil. I read these books (and the following series \\"The Malloreon) when I was 12 years old. That is probably the upper limit if you want to enjoy them. Eddings couldn't come up with an interesting story if his life depended on it. The main character (Belgarion) jumps around with a big silly sword killing bad-guys to the left and the right, but in 10 (!) books he doesn't get hit once!! Silly or what?My advice is to start reading some real fantasy like Tolkien or Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Belgariad Series","review":"I had not read in a little while and found out I was going to have surgery. So I hit the book store searching for a book. I love the King Arthur lore, so the first book in this series appealed to me. OMG!! I picked the perfect series. I read the first five before I left the hospital. I enjoyed it so much, as a present my husband bought me the first book in the second series. What I enjoyed was the different layers to the story and the characters. Each character had the flaws and their good points. The story line on the surface is somewhat simple and easy to read. But each time I read them I find a new depth and meaning to each plot twist. I even managed to talk my husband, my nephew and my niece into reading them. We all agreed the series is a 5 star read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and non-comprehensive book","review":"Having read this book two thoughts come up:1. They should have had much more in-depth data, why stick so much to the surface ?2. Is their overview of ways to deal with radical innovation comprehensive ?Seen the impressive list of authors and the impressive research they've done the book is disappointing. Maybe because they were limited on what they could disclose, time pressure etc.To learn more about dealing with radical innovation I recommend the books 'Corporate Venturing, 'Intrapreneuring', 'Webs of Innovation', 'The Innovators Dilemma'.So should you read 'Radical Innovation ? Well if you're active in the field it should be on your shelves, otherwise I wouldn't spend my dollars on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Save The Smithereens!","review":"Everything I hoped it would be and more. Definitely their darkest album, but still fun nontheless. If you only know the Smithereens from their singles during the eighties, click on \\"House At The End Of The World\\"; it's great (actually, I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days!). Check this album out and like the fan from Indiana said, see them live if you can. They're as good a live show as there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Smithereen's best effort....","review":"I must say that I was disappointed with this CD...I really was expecting much more. Too many mid tempo songs that tended to sound alike and just didn't seem to go anywhere. Carrie Akre's guest vocal on \\"House At The End Of The World\\" was a real treat though.

The Smithereens were one of the first \\"college rock\\" groups I really liked because they didn't sound like the usual dreck eMpTy V played, but between this and the second best-of, the band's becoming as unattainable when it comes to new material as the girls Pat DiNizio used to sing about. Is it writer's block? Is it lack of interest on the band's part? Learn from the mistakes of George Lucas, boys. You sang it yoruselves on the Timecop soundtrack, \\"Time won't let me wait that long.\\"And to the buyer, unless you're a pair of Nikes shy of Heaven's Gate when it comes to the Smithereens.

And it's a good thing, because there would be a huge void without them. Drawing on influences from the '60's, as ever, but inspiring great new music, they are sounding more fresh and in control than ever. She's Got A Way is a great single, but it doesn't stop there.

Alas, there were none. Margaret Bourke-White was a remarkable photo-journalist who has given us many remarkable and lasting images of industry, war and society. She joined Life magazine at its founding and died at the time of the magazine's demise in 1972.This book provides a comprehensive look at her work decade by decade with the best of her best work included with an introduction to each section by Sean Callahan. The appearance of this book is long overdue. A perfect companion to this volume is the biography by Vicki Goldberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I did not buy this book because MBW was an inspirational female or other, but because her photos are simply superb.

Spandau Ballet is one of the very best bands of all time and Gary's solo LP is worth listening to. No it's not Spandau Ballet and no Gary doesn't have Tony Hadley's vocals but he has a really great voice (fav song Lady Soul) with great range. The music has a celtic flare and a soulful blend. Don't buy it expecting a Spandau Balllet album, buy it if you're interested in great music & songs that stand on their own. Definitely recommend this album, it's worth more than a listen, it's worth a chance by fans and non fans alike. A+++, it really is a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mysteries of The Redemption","review":"I do not understand the title? If you are into the spiritual search then this book is a waste of time. It a meandering, poorly structured book of dreams, written much like a diary. Poorly structured, boring to read and no credibility to the personal dream life of someone that thinks they are special because of their astral dreams of past lives and angels and the like. I found it to be the worst book I have read. I gave up (I usually persevere with a book) at page 291. Just a waste of time. Can't understand the positive reviews.

Although I looked at all the great authors Bob mentioned, Thomas Troward very quickly became my favourite..These lectures, on what became known as 'New Thought', kind of metaphysical also, are nothing short of profound - if you study them and work them, not just read them.The principles contained in them are truly the secret to all this modern day talk about the 'Law of Attraction' and 'The Secret Movie' etc..I came across them a few years ago, and now they form a solid piece of my personal growth - in fact most Sundays I use these as my spiritual lessons[..]Yes, you need to study them, think about them, and shift your thinking into a more contemporary context - but the principles are timeless, and beautiful..Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Edinburgh Lectures","review":"The book arrived in perfect condition.

I love reading anything that has to do with him.The only problem I ever have with writings of T. Troward is that sometimes he speaks a little too intellectually. He also sometimes refers to things that are a bit dated, and that can also make it difficult to follow along at times.There is nothing else out there for learning how to use your thoughts to control your life, like the teachings of Thomas Troward. If that is an area of study that interests you, then read anything of his you can get your hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Truths","review":"The Law of Attraction isn't a new thought - Thomas Troward was teaching it in the early twentieth century.

Use it nearly every day","review":"I've owned this cutting board for well over five years and use it almost every day. It is just the right size for pairing vegetables, cutting up a small piece of meat, or other general purpose tasks. Bamboo is a great material for a cutting board because it has a very fine grain, meaning that it doesn't splinter, and puts up with a whole lot of abuse from a knife blade. I've used bamboo and maple cutting boards, and I've found that the bamboo boards don't seem to retain as much odor as maple boards. They also wash very easily and are aesthetically pleasing.

This album divulges his ability create several different moods within one track, yet maintains the continuous flow of the song. Guests like Craig G and Allison add flavor to the syncopated and groovy beats.

This is not a bad thing. This book is a great tool to help anyone understand the workings of the Federal Reserve System. Whether or not someone agrees with how the Fed runs itself is a seperate matter from this books intention and who this book was created for. This book does not get into philosophical idealogy of economic systems and it shouldn't. It accurately discusses the tools the Fed uses to help steer the economy in the direction they want it to go. It also explains the layout of the structure of the Fed. This book is good for anyone curious about the structure / tools of the Fed and why it does what it does. The Fed helps run our economy and this book shows how pretty decently. It won't disappoint you, as it is straight-forward and comprehendable.

It is based on religion rather than psychology, with attention paid to The Bible and the role dreams played throughout.The author posits that a dream is a vision of the future, and that any relationship with the past or present is incidental.From a religious perspective, I question the authority and validity of the author's interpretations.Scientifically speaking, the work has very little to offer aside from an alternative/historic view (which is not without value).Now that dream psychology is mainstream, and religious dream interpretation is on the fringe, this book's title is misrepresentative. A more fitting title might be \\"A Religious Dream Dictionary: 10,000 Dreams Interpreted.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice \\"Edwardian\\" Way To Interpret Dreams","review":"While being far from psychologically acceptable (or believable) these days, Miller's \\"Dictionary of Dreams\\" does present a glimpse into how our great-grandparents interpreted dreams - it reminded me of Mrs. Beeton's \\"Book of Household Management\\" and its codification of Victorian housekeeping! I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys interpreting dreams in a humorous spirit, as well as for those who enjoy authentic examples of popular history.And, to anyone who has an issue with the dream analyses - lighten up!

I have the premium version, but no Canada maps- which I hear they're giving free now- I called Teletype, but they won't give them to me even though I paid $50 more than what they're selling them for online now- they want me to pay $45 more- If I was even modestly happy with this unit I might bite- BUT NO WAY can I support this group with more $$- I wouldn't even give this product 1 star, but it seems I've little choice....you've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Not As Described","review":"The Kindle combined edition of Alice['s Adventures] in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass described here [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011U42V6/ref=yml_dp ] has neither the Tenniel illustrations nor the annotations mentioned in the description. As you can get the books for your Kindle for free, it's not worth getting the combo - even for 99 cents - without these features. That seems rather the point of purchasing it. (It was for me, anyway.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title: ONE Book Only","review":"I really wish I'd read the review of this kindle book before I purchased it. It is not Alice in Wonderland & Through the Looking glass but Alice in Wonderland ONLY. Very irritating.There is really nothing positive to say about this edition, the formatting is about par for a cheap kindle book. It's manageable but disappointing. If I were reviewing \\"Alice in wonderland\\" then I may have given it a 3-star review but as it is was inappropriately titled the entire experience is a disappointment.I wish there was some way to preview Kindle editions (screenshots etc) before purchasing them. You can read sample chapters but in this situation it would not have revealed that this is really only Alice in Wonderland. But it was a bargain and such things are always a bit of a crapshoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the illustrations?","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book. The formatting is poor and they have removed all the great illustrations. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"this edition was NOT what I expected","review":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Alice in Wonderland, and have from childhood. Rereading it made me more aware of the intoxicating dreamlike quality of the story line as well as the incredibly tongue-in-cheek writing style. BUT... I was very disappointed to open it and find it contained NO illustrations whatsoever! Reading A.I.W. without the John Tenniel drawings is like eating plain dry bread. I know the drawings by heart so I could imagine them, but it isn't the same. Also -- many many typos! Avoid this edition! I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection for a good price","review":"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe in impossible things? Try doing it a couple times a day.","review":"A very cute and very fun read, even over 100 years later. The word play and sheer ridiculousness of the characters that interact with Alice always makes this book lively and interesting. And yet, for a book that bills itself as a children's novel, I would find it hard to believe that adults who have never read it before couldn't enjoy it in their old age. No matter what age you are, though, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth much more than I bought it for.","review":"This by far is my best amazon purchase.

It has meaning beyond telling you about wonderland, because it gives you riddles and poems that make you think. This book also contains through the looking glass,the second and last Alice book. This is one of the best and imaginative books in my opinion ever wrote. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll. The book itself is not worth your money. The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf? Overall, the book is very cheap and thrown together. Get a nicer version that also has the original illustrations by John Tenniel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Kindle edition is not worth it","review":"This review is not about the book itself, but about the $0.99 Kindle edition.

As entertaining and totally bizarre as ALICE is, I can’t help but wondering if the whole of it is structured in any meaningful way. The experience itself is like a dream, or more probably also like a drug induced high, and the story is infinitely fascinating. It seemed to me (I had never read it as a child) that adults can appreciate this more than a child can, since the child can probably find the plot more humorous than illogical.

I wanted to be able to read the wonderful poems, like The Walrus and the Carpenter. However, this edition has no table of contents, and no index, which means I am unable to search for and go to the places in the book I am interested in. This makes it useless to me.

There's a lot the Disney movie left out so read the whole thing. Lewis Carol's style of writing is very reader-friendly.

Unfortunately I failed to read the small print: keep in mind that most of the reviews posted to this edition refer to other editions. The edition I bought was the CreateSpace paperback with the pink and white cover.This particular edition has NO illustrations. It is also cheaply made -- the cover is flimsy and the binding is poor. Finally, the quotation-marks printed in this book are all straight, not curved -- as if it were typed up and printed from Wordpad.I was not satisfied with this volume.

But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again. I am glad to have read them, though, as Alice's tale is a classic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good.","review":"I fully expected this book to be illistrated. obviously the reviews I read were for another publication.

There were several times that I had wanted to stop reading each novel, but persevered only because I wanted to see why these two novels are such beloved classics.However, I don't understand why these two novels are so beloved.

A lot of the characters are unique, but only appear for a brief period and aren't fully developed (or even partialy).Usually I'm a bad critic because its easy for me to enjoy anything, but I've had a tough time getting through this one, I dont even think its a good childrens book, they'll say the same thing I do.

In rereading the book, I laughted loudly at times of the cleverness with which it was constructed. As a very 'mature' reader I had remembered such from my youthful reading of it. Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence! This book really is a must for anyone's collection of childhood classics read and enjoyed, even if one is older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best [cheap] illustrated version for Kindle","review":"Buying a copy for $10 seemed silly when there are so many options for less than $2.

I even bought serving pieces, salt and pepper shaker etc.... When the first couple of pieces chipped I thought perhaps I was careless (although my last dishes never had this problem). I took greater care with them and yet they countinued to chip. Less than a year later I only have 2 salad plates, 3 dinner dishes, a salt shaker, a sugar bowl and 3 soup bowls.

He makes a number of descriptions about human anatomy that make me question whether he has had any training at all. If this book is a result of 25 years of study then he may need to quit since time in this circumstance is not generating greater understanding.Nothing revolutionary here, plenty of this type of work has been better explained and correlated in many other places.Save your money for someone who knows what they are talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that all doctors and their patients should read","review":"The writer makes everything perfectly clear, no one who speaks English, above the age of 13 would not be able to understand!The book discusses plainly every ailment and 'condition' and anyone who truly wants their body to be in the best condition possible can learn from this book.Highly recommended also for professionals: personal trainers, physio therapists, massage therapists and Bowen Therapists.

It might be that after reading all of his earlier books Lescroart's 'Second Chair' might be comfortable territory for the initiated. But as a stand alone book, this is pretty tired fare. The plot is far fetched and does not gel into the remotest idea of cohesion. The story bumps along from one character to the next like a bad auto accident. The characters are cardboard cut outs that are painful to imagine. And lastly the ending is a disaster of major \\"saw that coming\\" proportions.The writing style itself is not too shabby, though Lescroart could have whittled down the story by a hundred pages and lost nothing.Plainly, this is just a sub par Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable","review":"Having read all his last six books Lescroart disappointed me with this one. I was able to guess both the Executioner and how the two stories involving Glitsky and Hardy were going to converge half way through the book. The next 200 odd pages were then difficult to get through.Lescroart still retains his captivating style and warm characters but this book is living off the success of his last couple with constant references to events from the First Law. If I hadn't read The First Law before this one I would have struggled to understand what all the references to the previous year was about.I would only recommend this book to his die hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal Breaker","review":"This books starts with a murder. The suspect: a teenage boy who does his best too look and act guilty. Because he's a juvenile, he can be saved from LWOP (Life without Parole), if he pleads guilty to a double murder.Everyone thinks this is a great idea. The perp will be out at the age of 25. There is no long trial and the DA gets convictions on two murders. Everyone except the suspect who at the last minute refuses the deal, because he insists that while he might be a creepy kid, he didn't kill two people.Now, things get going! That's the beauty of this book.

Over and over again, I tell myself I am done playing, only to come back again and agian for one more run. The gameplay is that fun. Now, the downside. Tricks are hard to pull off in any major way. Small tricks are not really difficult at all during the races. THis makes the races insanely fun. But trying to pull off major tricks in the trick challenges is a complete nightmare. Good luck ever beating the computer opponents. Probably the worst part of the game though is the fact that it takes FOREVER to unlock new slopes. Seriously, you have to beat the computer opponents like umpteen million times before you unlock more slopes.Bottom Line: The racing part of the game is so fun it is worth every penny you spend on this game.

Once in a while a book comes along that I can't stop thinking about even when I'm not free to read--I can't wait to get back to it. This is one of those books. There are several characters and plots all leading into one major plot; yet, it never gets confusing or boring. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"While I have not seen it mentioned here, I think it is important to note this book won a Edgar Award in 1982. After having read the book I can see why it did as well as the high comments provided by others here. A few additional comments follow.I often find books spanning several generations such as this one to be very entertaining. The development of the characters as well as the community in which they were set was particularly well done. A few of the characters along with the common theme that spanned the length of the book gave additional depth to the story.

I think the plot was a bit scattered and the dialogue shift between some of the characters was over used and cliché, but for the most part the book was okay.The authors slips a bit of sociology in there too. You see a circle of events but you also see the answer to questions that, as adults, we see in kids. \\" How can anyone hate like that?\\" Well, the family may be part of the reason and in this story, you get that.

This book tells the stories of three police chiefs in a small town who recognize that a serial killer is torturing young boys and men. The first town chief. both literally and in the book,Chiefs (Will Lee Novel)gathers information about killings that seem linked and has them hidden in his desk. He is killed before he can learn more about the killer. The second chief is selfish and uses the position as police chief for personal gain. He learns the identity of the killer. The third is an African American chief who finds the lost papers of the first chief and eventually has enough evidence to arrest the killer. Chiefs is well-written, including great characters, atmosphere and descriptions as the town grows and addresses racial issues, and the slow, fascinating search and arrest of a serial killer of many young men over years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chiefs","review":"I first read Chiefs when it was new - and since the publisher didn't know whether it would sell, printed only 200,000 of them. So, now they're scarce, and I was fortunate to receive this book. It's my favorite of Stuart Woods books, and it was his first. They made a movie series of it as well - shown on TV, and it was excellent, and true to the book. Why couldn't it be released again? Both the book and the movie? It covers a few generations in a small Georgia town with a series of Police Chiefs, and it interested me since I live in Georgia. The fictitious name of Delano is a clever name for the small town, since FDR had connections here at Warm Springs, Ga. - and his middle name was Delano. There is a running mystery throughout - which keeps one on the edge of the seat. Strange. John Grisham's first book, \\"A Time to Kill\\" was his best, too. I highly recommend this book as very excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Woods' has written!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I do not like books set back in time but this book was one of Woods 1st and I think best.

Ten or less new words are introduced with each lesson, easily learned in the context of simple, repetitious dialogue. Each lesson also includes some basic grammar and exercises to practice reading, writing, and speaking. Sephardic pronunciation of vowels and alphabet, including script, are given in the back; I love it that practice reading and writing the script is included from the second lesson on. I also love it that there is no distracting transliteration, but the student is expected to be reading simple words from the get-go. Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew dictionaries in the back are only 9 pages long, so the book is slim, easy to carry around, and very accessible.

The grammer and and sentance structure could use some work, but considering that English is not the author's first language it was not too bad, I have seen worse from native born speakers.

(In fact, the same story in a different setting already WAS a terrific movie back in 1981, \\"Taps\\")The book reads as though it was fleshed out from a screenplay.

Street Boys is an inventive tale of the events of those riveting four days, but why stray so far from the truth? Heroes of the past deserve a just tribute, and in this case the truth is far more gripping. There was no American star that taught these poor boys to fight, and moreover, the bravest of the boys who did on their own were each awarded Gold medals of Honor for valor, an all-empowering fact that Carcaterra seemingly overlooked in his fiction.An enthralling depiction closer to the truth can be found in the 1980 book and now audiocassette title \\"Four Days of Naples\\" or the 1963 Academy Award nominated film of the same name by Nanni Loy. It will be interesting to see if Carcaterra's 2002 tale receives as much acclaim. Though I seriously doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched, formulaic, awful","review":"I kept thinking, while I was reading Street Boys, that this book is a terrible insult to the actual street fighters who held off the nazis and their panzers in the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland, only to be lost in the end.The author, to compound the error, makes every action scene uninteresting and unbelievable, and every emotional scene (death and love) devoid of emotion. Episodes of dying children are smarmy or corny, or both at once. Children outsmart and overwhelm seasoned soldiers who have far superior firepower at every turn.Even the most egregious mistakes supposedly made by the Germans would not have enabled outnumbered and overmatched children to destroy a panzer division and hundreds of enemy troops, along with a German tanker.I hope no one buys this book. I hope no one pays to see the movie. I hope people read Mila 18 by Leon Uris instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing--desperately searching 2nd movie deal","review":"This is the third Carcaterra book that I have read (Sleepers, Apaches) and by far the worst. The scenes in this book are so unbelievable, I found myself stressed about finishing the final 1/3 of the book. There is a stead-fast rule in this book: If a character has a name, he/she is probably not going to die. I feel Carcaterra realized this in coming to the end of writing, so he kills off several characters in a matter of pages.I also feel that Carcaterra remembered that he introduced the idea of conspiracy from the other street boys in the late rounds of writing and realized that he had to kill their leader before moving forward.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. I regretfully picked this book up in an airport bookstore based on my past experience with Carcaterra novels. This will be my last based on the fact that I felt he was whoring his writing out and begging for a movie deal with his latest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book because it was about two of my favorite topics, Naples and WWII. The author lured me into thinking this was a historical novel, but that is not true. He has no sense of geography. Anyone standing in Naples and facing the sea will have Vesuvio to their LEFT, not the right. Salerno is SOUTH of Naples. There were many errors in the Italian phrases in the book. The story seemed based on early sixties war films. Connors jeep apparently had a bottomless fuel tank. In spite of fierce battles all around, he and Nunzia find time for a \\"quickie\\". The German Colonel reacts to everything by slamming his fist on something. Charecters appearing in one part of the city, then another part of the city without the benefit of public transportation.There are countless true stories about the bravery of the Sgunnizzi [street boys] that need to be told. Perhaps another author will do them justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and poorly written","review":"What a disappointment! There is very little in this book that merits even one star, but that's as low as I could find.Carcaterra knows virtually nothing of military tactics or equipment, and very little of the events in Naples that this book tries to portray.He is completely out of his element in writing this story, and anyone who has ever served in the military will be unable to finish the bookPerhaps Carcaterra should stay with the \\"Sleepers\\" theme, which he seems to know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"no idea","review":"yet to receive it.Have no clue where the wire reached.Am confused whether i was able to cancel it or did i just take it as one of those loses that do tend to happen over internet shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"as much as I dig Warren Beatty's work i can't get down with this film.only Harvey Keitel makes this film worth seeing.the only good thing that came out of this film was the union of Beatty&Bening.very cliched Gangster flick.Ok writing&Directing but nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a star, but Amazon insists on one","review":"Many years ago I saw this movie in a movie theater and was totally smitten by Anette Bening. Without Bening it would be just a mediocre romance set in a classic mob environment and played by otherwise mediocre actors. But Bening makes it sparkle. Well, don't buy this DVD, the quality of picture and sound is so bad it will make you cry. It's actually not much better than illegal copies of movies filmed from the screen.

Just renting it yesterday I'm left with one thing to say: ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I'm not really a Warren Beatty fan. I enjoy his work in some films but not all of them. While I thought he turned in a good performance I have to admit I was much more taken with the performances by Annette Benning,Harvey Keitel,Joe Mantegna,and of course Ben Kingsley. A perfect ensemble of characters all directed very stylishly by Barry Levinson. Not to mention a screenplay equally as effective. This movie just isn't for fans of \\"mob\\" movies,but more so for people who enjoy watching great movies in general. Keep your eyes on the prodution and costumes designs which deservingly won Oscars.

In the days of Lucky Luchiano, Meyer Lansky & Capone, it really could have been good, but the focus is more on Bugsy's strange personality than it is about the mob. If you're looking for that good solid punch that Donnie Brasco had, it's not here & its a shame. I was surprised it was rated so high here on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatrical cut gets 5 stars, extended gets 3","review":"Bugsy, in it's original form, is a great movie. I was excited that there was an extended director's cut when it came out.However, as extended director's cuts often turn out, this one was a bust. It becomes easy to see that the deleted scenes were deleted for very good reason. The pace of the film is excellent with the scenes removed, and totally wrecked with them inserted. The ending is particularly punished by the different editing, which is too bad, because the theatrical release has a GREAT ending.So stick with the original DVD, folks. Hopefully there will be a Blu-ray with the original cut available eventually. Until then, I shall practice elocution while I wait...\\"Twenty dwarves took turns...Twenty dwarves...Twenty dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Mess with the Original","review":"I really like this film and I am disappointed with this DVD. The transfer from the film to DVD was not done well. The colors have become way too saturated. In most of the scenes the characters faces are either too red or too yellow. I'm going to hang on to my VHS of this movie from many years ago which actually looks better than this DVD. The color and overall look of the film are decided by the Art Director working in collaboration with most of the other major contributors to the film. It is a lot of work and the outcome is the result of many decisions along the way. There is no reason to go messing with that. Oh, and the extra scenes that were not included in the original theatrical release? They did nothing for me. The film was perfect the way it was. Please leave the Editing and the Art Direction to the experts.

Further the acting of certain characters is excellent, Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley.Sadly I fear Beatty's performance falls, at times, into slapstick - more of the vein of Stallone in \\"Oscar\\" than one of the most feared players of Murder Inc.I summary I'd say if you are a fan of the genre watch this movie despite Beatty, and if you are a fan of Beatty watch this movie despite the genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating info on the birth of Las Vegas","review":"I never really thought or cared about how Las Vegas was started. Well...I now know!BUGSY is a slick, lavish and eye-catching film that oozes directorBarry Levinson. This is a real treat for the senses.The attention to the most minute detail is a hallmark of Levinson's work.Beatty and Bening are not favorites of mine.I personally hated the characters they portrayed in Ben Siegel and Virginia Hill.I hated what these characters did to others and to themselves. I am not a fan of MOB movies and in fact usually dislike them....but I liked this film.Why? Barry Levinson, that's why.He made this film work for me. This film is elegantly made...set design, cinematography, soundtrack etc.Sometimes you can detest the characters and feel nothing for them (hence the 4 stars!), but in the right hands anything can be made enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugsy a disapointment","review":"I was disappointed by this DVD.

It tells us about his life as a man, philosopher, theologian, alchemist, scientist and public figure. It tells us how he interact with other scientist and how his ancestors were like.

You don't need to know or do anything else. All things you desire will flow into your experiences. I have lived and proved this theory for years. There is once in a while that I got thrown off a little due to the outside circumstances.

Particularly interesting are the unreleased sides and, on Volume 2, a version of \\"Please Mr. Brown\\" done ala Vivian Blaine as Adelaide in \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" The alternate versions of familiar Vaughan recordings are often intriguing butwhat is most notable is that, doing either the greatest American standards or the most forgettable single B side, Sassy gives her all.

It is 275 pages, but the information could be printed in half that if weren't all double-spaced and in large type. It is also cheaply printed--the titles seem to use a drop shadow effect that might have looked good on-screen, but looks more like a bug when printed.Only basic command-prompt stuff is presented. I don't see anything about file name completion, for example, and newer tools like fc (File Compare) are not included.There are six pages on scheduling tasks with the \\"at\\" command, but it never mentions the newer XP command, schtasks, which is better integrated with the GUI version.Finally, there is no index in the book. There is a chapter that has commands sorted by function rather than name, but it isn't a substitute for a real index."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Letter Writer","review":"Groucho Marx is known for his letter writing. This collection is great, but not as good as The Groucho Letters. Since these are only to his daughter, Miriam, they don't reflect aspects of his personality that show up in The Groucho Letters, which are collected from diverse people, family, friends, and other show people, not to mention Warner Brothers during a law suit.But I love this collection because Groucho comes across as a loving and concerned parent who can't get enough of his children. He is supportive, generous, thoughtful and witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful to Miriam for letting us in","review":"Miriam Marx has been quite gracious in letting us in to the family's private world to read her father's letters. He was a great letter-writer, as evidenced by other collections, and a great writer in general, having published several books.The Groucho Letters: Letters from and to Groucho Marx,Memoirs Of A Mangy Lover,Groucho And Me. His wit and intelligence carry through.These letters from a father to his daughter show an openness and honesty, a presumed closeness with his daughter that at first blush seems an uncommonly close connection, continuing across distances.How many parents would simply write \\"We had burgers for dinner, I hope you are fine, how's the cat?\\" What a contrast this collection shows.Well worth the read - as is seemingly anything that Mr. Marx wrote - and it is worth thanking Ms. Marx for publishing the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old School Canister Oil Filter","review":"I purchase this filter for my 1981 BMW 528i, and I must say that I am very pleased to install an old fashioned canister oil filter on my car.The canister filters are bigger, and I can only assume that they can filter out more impurities than a smaller spin-on filter.If you have an older BMW, enjoy the fact that you are purhcasing a better filter than anything that comes afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi!","review":"\\"look at this this, at every turn is not even good enough for a picture on amazan\\" i hear you say, but no even though this band is now defuncted there music will always stay with me, the not katies were a quite an underground band on deck cheese records, but one of the best i'd say.

That being stated, and all things considered, I am always disappointed when I receive an incorrect or incomplete order, but I really do like this light and it stays on your head securely with the adjustable elastic headband. Additionally, the light pivots up and down for directional use and the 3 or 6 LED light brightness positions illuminates the directed area very adequately. Got lucky!

I was in search of a new pair and chose the Tweezerman Spirit 2000 because they look identical. I know they are not made for clipping nose hair but I had hoped they would do a good job and chose to buy this expensive item. For the price they have let me down in that the quality cannot manage cutting nose hairs without damaging the nose tissue. As someone who uses buzzer shears to cut my hair short, the Tweezerman is utterly useless for my needs.

The arrangement for Fur Elise was a nice piece for a quick-learning beginner to study accidentals, and the arrangements for \\"All the Things You Are\\" and \\"Misty\\" have been helpful in beginning some jazz studies. Otherwise, I agree that a lot of the arrangements are off, and while there is a large variety of songs, I find that there are a lot of them that I would not have chosen for a book that presumes to call itself \\"The Greatest\\".

I still don't have all the Moria skills. I still need to lv the side of the fellowship and get there skills. I belive you could spend 20+ hours to get everthing.The graphics on this game is the best i've seen on a handheld. The sound is great as well. The game also has clips from all three movies.Now the down side. As you work your way through the game, all your heros gain exp. It don't matter if they was in combat or not.

Good story and plot, but I found Lauren's constant questioning of Rawlins' motives and actions irritating. After all, he's the professional. That aside, I would recommend the book. A MUST read is LAUREN BACH's sexy and thrill a minute \\"LONE RIDER\\". WOW! A five plus read.

His argument shows the changes in NYC during the time period, with the growth of the suburbs leading Robert Moses to believe that the future of pro sports and high society in general are outside the cities. But this only leads to Brooklyn having one of its few identities ripped away, while the likes of Shea Stadium (Moses' master plan) portends one of the more dismal eras in stadium building and location.On the other hand, Shapiro discusses how even after the Dodgers became in interested in moving, their dream deal at Chavez Ravine could easily have collapsed.Meantime, there is a game on the field and Shapiro details how the Dodgers, despite the age/physical breakdown of most of their stars, and all sorts of other problems, fight for one more National League pennant, leading to the last and probably best of the Subway Series'.Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great History Lesson","review":"This book goes beyond just a detailed view of the Dodgers' last great year in Brooklyn, it also provides a nice historical snapshot of the legendary borough and the changes that were taking place. This is a well researched book with a lot of great information on Dodger greats such as Reese, Snider, Newcombe, Robinson, etc. I definitely enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Good","review":"Wow. First let me say that I'm not a Brooklyn resident or a Dodger fan and picked this book up without knowing anything about it. The book turned out to be one of the best baseball books I've read in quite some time.I was drawn into the book immediately. It is clear in the Prologue that Shapiro is a very good writer and that the book is as much about the fifties and Brooklyn as it is about a pennant race. The book is enjoyable on both fronts.Shapiro does a great job of weaving a portrait of the changes going on in Brooklyn in the mid-fifties and giving younger readers a good idea of what it was like to grow up in that era. It is clear that Shapiro has done quite a bit of research and I think the reader really gets a good look into the personalities of the players and other characters in the story.Any fan of baseball history will do himself a favor in buying this book. It truly deserves more acclaim than it has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product..versatile","review":"This blush has a different texture than most. Its not quite a powder nor a cream.

It was and still is my all time favorite concert video. David Byrne, Tina, Chris, and Mr. Harrison are brilliant. The supporting musicians and singers? Simply awesome. From the bare stage begining of Psyco Killer, to Life During Wartime, and Crosseyed and Painless, every song is a work of musical art. This is no overly produced star fest. The music takes center stage. Jonathan Demme was supurb. I will probably never tire of watching this. A sure fire way to brighten your day. Even a non fan would probably be hooked to this! My favorite song is probably the second... Heaven Heaven is a place. A place where nothing, nothing ever happens....as the roll the set out to the stage.

You'll love the energy of David Byrne as well as the back up band. I cannot believe that David Byrne and the guitarist from the back up band were capable of moving and playing for as long as they did. I almost got exhausted watching it, however it was one of the made reason's I've watched this over and over. My favorite song is \\"Swamp\\", not as high-powered as \\"Burning Down the House\\", another personal favorite, but nonetheless a low-energy favorite (watch the lamp).

This is more than a band just playing their songs. It is a visual treat. David Byrne is an artist in multiple mediums.Main disappointment is that the BluRay doesn't bring much more to the table, although the audio is lossless DTS-HD MA. The DVD release left great perfomances (Cities, Big Business, and I Zimbra) as bonus tracks, and unfortunately with the BluRay release, this did not change. And those selections are not presented in wide-screen and have a very non-HDTV look. Why they did not make it right?But overall, a great captured performance makes up for the faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film of a great concert experience","review":"I was fortunate enough to see Talking Heads live in Australia back in January 1984 at a 3 day outdoor concert performing the whole show that is in this film.

Most interesting to me was the (perhaps unintended) sub-text about the dysfunctional management and leadership of the CIA's clandestine services--bosses from hell, unconscionable working hours and conditions (in DC, not to mention overseas), rampant brainless cowboyism, Spy versus Spy comic strip idiocy. Sidney Riley must be spinning in his grave. \\"The Company\\" had a long reputation for treating women badly and this book helps us see why 800+ female employees sued CIA for discrimination and won.

The authors spend many, many pages interweaving their personal love lives into the narrative. Personally, I was not that interested in reading how the female protagonist fell in love with her boss and left her husband (in that order). Too much writing about how the male protagonist's teeth \\"flashed in the sunlight\\" and not enough about the how's and whys of their respective trades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooriing!","review":"This book virtually doesn't have a storyline. It is rather a collection of loose narratives of spies walking or driving around cities overseas in the Cold War era. There's nothing new or of interest to historians or anyone interested in surveillance techniques. The only \\"Moscow rule\\" the authors repeat over and over is \\"one is an accident, two is coincidence, three is enemy action\\". They took it from Ian Fleming's \\"Goldfinger\\"! C'mon, is \\"Goldfinger\\" a textbook in the CIA Academy? I doubt so. A lot of ink is wasted on the author's middle age love affair no one is interested about.

My favorite scene must be the one where one of the girls reveal to the other the meaning behind the expression Deep Throat, but there are many other great scenes, like when the girls first stumble upon the white house tapes, and reveal to them a Nixon they didn't know. The ending is also superb. What's great about this movie is the overall humor that was sorely missing in \\"All the President's Men\\" and \\"Nixon\\": in this film, Woodward and Bernstein are as much objects of ridicule as Nixon and Kissinger."},{"rating":"2","title":"An educational movie.","review":"I really did not understand what Watergate was all about until I saw this movie.

The amusement died towards the end, however. The two girls start out as very innocent and sweet; as they become involved in the Watergate scandal, they \\"grow up\\" a bit and become more cynical, nasty. I know this isn't a serious film, but it just made me sad. The drug-related humor (I suppose some would find it humorous) was not amusing to me, nor was the overt exploitation of the girls' sexuality. The last few scenes were just wrong for the film.

Even though I hate teen-movies, this one had me laughing from the very start until the end of the superb extra features (on the DVD).

Michelle Williams adds some nice touches as she develops and loses a crush on the president (itself a funny twist of the movie).But some of the actors think they are funnier than they really are. Kirsten Dunst totally overplays the ditziness to irritation (I hate to say it because she has become exceptionally easy on the eyes), and other supporting actors try too hard to steal scenes.

Arlene was sort of funny though, with her \\"crush\\".

But I feel that someone who doesn't have experience with such a diverse and complicated machine would not be able to actually read this book and then immediately jump into a restoration project. Simply because this book seems thorough in its length a lot of the complications and intricacies of restoring a car are missing, probably because they wanted to condense it but I feel that this is a perfect reminder of the simple joy of restoring a car and its great for a beginner to see how its simplest form is done and then go out and seek direction from an experienced builder. Hope that wasn't too confusing. :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Natural Combination","review":"This is apparently the only album which Prysock and Basie recorded together and one wonders why the two men chose not to reunite. This is a wonderful album. Basie's great BIG band is at its most brash and magnificent and Prysock fits in perfectly; sounding almost as if he'd been singing with the band for years. So many of the recordings on this album are so good they sound pretty well definitive, especially \\"Gone Again\\", \\"I Worry 'Bout You\\" and even Ellington's great \\"Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me\\". Prysock's deep yet wide-ranging and characterful baritone is ideal for interpreting high quality standard material. If you like the Basie sound and have an appreciation for the leader's ability to back great vocalists (and Prysock was, despite his relative anonymity) with style and enthusiasm, then this album is an essential purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 10 Stars","review":"Ella! Ella! Ella! She's really SWELL-A(sorry, I do tend to get carried away at times)on this superb yuletide cd. It doesn't matter whether or not you're into jazz, or even Ella Fitzgerald, but if you want to add yet another swingin', fun, fabulous Christmas cd to your collection then this is the one. Every song sounds like a labor of love, Ella's warm, wonderful voice caresses every note while backed by Frank De Vol's orchestra. Hard to believe the album is 41 years old now, it sounds so nice & fresh today-even more so than recent holiday albums. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready to Swing Through the Holidays","review":"There truly is no better Christmas album than this 1960 recording. It puts me in the mood for Christmas even in July (and I do listen to it then). Ella has never sounded better, and this is without a doubt the swingingest Christmas album ever. The first two numbers, \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\\" set the tone for an upbeat and jazzy Christmas season. \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\" is also ample. But when one hears \\"Sleigh Ride\\" I defy anyone still to be a grinch! Throw this CD--along with \\"An Oscar Peterson Christmas\\" and the Nat King Cole Christmas album--into the player, and you're all set for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging holiday cheer","review":"This is by far the hippest, swingingest (is that a word?) holiday compilation recorded, and Ella is flawless as usual with that perfect diction. Holiday music tends to fall into two categories -- solemn or sappy -- but Ella puts her own stamp on holiday classics like \\"Jingle Bells\\" \\"Let It Snow\\" \\"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\\" and even throws in some blues for good measure (Good Morning Blues). This is perfect music for a holiday party because it's so festive. It makes you want to snap your fingers as you sing along. Heck, you might even want to cut a rug while you're at it. Bake some cookies, throw a log on the fire, add this CD to your stereo and you will have the makings of a perfect holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Yankee Pioneers of Country Music","review":"When I first walked into .......

Three bodies are recovered from a gigantic spaceship among them a beautiful female. Earthmen beware! It turns out these are predatory aliens who gave birth to stories of the original Vampires. The grand scenes of London overrun by Vampires and their zombified victims are memorable.Mathilda May playing the seductive ailen vampire went on to minor stardom in native france with a string of roles after this film.Recommended for viewing and collecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"I can't play this STUPID dvd in my player because it is NOT DESIGNED for this REGION!

The story was a little vague about how the hero was connected to the \\"vampires\\"(genetics or previous life). It explains nicely how you can have voracious vampires that infect everythink in sight and yet not have them take over the world (somthing that most other vampire stories are a little weak on).

I think its a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen","review":"This movie has the distinction of being the ONLY film that I ever walked out on when I saw it in its theatrical release. I finally decided to watch it on DVD ... figuring it couldn't be THAT bad. It's even worse, the biggest piece of junk I have seen in 50 years of watching movies. This is EASILY the worst acting that I have ever seen, combined with horrendous writing. Railsback does everything but foam at the mouth, bulging his eyes and yelling out terrible lines of dialog. I imagine that Patrick Stewart is terribly, terribly embarrassed by his performance. The rest of the cast is almost as bad, and by the end of the movie I was just laughing at the really terrible 'zombie' makeup. Someone actually got paid to write and direct this junk? Truly and completely unbelievable that a movie this bad could be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous from Start to Finish","review":"A waste of time from the Swiss-cheese plot to the pseudo philosophising.

The London scenes weren't outdone until 28 Days Later and it has a number of things going for it, not to say the least a very sexy female lead that walks around naked for a good part of the movie.The story is a bit overexplaiend and there are a number of scenes where learned men talk intulectually about the events occuring that are a massive suspence killer. This is in addition to the fact that it is rather silly and silly should not be rationalised.I found it a lot worse than I had remembered but I am still glad I had a second look. But I do not recommend it to first time viewers except maybe those how migth be heavily into Vampires and Sci-fi - then it might just be worth a late night viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Howl! Erotic sci-fi vampire extravaganza is lots of fun!","review":"Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) brings together 1) hysteria over the return of Halley's Comet, 2) an often nude 'space vampirette', and 3) near armageddon as London is decimated by life-force stealing vampires. But the highlight for *me* was seeing Patrick Stewart in his last role before taking the helm of the USS Enterprise (Star Trek: TNG, First Contact, Insurrection). When I first saw this in 1985, I had no idea who he was, but when I saw this on DVD, I had to laugh out loud! Stewart is PERFECTLY cast as the major domo at the insane asylum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip of the iceberg","review":"Shannon's review does indeed capture the surface appearance of this flick. However, bear in mind that the film is based on a book by Colin Wilson, a polymath sort of chap with serious scholarship behind his many works. In the book, the concept of energy vampirism is demonstrated in some real-life situations right here on Earth by the professorial character in the film, but it was taken to be too heady or boring for the film, I suppose; meanwhile, the concept of prana or chi and for demonic beings is common to both Vedanta and Chinese cosmologies. I would suggest willing suspension of disbelief in or to be carried along by the dark, Gothic romance of the film. In addition to Steve Railsbeck - who tore up the role of Charles Manson, by way of reference - there is a worthy supporting role by Patrick Stewart, no newcomer to sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"One little warning before you buy...","review":"If you know your Keaton, you know you're in for a treat on this one. The stunts are absolutely marvelous and astounding, this is top-notch physical comedy -- regardless of it being a silent movie from 1923.However, the soundtrack to \\"Sherlock Jr.\\" is a modern score by The Club Foot Orchestra that simply doesn't belong here. Some may perhaps like it, but myself I'm a bit conservative and prefer the original music. Occasionally there is an electric guitar, a sax, in one scene there is bluegrass, and in a chase scene there is a hint at 007...

Juliet was a Capulet and Romeo was a Montague. Romeo did many things for Juliet along the play.The couple was ready to die if they had to. Romeo was exiled because he murdered Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, so he had to go away. But the lovers weren't ready to separe.

If his is, then he is a fifth-columnist. He supported Reagan's illegal wars in Central America in the 1980s for much the same reasons he now supports Bush's wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all over the Muslim world. He does not understand Sayyd Qutb at all. Qutb did understand the US quite well. He was tortured and murdered by the CIA working through the Egyptian police. He wanted the CIA out of Egypt and he was right to think that. No one is an extremist for wanting foreign occupiers out of their country. Why Berman can't see this can only be attributed to his blind faith in the benevolence in American imperialism. Berman is just another apologist for American imperialism. No liberal or leftist would ever take that position. Berman is a right-winger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Absolutism","review":"The whole theory behind this book is flawed. I think what Berman is talking about is one small part of a whole phenomenon that has manifested itself increasingly in the last few years, namely the phenomenon of religious Absolutism(i.e. Religious Fundamentalism). It exists increasingly in all major religions, i.e. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Jewish religions. Actually the so called war against terrorism is basically a war between manifestations of that absolutism in the U.S., The Arab/Muslim world, and Israel. The major problem, that we are facing is that Islamic religious absolutism, is a great recruitment for christian, jewish, and Hindu religious absolutism, and vice versa. Good and evil, Black and White, us and them, believers and non believers, chosen and non chosen people, are the common language used to express religious absolutism. If liberals and religious pragmatists cannot change this vocabulary, than we are in for some crazy times in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left's confusion","review":"Probably the reason Paul Berman doesn't write about good \\"Third Force\\" alternatives is because there aren't any.

You were co-opted by the conservatives you so despised. What a fool!Berman's arguments for war are based on discursive \`facts' and hearsay. His arguments for a liberal regime in Iraq are also faulty. And his discussion of 'terrorism' fails to convince.Right now, you are probably very disconcerted how things have turned out (no WMD) but your rationale (\`but Sadam was a WMD.') is a weak case for a first strike.Leave this book for the political science class of 2053 as they try to make \`sense' of the Iraq War and how \`rational' people could have supported such a lark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Berman-A Neo-Con in sheep's clothing.","review":"I am not going to spend the time and effort to discredit this obvious neo-con view of the Middle East, but merely to identify it as such.

Some of the sections in the book get monotonous (trying to get excited about collecting every book published about Transformers is a tough request), and I found myself thinking \\"who cares?\\" more than once.

This was a challenging read - those who like simple sentences, one-dimensional characters and every bit of the plot foreshadowed for them won't like it. But if you enjoy characters with emotional depth trying to get through complicated situations with their love intact, and want an ending that you didn't see coming, this is a book for you. Wulf is a wonderful hero - brave, patient, tender and understanding when by rights he should be belligerent and hateful. Rowena is a strong woman trying to keep her family and people safe without knowing who she can trust, finding herself in the bewildering situation of relying on someone who should despise her.

Taking place in earlier English history,716 A.D it is not your usual historical romance. Times back then were more raw & brutal.

The backstory of the characters is vague at best for over half of the book. Because their was no insight into Rowena and Wulf's background - where their ideas and feelings are coming from - it was impossible for me to get emotionally involved with these people and their relationship.

Salem wants to write a story and she will do anything to get one. Sunny is trying to get expelled. Eddie just keeps running into trouble. Well, Pickles, he doesn't do a lot. I think this book is very much like There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom by Louis Sachar. They are very much like each other because in both books they go to the principal's office. Also, in both books there are many protagonists.I like this book in all ways. I like it because Jerry Spinelli made it sound funny and I like funny books. I think this book deserves 4 stars.

The book gives you very detailed character traits and visual traits of characters in your mind. Every character has their own unusual personality. You don't need pictures to see what's going on in this book because of the detailed descriptions of the settings and the characters' actions on every page of the book.

Hough did a pretty good job. Mabel's life, imagined and factual, was fascinating. Given her eccentricities and her rare talents, there was a lot of material here for an imaginative author. Hough takes a restrained approach while still creating for us a fascinating, difficult and empathetic character. The presentation of circus life in this novel is at the level of the high-lighted performers rather than the working stiffs as we encountered in Water for Elephants. By combining the information in both of these novels, the reader can get a good idea of the circuses of the first half of the 1900's. Just imagining the logistics of managing these huge enterprises is daunting in itself. Circuses played an important role in American life, and this novel allows us to glimpse that as well as experience Mabel Stark's life. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic and fascinating tale","review":"This was one of the strangest books I have ever read. Based on the true story of Mabel Stark, the book has some graphic scenes of bestiality that I didn't expect, but is also an interesting picture of a rebel woman. It's hard not to root for Mabel, and I learned a lot about circus life, which was also fascinating. An interesting read overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining fictional biography!","review":"The subject, the life of tiger-trainer Mabel Stark, was absolutely fascinating. I must admit that there was a rather outrageous quality, but I suppose that no circus life would be complete if the story was wholesome or toned down... Despite some questionable actions, Mabel was very likable and really, my main complaint was that the titillating secret the author teased the reader with from the beginning was not nearly as shocking as it could have been, considering some of the other things that went on! For a fictional biography, this was really wonderfully done with a carefully crafted picture of Mabel's whole life. Though the pacing was a bit uneven, and it would have been interesting to see more at the very end, the unique premise and strong writing more than made this an absorbing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Entertaining as the Circus Itself","review":"Mabel Stark, a real life circus performer, is someone I never would have known about if not for this very amusing novel. In this fictional memoir, Ms. Stark recounts her life story from a rebellious Kentucky teenager through her various marriages and through her rise to superstardom under the big top. A real gender-breaker Ms. Stark becomes the world's first and foremost tiger trainer during the era when the circus was the king of entertainment. Through the colorful narrative of her tumultuous life we also get a glimpse into the universe of the circus and all the eclectic characters (human and otherwise) that dwell in it.Author Robert Hough does a great job in keeping the action fresh and fast-paced in a writing style that is easy reading and highly entertaining.

I will say that were a therapist to become romantically involved it would probably be with a bipolar patient because their manic cycle is so exciting and exhilirating after endless lifeless burdened people.

It's neither original, exciting, or realistic. Gere tries his best to give a potentially complex character some dimension but comes out surprisingly superficial and by-the-numbers. I felt it had something going for it after Gere starts conducting a Beethoven concert (the only good scene in the whole thing), but once he got rushed off to the mental hospital and meets his doctor, I knew the film was totally lost. Once again Gere does try, but it's all very harmless stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impulsive, Irresponsible, Irrististable...","review":"A spellbinding story of a man on the verge of self destruction who is saved by love. Richard Gere gives a tremendous performance as Mr. Jones, a manic depressive who, during his highs is funny, creative and charming.

The characters in this are about as bland and uninteresting as you could possibly create. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I don't know who is responsible for the weak plot. This is nothing but a chase movie. A murder happens in the beginning, then the main character spends the rest of the movie running from bad guys and having narrow, implausible escapes. There is no gradual accumulation of information in the movie as you would normally expect in a thriller or mystery. The mystery just gets spontaneously solved in the closing minute.

Can he get anyone to trust him? His one hope is a young woman he meets on the train to Scotland but she believes him to be the murderer. With time running out Hannay must find out what the spies are up to before he is caught and imprisoned for a crime he did not committ.This is a wonderful film, much better than the first remake starring Kenneth More.

The faces of both the major and minor characters, from the cleaning woman who discovers a body in Richard Hannay's flat to the wary farmer and his pitying wife to the innocent, handcuffed blonde, are all perfect. But what makes this film soar is the impeccable use of light and shadows - on the moors, in the farmhouse, in the bedroom of the inn. \\"Vertigo\\" is Hitchcock's best psychological study; the original \\"39 Steps\\" his best action-suspense yarn. This early work by the Master is coming upon its 75th Anniversary and it holds up remarkably well - in plotline, in dialogue, in acting, but most of all in texture. It's can't-miss filmmaking at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A STEP ABOVE THE REST","review":"It's no wonder that this movie is looked upon as one of Hitchcock's finest British films. With enough tons of technical acheivements (although one must remember the time that it was made) Hitch takes his audience for the ride of there life!When Donat's character is told information about spys takeing information out of the country by a mysterious woman he doesn't expect her to be killed in his flat. Of course now he police think he is the murderer and noone will beleive his story of spies. Not even the lead woman. To make matters worse, he is eventually tied to Carrol's character who has betrayed him by turning him over to what she thought was the police.One must check this out! It really is exellent British Hitchcock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"D O N ' T B U Y !

Fans will see many similarities to later works. Most notable is the classic Hitchcock theme of the wrongfully accused hero.Hitchcock, as always, demonstrates a mastery of the visual medium; the film is rich with story telling enabled through skillful use of the camera, rather using dialog as a crutch.The DVD includes a so-so documentary that surveys his early work in British film. A running commentary is also available, that highlights many fascinating elements. Overall, the DVD translation fulfills what I would expect from Criterion--top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The 39 Steps\\" As It Should Be Seen","review":"A stylish blend of mystery, romance and light humor, \\"The 39 Steps\\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest achievements.

You're better off purchasing the Criterion release, which features a stunning 35mm print and some nice bonuses. \\"The 39 Steps\\" represents the highpoint of Hitchcock's British period and should be seen in the best possible quality.

While not the most memorable Hitchcock movie in terms of cinematography, plot, or acting, taken as a whole I think it's one of his most charming and funny movies.The young Robert Donat is fantastic as the accidental spychaser: as smooth and handsome as Cary Grant would be. Madeleine Carroll is fine, but lacks the appeal of other Hitchcock blondes. Lucie Mannheim as Annabella Smith is hilarious as the mystery woman.The themes of paranoia, suspicion, and the relentlessness of human nature are common to Hitchcock, but here they are spun together with frothy, witty dialog and some memorable, finely acted scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy DVD version - it is not Criterion, only BluRay","review":"I am a recent fan of this film and (having watched the crappy transfer they have on Amazon Instant Video) I was delighted to see a Criterion edition - particularly for the special features included.Sadly, this page is incredibly misleading.I did not purchase the BluRay because I thought I was saving a few dollars. Fool me once, shame on you.Amazon should change the listing to make it very clear that the DVD is the same crappy (shaky, bad sound) transfer they have available for streaming.

At 37 years old, a university graduate, married career etcetra I find her book a bit of a downer at times. The emphasis on how to get out from under the thumb of an abusive/domineering man, boss, parent, \\"friend\\", is a bit depressing. I think it's great for those who have been down-trodden to listen to Oprah and Rosanne and Sally Jessy Raphael and Hillary Clinton for that matter to learn truths about destructive interpersonnal relationships.

But despite the predators from outside, a woman's worst predator is that of her inner landscape, born of the suppression from outside.And that is why Estes book is of vital importance to each and every woman on this planet: through excellent writing, the use of stories and a profound insight into the feminine realm, she offers us the means and ways to understand the inner and outer restrictions on our instinctual selfs, and a map out to freedom, the key to unlock the chains that hold the Wild Woman captive.A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too academic and dry for me","review":"I had hoped for an easier read- I am college educated, and can read this sort of thing, but I thought that it would be an easier read than this.

All four turtles fit in just fine and with a little extra shoving you can even fit in April. The big problem is the front and side door falling off all the time. It doesn't bother my son at all though (since I'm the one fixing it 50 times a day), and he'll even play with it when I get tired of putting the doors back on. Its also very durable, withstands many falls and even being sat on. You can't beat it for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Schools Can't Work","review":"Everett Reimer wrote a facinating important book about why schools can't work. He speaks only briefly about the problems schools have in educating students (we all already know that), but rather talks about the societal problems inherent in having institutional schools. He speaks about how schools give children an institutional mindset akin to what criminals get in prison. Everett also speaks to the gargantuan waste of money that occurs within the school systems, at our expense. Those who like the works of John Holt and John Taylor Gatto will find much to like her as well.Please, if you can, read this book with an open mind. It will really make you reconsider how you view childhood, education, and the effects of over programming our children.Most fascinating about this book? It was published in 1971! The problems with schools aren't new, they just getting more new coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all this time ---","review":"\\"Honey\\" was an album my brother owned when were only 9 years old. That's right, when other kids were watching cartoons, or listening to the Beatles; we were listening to Andy Williams. Anyway, after all this time I came across this CD and immediately purchased it through Amazon to relive my childhood. I wasn't disappointed. Every song is an adaptation of popular songs during this time, but Andy's fresh, silk-like, soft presentation provides a new way to enjoy the song. In fact, Honey as sung by Andy was the first way I ever heard the song sung, and everyone else who I later singing it came up short. Thanks for the memories \\"Collectibles\\" and Andy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are studying 1 Peter this book is a must!","review":"As I read the new testament books of the bible and study carefully what it says and how to apply it to my life I usually turn to Warren Wiersbe for a great commentary and devotional. 1 Peter can be a bit overwhelming with all the references to submission and to suffering and rejoicing. Weirsbe's comments added clarity and devotional insight to a topic that is hard to grasp without time and repetition on the truth therein. If you are going to be using 1 Peter in group study I would highly recommend this BE HOPEFUL as a valuable resource for all.

This is a timeless recording by Return To Forever.The acoustic and electric guitar work of Al Di Meola (only 21 years of age when this classic was released) sends chills up my spine each time I hear it. Chick Corea, the consummate musician, is once again virtuous on the synthesizer, organ, and piano. The drums of Lenny White are tight, and the bass work of Stanley Clarke is immensely complex, yet very sonorous.This disc is a gem. To give it any less than a five-star rating is criminal. It's good to know music like this exists at an affordable price, especially in our world of hackneyed, superficial pop-music. With each listen of \\"No Mystery,\\" a new level of music appreciation is procured.Brilliant stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP SHELF FUSION","review":"I saw these guys in concert 5 times, so to say that I love this disc is a no-brainer. I was front row center at Carnegie Hall for what I believe was Al DiMeola's first show with the band, Billy Cobham was about 10 rows behind me. These guys helped usher me into the world of fusion and remain of my favorite fusion bands of all time. This disc is funky, jazzy, and just flat-out superb.

Although Batman only appears in a handful of panels, Slott deftly handles Batman's villains and even creates new ones that are equal parts creepy and cool. Ryan Sook's art portrayed the craziness perfectly and the book would have been totally different with a different artist. The ending of this got a little wonky but overall the book was fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Avoid this Living Hell","review":"I'm sorry folks, but I just did not like this one. Three things are wrong with this tale-- it should not have the name Arkham Asylum, because it is reminiscient of Grant Morrison's excellent Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth, next, it wasn't even a Batman story, it follows the Shark completely, and finally, it's just not entertaining. It's not that the art is bad, it's just that the story is pointless, it's about how the Shark decends into \\"madness\\" living in Arkham but it's not psychological, he actually becomes sort of a hero (he and the Humpty Dumpty style character) but then he just succumbs to the insanity. The final villians made no sense. I think you're getting the trend that the story is just as crazy and inconsistent as the characters in the story itself, which is a shame, because Arkham Asylum is a living hell.I love Batman, but don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"The movie wasn't what I expected. Nicholas Cage's performance was less than spectacular and the performance given by James Coburn wasn't up to his usual standard.

Instead, he pulls only inconsistent performances out of many in the cast (Cage is cosmically unrestrained) and proves himself a questionably talented heir. Just dreadful, and little more than a self-satisfied catalog of eccentricities, mannerisms and \\"offbeat\\" casting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man! What was Nicholas Cage thinking?","review":"This movie is not a comedy, but with Nicholas Cage giving the most hilarious performance of his life, it turns out to be quite an aisle-rolling experience. I mean, he goes from one accent to another, he's snorting coke, chewing chiklets, and best of all he takes his aggression out on innocent clotheshangers. It's a classic, believe me. I only wish more people would have seen this, like say members of the Academy before they handed him that award. It's funny, but only worth watching for Cage. James Coburn and Michael Biehn add to the hilarity somewhat, playing strongly off of Cage's \\"Hotheaded\\" Eddie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy >=o)~","review":"This is probably Nic's goofiest movie ever. Nothing is real - not his accent, not his nose, or even his hair. You would hardly recognize him! And I'd tend to think that was exactly his intention - to completely build a character out of nothing, with no ties to him as a person whatsoever.The plot is pretty cool, the movie has a weird edge to it. So if you like alternative types of movies this one is definitely worth seeing.

It was.This reader seems to read some odd-sized flash card, but you can't determine that fact from its user manual or installation guide. The documentation is completely silent on how to use the device, or what type of flash card it's supposed to read.What is certain is that no matter which way you try to insert a standard digital camera flash card (as in my Fuji MX-600), it either won't fit in the slot, or the card makes no apparent connection with this reader. And because the manual doesn't tell you how to insert flash cards, it dawns on you slowly that nothing works. xyzzy = nothing happens.So if you have standard flash cards, don't buy this device.

Unfortunately, it is a step in the wrong direction for Ms. Jackson. STCML fails in many areas, mainly its inane lyrics over a poorly produced sample of America's \\"Ventura Highway\\". Can't people write good songs anymore, without ruining classics by sampling them? This has to be one of the most pointless songs ever, with the most childish lyrics I have ever heard from Ms. Jackson. Then there's the So So Def remix, as if the world needed another remix from Jermaine Dupri. Overall one of the more weaker songs from her equally disapointing 2001 album ALL FOR YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song","review":"Going back to the song Ventura Highway, Janet's release off her All For You Album is simply wonderful.

The primary narrator, Addy, is flawed and perhaps on shaky emotional ground, but she is still on a quest to find some peace in her life after a difficult childhood with inattentive and quarrelsome parents. The debate, however, is whether her quest is one that is too selfish in nature to be taken as a hero(ine)'s journey. Regardless, several of the characters do emotionally travel to a new place as a result of her choice to attend her former nanny's funeral. All the Finest Girls is not apt to rely on staid stereotypes and the author gives enough information to absorb the reader without dictating the interpretation too heavy-handedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't ever be re-reading this one","review":"This book gets a C at best.

A Templar doctor and his scribe are caught up in events and try to solve the mystery that lies at the heart of the monastery only to find that they are locked in a battle in which they must decide between knowledge at all costs or the Higher Wisdom that is beyond it.This book also connects with Koulias's other books THE SEAL, THE SIXTH KEY and FiFTH GOSPEL - all recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Candy Fans","review":"John Candy is great in this and doesn't need to go below the belt to get a laugh.

I don't want to dog this product but buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read this book more carefully!","review":"The two people who reviewed this book before me probably did not read it carefully. Chodorow in fact quotes hundreds of researches and conclusions made by other psychoanalysts and herself. She states her own opinions about the issues she discusses, of course, but also other critics'. In the notes to the chapters she indicates several further readings to illustrate her points or other theories. This book is very educational and opens the readers' eyes to many crucial aspects of mothering, both for parents and children's sake. I recommend all her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic in Feminist Theory","review":"A true classic in feminist theory, and an example of the best scholarship.

Zilch. Nada. No in-depth interviews, no participant observation, no historical analysis, no surveys, -- just one woman's musings.She of course may be right in the end, but without ANY research to backup her claims -- it is just a rant.This book definitely made me think about raising kids and what I wanted in a spouse, and definitely makes a strong case for equal parenting. But in my opinion, good scholarship is a marriage between data and theory; a synthesis of research and imagination. Without both, a scholarly book falls flat. Chodorow did no research, has no data, and thus this book ends up being speculation at best, flat-out myth-making at worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Illustartions! Love Jan Brett!","review":"This is such a great book! My daughter checked it out from the library and after seeing it, I just had to have it! One, you can not beat Jan Brett's Illustrations. She is a master of creating beautiful art from a story and also creating a side story along the page edges. Two, who doesn't love the Twelve Days of Christmas! We also own another version of the twelve days of christmas called Christmas Song of the North by Marsha Bonicatto. It's a great story with lovely water color illustrations by another artist. This used copy was in fairly good condtion. Only the jacket had some minor tears and dirt. the book itself was undamaged. Great book, totally recommend adding it to your Christmas reading collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I hope David Sedaris would be appalled to have his writing likened to this woman's drivel. I didn't so much laugh out loud with every turn of the page as I did cringe in embarassment for pretty much everyone involved in the publishing of this book. There are typos and grammatical errors spotted throughout. Her \\"witty\\" recounting of an unremarkable upbringing (in which the most awkward phase Gilman goes through appears to be when she sprouts enormous breasts) sounds painfully contrived, and at times just plain made up! Why did I read it? Because a female friend recommended it, and because none of the reviews out there had a negative word to say about this horse crap. Well, here's the negative word. Now all the truly witty, sarcastic, intelligent feminists out there can consider themselves warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"I tried so hard to LIKE this book but I just couldn't.

She reflects on her own experiences - so real to the thirty/fourty-something woman today. Not only are her stories funny and entertaining, but they provide insight into our generation of being a woman in the workplace, finding self-esteem in adolescence, figuring out who we are, and finding the truth of what we really believe. And, the theme is \\"it's okay not to be perfect and laugh at yourself\\" which is a refreshing approach many authors forget now-a-days.

Susan's stories about a hippy childhood, a Mick Jagger obsessed adolescence, and a journalistic adulthood are alternately hilarious, memorable and even moving. A gifted storyteller makes you feel as if you know the author and Susan Jane Gilman truly has that gift. Susan's colorful life makes for a wonderful story and I can't wait for the next chapter.

It follows the author from her hippy childhood on the Upper West Side in the \`70s to early adulthood.

It was given to me by a friend as comic relief because I was reading too many serious books (I never read memoirs). I laughed so hard and so much that my cheeks hurt.

At times hilarious and at others so close to home that I feel the embarassment of being the \\"different\\" kid in school all over again, she hits the mark.

No, the traps are not very good at catching them. I have tried these, and many similar brands, all with the same problem. Here's what you do: Buy the pest trap. Take out the pheromone wafer and throw away the rest. Buy a fly paper ribbon (maybe fifty cents) and hang it up. Stick the two pheromone wafers on the fly ribbon, about a foot apart. This will catch meal moths for weeks, and will stay sticky even with dozens of moths on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer works with new bait enclosed","review":"The trap worked well when it came with a square bait package that was fit into the back slot.

If you trap a moth in there yourself, it doesnt stick to the glue, and flies right back out.I have made this known to the Safer mfg. co. as soon as they changed the bait but they have done nothing.We have wasted about $100 on these traps in the past year.

Within seconds of having torn open the little pheromone packet I was swarmed by male moths. You just need patience. The life cycle of the pantry moth takes time. There may be eggs that haven't hatched yet, and larvae that haven't metamorphosed yet still hanging about. You have to leave the trap out (and according to the directions) for a good long while to catch all the moths. The traps say they are good for 3 months...well you should leave them out that long to make sure you get them all.

The traps come already assembled and the adhesive is already exposed. Set these up in the kitchen and pantry and came back and saw the moths left brown tracks on the adhesive but managed to escape because who knows how long the trap has been sitting in the shelf. There is no protective cover on the adhesive to peel off like other moth traps on the market and so the adhesive is not very effective in adhering to the moths.

The most recent order was through Amazon, and the traps have proved to be mildly effective in attracting the moths. This is possibily due to the age of the traps. The little pheremone insert might be waning in its effectiveness over time. So, I think it is important that the traps be fresh, not from long stored supplies.I was dissatisfied with these traps, as very few moths have been trapped, compared to MANY in the past.

You also must put their \\" lure \\" on this sticky area so unlike other brands that come with the chemical already in the sticky part you can not cut the trap into a few smaller traps and put into a few places. I found Pro-Pest brand better because all the inside surface is coated and treated and because of that has twice the moth catching and holding capacity.

He didn't get loose the second time. There's an allegorical tale for all us males right there.As has been mentioned in other reviews, these only trap the male moths. That cuts down on the reproduction rate but you still have to kill the females by hand. The traps might work better if the manufacturer had put a larger patch of the sticky stuff on the inside and the price is a little high but when used in conjunction with proper storage techniques, the traps will help you keep grain moths under control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work at All!","review":"I bought the Safer traps and Contech traps at the same time.

We had a massive number of moths appear almost overnight and our house was full, they were everywhere. A white ceiling looked dark there were so many. I set these traps out and in four days I caught one (1) single moth. I do believe it was an accident on his part taking a wrong turn and getting stuck inside. I would not try them again having checked locally finding them 30% cheaper before shipping. So look at your local hardware stores but not for these I wouldn't hit a dog in the back side with these.

I had loads of moths and I had used another brand, which worked very well, but that brand was no longer available. Then I bought this brand and it didn't catch one moth. I used one trap with one square of pheromone. I followed the directions completely. In other words, I don't think the problem was me. I have to wonder whether these sat on the store shelf too long. Anyway I took them back to the store and got my money back.It might be hard to return these if they catch one of a hundred moths and are therefore used and slightly successful. Fortunately for me they did nothing.I now have another infestation and need to do something about it, but I don't know what I'll do as I need a product that is 100% successful, else the remaining moths will replicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glue doesn't hold","review":"I purchased these at a local hardware store. The lure works, but the glue doesn't hold the moths.1) Upon opening the box, I discovered the traps are already pre-folded for use. The glue is exposed to the air with no plastic protective covering. This is different from every other trap I've used. All 3 boxes were like this, so it appears to be the norm for this brand.2) There are two lures included and they are packaged individually. That's great if you don't want to use both traps at once. Most brands package them together.I noticed that approximately 15 moths were flying around the trap within the first 5 minutes. They were clearly very attracted to the lure. But, two days later, only 1 moth was caught. The glue sides were covered in moth dust, which I assume is from the glue escapees.It wasn't a total waste. I used the lures in separate bottle type trap, which worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of money","review":"Literally does nothing but take up space.

Within seconds of opening the pouch the moths were swarming. The sticky inside the trap is 100% garbage! Not a single moth got stuck. I watched them get their wings and feet 'stuck' only to easily free themselves again. The sticky is covered in dusty wing prints, but there are none actually stuck. This product gets a 2 only because the attractant made it easier to squish all the moths."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PANTRY PEST TRAP (Safer)","review":"Like of nowhere, we suddenly had two or three moths in our pantry every morning.

Surprisingly, moths kept flying or resting under the shelves and not a single one was attracted to the lure. They totally ignored the traps and not a single one got caught. In my opinion a very bad investment at over $6 for two useless traps."},{"rating":"1","title":"no longer a good trap","review":"These have caught hundreds of moths in the past. But the last ones are NO GOOD! I have traps set out and the moths are flying around me! These no longer work. Don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"Amazon should be ashamed of selling this and there are probably a whole bunch of people in China laughing at the people who buy this product. We bought these as a replacement for older moth traps that actually worked and I can't believe the difference. The attracter square is tiny and doesn't attach anywhere while the on-the-trap folding instructions tell you to put it in a non-existing place (I have an idea where they should put their traps), and the sticky trap material is again, virtually non-existent. Total crap. Buy these to send to someone you hate who has moths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"These traps have caught nothing but dust. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing problems with meal moths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't immediately effective, but one day...wow!","review":"In April, at the height of our moth activity, I bought a box of these traps and placed one, per the instructions, underneath the cupboard. Three days later, all I'd found inside was a gray smudge where a moth apparently managed to free itself from the glue. I was frustrated and posted a 1-star review.Just over a month later I happened to look inside the trap, and I was stunned. Both sticky surfaces are now covered with moths and even a few flies. I haven't touched the trap, and I'm not sure what happened, but I've completely revised my opinion. You may now consider me very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw or Launch Failure?","review":"I must preface my review with the point that I'm not sure if these were out of date; I do not have the best of faith in the seller from whom I bought them. If they were not extremely old, however, I would say they are not very powerful or effective. When I have purchased other moth traps (I have tried four different brands) the pheromone pads always have a distinct odor immediately upon opening the packet of the most effective ones. These exuded no smell whatsoever. Also, the better ones begin catching moths immediately. A moth circled the vicinity of this trap for a good hour without feeling enticed enough to go inside. The next day, not one moth is in the trap. Finally, the sticky surface inside the trap is not the stickiest I've seen and does not cover the entire inside of the trap. Definitely would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"Please don't buy this product because it does not work.

There was no background on any of the characters and you found yourself wanting to know more about the characters. The acting is really sub par in true bmovie fashion. What really sank this movie is the absolutly atrocious dialogue and the fact that the Russian mob are just a bunch of pushover whiners. It is not believable at all that a \\"taxman\\" could have accomplished this anyway. The movie is laughable in some parts and incredibly boring for the rest. I'd skip this dreadful movie. I definately had to look at Joe Pantoliano in a much lower light from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing movie","review":"Joe Pantoliano blew me away - I'd bet the bank on this guy! The movie is about a simple tax collector who, through the course of tracking a tax skimming operation involving the oil industry, proves the depth of the simple, honest yet somewhat (if not often) deranged man. I stopped everything that I was doing when this movie was on the toob and I was transfixed. Wade Dominguez is brillaint as his stuttering NYPD sidekick.

It is a good book with 101 stories of Courage, Hope, and Laughter. I thought it was a fun and exciting book to read.

Besides being boring, my heart rate never really got moving. After I was finished, I felt like it was a waste of my time, like I didn't burn any calories at all. I should have gone for a run. The dancers were not very good, and kept making mistakes. The camera kept moving around, and you'd get shots of the dancers faces only...not helpful when trying to learn new choreography. What a waste of money...don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I went to the store looking for a dance/cardio workout, because I get tired of the same ole routine. I read the back of this DVD and it sounded really interesting. Well, I started the DVD and I was very excited for the first 15 minutes. I was keeping the beat and really having fun. After that, it started moving really fast, without enough time for the \\"dancer\\" to learn the steps. I had to reverse and play the steps several times before I thought I had it.My other critique is that the cameraman did not show all the dancers. He had a tendency to just focus in on some of the girl's faces, while Gloria was showing the steps. Before I knew it, the \\"dancer\\" was supposed to be completing the steps, without any instruction.Overall, the first part was fun, but I ended up disappointed with the second part."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok,nothing special","review":"He is a good trumpet player. but this CD didn't do anything for me.

It is an odyssey which portrays an actual voyage, bringing to life the majesty of the ocean and the exotic places that such an endeavor touches.I found it to be a well filmed adventure which effortlessly flowed from scene to scene. The background music, narration, and animated maps/charts were exceptionally well done. The sailing scenes and the places visited were quite interesting.I have now viewed it several times and each time has been a treat which left me wanting to follow in their wake. This is a DVD that is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home movie for sale","review":"This certainly wasn't what I expected. The film was useful in stimulating ideas of places to visit but it was not a movie and not at all engrossing. This is horribly produced. There is a narrator who in a near monotone voice flatly describes what was seen and who did what. This is effectively someone's home movie that they managed to get people to pay for.

I am buying a copy of this to add to my collection as soon as I get back home. A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe early 70's","review":"This appeared to me to be a very dated DVD about a family that went around the world. There is very little information about the sailing, just about the places they visited.

If you want to know about their sailing experiences, successes or problems with the boat, etc... look else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming, more for those with families than Cruising Has no Limits","review":"I liked the music, the family atmosphere, the fact that these folks really enjoyed their voyaging (and sailing).

That one took me to places I dream of seeing some day. Glad I bought both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD, well worth the cost.","review":"I found this dvd very interesting and well filmed.

This was pretty dissapointing. With a copyright date of 2006 I was expecting a fairly modern sailing video, what I got was video taken sometime in the 70's!

We use potions, creams, and masks on our faces to keep complexions glowing but often neglect our hair save for a quick shampoo and blow dry. Then, all of a sudden, we look in a mirror and realize these tresses need a treatment!Let's face it, blow drying, hot rollers, curling irons, coloring, the sun all take their toll on even the healthiest of heads.Hair Mask with Shea Butter is both a treat and a treatment for dry, lifeless, lusterless hair. Shea Butter is, of course, the key ingredient, working its magic to restore lackadaisical locks.It's simple - work a palm size dollop through damp hair and leave on for up to 20 minutes. Then shampoo and rinse hair well. I'd also recommend using Fekkai's Apple Cider Clearing Rinse.The results are immediate - what a difference you'll see and feel.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Awful is just the right word to describe this product. Since I started using this mask my hair has been drier and drier each day and brittle and even hard to the touch. Would never buy this again. I cant even comb my hair after using this product!! Ive never used a product as bad as this one. I only kept using it to see if the changes were gonna happen for better, but it only got worse. Don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing quality for the price","review":"Recently, I tried a few of Fekkai's products. Although I think most of them are great, this one was at the very bottom of my list. I gave it two stars just because I LOVE the smell. I received it as a sample and followed the instructions. First, this is not a deep conditioner, is just a mask so don't expect your hair to detangle and get that \\"slip\\" effect your accustomed to. It just sticks to your hair. After I rinsed, it did not feel clean (I wanted so bad to shampoo it again) but left it on because I wasn't going anywhere(I can spare a bad hair day in my house).N-e-ways, after I let it air dry, my hair felt kinda dry and stringy but the weirdest thing happend later during the day, it got glossy (shiny) and pretty. I'll probably try it again (I still have one sample left but for the price, I wouldn't buy it. I don't think the value makes up for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair treatment but too greasy","review":"This product delivers its promise to restore dry hair.

It feels like glue in your hair. I can't comb it and it feels raw and brittle. I can't believe this is Fekkai!! I would not buy this product.

Dever views God's promises to Israel in light of a covenantal structure rather than a dispensational one. The Old Covenant completely fulfilled in Christ, must now be viewed through His fulfillment and establishment of the New.The previous poster's claims of a 7 year tribulation and millenial kingdom etc. are not to be found in Dever's book because Dever simply has a different theological lens and eschatological viewpoint than that offered by Dispensationalism.This should not cause a loss of rating, for it is not the substance of the book, rather, the book should be judged on its faithfulness to the Scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but Effective","review":"This book is large in page count but very thorough.

Anyways, Vol. 5 has two additional videos not listed on the back (one by Plank Eye and one by Joy Electric). Vol. 5 is better than Vol. 4 in that they cut down on the behind-the-scenes stuff. All the videos are good. My favorite ones in particular are \\"Chase The Sun\\" (The Supertones), \\"Rock And Roll Star\\" (Fanmail), \\"Goodbye\\" (Plank Eye), and \\"Children Of The Lord\\" (Joy Electric). \\"Children Of The Lord\\" has to be the most visually creative of the whole bunch.

Far harder/sharper than prior albums, (which are kind of dreamy, like Tristeza or Mercury Program), this one sounds more like a live show. Mesmerizing guitar work. Still some mellow stuff. And extra credit for passing on a vocalist, so many bands are ruined by bad vocals they would sound better without. The opening track is awesome. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly derivative post-rock lacking musical depth and emotion","review":"This is elevator post-rock. Think of Mogwai with all the suspense taken out. It's just not fun and it never goes anywhere...just the same formula again and again: start with a guitar or synth riff, add in some drums/bass, crescendo, sudden stop or slow fade. I can't remember one song off this album. It seems like there is no \\"soul\\" in the music, like it is being made by a computer.I disagree with the above review, this music is not for intellectuals. Anyone who likes interesting rock music will be completely bored by this. They fail to create much musical tension, and then when they do manage a cool riff or section, it never...goes...anywhere. Sounds like a glorified jam session that was written 10 minutes before they recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept wondering....","review":"What was the point of this film? In my opinion, it may get some play because of the nudity, but I'm sure that wasn't the point. The realities of class distinction, the flawed mixing of religion and politics, and grinding poverty are addressed, but weakly. I wasn't able to lose myself in this film.

Many of the sets look fake.- Some of the fighting scenes are good. Some are bad because of poor editing and filming.- The fighting scenes are non stop from the beginning of this film to the end. There's no time for character development. For example, the 2 brothers fought against each other in many scenes. Each time, one of the brother had a chance to kill the other brother but he stopped it when seeing a big scar on that guy's neck. Then the director did not give the characters time to investigate the scar further. He just showed the two fighting again and again in the following scenes. And then the same guy stopped the fighting when he saw the same scar again. It's so silly that it's boring.- In short, it's a waste of money.

Thank you Cynthia Stewart-Copier for writing such a helpful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging Yet Realistic Advice","review":"This book spoke directly to me, a person finishing her dissertation who saw the potential for publishing but didn't know how to get started. The author works for a publishing company and once wrote a dissertation, so his advice is trustworthy. I also felt that the ideas he shared were practical and doable. Having read this book gave me a clear sense of direction as I began my own book manuscript, and I kept the author's advice clearly in mind as I wrote. One downside: The book is wordy and leans toward a scholarly tone. While it isn't exactly an enjoyable read, it is high interest if the reader is thinking about publishing all or parts of her dissertation, and certainly those of us who have written dissertations can get through scholarly text! I recommend this book. It is one of a kind on the market right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, but Repetitive and Long-Winded","review":"This book is short and a quick read, but even at that it's a real waste of time. The author repeats himself over and over again throughout the book. And what he's repeating was barely worth saying once - double space, think about the title, you have to revise your dissertation and don't just send it to a publisher as is. As a matter of fact, that's pretty much all the book has to say. If you want a more serious book that will actually help you understand how editors think, get Rabiner's Thinking Like Your Editor. It's not specifically for the academic book market, but it's both more informative and a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicking into gear","review":"Trying to organize my thoughts and goals after finishing my dissertation has been a long, slow process. This book outlines some of the typical pitfalls, identifies a step-by-step process and has set up some guidelines I need to move ahead. Good luck to anyone trying for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"As others have pointed, for such a short book, it made me incredibly impatient because practically half the book was full of advice a person who has written a dissertation knows already. I found little of value till page 70, where the author mentions a suggested timeline for various types of revisions. It's a cheap book and a quick read, but don't expect much. Incredibly, for a book on writing, the writing is nothing to write home about. Strewn with slightly awkward attempts at humor, which add little of value and betray a largely indecisive \\"voice.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Music","review":"It is exciting to know that there is still decent music out there for our youths.

Most of the info in the book you already know or can learn from a myriad of other books or sources. It promises to show you how to become an internet pornographer yet tells you little or nothing about how to set up a website, find hosting, payment options or any of the other nuts and bolts needed to be succesful. The info on where to find models is no mystery, just common sense. What to pay models was a bit interesting but the advice to pay by check is accounting 101.

I expected it to be newsreel footage from the war years together with hopefully an informed linking commentary.The films included are almost all Government instructional or promotional films hoping to persuade the public to buy war bonds etc. Laudable as their purpose might have been, when originally produced - they tell us almost nothing about the War on the Homefront.Buy a book instead - that's what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wraith Squadron Rocks!","review":"The characters are all extremely well developed.

Instead of following Michael Stackpole's previous stories, Alston shows Wedge creating a new X-wing squadron called Wraith Squadron (hence the title) and the pilots are not picked for their flying skills, but for their inexperience in flight combat. Wedge seeks to train them into a comando unit as well as an X-wing squadron. Fans will be interested to know this story involves Warlord Zsinj who is later featured in Courtship of Princess Leia. this book is a good starting point for new readers, and a must read for fans of the original series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great videos!!","review":"Only problem I have with this tape is you only get 3 David Lee Roth era videos!! I know they did mostly live videos before that, but Oh Pretty Woman would have been a bonus. You get 13 classic VH videos. VH once said when Sammy joined they could never top Dave in the video showman ship department. So why 10 Sammy videos guys? Still worth it for any VH fan!! Also be warned, if your after the \\"Dreams\\" video with the blue Angels in it, this does not have it. The version is the live version they released in the early 90s, live at the Wisky:( Hot For Teacher is my all time favorite video and it does have that!!

However my favorite video is \\"Dreams\\" with the Blue Angels and this is not on this DVD, there is a live coverage of them in downtown L.A with news coverage of the riot. It's not all bad just disappointed. So if you are looking for the same video I am this is not it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs the Roth Era!!!!!!","review":"Even though the 78-84 era has few videos, there were a lot of mainstays on MTV: (Oh)Pretty Woman, Dance the Night Away, Unchained, and Hear About it Later. There have also been promo videos from 1978 for Jamie's Cryin', Running with the Devil, and You Really Got Me. There are also tons of live footage of that era of VH. Hagar has been covered in Live Without a Net and Right Here Right Now, but the Roth era exists in 10th gen bootlegs or the 3 videos on the DVD. It's not a comprehensive \\"greatest hits\\", and with some creative director, a more complete \\"hits\\" (and fix the sound!) could be released, doing it justice. Add the MTV \\"Lost Weekend\\", the US Festival portions, some commentary, and some eggs, it would be an awesome package. If you're a Hagar fan, give it 4 stars.

In the case of the early Roth videos, the clips were so primitive (I think the three clips from their first album were all filmed the same day, just like AC/DC did for their \\"Back In Black\\" video and Def Leppard did for their \\"High N' Dry\\" clips) that it doesn't really matter if you have them on DVD or not...go find them on YouTube and watch them in all the clarity you need. But the later clips with Hagar were high-production affairs that got regular MTV airplay and should definitely be here. Like KISS, this band clearly needs to release a proper comprehensive music video collection in the DVD era.Videos not included:Runnin' with the DevilJamie's Cryin'You Really Got MeLoss Of Control(Oh) Pretty WomanDreams (Blue Angels version)Feels So GoodTop of the WorldAmsterdamFire in the Hole"},{"rating":"2","title":"No real surprises","review":"I agree with all statements made in prior reviews, except the one about the edited videos. The videos were not edited for this DVD -- they are shown exactly as they were played on MTV. Unfortunately, MTV and record execs force many bands to shorten their songs for both radio and video airplay in order to allow more time for other songs and, of course, commercials. That being said, this is a good collection of videos for any Van Halen fan. I was somewhat surprised that ALL of the VH videos were not included in the collection, however, which explains why I am not giving it 5 stars. Notably absent were the videos for \\"Feels So Good,\\" \\"Top of the World,\\" \\"Amsterdam,\\" and \\"Fire in the Hole.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my dreams come true","review":"Well, I'll be honest, I was looking for an opportunity to buy the MTV video, \\"DREAMS\\" with THE BLUE ANGELS footage. Oh my goodness, it's the best video ever made, this DVD however contains a live jam of the band at some venue instead. What a major dissapointment. I would have the price I did for ONLY the DREAMS - BLUE ANGELS VIDEO \\"ALONE\\". But instead I get this.No this would have warranted a \\"1\\" rating, but the Right Now vid, bumps it up 1/2 point and the collection of the rest up another 1/2 point. Heck even the Humans Being vid cuts out all the Twister footage the original video contained.So I'll stick with the rating of \\"2\\" and shake my head in utter discust at the idiot that put this package together without including THE BLUE ANGELS video footage, what is your problem anyway?I'll now have to wait until some brilliant entrepreneur at MTV top put some 80's video package together that will include this AMAZING video of multi-angle plane mounted camera footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Hards Only","review":"If I could have previewed this DVD before I purchased it.

She takes off with the baby she named Maureen and her son Virgil (she shot Virgil's daddy dead) and flees to Goons.

She has a trail of bodies to prove it. She has a special room--the Upper Room---where Maureen stays. Only she, Mama Ruby, and Virgil are allowed up there.

The style of writing I found to be truly strange and it just wasn't an enjoyable piece. It started to get somewhat good towards the end, but it was too late for me.

Mamma Ruby was so funny, the way she talked, and even the parts when she killed people and threw them in the swamps was funny. This book made me laugh so much. But I hated how maureen wasn't allowed to leave and live her own life. I also hated the part when her childhood friend raped her. Some parts of me wished that she would have told mamma ruby. It also broke my heart when one of Maureens twin daughters drowned. I think Maureen did what was best for her and her daughter when she moved and got a job.

From the first time I heard the name flashlight brown mentioned at a treble charger concert, i've been hooked. This album is great, comparable to their previoius cds, but this time its on a major label. There songs are melodic, with catchy lyrics about outsiders looking on the inside.. My personal favs are \\"Loose the Shades\\" and \\"Praise the Day\\" For $, you can't loose"},{"rating":"2","title":"shoop shoop...","review":"Alright, I've been waiting for this album to come out! I got it the day that i came out and i really like it. If you like bands like Simple PLan, Sum 41 and Good Charlotte, you'll like Flashlight Brown. ITs not totally punkie or emo at that. It kinda reminds me of old school Blink with a twist of today's bands. My favorite song at the moment by Flashlight Brown... A FREAK... love the intro... its not expensive,... and its enhanced, so you can't go wrong...buys yourself a copy today, and one for your best bud, Uncle Joe, Nana, and the dog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This band rules!!!","review":"I loved this album. Flashlight Brown rocks!!! Canadian punk guys do it again. This album is a breath of fresh air. If you are a fan of Sum 41 or Blink 182, you will definitely like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Flashlight Brown has grown as a band in the years they have been together. This is evident in their new renditions of the songs \\"Lose the Shades,\\" and \\"Butterball.\\" I thought the old versions were good, but let me tell you, these are even better. Other favourites of the disk are \\"Go and Die\\" (a song with a catchy beat and awesomly fun lyrics, as with all the songs), \\"Praise the Day,\\" \\"Today,\\" (this is probably one of the best on the CD), and the fantastic intro to the CD, \\"Ready to Roll.\\" Anyone who enjoys a punk band, but is ready for some different sounds, and a unique sound to each song should Definantly get this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This CD is a grreat disk! Being a couple year long fan of Flashlight Brown, listening to the downloads from the site (never able to find a CD!), one can hear the changes that the band itself has gone through. Their new rendition of 'Lose the Shades' is a work of genius, and the same goes for 'Butterball.' New songs, including 'Praise the Day,' 'Go and Die,' and 'I'll Only Make You Cry' (my favourites) are amazing songs. Anyone who loves upbeat, good punkish rock should definantly get this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is the best!","review":"The new cd from flashlight brown is awesome! it has great music, its funny as anything, and its short, sweet, and to the point. The first time I listened to it i fell in love w/ it...especially numbers 3,4,11......hell! i love them all. so i recomend this cd if you are a fan of punk music and band members that are down to earth.

This recording, and Botti's subsequent recordings, rise to the top of any stack. Here is a musician who goes to the heart of everything and knows far more about our lives than can be spoken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drums are annoying","review":"I love Chris Botti -- have lots of his cds.

The trumpet playing is faultless (there's only one track with vocals), but I now regret buying this album as I really can't abide the bang, bang, bang, bang which overwhelms the trumpet and the melody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gypsy Queens","review":"This is an excellent overview of female gypgy singers today. The recordings are of high quality and the selection of songs and performers is great.

This is a lucid, intelligent adaptation of Catherine Marshall's masterpiece, \\"Christy.\\" Archer makes the content easier, but she never compromises the beautiful original book. I have read all twelve volumes of Archer's Christy series and each book is terrific.

Illustrations clear and gave additional instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the Traditional Healers?","review":"This book title is misleading because it does not reveal any practices of the Yoruba Traditional Healers.

I first heard of Sadao in '85 and have been tracking down his stuff ever since. This is an excellent example of his style and is a great listen when you get tired of the smooth jazz typically played on the radio. The vocals are pleasing and non intrusive, which is VERY important for the transition from piece to piece. A gift that will be completely enjoyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The bigger picture","review":"Probably the most useful aspect of this book is that it provides a way of looking at Bush's campaign messages from a communications viewpoint, free of the chaff that distracts. The author's insights into Bush's mindset are quite valid, and they are disturbing. I read the older hardcover version (there is an updated paperback edition), which turned out to be an advantage, because many of the events we are seeing now are being handled by the Bush administration in exactly the way one would expect if the book's insights are valid. It appears they are. The author's opinions on television are especially interesting, and the book is worth the read. The author has a philosophical stance that is readily evident, but with a few exceptions, it does not blind him because he uses Bush's own words and history to bolster his arguments. It is a serious work, not humor based on Bush's notorious inability to speak English, although howlers are inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shortcut to thinking","review":"As an English professor I am always entertained by malapropisms and mixed metaphors. I enjoy the language and all of its misuses. However, I did not find this book at all entertaining, but rather, bitter, small-minded and for lack of a better word, bitchy. As I tell my students, thoughtful criticism is an art, but bias is a shortcut to thinking. From my examination, bias is all this book comprises. Anyone can tear down; anyone can sneer because they don't approve of a political party, or for that matter, race, religion, orientation, or \\"dyslexia\\". There is nothing insightful or clever here. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Book","review":"As a true believer in the 1st Amendment and personal liberty I cannot take too much issue with Mark Miller's interpretations of GWB's speaking style and grammatical gaffes.What I find truly scary is the ease with which the self-proclaimed intellectuals of the world have led themselves to believe that a perjuring sex-addicted sociopath who thinks he is far superior to his admirers is somehow a more positive influence on the country than someone with a Harvard Business School degree who has solid common sense values and is not the least bit interested in the liberal academic establishment's opinions.Don't waste your money on this one unless you see yourself described above."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Book-Too many lackluster \\"Bushisms\\"","review":"The beginning and end of this book is pretty good, when he is not explaining Bush's quotes. It gets boring in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"I trully enjoyed previous works by Miller, especially BOXED IN: THE CULTURE OF TV But his latesr THE BUSH DYSLEXICON can be, at best, described as a disorganized and illogical smearing of a politician Miller does not approve of. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's right--but he fights a little dirty","review":"I read this book in a couple of sittings and lost some sleep for that reason. It is thoroughly researched and written. Miller makes a compelling case that George W. Bush is semi-literate, ill-prepared for the office, lazy, and more than a little mean-spirited. His thesis that TV & the media are largely responsible for the decline of the American politic is also convincing. I think, however, this would be a better book if Miller wasn't so transparently hostile to Bush and conservatives. Granted, Pres. Bush is the easiest of rhetorical targets, but I think Miller takes some cheap shots and stretches unnecessarily in his analysis of Bush's language. As a result, it will be a little too easy for moderates and conservatives to dismiss this author. But, Miller is to be commended for going beyond the usual catalog of \\"Bushisms\\" to an attempt to understand what Bush's famed inability to articulate reveals about the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for Anyone Who Steps Into the Voting Booth","review":"The nuclear (or in the case of George W Bush \\"nu-kew-lar\\" )football that can launch an cataclysmic end of our planet is within a 3-second determination. Bush's lack of knowledge and his pride of former, should give pause to anyone who'd like to see their grandchildren in this lifetime.When you superimpose what the author so eloquently writes with what W is capble of doing, and has already done to the repution of the US, it is truly sobering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to watch closely","review":"Although I got ripped off because I bought this book in an airport instead of Amazon.com, I consider it a good purchase nonetheless. It has been 9 months since 9/11, and it is high time to start looking closely at the Bush Admin. again (or for the first time for those of you who haven't yet started!). The old axiom since JFK beat Nixon 42 years ago was that you have to look attractive and speak smoothly to be elected president in the age of television. If that wasn't bad enough, the situation has changed alarmingly for the worse, as exemplified by Pres. Bush. Perhaps reading Miller's book will help us understand and avoid making even dumber choices for president in the future. We must celebrate intelligence and intellectual curiosity or we are doomed as a nation for the progressive future."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the more important now.","review":"After Sept 11, this book, its ideas and its compilation of Bush's malapropisms, mean-spirited attempts at jokes, and simple illiterate utterances becomes an increasingly important read. It is sobering to realize that man as unprepared and emotionally immature as George Bush has to deal with one of the world's gravest crises.Miller is a bit pedantic and long winded in the long first part. So what? He has many important things to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Bush-Haters should bother","review":"This shrill screed will only appeal to the virulent Left-Wing haters who have come to the fore since the Clinton Impeachment. Another part of their attempts at revenge on the GOP for daring to hold Clinton accountable for his actions, Mr. Miller's book is another weak attempt to argue Bush is shallow and without the capacity for the Presidency. While his Yale BA and Harvard MBA belie the attempts of such professional navel-gazers to denigrate his abilities and education, their vocal, yet myopic world-view plays into his hands. Perhaps they should re-read Hamlet's mad scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you time.","review":"It does make one cringe on occasion to hear about President Bush's malaproprisms. This book offers little constructive or insightful beyond the obvious. Our President is not a gifted speaker, true, but we will get used to it (we got used to President Clinton's lying), even if it causes us to suffer embarassment from time to time. This book provides small arms ammunition for the anti-Bush crowd, and little more of true substance. The fact is, Bush won, Gore failed to steal the election. Walk it off, and don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exposition of Personal Hatred","review":"When I saw this book on the shelf and scanned a few pages, it appeared to be a likable collection of our chief executive's disabilities with the English language. But it doesn't take one long to realize that it is in truth a vicious, vitriolic spewing of the deepest kind of personal hatred of the author toward the Bush family. To have simply documented Bush's gaffes would have been sufficient, but the author insists upon coloring every quotation with inflammatory rhetoric, specifically designed to hurt and offend. If our laws of slander do not cover this kind of pointless animosity, then they fall short of their purpose. If you must read this book, then borrow it or check it out from your library; we do not need to encourage this brand of viciousness by purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing for all the right reasons.","review":"This book is light fare. But, to reject it entirely for focusing on such a narrow topic is unfair. The truth is, these little morsels of strewn thought from Bush, are all that most of us have to judge him on. He has virtually no political background to access primarily because he has no background. To tell me that the man is not who appears, that he's smarter than this, more experienced than this...I'll need to see proof of that to be convinced.As for now we'll have to settle for the suspiciously thin resume of a man and his WORDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dyslexia Has Nothing to do with Stupidity","review":"and it's a shame people styling themselves as liberal and intelligent are capitalizing on such an ignorant assumption. Bush's malapropisms have all made us shake our heads from time to time - but I've learned that what a leader does is at least as important as what he says, and how he says it. Apparently, the majority of Americans agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiney, Better A Pamphlet","review":"Left-wing liberal extremists, such as Mr Miller, always unveil their true political identity when they start characterizing themselves as middle-of-the-road, unbiased, independents.In the beginning of this book the author's strain to sell the reader on the idea that he's evolved into some higher form of political species by virtue of voting for Ralph Nader (his mommy and daddy are \\"hardened Democrats\\") is laughable.If the whiney liberal condescension was excised from this book it might make for a mildly amusing pamphlet.Of Presidential quotes, I'm sure glad the sentences containing the words \\"but, I didn't inhale\\" and \\"I did not have sex with that woman\\" were found--by liberals--to be grammatically correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing","review":"This book is a nonpartisan, good-natured, honest comedic romp -- NOT! This book is precisely what it purports not to be. The book tries to give the reader the impression that it is an balanced and realistic potrait of the President and fails miserably.If you enjoy political hatchet jobs and dislike Mr. Bush no matter what he does, then this book is for you.I oozes the type of negativity and hate that most Americans would like to see taken out of our political system."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEY DEMOCRATS, YOU LOST","review":"Democrats, you lost the 2000 election, get used to it. It was very close, but you lost. It now looks like you are going to lose in 2004 as well. I admit that Bush is very inarticulate, but this may actually be to his advantage. The voters realize that a politician who is inarticulate is by definition incapable of sophistry. Since he cannot beguile by words, his character may more accurately be judged when he speaks. If Bill Clinton were not articulate and slick could he have been elected President by virtue of the character he projects? I think not. He would have been seen as the kind of dishonest wiseguy we have all met so many times. In a time when a President can utter the sentence, \\"It depends on what your defintion of is, is.\\", the American people may prefer a person with a marked inablity to use language."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most freightening book on Dubya I've seen...","review":"I gotta be honest... this book terrified me.I work in High Tech and have prospered well over the last 8 years under the Clinton administration, as have all American businesses and industries.This book puts into clear perspective why we're in DIRE economic straits... The \\"Far Right\\" has been so intent on demonizing Democracy that they've lost rationality when it comes to anything else, and Mr. Miller's book shows how it all came to be.Far from a gaffe-attack on Dubya's lack of education, this book shows his true colors in a way that has me sweating in my shoes.I hope EVERY American reads this book before the next Congressional Election!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Schpellcheken!

That would be a mistake because this book is not just an attack on George W. Bush. It is an invitation to reconsider the national refusal to think and talk deeply about the issues and is a call for Americans to restore intelligent and reasoned discourse to the center of the American political process.In the aftermath of September 11th, all Americans will stand behind the President and our other elected leaders. Hopefully, we will also use this as an occassion to re-evaluate our electoral priorities and begin to inject new meaning into our democratic process. This book is a thought provoking start to that process."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent must-read","review":"I am neither Republican nor Democrat. I believe every American should read this book and cry for America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"While I bristled initially at buying this book, I'm now so glad that I did. This book goes beyond a mere collection of silly quotes and instead conveys an important message about the current state of journalism and how Americans as a whole need to be more aware of our media and their power to influence and sway public opinion. Particularly now in an age of Corporate controlled television.

And Keith still is just KEEF!!!! again the old tale of some sort of ginger vision appearing at a concert insisting he could play better than the fill in drummer is trotted out and the nonsense about The Who being banned permanently from Holiday Inns is back again.2nd disc is excellent should have been more like this.you should get this however if you don't have Kids, Live at leeds, the Isle of wight DVD and Dark Side of the Moon (book) get those first. then this. ok?."},{"rating":"2","title":"For non-fans of the Who","review":"Count me in the non-fan camp, though I do appreciate the musical contributions of John Entwhistle, Keith Moon and, to a lesser extent, Pete Townsend. Even Roger Daltrey's singing, which I have found to be an acquired taste, comes through here as eloquent in his old age. The main film recounts the band's storied history, but I found the extras most interesting, especially the four bios of the band members, detailing where they stand in rock history. I really liked the footage of the current two band members recording a new song with Zak Starkey on drums and the bass player from ELP. Quite revealing of their methods. The Who were four lead players all together at once in their heyday, which made for exciting live shows, even if the 'rock operas' were a bit overrated and bloated at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"packaging","review":"whats wrong with this packaging?what's wrong with these people?compare this cover shot to the british one of the very same title,you might as well do it right here below on this very page,clicking the UK store link.it's a matter of...err package, actualy more the loss of it, or maybe just being ridiculously prudish.as church lady would put it: talk among yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus disc at Best Buy","review":"Just picked this 3 disc set up at best Buy, a week earlier than stated release date, It includes a bonus disc from Chicago '79.

The only way I could sit through it was because of the rare clips but any movie can have rare clips and that doesn't make it good. This is \\"Behind the Music\\" treatment and the band had barely anything to do with it. This movie was talked about in the begining with much ambition in the fact that it was supposed to be featuring full- length live clips, unreleased interviews ect. The Who should be embarrassed. If someone showed this to me to get me into the band I don't think it would do a very good job. I mean, it may be the gateway to TKAA don't get me wrong, but I would surely not watch it again. I understand that there wasn't very much money involved but they shouldn't have promised something brilliant and then release just another boring everyday documentary just because they want to make a few bucks before Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike's review of the Amazing Journey","review":"I was more than pleased with the Amazing Journey.

It's very entertaining and taught me more about recycling, plastic, and myself than anything I've seen or heard before It's amazing what we don't know and what is hidden or disguised on packaging and items we use everyday. I would highly recommend watching this movie even if you think you know all there is to know about being eco-friendly! All-in-all it's entertaining and eye opening.

All the songs were spliced together from various shows, and not her best performances by a long shot. It looked as though some of the numbers were taped using held video recorder. Sometimes the picture was out of sync with her voice. I could go on and on but to make a long story short SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rip-off","review":"This DVD is a sham, from the get-go; I am not sure how it was able to be produced and sold, as it comes-off as a pirated issue. The good reviews listed here, obviously are not for this Hudson Street version. (1)the picture on the cover is a poor copy/scan of a 1979ish picture of Cher; (2)it contains song clips from HBO's 1999 \\"Live in Concert\\" and Image's 2003 \\"Farewell Tour\\"; (3) the editing is terrible, as the song clips are not arranged in the proper order (Cher does not change BACK INTO a costume)and the clips from the 2 concerts are mixed-up; (4)before each clip a VERY cheap looking graphic comes-up and gives the song title - they should have just had someone hold up a sign with the song title; (5)the box states it was filmed entirely in Las Vegas, but one of the concerts was filmed in Miami; (6)the video quality is very poor, and blurry...almost as if someone held a video camera at their TV and taped it. Please order the originals...not this scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought it was a big disappointment. My mom was even very disappointed and she loves Cher as long as I can remember. The dancers seemed way out of place. They seemed like they were doing their own show, had nothing to do with Cher. I also thought she took way to long to change her clothes, which most were horrible. Then you were stuck watching these dancers. During one changing they had clips of her movies on a big screen which I also found stupid. You go to a concert to hear her music not see clips of her movies. I could go on but I'll just say I thought it was a terrible show. I give her credit to still go out there at her age, but I think she should hang it up now and go out gracefully. I suggest to all Cher fans to rent this video first and then decide if you really want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD","review":"An embarrassing recording....surely Cher did not view this prior to release?

The costumes are great, it shows Cher at her best. The sound is great, the camera directing is extraordinary. Cher's energy on this video is nothing short of amazing for a 53 year old. I strongly recommend this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful performance","review":"great DVD... HIGH IN QUALITY...glitzy showbiz performance from Cher...a must for music lovers....hope she brings out a compilation of video clips on dvd...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This video is a ripoff. It is nothing but clips from the two previous Cher concert videos, the Farewell Tour and the tour prior to that. It eliminates all dialogue from the star, it rearranges the order of the show (which was similar on both tours with the costumes and scenery changed) which ruins any degree of continuity or thought process the star and her director applied to the project, and is shorter than either of the other videos. Nothing but a repackage, without being identified as such anywhere on the box or during the DVD. I returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dis-appointing","review":"I purchased this DVD as I missed Cher's concert while she visited Ireland and although the quality of the DVD itself is top class in both sound and vision I was somewhat dis-appointed with the show itself. Firstly I felt like I had seen the show before as Cher blatantly steals elements of her concert from Gloria Estefan and Janet Jackson therefore if you've seen these shows you're left you with no surprises and a sense that little thought was put into it from the woman herself. Certain songs such as from her latest album \\"Believe\\" are performed very well, in particular \\"All or Nothing\\" and \\"Believe\\" but parts of it left me wanting...I think Cher has some great songs out there but only a few were selected for this tour and the rest are among her weakest. I should have listened to my friends when they told me they were disappointed with it also! I recommend this DVD only to dedicated, die hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cher Live","review":"This concert is fantastic in the sound cat. Only problem is, Cher uses the F... word and takes the Lord's name in vain. If you want that type of entertainment in your home, you may enjoy the concert. I don't know what Cher was thinking to include such vulgar expressions in an otherwise stellar concert. This DVD was not rated, so you would not know it was in the DVD without this review until you watched it. This is not something I want in my home. Cher should learn from this, vulgarity is crude, rude, and very low class. Disappointed in an otherwise classy lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be some mistake.","review":"I am a fan of Julia Cameron's \\"The Artist's Way\\" and think it to be one of the most valuable references an artist or writer can own. There are times when the spirit needs to explore what is ailing. After reading reviews I was ready to be entertained and further enlightened by this book. My gosh, after looking through it I couldn't help but think there'd been a mistake. This didn't seem like it came from the same author. While I can go for sophomoric humor as well as the next person, this was all that and less. I hope Julia will take this one back to the drawing board and come out with a whole new and improved version. The cartoons are kind of weird and the captions are flat. Was there anything to take away from this? Yes. I just wasted the cost of a book that might be worth keeping.. Maybe this one will find it's audience at the Goodwill store."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Junior High School Student Loved IT!","review":"I took this book to my tutoring session, where a very bored Naisa wanted to leave early. When I offered her this book to read, some out loud, she perked up. Kids are often bored. She asked to borrow it, so I said YES. On the last day, she did not have it with her, so I told her it was a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"By the title, I was thinking this would be a humorous book about how things happen to interfere with what you want to do most as an artist, or at least how things come up when you are supposed to be working on projects. Instead, I did not find it humorous at all, it has more of a negative/cynical sense of humor. The majority of the cartoons were what excuses you can use to not create art. I'm sure someone who appreciates sarcastic or cynical humor would like it, but it wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"FASTFORWARDITIS","review":"This is a horribly unentertaining movie. I have seen other Nico Mastorakis' movies, such as Zero Boys and Bloodstone which are B-movies but entertaining. I'm not going to cut him any slack with the old cliche, this is so bad it's good. This movie is the nightmare and the DVD is overpriced on Amazon.There are a bunch of extras: trailers, DVD specs, Nico Mastorakis' ongoing documentary, and a filmopgraphy. The DVD is widescreen and the actual image and sound quality is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"nightmare at noon","review":"This movie is b-rate movie no matter any way you look at it.

It can actually make 3 - 10 cups of rice. 4 cups will take about 20 min. to make. Very fast and always make perfect rice every time. Also very easy to clean (non stick pot inside).

After its first use, which managed to make semi-decent rice, it no longer worked and died completely. I'm afraid that the manufacturing quality of these rice cookers seem to be abysmal. Please for your own sake, do not buy this rice cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifespan of 3 years","review":"I barely used this rice cooker... had it for 3 years and had problems since the beginning. The inner lining flakes off into your rice (very unhealthy) and you cannot keep the rice warm overnight like other rice cookers because in the morning, you will find stinky rotten rice. I'm asian and we've cooked rice everyday all day my entire life. Most rice cookers are left on overnight and keep the rice warm for about 2 days before we toss it out.

Kajagoogoo was very underrated as a New Wave and Synth band, and really, they should have gotten more recognition and credit.

Everyone in the small town wants a share of the money. Since his father isn't around much, Teddy gets to relay the requests, including those from a classmate who regularly writes his African penpal to ask for money; the school officials who want a new furnace; and the hot woman across the street, whose son has warned Teddy that if their parents sleep together, he's going to kick Teddy's ass.It's both funny and really touching.

I got it mainly for air travel but find myself using it on the sofa too. Mine appears to be of quite good quality, I do not worry about it tearing for a while. There is a zipper to open the cover and inside it is stuffed with some kind of soft fiber. The only downside I see is that I think this will be hard to wash because the stuffing might be hard to put back together on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Bone Neck Pillow","review":"These pillows are nice looking pillows, seemingly well made, although I ordered a threesome set and only received two as they ran out of stock. They subsequently decided to never ship me the 3rd one for whatever reason. That is fine as I'm really not going to use them as they don't fit my neck very well. I had my son try one for a short time and he didn't like it either. They need to be about 2 inches longer in the middle where the round part of the pillow is. I have a round one that I'm wearing to pieces that is about 12 inches long and I love the way it makes me sleep good.

I have no idea whether the author made much of a case, since I discovered in the first few dozen pages, and then some selected sections following, that the book is abominably badly written, gives appallingly little actual information on the two major events of 1676 (leaving out huge amounts of information found in books where King Philip's War and Bacon's Rebellion are only part of the subject matter), and ends with a really bad index."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubt they'd have made this show in 2012","review":"A major pontification from 2007 about how safe nuclear energy is. I wonder what they'd say post Fukushima. The US has plants subject to similar catastrophes. That kind of flies in the face of a lot of their analysis in this episode. In fact, seeing this post Fukushima makes them look pretty ridiculous. They'd probably find some rationalization to rebut this, by interviewing the right industry spokesperson who will say Fukushima is exaggerated. Their general approach is to find somebody with credentials who agrees with them somebody without credentials who doesn't, and then to call the latter person an obscene name. Hilarious when they're right, and they often are, but shameful when they're dead wrong, as is the case in this episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this years ago and it's still going strong","review":"Good, durable, scale. Personally, I found all the pre-programmed caloric values annoying, but maybe someone else would use them. To just use it as a scale, it's great.

(1st being \\"Jack the Bear.\\") I bought this movie the day after I watched it on T.V. I have seen it dozens and dozens of time, and I still don't tire of it. It's the PERFECT combination of comedy, drama, & romance. This movie really made me think about what's important in life. I've been a fan of Reese Witherspoon forever, and it's hard to believe that this was her debut, she's so wonderful in this roll. You MUST MUST MUST watch this movie... not once, not twice, not even three times... until you get sick of it, which I can honestly say will be NEVER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chirping crickets have never sounded more beautiful!","review":"Everyone told me how great this movie is, but I didn't listen. Ten years after its release, I have FINALLY watched this movie. I must admit, I should have listened to my friends and jumped on the bandwagon long ago. This is a masterpiece--one of the best coming-of-age dramas I've ever seen! This movie explores many issues--first love, sister rivalry, tragedy, and redemption. You'll feel the summer heat as Dani (Witherspoon) rushes home from church to change into her bathing suit. The scenes in the pond are beautiful! The sound of the outdoors delights the senses and adds to this breathtaking cinematography. The cast, the setting, and the story all come together to make a PERFECT movie.

Unfortunately everything does not go according to plan , especially when and Dani's older sister ,Maureen , and Court elope .The innocence is later exposed to an even bigger shock by a terrible tragedy.This movie portrays the clash between innocence and experience and has some really delightful characters.

I want to add this to the reviews: Get the soundtrack. I found it as a cutout CD not too long after the movie came out, and I love that disc. It's all just the background music from the movie, wonderfully played by musicians David Grisman (mandolin), Dean Parks (guitar), Michael Fisher (percussion), James Newton Howard (piano), and Jay Rosen (violin). Each of those musicians is truly a legend in his own time. It is so incandencently beautiful you'll find listening to the music as personally and emotionally engaging as watching the film.Nice, acoustic music, it's, as I said, the background music from the film--with titles like \\"First Kiss,\\" \\"Dani Sees Court,\\" and \\"End Titles.\\" I didn't realize there were other fans of this movie out there who were affected as deeply as I was.

But, you ask why? I'll tell you. Young actress Reese Witherspoon (Fear, Cruel Intentions, Freeway), plays Danni, a young girl who falls in love with an older neighbor boy named Court. Together, they bring the rising romance to the scene as Danni plays stunts to see him and does many things to impress him. The movie is filled with the jealousy of Danni's sister, irony, intense moments, tragedy, happiness, sadness, etc. I can't possibly describe another movie that posesses almost every emotion. When you get done seeing it, you will need a box of tissues, please use Puffs Brand, you'll need a lot!(unless you prefer a sore nose!) I give it more than 5 stars.

The reason? There's no MONEY in treatments that actually eradicate disease! There's simply too much money to be made in the cancer industry! This is a chilling reminder that ignorance is not bliss! The American Medical Association and the National Cancer Society are merely organizations to ensure that the truth doesn't get out! They are in place to CAPITALIZE on the cancer BUSINESS!

So the movie is convincing and informative enough to cause a change in lifestyle just by watching for 1 1/2. That's pretty impressive. I have been interested in \\"alternative\\" health information for 20+ years but had never directly learned about Max Gerson and his work. In hindsight I am incredulous that such an important and exhaustive body of work has eluded me. This DVD along with it's 'companion' piece \\"A Beautiful Truth\\" presents the story quickly and well. Well or Sick, EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. Now is better than later. As an aside, A Beautiful Truth and Dying To Have Known both appear to have been produced by the same people and at the same time and either one can present the story. Each has some unique information and some similar/overlap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Tripe","review":"This infomercial masquerading as a documentary gets 1 star for proving, beyond a shred of a doubt, that Netflix has some tweaking to do on their viewer rating prediction algorithm.Why else would it predict a 3-star rating for this film?

Years ago, I rented it on vhs, but later on after I had started my dvd collection, this version was one film I would hope to find on dvd, but not until just recently. When I found it on amazon, I quickly picked it up. In my opinion with George C Scott & Jack Lemmon in the lead roles, if you like this type of movie, I recommend it. I had already seen the original with Spencer Tracy quite a while before I bought the remake, but I have to admit, when you think of movie remakes, the people who made this remake of \\"Inherit The Wind\\", they hit a home run with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the gullible.","review":"One reviewer said that this film \\"proves\\" the Bible to be \\"baloney\\". It does nothing of the kind. All it proves is that Hollywood is steeped in anti-religious propaganda. The film is full of caricatures that make no sense. The so-called prayer meeting alone illustrates that the script writer has never attended an actual prayer meeting. The ridiculous charge that a Bible believer can't see reason or that evolutionism is equivalent to \\"science\\" or \\"reason\\" shows that there is not much intelligence in the whole structure of the film. The film itself is, of course, a propaganda reaction to the very serious evidence against evolutionism. No wonder that Hollywood's so-called stories \\"based on a real event\\" can't really be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film to show to U.S. History class","review":"I show this version of the film every year in my 11th Grade U.S. History class.

It is a pleasure to read as Dixon takes a potentially puzzling subject and captures it in clear and logical terms. Through the use of examples, illustrative tables, and conscientious narration Dixon makes her conclusions apparent to learners of all types. The efficient sharing of knowledge is an opportunity for an organization to truly advance itself and this book can and will facilitate this improvement.

Certain scenes may seem dated(check out the band playing at the party)-but then again it was the early 80's(lets not forget the disco scene in Prom Night).Overall, a fun and suspenseful film that should not be overlooked by any horror fan looking for something with a few jolting twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"somehow overlooked this gem...","review":"I was suprised to notice I had not seen this movie when I read the reviews. Considering the number of similar titles and themes, it it was easy to overlook, I suppose. This does separate itself from its peers in that the characters are more than cardboard cutouts, and there is less focus on the \\"kill\\" and more on the suspense. The story itself is really well done and there is a logic to it, though it does follow a similar format to other revenge themes. While the special effects are hardly special, they are not necessary when the story is compelling enough to hold your attention. Certainly an enjoyable flick for those (like me) who enjoy the occasional slasher film from the recent past with a bit of a twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is The House Still Open On Sorority Row?","review":"To add to the other reviewer's comments this was a suprisingly good effort in the slasher genre with some watchable stars (though the male actors other than the doctor are horrible), and a not too tired plot device.Probably if Hitchcock was doing Slasher films it might come out like this one.I understand from an article done in FANGORIA magazine when this first came out in the early 80s' that the House was in or outside of Baltimore.I wonder if it's still standing (and let's hope they finally drained the pool!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little horror gem!","review":"Never saw this film when it originally came out, but saw the remake, which made me want to see this---and I was not dissapointed!

There was Initiation, Sorority House Massacre and Hell Night, just to name a few. This one is among the best, and does have a few creepy moments. Not overly bloody, and a followable story line.

The main character Nick is not someone who generates reader sympathy. What are we to make of him when he ditches his girlfriend in a critical scene mid way thro' the book? Or when he makes a play for his best friends wife? Nick is also naive in the extreme eg \\"What exactly is money laundering?\\". Nick is a drip who should have stayed in acedemia - why was he hired for his Russian expertise when no use of this is ever made by his bank? All the characters have faces which \\"redden\\" - even middle aged folk? Basic errors abound - Lord Kerton is about forty - then ten pages later he is near retirement age? The dialogue lacks conflict. The prose is laboured and pedantic. As someone else has mentioned - who can believe that a lone English guy can take on the Brazilian drug lords? Nice cover though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A formula too far....","review":"This thriller is a little like a throw-back to the 1970s. The trouble is, the author's heart doesn't seem to be in it. Long lectures about financial matters, culled from financial journals, the internet or The Economist really don't make for a good novel, thriller or no. This story meanders slowly and predictably through a kidnap plot, adding a South American flavour, but none of this livens up a very tired idea. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"just going","review":"I was disappointed with this read.

There has been a re-make made and a colorized version made, but all Casablanca fans know to ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES.

The film does in a very smart way flash back to Paris from time to time and I thought that for once this was done well. Usually they don't need to be in there and they are done badly.

If you believe that uttering words is equal to acting, then this movie will not disappoint you. I could never understand how these actors could be so indifference and dead(!) while their dialogs supposed to be passonate and lively. I was very unconvinced watching their theoretcially romantic moments. I didn't think that they really care for each other. The real stars here are the screen writer and the song writer.

The acting was subpar and the storyline dull. A lot of the lines were so ludicrous that I found myself cracking up, much to the displeasure of my friends. I personally think that it is overrated, and had it been made today it would be shot down as a stupid romance that only girls go to see and then weep over. I don't think that it would recieve all the critical acclaim that it does. Of course, the reason it recieved such critical acclaim could be because it was one of the first of it's kind and whatnot.

Since this movie was released in 1942, there will never be a letterboxed edition. Second, I found the character Sam very shallow and subservient. I was appalled to hear Ingrid Bergman call him a boy. Third, the cinematography was closer to average than groundbreaking. Clearly, this movie was originally a play. The backdrop in the driving scene was more than obvious. The plot tended to be predictable.

Then back it up with a suspenseful and exciting script with one of the best supporting casts ever put together. Very special mention has to go out to Claude Rains as Louie. Louie is given many great lines but Raines makes them more special with his performance. \\"Major Strasser has been shot.( Long pause- roll eyes -look about) Round up the usual subjects.\\" A great line made even better by the way in which it's delivered.Greenstreet is also perfect as is Lorre.

The love triangle is devastating from the beginning, but add the danger and desperation of the situation, and it adds to this classic movie. Everyone should see this at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I may be the only one that thinks so, but Casablanca was a big dissapointment to me. I am a classic movie buff and have almost all the great ones, but this was so boring and Humphrey Bogart has no romantic appeal and no chemistry with Ingrid Bergman. I think this movie is known more for it's one-liners than the fact that it's a \\"good movie\\". I think the movie came out at a time when it was embraced because of world circumstances, but there have been many movies after it that blow it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, bad plot","review":"I thought the movie was going to be a lot better than it was. They could habve done so much more with the movie other than making it a boring, totally wrong love movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it","review":"you know, i'll get like 1-300 helpful votes on this, but i didnt like this film. i honestly didnt like it. it seemed that humphrey bogart's character could do nothing but whine all the time about his love affair in paris and then get drunk at the bar. there were some powerful scenes, like when the opposing groups sang their respective nationalist songs and the ending was beautiful. but i just didnt like it. too melodramatic and humphrey whined too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy","review":"This dvd did not play at all! It was really lousy to look forward to watching the movie we purchased, receive it in the mail, get set up for movie night and the dvd didn't work at all! It was not a pleasant experience and will definitely effect my future purchasing,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booo","review":"I can't believe people rave about this movie! I tried to watch it with my mother and stepfather. None of us were tired when it began, but we ALL three fell asleep. ZZZZZzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"simple and naive","review":"Described as one of the top-10 movies of all time... I naturally had high expectations of it. However, the plot and the entire storyline are uncomplicated, very predictable, and naive. I assume it was made for mass audience, and at the time it was released, it may have been a hit. However, now it is more of a sleeping pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Blundering","review":"Humphrey Bogart (Rick) is a master of the outer cold/inner warmth style. Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa) glows in her authentic softness.In the end, Rick makes the best (right) decisions for the individuals involved, and because of this, their actions are also good for society. This movie really deserves five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"It came quickly and is exactly as discribed. The picture quality is as good as the original film. I recommend this retailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I bought this Movie as a gift for my husband, it is his fav!! It was my first time buying from amazon. I was very impressed by how fast it got here and how simple the purchasing was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casablanca","review":"I love the old classics. But this one is one of my all time favorites. The actors are great and the love story and, of course, the notable lines keep me coming back to this movie...I watch it over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the most entertaining movies of all time","review":"Casablanca is that rare classic that never gets old and everyone can enjoy at different levels. It will probably mean different things to you at different times in your life. It doesn't get any better than this. The epitome of what Hollywood is (or should be) all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's only rival is Gone with the Wind.","review":"Better then a soap opera triangle is the love story of the ill fated lovers, Ilsa and Rick. I can't help but cry when Paul Henried leads the band in La Marsaiselles. Anyone who can keep a dry eye at this old love/war weepie is nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it again, Sam","review":"A complete waste of money. The \\"newly discovered additional footage\\" amounts to under a minute. The outtakes are of little importance and are mildly entertaining as a curiosity only.Sadly, this set is a shining example of Hollywood trotting out old material (such as the Bacall documentary which has aired many times on TV) on DVD that isn't worthy of a deluxe 2-disc set. Stick to the original 1-disc DVD and use the $10 you saved to buy a DVD of Sharky's Machine. Burt needs the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO AUDIO on BluRay movie...Shame on you Warner Bros.","review":"I purchased this set and the only problem is with the audio on the BluRay version of the movie. Everything else works on the BluRay as well as the DVD. The DVD movie plays fine however I cannot get the BluRay audio to work within the movie. It will play in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese etc but not English. The BluRay player is new and yes, I did upgrade the software to the most current version. It is a new Samsung BluRay player and all other BluRay's work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casablanca","review":"I thought this movie would be a lot better to tell you the truth. I found it to be rather boring at times. Being that its a classic movie I thought it would have a better plot! I guess I would give this movie a 2 star, for being so boring!I would not recommend this movie for somone looking for an adventure and action movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The purchase was smooth and worry-less. The movie sold for a very fair price and shipping was fast. I would definitely do business again with this seller.I got the movie because someone told me that is was a romantic classic and my collection couldn't be with out it. I disagree. The movie was good and I would watch it again with a lady friend but I could have went my life without ever seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must remember this...","review":"Louis: \\"If I were a woman, I should be very much in love with Monsieur Rick\\"Louis: \\"She was talking about Monsieur Rick in a way that made me extremely jealous\\"\\"Louis, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship\\" - well, Louis would certainly like it to be! Louis Renault is a fantastic character, but he is also immensely camp and totally in love with Rick Blaine. Next time you watch the film, bear this in mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casablanca","review":"This was bought as a Christmas present for someone who loves old movies. She enjoyed this very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film has badly aged","review":"This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the \\"tough guy with tender heart\\", helpless woman who \\"suffers\\" because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing.And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I guess most of the enthusiasm for this film comes from old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been a beautiful friendship","review":"One of my two most faourite films, the other being The Big Sleep. I can watch these two over and over along with Maltese Falcon and Key Largo. True classics. Also have a love affair with African Queen but that's a film of a different colour.But though its great that you have sharpened the print on blu-ray and no doubt have many extra features, I still crave for the day when the colourised versions of these films are released. I know...sacrilege. But I've seen 'em in colour and I luv 'em in colour. Could deepen the friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor - did not meet expectations","review":"Reading the advertisement you are left to believe this would be a re-mastered version, but it was only a rerecorded copy on Blu-Ray. Not any better than could be expected from a good DVD.Missed to mark entirely for blu-ray.Great movie - but DVD would have been the correct choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Icon","review":"This is a movie that every American must see. It really set the standard in Hollywood for years to come, especially with its cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Classic","review":"Simply can't go wrong with this movie. It is considered a classic and for good reason. Well staged, great music, intrigue, and plot twist. Of course first rate acting from the entire cast. This one has it all. Added features of this version are well worth any extra price. The video quality is high as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and classy","review":"Already one of my favorite films. Great in Blu-Ray and the photo book, mini posters, passport case and luggage tag made it a super buy. Get it while you can!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend!","review":"Casablanca is one of the few movies that is every bit as good as its hype. The story moves at a frantic, but believable, pace. Like all of the great ones, this film is not tarnished by its age. The unfortunate thing is that, in 2005, so much of the dialogue has so fully entered our cultural lexicon that the new viewer may be disappointed as to how cliche it sounds. Yet, none of the lines like \\"play it again Sam,\\" \\"...out of all of the gin joints\\" and \\"this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,\\" were ever heard before Casablanca's release. Sure, Bogey is stupendous as is Bergman but what about Claude Rains? He practically steals the title role away from Rick. His character is incredibly complex and interesting. It is somewhat amusing as to the favorable spin that the French are given, but we must remember that back in 1941 they were a defeated ally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Collector's Item","review":"The DVD is still one of the best films ever made.The extras are what make this box set so unusual. Original lobby cards are very rare and expensive to purchase so these provide a unique prospective. The black and white photographs offer a behind-the-scenes look into a historical film, the one-sheet movie poster is in the box (as well as a free offer for an additional rolled one!) and the Senitype contains a film clip from the movie. For me, it's like owning a true piece of Hollywood Glamour."},{"rating":"2","title":"a terrific alternative to the huge box set!!!","review":"If you don't want the big box.... a couple of previously released and worth once watching Warner Brothers pieces...then RUSH to buy this at Target where its is exclusively sold! It has the new 70th anniversary print as well as the two new documentaries (which I recommend one on Michael Curtiz and the other on the film) as well as hours of the essential documentaries from previous editions and commentary tracks. I think Target sells it for $19 and I picked mine up there on sale for $14.... now I can live without casablanca coasters and a poster and all that other junk in fact I bought the big set and got rid of it when I found this superlative one disc alternative!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic - as a good wine, it only gets better with time","review":"Now, you'll say - what can I possibly get from the HD version of a movie filmed 65 years ago? It's not like they did it on HD and had to go SD due to hardware limitations !I tell you this - the \\"standard DVD\\" showed a bunch of background as just a blot of black or white - HD recovers all those details. And the close-ups on Bogart's and Bergman's faces are breathtaking.If you loved it in SD, you'll marry it on HD :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality of the DVD Edition","review":"No point in writing about the movie - it is adequately covered elsewhere - just a note to say the quality of the DVD release is superb. This is what B&W on the big screen should look like - all the subtlety of shade and texture and wonderful tonal values. If you are borderline about buying it for the plot and have seen to many terrible prints on TV - get this to see how good the cinematography really was in those days! Oh yes - it's also a good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of best movies ever made with so many one liners","review":"Casablanca is by far one of the single best movies ever made and winner of best picture back in 1943. On top of that you had some many one liner's from the actor Bogart \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\" \\"All the gin joints, in all the world...\\" \\"Looks like the beggining of a beautiful friendship.\\" Plus mutiple other lines that can be quoted. I just own the regular version not any of the special editions of this movie, but I have watched it many times over these past few years and still never get tired of watching it, plus has one of the most pretty actress during that era in the actress named Ingrid Bergman. But if your looking for a classic drama movie with many famous lines within the movie and people's choice as one of best movies ever made in movie history then pick this movie up and add it to your collection because it is worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casablanca","review":"Great movie. I believe this is one of the best movies of all time. It is very suspenceful and drama filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casablanca - The best movie ever","review":"Casablanca is simply the best movie ever made. I think that there is a generational divide to a certain extent because it was made so long ago, but a person of any age who really gets involved in the movie can always feel its true power and emotion.The most beautiful woman ever, after my wife, Igrid Bergman, certainly makes the movie easy to watch - and Bogey , what a guy!!! To see Bogey change from the apparently narcisitic big man on campus to the sacrificing, earth saving guy we all knew he really was hidden underneath that rough exterior, is a masterpiece.I have never written a review before but this film deserves watching - not reading about."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorate Movie of all Time","review":"Cassablanca just might be the perfect movie, I'd give it 6 stars. This movie is the perfect guys romance, Bergman is the only woman he's only loved, she hurt him and now he doesn't give a damn about anything. What guy has gone threw that. The movie has wonderful acting, when Bogart enters the room and hears \\"As Times Go By\\" playing, he runs up to the piano and when he see Bogart you can see in his face that he's just had his guts ripped out and stuffed back in, that's acting. I cant' imagine a better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"I really wanted to hate this movie. I hadn't seen it and didn't want to buy into the mythical hype around it. But I finally broke down, and to see it is to love it. It is beautifully written, skillfully shot and tenderly acted. If you're willing to lose yourself in the world of the film, there's no way you can't be swept to tears along with the luminous Ingrid Bergman in the final scene. A great example of what American film was and should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie !!!!","review":"What can you say? Awesome classic... Everyone should watch this movie...

Also Ingrid Bergman is no Maryland Monroe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated Rubbish!","review":"A classic? I don't think that I have ever seen such an artificial and boring love story in my entire life.I didn't cry. I moaned and groaned, and waited to get these two people that I didn't care about off my T.V. screen. I just did not like any of the characters. The actors were like lifeless cardboard cut-outs, reading their lines.It's an old classic to some, but definitely not for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Great movie, bought for my Grandmas birthday and I watched it with her and was surprised by how good it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"casablanca","review":"Item was received very quickly by mail and as described.

It just seems a lot more convenient. But I do save so physical space in my collection for those items that are truly worth it, and this Two Disc Special Edition of Casablanca happened to be one of those, and probably my favorite. It was great to enjoy the movie once again in such a good quality, and the extra features were also pretty entertaining. I specially loved the looney tunes special CarrotBlanca.

I consequently ordered the Blu-ray version expecting a substantially improved version as compared to earlier releases. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The Blu-ray version is not noticeably better than the earlier versions. For someone who has an earlier version, I seriously question whether it is worth spending the money on the Blu-ray version.

There is little chemistry between Bogart and Bergman characters. The Germans just appeared to be too stupid in the movie. If Bergman's so called on screen freedom fighter husband is so important, why don't the Germans just finish him off when they had the chance rather than just trying to keep him from getting to Lisbon, duh... Ingrid Bergman is mesmerizing though, she deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"great edition, worst amazon packaging ever","review":"The boxed set is georgous and in line with other boxed set like Gone with The Wind, Wizard of Oz or Sound Of Music.The problem I had is again, the way amazon shipped the set, in a cardboard box exactly the size of the boxed set, causing no protection at all to shipping.The set arrived crushed on every corner and torn.Thanks amazon :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes a long time to get into","review":"i watched this movie for an hour and i just couldnt get into it.

Not so. There may not have been the \\"Bogart and Bacall sizzle\\" between Bogart and Bergman, but Bergman was a better actress who, IMHO, sizzles on her own. Compared to Bogart's other expatriate patriot movie, To Have and Have Not (with Bacall), Casablanca came first, during the earlier years of WWII, so the politics seem more real. Worth seeing over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Cinematic Bliss","review":"Casablanca may very well be the greatest movie ever made. It has action, romance, deciet, and some of the greatest one liners ever. The DVD features an incredible print of the movie. A must own for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Movie","review":"We all know that Casablanca is a classic romance. However, when you're deciding whether to buy the VHS or DVD version of this masterpiece, definetly buy the DVD. Not only are the picture and sound precise and clear, but the extra features are great. It's so neat to be able to see the original theatrical trailer, and to study the documentary. This is a must have for any movie lover! **oh, if you really want to have fun with this movie, select French with English subtitles.

I just finished watching it on a high-definition monitor, and it is simply the best restoration of an old B&W film I've seen. Even better than the recent digital restoration of Citizen Kane. There is absolutely no grain, no dirt and a wealth of vibrant detail that hasn't been seen since the original release prints were in theaters 60 years ago (and maybe not even then.)Yes, the extras are nice, especially the Roger Ebert commmentary track, but this disc would by worth buying without them just for the superb picture. It's like seeing this wonderful classic for the first time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Film is a Given - But the DVD Quality is Shocking!","review":"I won't write even one word about the film itself; we all know how great it is.

On my computer's 19\\" monitor, it was as clear, crisp and sharp as it would have been on the \\"silver screen.\\" A TV really doesn't do justice to a film like this. Again and again my wife and I found ourselves gasping at the perfection and beauty of the cinematography, the lighting, the sets, the shots, the angles... Even on a big-screen TV, you only see a faint hint of this film's real beauty; but the DVD brings it out in a way that only people who saw it in the theaters back in 1943 ever got to see... until now.

Then pop some popcorn, and be prepared to be stunned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please include list of special features","review":"This is a fantastic movie, but Amazon.com unusually does not list anything to distinguish this Limited Edition Collector's Set from a regular edition.

If you've ever compared the difference between a VHS release of a film and its DVD counterpart, you know the improvement; here, I find there is at least as much difference between the two DVD releases as with typical VHS/DVD comparisons.

There's so much to love about it from the acting the story the backdrop the performances or the music. it all is a wonderful combonation For starters the story in it is very well written. The story is so good, very good character development and what not. The backdrop still looks very good although a bit dated it still looks very good. The performances from all are excellent mainly Bogart&Bergman have such an on screen presence it's so romantic. and i really liked Claude Reins and the police chief he is really good. and the score from Max Stiner is excellent. I wish they would re-release it into theaters it would be such and experience to see it on the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time greatest films!!!","review":"Casablanca is a classic in so many ways! It's an eye-opening historical movie illustrating the plight of those refugees trying to escape the war and the Nazis, what was going on in those backwater nations unaffected directly by war, also an exciting adventure at times of those attempting to resist, as well as a moving love story, beautifully acted by an incredible cast! My own favorite scene, when Victor Lazlo leads the nightclub patrons in a rousing singing of the French national anthem to drown out the Germans! One of the great moments in the history of cinema!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over, and over, and over...","review":"There is no limit to the number of times that this film can be watched.

I recently introduced the movie to my kids and the actually liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite film EVER!","review":"Everyone has heard of the movie Casablanca. But has everyone seen it. They definitely should. This 70th Anniversary Edition is the best release I've ever seen. I've owned this movie on VHS, twice on DVD( b/c an ex-girlfriend ganked it when she bailed on me), and twice on Blu-ray. This edition is great.

It's definitely the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casablanca: Hollywood's Greatest Love Story","review":"Casablanca is the greatest love story ever told on film.If you haven't already seen it, Blu-ray offers the best viewing experience to watch this classic romantic drama.The actors are amazing, the story is emotional, and the film has never looked better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casablanca","review":"No film has embedded itself more firmly in the collective imagination than this captivating, still-unparalleled romance adventure, which epitomizes everything that Hollywood filmmaking--at its very best--strives to be. Was there ever a more unlikely yet perfect pairing than the radiant Bergman and the world-weary Bogart? Portraying the twilight of civilized society in a foreign place, and the rising menace of new world evils, director Curtiz masterfully juggles tragedy and humor, intrigue and action to tell a timeless story rich in personal and political detail. And what an indelible, heart-catching finale! \\"Casablanca\\" won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, and continues to mesmerize on repeat viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest films ever made","review":"Casablanca was a watershed in world film making and if you have not seen it, you must.

So here I just sat and stared as the dull b&w scenes rolled slowly right by and nothing much seemed to happen. But at least I recognized the famous scene at the very ending where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman turned to look at each other by the plane - but that's all. Sorry, but it was a very very bland experience for me as the deaf viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY overated","review":"OK.. I don't understand why people praise this as the best movie of all time? I just don't find anything special in this movie.

I'm only using this kid's review feature since I'm not a customer. I watched Casablanca recently and my gosh I was disappointed. I really don't understand the fascination people have with this movie. It's a film about unrequited love which frankly doesn't appeal to me. I don't care about great dialogue or \\"whimsical\\", \\"beautiful\\" acting and drama. This is a film from the 1940s and the acting is stagy and the film has no entertainment value.

A wonderful rendering of these classic songs. The orchestration is worth the price of the CD alone, but then you also have the added bonus of two outstanding vocal talents, Armstrong and Fitzgerald. Only one minor complaint: I don't think Ella's pure, flawless vocals do justice to the plaintive emotional stirrings needed for \\"My Man's Gone Now\\".

In the last 5yrs I went to turfs. I love those over cleats. First turfs I got from Zappos, and they were Adidas's. They lasted a long long time.Played in clay, water, small puddles and they kept going. Finally gave out, and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon. Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust. Once it does the laces will be useless. So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I'd rather have a heavier turf shoe. Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe.

The bottom where the studs are is glued to the bottom part of the upper shoe. There's a piece in the middle of the bottom of the shoe (the black diamond-like shape) that pops off after about the 3rd time worn. When it pops off, the rest of the bottom comes apart. They are not molded into the bottom like say, Reebok or Mizuno.

I put them on and they had great room for the toes and also felt great on the feet. I got the green one and the green color looked alot better in person than on the website.

I couldn't even get through it. The jokes seemed straight out of the 1920's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any assignment but this","review":"How can a movie starring Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley be bad? I wish this was a rhetorical question. Portions of this movie have a professional feel, and some of the acting, typically the minor roles, is good. However, the preposterous plot, the clichéd script, the bad B movie caricatures that pass for characters, and the painfully unbelievable performances of those two actors, especially Sutherland, make for a dismal viewing experience. As another reviewer has noted, the movie reeks of low budget. Nowhere is this more evident than the training sequences which employ what look like white-clad storm troopers straight out of Star Wars.If you're from Montreal, you'll enjoy seeing it stand in for both Vienna and itself. Look out for Notre-Dame Cathedral, the University of Montreal and, I think, the castle-like building on the reservoir at the top of Peel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best among the best!","review":"That's a perfect action pack!

I bought this movie and was fairly disappointed because I'm a Ben Kingsley fan. Acting is mediocre and you can tell that this is budget-constrained movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre film.","review":"There is nothing spectacular about this film. Adian Quinn and Ben Kingsley have acted decently, but overall, the film fails to deliver. Aidan Quinn's training scenes, which take up most of the movie, are pretty lame. Ben Kingsley dies unnecessarily and Donald Sutherland's acting is awful, at best. The plot could have been utilised more fruitfully and in the end, one is filled with huge disappointment for having wasted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars is not enough","review":"Definately an unconventional thriller. Duguay's slow but heated pacing throughout the movie was well appreciated. This allowed us never to expect when someone would die, or get blown up. Quinn's portrayal of Carlos' hatred was dead-on. His unpredictability and seething brashness was surely a reflection on the real Carlos (who by the way killed French cops in the '70s as Quinn did the KGB in this movie-by distraction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting action flick.","review":"This is an exciting action flick about how the CIA, through the use of a look-alike, supposedly ended the career of the famous terrorist/assasin named Carlos. Aidan Quinn is excellent both as Carlos and as the naval officer who is Carlos' reluctant double. Ben Kingsley and Donald Sutherland are also quite effective as the Israeli and American Intelligence officers running the operation.

While both take place in humankind's prehistory, I'm afraid I found little else in common. Particularly disturbing was the widespread misogyny and violence against women portrayed as part of the culture of the humans at the time. I also found the author's often excessive descriptive sytle distracting at times - a little more simplicity would have been appreciated. The main character, Torka, was difficult for me to connect with and I felt his character development to be abrupt and without explanation.

The pour holes are covered with a flimsy transparent plastic lid that is hinged via one small hole and rotates out. 1/2 of my lids came with the hinges already cracked. Due to design and the slightly curved top of the lid, the clear plastic covering is not flush with the rest of the black plastic lid, and as such, there's a 1mm or so gap between the two. If you have a filled jar placed in this rack, and if the spices are fine grained like poppy seeds or many of the chopped up herbs this rack came with, things start leaking out!! In addition, with this leaky jar lid, if you live in a humid environment, certain spices will spoil easily as well.The plastic jars McCormick spices you buy from the grocery store come in has better lids than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile Jar Lids","review":"I received this for Christmas last year.

The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect.

There were inconsistancies in the plot i.e the party invitation that was supposed to be delivered late, and none of the characters had depth, I certainly had no empathy with any of them. I waited in vain for the plot to develop and improve.

ALL THE EDGES WERE WORN AND CURLED, WHICH I ALSO TAPED UP. ALSO THE PAGES WERE YELLOWED. THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RETURN IT WAS BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH.THE OTHER 2 BOOKS FROM BEARBOOKS -(FERN MICHAELS-WEEKEND WARRIORS AND VENDETTA) WERE LISTED AS NEW AND WERE FINE.I CERTAINLY WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM BEARBOOKS AGAIN THO AS I WILL BE AFRAID OF WHAT I RECEIVE.AT THE SAME TIME I ORDERED 2 USED BOOKS (FERN MICHAELS-PAYBACK AND LETHAL JUSTICE).

There was tooooooooooo much of the two reporters, their romance, their following the women in the sisterhoold, etc. they were annoying and not essential to the book and I hope they are not in the next book. I much preferred Mark from the previous book.The book was about Isabelle's revenge but she was hardly in the book, nor for that matter was the sisterhood, though I must say the character of Rosemary was the best villian in the whole series.I hope the next book is better with more of the sisterhood and their methods of revenge (and bring back the character of Mark and x-out the reports)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet revenge (revenge of the sisterhood","review":"I really enjoyed the book.

Sweet Revenge was defintely not a favorite. I wouldn't have bought it had I known it wasn't as good as the last four. Honestly, the first book seems to be the best. It seems like Fern Michaels has lost interest in her Sisterhood sisters.I felt like there were so many things that could have happened. It seems like Fern Michaels set us up for so many different options of what could happen and then just sort of killed the idea. It was short and seemed rushed.This series was my all time favorite books, what better to read about than revenge. It's disheartening to think that the writer is losing interest. Some details seem to be fogotten, sometimes, but I learned to over look them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Vocal unlike any other","review":"This is a wonderful album if you want to hear a jazz musican doinmg vocalizations, not merely a singer fronting a jazz band. I know it is sacreligious to say so but her scat is better than Ella's(to me) because it caried more of an emotional weight than Ella.

A must-have if you're a fan of Dee Dee's dynamic singing and rip-roaring scat. If you're a fan of Horace Silver's compositions, all the better--but it's by no means a must for enjoying the album. Horace even makes an appearance on a track or two, easily distinguishable from the pianist's main CD (who does a fine job of his own). Check out \\"Nica's Dream\\" for the best groove on the album. About the only thing lacking on the album is the two brothers playing sax and trumpet don't always swing too well--but it's negligible enough to make the album a worthwhile buy. Definitely buy it over one of her other albums like \\"Dear Ella\\" ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of Dee Dee","review":"If you really love Silver's compositions like \\"Song for My Father\\", \\"Nica's Dream\\" or \\"Tokyo Blues\\", you will really appreciate this album of Dee Dee Bridgewater.

I am an admirer of Hitchcock and also enjoy old British films, but I still found this movie tough going, not least because of the 110 mins running time. The picture quality of this Laserlight DVD is not perfect, but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you'd expect for the price. The musical score is also okay, but nothing to write home about. Laserlight do however pose a mystery that Hitch himself would have been proud of. This DVD has no commentary, no documentary and no trailer, not even one of those awful Tony Curtis intros. So why do Laserlight describe this DVD as a 'Special Edition' ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Era of Silent Hitchock Film","review":"This is a tragic, woeful tale-very early Hitchcock.We are introduced to the fine actor, Carl Brisson. His performance is super-expressive (expected, considering it's a silent film), however, his is a performance to be remembered. You really root for this guy, especially when his Woman does him wrong. Carl is the backbone of this dreadully long, long, tragedy.Don't get me wrong, Anny does her part too! When she mouths, \\"I am having a baby\\" directly to the viewer, I was delighted.You'll notice the pacing and editing of the movie are frustrating, however, in its entirety, i still believe this film works. It's a rarity, and something I'm glad to have watched. I only wish Mr. Brisson had produced more than three films before his untimely (and early) death.And you'll want this as a reminder that the fruits of Hitchcocks genius were in the larval stages and just absolutely fascinating to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME WAVE BOARD","review":"This board is so much better than a skateboard.

This guy came to our school with about 30 waveboards and helmets, plus 7 boards he was giving away for free! So we got in pairs of two, and we tried out the boards. They are a little hard to get, but soo fun! Even trying to get it is fun, and it is a little helpful to have someone to hold onto in the beginning.

Could still be a great 3D card, at the right price, and if you don't mind no support..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodoo5 5500","review":"Although many people think the GeForce2 GTS is a better card from the specs and the benchmarks, the Voodoo5 is superior. Not only does it have more memory and is cheaper, but the anti-aliasing works all the time, on every game. The T-Buffer effects make for a more movielike game, and the speed is simply amazing. Even the anti-aliasing is better than the GeForce2's. This card is ideal for gamers who want to play sims, driving games, adventures, RPG's, etc.. If you play a lot of FPS's you'd be better off with the GeForce 2, because it is simply faster. The Voodoo5 is for games that you want to enjoy the visual glory more. So, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Moly! It's great!","review":"I previously owned a 3d ProphetII. I was very impressed by its extremely fast frame rates and overall game performance. However it is not a very stable card and the graphic performance was not what I expected from a $400 card. The V5 is very compatible with numerous setups or chipsets you may be running, weather it be AMD or Pentium. As well the T-Buffer engine makes for some impressive effects while the 2x or 4xFSAA is activated. Even 2-D applicatioins look sharper. The extra programs 3-Deep and True Internet Color tha come on the install cd help to make your existing color scheme more rich then ever before. It does what a graphics accelerator is supposed to do: Enhance the aestetic apperance of the games you play. It adds a dynamic level to the game environment like no other card out there can do right now. A must buy for gaming enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"good card","review":"Ok, if you own a Voodoo3, don't bother spending the extra money unless you have to have the latest and greatest. If you are considering buying this card, then I think you are getting alot for your money. I just upgraded from a V-3 and Tnt Ultra-2. I found the Tnt Ultra to be close to to performance of the V-5, but less stable. The V-5 has \\"64megs\\" of memory, but really it only allocates 32 megs per procerssor, so it is actually a 32 meg card. The best thing about this card is the FSAA. It will not work great with all games but it is a great feature. FSAA simply smoothes out the jagged edges in games, but does not eliminate them completly. Frame rates are better than the V-3 and TNT Ultra, but only a little. The card is large, so be sure you can fit it in your case. If you have Direct X 8, be sure to get the latest drivers from 3dfx. Nvidia now owns 3dfx, so that may be another deciding factor in buying this card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make it first on your list!","review":"This is a monster of a card. True OpenGL support. None of the configuration hassles of the GeForce cards. 64MB's of RAM and dual Napalm chips mean you will reduce load on your CPU. This card was built for use immediately. While everyone else is trying to headline on features which aren't even incorporated on a single game yet, this one is built for the now! Going with this card will not let you down. Please be aware of the heat generation of this card. If you already have a cramped case, you may wish to pick up an extra cooling fan along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"Do not buy this video card! Even though numbers sound impressive, they are not all what they seem to be. That 64mb of memory, can't go wrong there right. Wrong, that 64mb of memory gets chewed up faster than the 4 VSA-100 chips can swallow. Therefore that 64mb of memory becomes more like 24mb! And the Voodoo5 5500 inablility to produce per pixel shading or vertex skinning is astonishing. For it what gives you this graphics accelerater is not worth it's price. Don't buy this card. Buy yourself a nVidia GeForce2 GTS they cost the same price. Also the GeForce2 GTS has an on board GPU(which the Voodoo5 5500 does not) and does not need to reley on the system CPU to render light. Even though the Voodoo5 5500 is a decent card is not worth what 3dfx charges for it. Sure the box looks cool, but isn't what's inside that counts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as i thought...","review":"I picked up my card on the very first day of the release. I removed my old drivers from my OS (delete the old files, not just uninstall it) and put in the V5 55oo. Well...I had a nVidia TNT2 Ultra card before and i hoped for some serious improvements. But i was wrong. The card gave me some improvement in games and the so called \\"fsaa\\" feature is nice, but overall i was very disappointed, because in high resolutions it is not fast enough on my PIII600 and the fsaa feature makes the picture very blurry. I brought my card back and own a nVidia Geforce GTS card now and i have to say that this was the right step to do. Please, dear customers, before you order that card, make sure that you like blurry pictures in games, make sure that your processor is fast enough (650mhz and above), otherwise you'll be very very sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This card sucks","review":"When I looked at this card back in feburary of 2001 i thought it was a good card. I installed it to windows ME and it worked great. BUT Try installing it to any windows NT platform and nothing but trouble. I did not expect for thier crummy software to work with NT but at least the driver so I could have a decent resolution, and that did not work. The worst thing is that 3dfx is NO longer a company. That means NO support in any way. I screwed up my computer numoruos times because of that stupid driver (that does not work).I STRONGLY recommend NOT considering this card. ATI, pny technologies and Radeon are the best. Voodoo used to be a great card but their time of fame has gone and they need to go out silently."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a little late, but...","review":"This video card is terrible. Okay, so 3dfx don't exist any more, but let this be a lesson to you to always research before you buy. The Voodoo 5 was such a bad card that it is used as the standard against which bad products are held in the gaming community right now. The positive reviews were from people who loved 3dfx back when they were a good company that did good things.

That is not to say that she is merely competent. No, she is a jazz singer of the highest order. On the swingers (eg, \\"No Soap, No Hope Blues\\" and \\"Old Devil Moon\\"), she displays a great sense of rhythm and fun along with some top notch improvising. As for the love ballads (eg, \\"When the World Was Young,\\" \\"Angel Eyes,\\" and \\"If the Moon Turns Green\\"), she infuses each song with nostalgia and longing. This very excellent collection weighs more in the ballads. I recommend it highly, especially for those new to Anita O'Day or to jazz singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Jazz Singing","review":"I've searched for my favorite Anita O'Day collection, and I think this one is it. O'Day is best known for aggressive, lightning-fast tempos, but those tunes often tend toward novelty. This set concentrates more on ballads, and the results are more mature and emotionally honest (several of these songs were also done by Frank Sinatra). She is influenced by Billie Holiday's behind-the-beat approach, but O'Day's tone is sharper, which lets her play with rhythm on every line. Her performances are jazzier than Sinatra, but she is suprisingly romantic and intimate. Her version of \\"Angel Eyes,\\" for example, is smoky and devestating. My only complaint is her scatty run through of \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" Those lyrics call for a more thoughtful approach. But this set proves that O'Day was a great interpreter, not just a novelty chick. Ignore the unflattering cover photo (please), and enjoy the lost art captured inside: pure jazz singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of namby pamby nonsense","review":"Well, my boss made me read this, but, he doesn't really run the business, so, who cares.

I was expecting some in-depth discussion on file transfer protocals and FDF files in particular, but out of the entire 433 pages, the author devoted one and a half pages to transferring files from the Sys/36 environment, 2 pages to converting CCSID 65535 and 1/2 page to remote email transfers.

I thought the book would be perfect, because she could take it off to a corner and practice at her own pace. She is 4 1/2 and has expressed an interest in learning. While the book initially built excitement for her, she has now lost interest because she is finding it so frustrating. She wants to do it just as the book, but some of the pictures are hard for her to follow. I tried doing the two loop method and I found it very tough to do. Frankly I think it takes more finger dexterity than the other way.

I think that it's a great starting point, as long as you understand that it is fairly dated, doesn't comport entirely with modern techniques, terminology, and PC hardware. I think by the time you absorb the information in this book, it will demystify the process of writing an OS, but you will also begin to recognize the limitations of the author's approach. I think there's a lot of educational benefit in a very primitive kernel like this one, because it's a lot less daunting than more professional projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CD with the book","review":"Why this is no CD along with the book.

Bad investment junior, go back to your coa-coa puffs.Burgess obviously doesn't know what open source development is about (thank god Linus did). This has pretty much doomed MMURTL to the backwaters, along with other great hits like the TRS-80.Should Bill Gates be worried about MMURTL? Oh, that's funny.

That, coupled with the $20 replacement filters doesn't exactly make these things cheap, but I think it's worth it.I think it is worth mentioning that you can get \\"custom\\" filters for less than the cost of the 3M filters.

Can be noisy on high speed. Filters go fast if a smoker is in your house. After a short time it blows out ash tray smelling air.

Once it's been running for a while it cleans the air well, but the first few days of every filter change it smells charcoaly and makes the whole room stink. The replacement filters are also quite expensive. It is compact, easy to use, and cleans the air well so that is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud.

My main complaint is that the fan speed selector has tiny lights on it that, in a way similar to xmas \\"chasing\\" lights, appear to spin at various speeds. The problem I have with this is that there's something frustratingly addictive about playing with the fan speeds and watching the lights! Other than that, great all around!!Now, the money saving tip: There's a certain department store out there with a carbon/charcoal mesh and blue mesh trim-to-fit air filter for $10 (the store is based in Arkansas and has the word \\"Mart\\" in it). If you set that up as a \\"pre-filter\\" of sorts, you'll not only get nearly a year out of your 3M one, but you'll get rid of odors much better.

I also have the larger FAP03 purifier and am pleased with its performance too, though it's rather large. They work so well that the filter only lasts 1 to 3 months, and I love that each unit tells you when the filter is restricted, but don't chg the filter immediately; try vaccuming the filter first to extend the filter life. Also, rotate the filter, since the bottom of the filter fills up first.HERE'S THE PROBLEM: the replacement filters are TOO expensive!!!

This author was recommended to me by the owner of a used book store after I said I was tired of reading Patterson, Baldacci Coonts, Crighton, and Connelly, to name a few. I wanted something different. I began reading Wilbur Smith and was delighted with the change of authors. I had never read many novels that take place in Africa. After reading one book I went back to the beginning of this series and read the entire series. Since I began reading him, I have read all of his books in his series which has been 20 so far. He is a writer that has a story line that keeps you coming back for more and more. His characters are realistic and his descriptions and plots are well written and intriguing.

They stay true to their trademark sound, but you can tell they've improved and grown a lot. The piercing high pitch screams are still there but more bearable, but the deep growls have been perfected and sound more unique in my opinion. Musically they still are very diverse, drumming is absolutely amazing. Guitars are still brutal, with the occasional jazz breakdowns.

It can not be stopped playing now! A STOP button thinks it is \\"move back\\" and FF button works as \\"modes\\". More, it eat batteries quickly, eg Philips LongLife in 2 hours. And don't try jogging with it.. Nevertheless, its design is so cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun...while it lasted","review":"Admittedly, I only bought this player because it was purple, but I am still sorely dissapointed in it's performance. I started having minor problems with it after about six months of moderate use. The sound quality has been degrading steadily, and as of today, the player is completely unusable. It skips every couple of seconds, even with a new disc on a flat, still surface. The anti-skip function actually makes it worse! It has been less than a year since the date of purchase.Still, it is awfully cute. And for a few weeks there, I was reccomending it to everyone. If you aren't in it for the long haul, go ahead and buy this. If you want something more durable, keep shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok unless you want it over 6 months","review":"I got this cd player for my birthday and i loved it. it looked really cool. i put my cd in and clicked on the anti skip button and it was pretty good. it skipped a little bit but not enough to be disappointed in. i did a lot of things with this cd player. i mowed with it and took it every where i went. But the first problem was that it ate up the batteries pretty quick. so if i wanted to take it somewhere i would have to take extra batteries. and also it didnt tell you how much power is left in my batteries until they totally run out. also when i mowed it would constantly skip and would really get annoying. and then after about 6 months of having it, it just stopped working. i was very mad. we had to throw it away. so if you enjoy buying a new cd player every 6 months you should get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product...Check the Bad Reviews!!","review":"I bought this CD player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and now after a months use, it no longer plays music!

I read all the great reviews for this product here and decided to purchase the CD player, but I am urging you not to buy it. The bad reviews are very valid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and surprisingly sturdy","review":"Because of the low price, I was worried that this portable CD player would break soon after purchase, or the sound would be terrible, or it would eat batteries ... something had to be wrong with it at that price, I thought. But after using it for a month I can say with confidence that it is a fine CD player -- much better than the Sony I had before, which cost three times as much. The Koss CD player spent an entire day with a six-year-old girl who dropped it repeatedly, and it emerged unscathed. I recently sent it sailing off my kitchen table to crash into my hardwood floor, and again it was completely fine. Great sound, very sturdy and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niles","review":"I have prior expeirience with several products. I started with a sony cd player 5 years ago that had no skip protection. i went to aiwa shortly later that had none either. after a while i stumpled upon a cd player with 10 sec skip protect. the cd player worked great, and skip protection protected for a max of about 6 seconds. and this was another sony! this koss cdplayer, which i bought a few weeks ago, has shock protection that lasts up to 30 seconds, and even is somewhat shock proof without the skip proof on. i dont know what these people are talking about, this cd player looks great, sounds great (awesome bass!) and the shock protection works better than even a 100 dollar sony i bought earlier! i recommend this for anyone who wants to get great sound for less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Missing Features","review":"This CD player has a great weight and feel to it, and it look awsome to. It plays CD's super and has a very crisp sound. I got this to replace my Sony Discman, and with the replacement, There are some missing features that are hard to live without. This CD Player doesnt have a \\"resume\\" function that allows you to pick up off the place on the CD where you left off, and the biggest missing feature is a Battery Indicator, so you have absolutly no idea what condition your batteries are in. I will now be forced to take an extra pair of batteries with me wherever I go in case they go dead on me. But overall, its worth the money, and a good CD player! You can always trust Koss"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Christmas present that lasted a week","review":"I bought this for our son 5 1/2. He loves the color purple and I was looking for a simple player. I got it - he loved the color and it was nice and simple. Here's the but! He dropped it (one week after getting it )the top broke. Lots of tears. Called Koss Customer Service to find out that not only would they not service it, but they wanted me to mail it back with all accessories along with a check for fourty dollars. They would then send a new one! I said, \\"Can't I just get a new player? I don't need the accessories. Since that was full price why do I have to bother mailing it back?\\" \\"We are not a retail chain!\\" was the answer that I got. I will not be buying any new Koss product, if this is there idea of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please do NOT buy! If you do, I feel SORRY for you!","review":"The ONLY good thing about this CD player is the way it looks! The sound is so fuzzy.

Got it promptly when Amazon/UPS said I would, opened it, played it, purposly droped in on the box it was shipped in, and kept on playin' without a skip!!

I'm hoping when I return it for a replacement that it won't quit on me again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing Defect","review":"I purchased this cd player and when I received it I had to send it back to Koss for repair.

I read poor reviews, and dismissed them as rare occurences. I was soooo wrong...When it arrived, it would play for a little while, and then suddenly turn off. Then, the buttons stopped working. I had [...] replace it, and guess what? AFTER 2 WEEKS, THE SECOND ONE BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS TOO! The buttons are all messed up--the stop button skips the track and the skip buttons do random things, and because of this it's almost impossible to turn off. The return period had expired, but it was still covered by Koss Electronics' 90 day warranty. However, I needed a copy of the invoice, AND [...]. So now I'm stuck with it, at least it can just play. The good thing, though, is that this CD player has EXCELLENT sound, and probably the best I have ever heard. I also like the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound at a cheap price!","review":"I bought this for my fiancee back in October and it rocks. The sound is fantastic! For once the headphones on a low-priced player equal the output of the player. I couldn't be more pleased. Great bass and full sound. My fiancee tells me she constantly gets compliments on the look of the player as well. ...[You] can't beat the price. If you don't care about listening to the radio or other unnecessary extras, then this is the CD player for you.I don't want to argue with the guy who gave the player to his kid who then dropped it -- I'm sure it's not the most durable thing in the world -- but who gives a CD player to a five and a half year old?Word to the wise, always put the anti-skip on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I just got this CD player today and I must say, it's prettygood. The 40 sec Anti-Shock works like a charm. The features(Hold,20 track Programable, etc.) are common for most CD players but there one thing going in this one's favor, it's relatively cheap...not that bad of a deal.

This was my first portable cd player and I was very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Wow, I see since I bought this unit there have been lots of people with the same troubles I had.

Ive only had it about a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great . . . for the short time it lasted","review":"When I first bought this CD player, it was great. The sound and headphones were excellent and it was really cool looking. It was great for a few months, then it started to just turn off in the middle of playing a CD. To get it to work again, I had to hit it really hard, cause all the buttons stopped working! So as you can see this CD player is not worth the money. If you want a CD player that lasts a few months, this is the one for you. If you want a quality CD player, go with a Panasonic or a Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Eater","review":"This CD player eats batteries faster than I can stuff pork rinds into my mouth with both hands.

In my case, the anti-skip works fine, but the control buttons failed after a few months. Now, sometimes they work, and sometimes not. If I had bought it at a local store, I'd be returning it.The unit also has a crude look to it, not as refined in appearance as the Sonys, for instance. As soon as I opened the box, I was disappointed with the appearance, just not quite up to modern standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"the color is the best thing about this portable cd player","review":"Skip protection does not work. I cannot wear it and walk on the treadmill at a brisk pace. The buttons do not work reliably either. I can push a button several times before the feature engages. This was a cute color, but performance wise, it's just another piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all Sad","review":"I have to disagree with the other review. While Kiri is almost 63 she looks and sounds very well. I find the musical orchestrations of Karl Jenkins to be too much for the beautiful Guastavino songs having heard them sung by Kiri and others in recital. Not really the orchestra, but that chorus he uses. Some people don't like change and I know the \\"Opera fans\\" won't like this one as they didn't like \\"Maori Songs\\" etc. Not many recordings have surpassed \\"Maori Songs\\" in popularity, however. They went platinum after about 8 weeks. Not many recordings ever go that far..ever. While this is not destined to be one of my favorite recordings it is good.The Spanish is different in this recording because some of the words do not translate into English..because they are Argentinian Spanish which is as different from Spanish as Cuban Spanish, Puerto Rican Spanish..or even worse Catalan spoken in Barcelona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiri Sings karl","review":"Kiri sings opera would have been a more telling title for those of us who are unfamiliar with Kiri and who enjoy Karl.

It's a gratuitously violent, utterly offensive and sexist pile of trash that shows why Tony Scott should not be allowed to direct another film for the rest of his life (when Top Gun is the finest film you've ever done, it says volumes about your talent or lack thereof). Bruce Willis does his usual tough guy routine, Damon Wayans shows his usual bad taste in picking projects and the whole sordid mess reeks of idiocy from top to bottom. If you like foul mouthed kids, women portrayed as either philanderers or crackheads, lots of car crashes, lots of things blowing up and bodies flying around and tons and tons of gratuitous foul language with no intelligent dialogue to go along with it, then The Last Boy Scout is for you. If, however, you have even a little bit of taste, stay as far away from this clinker as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Films of All Time","review":"I cannot believe anyone can watch this movie without laughing at the utter stupidity being displayed on screen.

Awful, disgusting, and stupid movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie, definitely not for kids","review":"This movie must go down as one of the best of its type of all time. Wayans and Willis make a fantastic team and I can't believe with all the one-liners between them, that it never made a spin-off TV series attempt. One of the coolest scenes in a movie can be found in here (when Willis first meets Milo by a swimming pool and offs one of his henchmen), but there are so many other quotables and good moments that the film bears repaet viewings. I love Willis, but this is his best and I have nearly worn out my copy.

While jazz purist have complained about the popularity of smooth jazz and state that it's not really \\"real\\" jazz, it has become as commonplace as rap, r & B, pop, country, and other music forms while \\"pure\\" jazz is fading from the land scape (although i love pure, smooth and all types of instrumental music).

For the price of this lens I expected much better. My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images.

Reviews say the AF stops working when using a 1.4x adapter. Ummm, they got that wrong. The AF works just fine. Take off the 1.4 and you're good for shooting in a dimly lit church.

Oh yeah, the hood was an extra $30+ :( ; The barrel wobbles a bit and sometimes it can't autofocus at 300mm. The barrel also rotates when focussing which makes it difficult to use a circular polarizing filter. In spite of these flaws I would recommend the lens as a really good consumer grade product. I use this lens with a Canon close-up lens sometimes to get awsome macro shots. I have a 1.4X teleconverter on the way that will extend its range to 420mm (672mm on the XTi). I will update this review after trying the teleconverter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"I'm very happy I purchased this lens. I use it for my kid's sporting events and I always get great photos. You can spend a lot more for an L lens, the 70-200's or the new 70-300 L, but you'll be very satisfied with this lens. The build quality is a little loose compared with the L series, still if you are not using it every day you'll be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lense","review":"I use this lense for taking photos of wildlife here in the area where I live.

I have IS on the 3 other Canon lenses I have. All state they should eleminate up to 3 stops. This lense is obvious that it works to that level. I put the movie mode on my T2i and you can really see the amount of shake the IS takes out of the image. Very impressive. Only negative I can give this lense is that the IS mechanism was audible. You really notice when it's working with a slight hum from the lense. You don't hear it out and about, but in a quite room it took me a while to figure out where that new noise was coming from. Auto focus usually makes noise, but this is the only lense I've used that hummed while the IS was working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 70-300mm IS USM Lens","review":"I love this lens. I have a regular 70-300mm lens but I wanted to have the image stability. I am often in the field without a tripod and the image stability really helps with camera shake. It has brought the love back to taking photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels good in the handsce lens","review":"My father-in-law has this lens and let me borrow if for about a month while I was on vacation. I have a 70-200mm 4.0L non-IS and have owned a few other lenses in this general focal length. The Canon 70-300mm is a great lens, and were it not for the price point of the 20-200 L, it would be an unreserved recommendation. The L just has a little better color, contrast, clarity and all that.Like all other zooms of this general design I have tried (rotating front element), the shorter focal lengths are great, but the longest focal lengths are less so. This lens is really sharp up to about 180mm, but less so at 300mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice upgrade","review":"This is a great upgrade lens from any kit lens; the optical quality is quite good, and the IS helps. When using the IS, remember to keep the shutter half-way pushed for about a second before shooting, which allows the IS to kick in.On my 40D, I felt this lens was a bit tight due to the crop factor. I picked up a 5D (original version) and the lens came to life. I really like the combination and have decided to put off getting a 70-200L for a while. This will do just fine. I just have to decide what wide angle zoom to get, now (probably the 17-40L).My gripes with this lens are minimal; the lens does extend when it zooms; the rotating focus element is not a problem for me. Sometimes I forget to change the lens settings on the lens (mode 1 or 2, AF on or off). It's just something I have to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got this to replace my 55-250","review":"I'm still learning with this lens. Like other reviews - it is soft at 300.

Nothing more really needs to be said. If you want to spend money on a \\"L\\" Series lens, go ahead, but it won't make you a better photographer and it won't really take pictures better than this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this lens!","review":"You get what you pay for. To me this one is good! A lot of people compare this one too much with more expensive lenses which doesn't make any sense coz they are comparing an apple with a pear! Nothing is perfect. Especially with certain budget! So please stop blaming on the equipments and work on yourself! I always think the one behind the camera is more important. If you want to stick to the quality of the photos, go get more money first!I went on a trip out of country right after I received this order. This lens didn't disappoint me. It has got me plenty of decent shots. With my budget, I am quite happy with its performance. Will upload some photos later if I can coz I've never done it before. A picture is worth a thousand words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Zoom Lens","review":"Nice lens. The image stab is great. You can see the image clean up as the lens starts to focus. Really helps get clear pictures at higher zooms. I'm very happy with this lens as a good all around travel lens. Only negative is the occasional time I've wished the zoom range was a little wider. Doable of course but not in a lens in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it Very much! IS a must tho","review":"I am by no means a pro photographer but I do take a ton of pics w/ this on a Canon Ti1. This is a great lens I would not have bought it if it didn't have the IS on it. The first shots my husband took from a 40ft high deer stand of baby owls we had been watching for several weeks. Pics were great even w/ my husband who is only allowed to touch my camera on rare occasions. Great quailty from my experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Good quality lens for the money. Slight delay on the autofocus. Otherwise produces very clear images.

I was ready for a step up but not able to spend the big bucks for an L lens. I read the user reviews on the EF 70-300 and felt that this was the mid-level lens I was looking for.So far, so good! This lens has performed very well - the IS function is great and really helps get the shot the first time. I shoot a lot of classical music concerts and it does well in concert hall lighting. The IS is a tad noisy in quiet settings but probably only noticible to other people close by.For other situations, the lens is perfect and gives me the reach I need. I can get a real nice bokeh effect too! I recommend this lens for those looking for a more reliable and accurate zoom but not ready to spend money on an L piece of glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for price!","review":"I've owned this lens for more than a year now and have had great results from using it with my EOS T2i. Of course this lens is not the build or glass quality of an \\"L\\" series Canon lens, but it does take great photos in good light. I use it mostly to take photos of critters in nature, especially dragonflies and it generally results in sharp crisp images. I have used it on birds as well with not as much success. I recently acquired the EF 100-400 L lens and when comparing the two, it is obvious that this lens doesn't come anywhere close to the L lens but for nearly $1000.00 less that is to be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Able to zoom in really closely.","review":"I was debating on weather to get a regular SLR or to get a super zoom camera. I liked the quality of the SLR better but still wanted to get the super zoom capability. I love that I can get the close ups now of my kids in sports and in a program that they are in without having to sit in the first row."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY too expensive, but...","review":"WAAAAY too expensive (they all are though) but it gets the job done. A decent lens, but it's definitely NOT an \\"all-in-one\\"... you'll need others to get the job done. The low and high ends are pretty much useless, but the mid-range is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras","review":"Great company - delivered product on time. Tested out the lens in Mexico, Brazil, and Canada. When the automatic settings on camera (Canon 10D) were selected and pictures were taken outdoors with a lot of daylight, the background is overexposed. This results in things like clouds not being included in the picture. Manual settings and adjustments within the camera will remedy the problem. However, there is an expectation that lens from Canon should take quality pictures from the automatic setting. Otherwise the lens works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto focus not good","review":"Liked the lens at first but after looking closer at pictures that were taken at shorter distances they were very good, but when taking distance shots they were blurry. I switched to manual focus and the pictures were much better. I tried different settings on the camera with no luck. Returned lens and purchased the canon 70-200 L 4.0, so far much much better, it's the lens I wanted all along but the cost held me back. Save your money and buy what u want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the lens - hate the tax","review":"The lens meets my expectations. I'm disappointed with picture quality at 300mm, blurry - definately need a tripod.I'm angry about an added charge for New York sales tax. I'm not a resident of NY. Amazon wouldn't ship the item to an APO address (which our federal government declares must be viewed as a US address); so I had it delivered to a family member in NY, then forwarded to me. I was shocked to see the previously undisclosed charge added to my bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice","review":"I read every review and test I could find while deciding between this lens and the 70-200 f4 L. In the end, I opted for stabilization and reach - big mistake. Sharpness and color are poor on this lens and it can be very frustrating when you review your photos at the end of a trek and toss, literally, all of them. I sold this lens at significant loss and bought a used 70-200 f2.8 L (non IS). The difference was stunning. There is a reason the f4 is best in its class, don't make my mistake. You can easily crop your super sharp photos to match the reach of the 70-300. I've since bought a used 400mm f5.6 L - even at f5.6 the L glass is so superior to other products that it is easily hand-holdable (this lens is non IS) in all but the lowest light. Additionally, the L lenses are built like tanks! The f4 L will not dissapoint, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect color!!!","review":"I like very much this color because I can use it everyday because it is easy matchable. It is a very nice and natural color."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTRAORDINARLY difficult to unplug","review":"At first, this cable worked great; it was fast and sturdy. But when I tried to unplug it, it was nearly impossible. It immediately got stuck in the port. I tried all sorts of online tutorials, using a tweezer or a flathead screwdriver, and when that failed I called around asking for help; I was at my wit's end because I didn't know whether to keep trying lest it damage the Ethernet port itself. Eventually I suceeded, using a tweezer, but still every time I unplug it I must use the tweezer, which is inconvenient because I often bring my laptop on the go. Perhaps the plug goes too deep into the port, making it impossible to push down on the tab with your finger. I would not recommend this cable for people who regularly plug and unplug it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and price!","review":"These cables are great! Can't go wrong with them at this price especially! I ordered extras just to have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cables2Go are my goto","review":"For personal use, I only buy cables to go.

The Information, with all its styles, sounds and scope, is at once stunning and wondrous. I believe it to be, in all its creative and inventive force, a truly singular achievement in modern music. In my opinion, it is music that we should not be hearing for another ten years.And yet, here it is, upon us. Sting recently said that he was bored with rock n' roll. Certainly, he has not heard this broad stroke of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Little Better than Guero","review":"If another artist put out this album I might have liked it more. But since it is Beck (the expectations being high) I'm being generous with two stars. 1000 beats per second is the worst song ever put out by Beck.All the tracks on this album are redundant and they don't progress. They simply don't have any movement at all. His songs used to be more unpredictable and evolving. These tracks upset me because I love Beck.My only theory on Beck's downward spiral is because he became a Scientologist and they sucked out his soul or something. It can't be a coincidence that after Sea Change he became a Scientologist. Hopefully his next album is better. He needs to break up with his girlfriend again."},{"rating":"1","title":"lazy lyrics, weak hooks, pseudo cosmology","review":"What made early Beck so compelling was his word pairings \\"Misery waits in vague hotels to be evicted\\" (Tropicalia); \\"I've been looking for my shadow but this place is so bright and so clean\\" (O Maria). These were not just odd and arresting juxtapositions. They conveyed a sense a beautiful sadness Beck appears to have abandoned. I find this album to be an excercise (as in tired) in self-indulgence. Yes, the instrumentation, overlays and influences are interesting, but there's just no real feeling. Call it what you will, to be it is overlayering at the expense of substance. I'm not a big fan of Guero, but this album doesn't have anything close to the hooks of \\"Girl\\" or \\"e-Pro\\". The more promising hooks appear to be quickly abandoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck does it again","review":"Beck is one of the greatest modern songwriters around and The Information is one of his greatest, most enjoyable creations to date. On top of this, it even allows the listener to have a part in Beck's creative process by making their own custom album art! I had almost as much fun customizing The Information as I do listening to it! So what reason could one possibly have to not love this spectacular cd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and interesting, well worth it","review":"What I sought when buying this album was a sequence of funky, mostly upbeat songs, not too repetitive, with some original melodies, use of computerized sounds, as well as this refreshing, contemporary feel to them. And thats pretty much what the album turned out to deliver. The first half of the album - mainly up to \\"Nausea\\" - is a sequence of cool songs, while the album gets more experimental and more downbeat towards the end - but still quite interesting. Favorite songs? IMO \\"Cellphone's dead\\" and \\"Elevator Music\\". Hits? \\"Think I'm in Love\\" and \\"Nausea\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck never fails to impress","review":"I have been a major Beck fan for about 12 years and I have to say that \\"The Information\\" is one of his finest albums. His ability to make every album significantly different from the last is absolutly incredible. The Information is a must have for all Beck fans. Beck writes music from the heart and soul: Other musicians should learn from him. Beck is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you... and blossoms into a near-masterpiece.","review":"When I first played this I felt a little let down because I thought a lot of the tracks resembled Guero... only in the sense that he was rapping on certain tracks. And I was expecting an album that sounded more like Mellow Gold. But after numerous listens this album really grew on me and I think it's what an overproduced Mellow Gold would sound like. This album is very crazy in comparsion to his last few albums. (Sea Change being all acoustic with strings and Guero being mostly hip-hop). This one jumped genres all over the place. Definitely one you should buy (if not for the amazing packaging alone). Beck rules, enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere man, please listen","review":"This album seems to be going everywhere and ending up nowhere. What sounds like rap influences make the surrounding music sound like its falling down a flight of stairs. To me it was disappointing, I don't mind the direction of the sound, but would listen to David Bowie's \\"Low\\" or George Harrison's \\"Wonderwall Music\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his other albums.","review":"It's just not. It doesn't have the weirdness that Beck fans have come to expect over the years. Buy Odelay, Midnight Vultures, or Guero instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy cream or half and half","review":"At this point in Becks catalog, he is about half good half bad. This stuff tips the scale even. It seems Beck is no longer able or willing to write a great song. Where he once led he now follows, but thats ok. No artist hits the mark everytime out, and they need room to try new things. I knew from day one this guy would have a long career with many songs in him. I don't think he's dried out, but if he is I believe he has a well somewhere that he can dip into. Like Dylan. Sometimes the best thing for a songwriter is to become irrelevant and slip under the radar. As it stands with this release regardless how many drones will buy it, Beck is on his way to obscurity and when he gets there and looks around he may find it suits him fine. Better things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant album somewhere between Guero and Sea Change","review":"I was not really sure how I would like this album after listening to both Geuro and Gerolito. The information has a sound very similar to actually 3 of his former CD's. Of course, Guero is the first one. The other is Sea Change, and the 3rd is Mutations, to some degree. My favorite cut is #10 on the CD. I forgot the title. I just love it. Soldier Jane is a good one too. There is a lot of value in the album. I think it is even better than mutations. Beck seems a little depressed on a couple of good songs too, but, sounds like he is going through a spiritual search or something. Beck just keeps evolving, however. Can't wait to watch the DVD the album came with. Next thing you know, Beck may be coming out with some old Standards with a trio. (From the 1940's).You never know what Beck will do next. Keep lovin' him.PeaceDirk-David Todd"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not worth the money.","review":"I suppose if you are a beck junkie than this is a must have but seriously,this album is just another dissapointment from beck along with sea change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Beck always Beck","review":"This album is different but still what you would expect from Beck. By far the music is good as is par, BUT would somebody please explain to me WHY the DVD that came with it only has 2 channel Digital Dolby and is not 5.1 surround like his prior two albums? I would feel completely ripped off if I wasn't a Beck fan. No wait I do kind of feel ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 4-1-1 on \\"The Information\\"","review":"Despite keeping the basic musical formula somewhat consistent over the years, Beck still finds ways to release fresh music. On \\"The Information\\", Beck fans can expect the usual doses of dance beats, gazillions of layered samples, and catchy choruses. Some tracks will seem very familiar, yet some will be distinctly new. Beck's typical, unique interpretations of rap music can be found on \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" and \\"1000 bpm\\", while more alternative-friendly numbers like those on Guero come in the form of \\"Nausea\\" and \\"No Complaints\\". However, there are some newer musical elements never before heard from the infinitely-talented musician. For example, \\"Soldier Jane\\" contains a Middle-Eastern influence that results in (at least in this reviewer's eyes) one of Beck's greatest musical achievements. Overall, \\"The Information\\" is a must-own for Beck fans...and definitely check out the accompanying DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rao Like father like son","review":"Other than the short section near the end of the book where Jor-El gets Superman on earth for help and end up becoming the master of a computer program I totally loved this book. I especially loved Jor-El, Lara, Superman and Lois all in the silver-age Krypton costumes that I grew up with and loved the best. It had such sweet bonding moments between Lois and Lara as well as some great bits with Superman and Lois in different areas of Krypton including the giant key hole fortress of solitude which while logically never made sense was always a great part of the superman lore I grew up with. While Supergirl comics of the same time period commented on it being impossible move a planet Superman managed to do it just like his classic silver-age counter part was once able to.

It's a wonderful romantic-comedy.It's pretty simple which makes it such a lovable movie. It involves 3 women living in different areas of the US (Miami, Chicago, and the other in New York).

I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen, but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target, I think it's just a shame.The whole cast was pretty much of Latin America origin, but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight. The plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The dvd played very good I been ordering alot on amazon The best place to buy anything that you want.

(Especially when he recommends another card as 'better'.) I've checked a number of other sites and the PC vs. is definitly not available. I'm sure everyone accessing this site would like to know the answer to that. I even e-mailed Voodoo concerning a projected release date with no response. If you choose not to release this commentary then you should delete the 'rating' from 'Washington' as irrelevant. Actually the whole rating system is irrelevant, in my opinion, because it reflects opinions of 'past' purchases without correlation to 'upgrade' purchases. Is this fair, do you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for sale yet != not available","review":"Just because something is not available for retail sale does not mean it's not available.

His testimoney is amazing and we all had the privilage of meeting him in person while he was here in Ireland. He has blessed many through his music and I'm sure he will continue to do so.

The lyrics are repetitive. The songs that don't have enough rhythm to merit the use of drums HAVE drums. Pointless. This album drags. I wish I could return used albums.

His work is truly inspired by the Lord.If you have not heard this CD, buy it. There are no bad songs on it. Some are just awesome. Those include: Stay, Walk By Faith, I Still Believe, and Take My Life.

Jeremy Camp has touched a cord in me with this CD. The hard driving \\"Take My Life\\" is a song to go to war to, and \\"Stay\\" seems to imbue strength in the listener to be able to do just that. If \\"I Still Believe\\" doesn't impress you, which it should right out of the box, then read the back story and listen again. The story behind this song changes it from just great music to an amazing testimony.

He has a sense of humor and does his own thang. The Bird comparisons are invalid, because he is said to have been playing the bebop alto since the late 40's. On this CD, we get a view of late 50's/early 60's Sonny. He shines alongside Gene Ammons on \\"Walkin'\\", a solid mid-paced burner and the lovely \\"Time\\" with strings. If you never hear his playing , you will miss out on one of America's greatest jazz musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dad's Lessons.","review":"Nemo's Dad, Carl, is the star of this book. Basically, it's a quick overview of the adventures he went on while looking for Nemo. Sprinkled throughout the text are various facts about sea life and sea creatures. The book has lots of black and white illustrations and contains some practical advice for real life as well. I bought this book because I'm a huge fan of FINDING NEMO (the best movie of 2003!) and would recommend it to any other Nemo fan.

Tone Dialing is an attempt to break away from the acousic sound he used for so long and incorporate hip-hop and amplified instruments. He shoots and misses. His plastic horn is an afterthought behind the electric bass and heavy drums. And the reverb he uses is annoying. Simply, the group isn't nearly as good as his earlier groups.

I could only put a small amount of meat in the unit because it would jam up. This piece of junk is going to the scrap heap. it was total frustration and agony to trying to stuff the casings.

The phone can also be turned on by itself or perform other actions because the holster side of the opening flap has a seam that transcends the key pad buttons, including the hot keys and when sitting in a car the seat belt buckle pushes on the phone case and the seam causes the phone to sometimes turn on and perform some random programs. Dangerous for contact lists etc. I have a few pictures of the inside of the phone case also.Phone can also be propelled out of the case with little force if the correct angle of bump is directed on the antenna while walking.

A person walking behind me pointed out that my pouch and phone were on the floor; I looked down at my belt to see that the belt clip was still there.

Not to mention every major move or choice I made was a pause in the game with the off-black blank screen that said \\"loading\\" in the top corner. Not even the original Sims didn't do that...and I was playing with my old computer at the time.The PSP is a great system that does not come cheap. You would think with all of the positive hype with the Sims collection over the years and the PSP that *someone* would actually take their time and preventing this!I hope they come out with the better version with the Sims in the future if they want to be successful with the PSP crowds. Other than that, I'm staying away until it's changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the Sims.","review":"This game is nothing like the sims on other platforms, it is a 1st person role playing game, where you walk around doing dumb little tasks to stop yourself from getting a headache. It is similar to the game boy advance version, but the graphics are a lot better and game play is a lot worse. Simple conversations with people are now a chore, and any ground you make how ever little gets lost if you don't meet these silly goals you don't really care about it. So I'm going back to my PC to play it and the Game boy when I am traveling. Its a shame they didn't try to make a sims version like the PC version and forget the neighbourhood and concentrate on the house building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grind, Grind, Grind, CRASH!","review":"This game had so much potential. Great story, great graphics. It would have been a fun, portable version of \\"The Sims 2\\" that was much more faithful to the original PC version than the versions for DS and GBA.Unfortunately, the horrific load times and crash-proneness ruined that. Any time you do ANYTHING in this game, the game has to load from the disk. And load, and load. So you're sitting there listening to it grind and looking at a spinning hourglass.The funny thing is that there's only really about 5-6 hours worth of game here, but it takes at least three times that because of all the loading.Even worse is its tendency to crash. While I was playing, the game crashed several times, requiring me to restart my PSP and go back to a save file. Worst of all, it consistently crashed on the game's finale.I'm glad I just rented this one. It's defintely not worth what they're charging for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fun, very slow.","review":"Now, don't get me wrong. This is coming from a HUGE Sims fan. I think the gameplay in this game is very much fun, and the graphics are very good. I CAN'T stand the loading times. I think they should have gotten some of the bugs out before selling it. Oh, well, still an OK game. ;)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Graphics. Poor Loading.","review":"Well, what can I say..The graphics rocks but the loading and length of game play is really a disappointment. I have already played this game through. I probably would've finished it in about a few days but the wait is what made the game seem so long. There weren't much missions fullfill and for some strange reason this game will make your psp shut off. I've never had this problem w/ my other games for psp. If I were you, I wouldn't really waste my money on this game..It's not worth it. I'm planning to sell mine back to the store I bought it from or swap it w/ the ds version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good game man","review":"I chose rating because Very Good game .I don't like the AI and the camera anglesI would recommend this game to a friend"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"Can't wait till my kids open their presents tragic story cut short we lost all belongings including psp's and games kids will be happy this year. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book--A Must Buy for Any Japanese Student","review":"This is a first-rate product, available at a reasonable price. The jacket and paper quality are outstanding.I must admit that I have not yet read through all the stories in this collection, but I very much look forward to doing so.The volume is exceedingly user friendly and features footnotes for each Kanji compound introduced.The publishers were awesome enough to include a link to online mp3 files with Japanese actors reading the texts aloud.In short, a must buy for any student of Japanese!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I gave it 5 stars because the shipment was fast and the book itself was really good.

As usual, 4 Stars because only God is Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With the Wind 75th Anniversary edition","review":"The book arrived on time, in good condition, however, I was disappointed that it was a paperback version. I should have read the comments closer and I would have known it was not a hardback--in which case I would not have purchased it. I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf. I do not understand why this book was not offered in a hardback edition, after all, I would think most people purchase them to add to their collections and plan to keep them for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still here with the wind","review":"The book actually provides a well-balanced explanation of southern attitudes and responses to the Civil War, reconstruction,their \\"culture\\",womens place in society and class consciousness among both blacks and whites. Great history. But Scarlet and Rhett do get tiresome, I do understand better now what made them tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless and useless","review":"Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, \\"oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!\\" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing Lousy History","review":"GONE WITH THE WIND is a book that deserved to win the Pulitzer prize for its well developed Characters and fine writing but PLEASE don't buy it as history.I see no reason to call the Atlanta citizens \\"rare courage\\" unless you mean half baked!The slaves -- yes for what they endured.The Union troops (Black and White) fighting to preserve the Union IN FREEDOM and President Lincoln who went through hell for the nation but NOT the Confederates who were only seeking their own advantage and trying to tear our nation apart to establish a slave empire.Sorry but facts are facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page missing!!!!!","review":"I thought that amazon would have fixed the problem by now, but no. Page 713 is still missing, and in its place is page 813. I just got it in the mail as a Christmas gift and decided to check to be sure. I am so mad and disappointed with Amazon right now. Hopefully they will resolve the problem quickly. Bigtime bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!","review":"Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR A GIFT","review":"The book was intended as a gift but was in too poor condition to be given. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With The Wind","review":"This has to be the best book ever written. You abosolutly will love this book. While Scarlette acts like one you would detest, you can't help but love her and all the other characters. If you've only seen the movie, you are in for a huge suprise. Lets just say Bonnie is not the only baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett O'Hara Wannabee","review":"I loved this book! It was written in a descriptive language, but it was a level that everyone could understand. Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a Wonderful Book!!!","review":"Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Novel Ever","review":"This is the best book ever written. Margeret Mitchell is the best author of all time and Gone With the Wind is both the best novel and movie of all time. I can't get much better than this description of the South. It never has a dull moment and the only ones who don't fully enjoy it is those who cannot understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"gone with the wind","review":"This book was advertised as large print which is what my elderly mother needed. It arrived and it was not large print but normal print. The company apologized and stated they did not have a large print but to keep the book they sent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence in writing AND publishing","review":"\\"Gone with the Wind\\" is one of my favorite stories. As a writer and publisher I admire not just the craft of Margaret Mitchell but also that of her publisher. You do not find such excellence in editing and proofreading in today's books. This is one of those books so good, you find yourself turning again to the first page as soon as you've finished it!--Linda Donelson, author of \\"Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great American Novel","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I admit that it starts out slowly, but the rest of the book is well worth it. After reading the first chapter, I thought it was the most boring book in the world. But I kept on reading because of all of the wonderful things I have heard about Gone With The Wind. I was unable to put this novel down! I was engrossed in the story of the Old South. I highly recommend this book. It will be an experience you will never forget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely brilliant","review":"This is one of the most fascinating book that I have ever read.In its sweep, it focuses not only on slavery but also on the impact of war (however justified or inevitable) in people's lives. Scarlett's character is brilliant. Her transformation from a butterfly to a tough woman who loves her land, her struggles against poverty and her determination to rise above it, her passionate nature are just some of the remarkable features of this book. Its almost as if in the character of Scarlett, the author has put in all the dreams, hopes and aspiration of America of the mid 1800's. The description of life in the south makes the book all the more enchanting. Above all, its a great romance- A wonderful summer read. Scarlett's character, could be the voice of many women across the world even today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling and vigor","review":"Forget fifty shades of gray! This is a true love story. A story with meaning and feeling. Gone with the wind will burrow deep in to your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting view of the Civil War from the South's Perspective","review":"It didn't take me long to figure the author was from the South. It painted a southern paradise that was destroyed by the North. However, I did enjoy the story line itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Hara Not Gone","review":"What can i say? The book is better than the movie, but even though one cannot on screen (seeing the movie in any other media except the large movie theater screen will never be the same. For instance, the burning of Atlanta, does not and will never have the feeling and movement, and the right reaction on any other medium. Anyone who has seen this cannot disagree, I hope!Otherwise, I believe all has already been said on this, and I would not think Miss Mitchell would appreciate a review as long as her work which is set apart from all other literature. It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh. My. Gosh.","review":"Absolutely fantasic. This book was so good, even though I couldn\`t stand Scarlett most of the time. All the different characters were ejoyable to read, and Rhett\`s character had so many different layers that I was always trying to figure out just how much he cared for the unworthy Scarlett. READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story, but terrible print","review":"This book is a classic. One that I believe all southern women should read and pass down to their daughters. It is a story of love, loss, and an age in which we could never fully understand. That being said, this version's printing is not the best. On nearly every page, there are words or letters that are not fully printed. The hardcover, binding, and dust cover are in wonderful shape. The packaging and delivery, too, were outstanding. The only drawback I see is the printing not being 100% clear on each page. I think if you are interesting in purchasing a hardcover copy, you may wish to try a different version. I hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery","review":"I read this book as a tween and loved it. I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery. I hated Melanie and Ashley, and I loved Scarlett and Rhett, even though I thought Scarlett was some kind of a moron to have the hots for Ashley. When I became a novelist, I realized that my love/hate experience with the characters demonstrated just how crafty Mitchell had been in creating her characters because by then I'd met a bunch of readers who loved Melanie/Ashley and hated Scarlett/Rhett. Something for everyone? You betcha. And her \\"I'll think about that tomorrow\\" ending was also a brilliant move, equally satisfying to readers who want Scarlett to get Rhett back and those who don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett's perspective","review":"I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a \\"talk\\" with Scarlett. I am so glad she \\"grew up\\" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change. Such a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie's great but don't skip the book!","review":"Being a Yankee, I never got why so many white people in the South are STILL so bugged about the Civil War and its aftermath. Well, after reading this book, now I know: those ornery white people down there are descendents of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes (and all those tough old white ladies, the \\"old cats,\\" as Scarlett calls them) and by God they just ain't never gonna FORGET! Every American (especially all you Yankees) should read this book for a better understanding of the point of view of rich white Southerners during and after the Civil War. (You still won't think they were RIGHT, by the way, but you'll understand them.) Plus, Scarlett O'Hara is a total piece of work. You've gotta get a load of all the stuff she's up to! This is a chick who could rule the freakin' world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I love this book, because it's so romantic and so classic. You'll never get tired of this book. And it just keeps on going. But even though it's so long, it ends way too soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With the Wind","review":"I was 13 when I first read Gone with the Wind. It was a Chinese version. I couldn't remember who translated the book. All I could remember was that it was one of the most touching story I've ever read. I was encouraged by the Scarlett's passion and courage for life and touched by Rhett's patience and love.A few days ago, I picked up an English version of Gone of the Wind. It seems so much better than before. Maybe it's because that I'm now older and I can understand people's feelings in another dimension. Or maybe it's becuase I've moved to America and I had a better understanding of the western culture. I cried after reading it. I wish there was a different ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it be rated by stars?","review":"I first watched the movie when I'm 14. Just totally obsessed by it and started to read the novel. I'm now 17 and had read the novel 3 times in Chinese and one time in English and watched the movie for 5 times. It is (will be) the best novel I had read... the novel is better than the movie, more better. Dont' read or watch the sequel!! You will disappointed. Scarlet and Rhett only live in Gone With The Wind. When it ask \\" How do you rate this book?\\" in this review. I just can't stop laughing. Can it be rated by stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett and Rhett: Best Cat and Mouse Couple Ever","review":"Gone With the Wind is, without a doubt, my one and only obsession. Since reading it at age 10, I have attempted to acquire everything that I have found to be associated with this extrodinary book. I am now 16 and my love for Gone With the Wind is still exceedingly strong. Alexandra Ripley's so-called sequel was good but her Scarlett and Rhett did not suit the originals. Margaret Mitchell was a superb author with a genious for portraying saucy, touch-me-not characters like Scarlett and smooth,arrogant ones like Rhett. Throughout the book Scarlett's insistance that she would always love Ashley and Rhett would never have that privilege perfectly led up to the ending where she finally realizes that she only wanted Ashley because she could not have him. Gone With the Wind is the best book ever written and in my mind that fact will never change."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books I've ever read.","review":"I loved this book!

Wow, wow, wow.","review":"I love this book. It is so heartbreaking, tragic, and romantic- it just kind of draws me to it. One of my best friends took three years to convince me to check it out of the library. Finally I did and I wish now that I hadn't waited so long. I'm 13, and I think this book is awesome, and I don't even like romances, and I haven't even finished it yet!!!! This is a must-read for anyone with a flair for the dramatic, and anyone who doesn't like it can just shut their mouths!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time favorite","review":"Always loved this book ever since I was a teenager.

I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait so long to read this book???","review":"Gone with the Wind is the story of Scarlett O'Hara (and so much more). When the reader meets Scarlett, it is pre-civil war in the South. The reader gets to see plantation life on Tara and in the Country as it really was. Mitchell takes the reader through the Civil War, how life changed for those that didn't go of to war, how life changed for everyone after it, the mentality of those who survived it and how they lived afterwards. The reader gets to watch these character develop and change with the times.Mitchell's character description is amazing! As a reader, you feel transported into this world, as if these characters are your friends, and as if you are a part of this town - just another neighbor. You will feel for each and everyone in some way at some time. You'll not want to put the book down, nor will you want it to end....What can one really say about this book other than it is a great read and one that everyone should pick up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best story ever!","review":"Gone with the wind is one of those storys that wraps you up into the story waiting to find out what is going to happen next to Scarlett.

Even if it is fictional."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think you know the story having only seen the movie..","review":"If you think you know what this book is about because you've seen the movie then think again. Each time I have read it I discover something new. So many richly complex characters and scenes were left out of the film due to time constraints. It is my favorite book of all time, one of those rare works of literature that you can open up to any page and immediately become engrossed in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever.

Margaret Mitchell described every little detail so one could see it vividly, even if it was only in one's imagination. The characters were very much like real people and that is something not all author's are able to accomplish. The sequel, although it was a good effort, could not compare to the original. I think Gone with the Wind is a novel that everyone should read. If you haven't already read GWTW, then you don't know what you are missing. :-) :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STAR JUST ARE NOT ENOUGH!! ************","review":"Gone With The Wind can be praised in so many words, so many sentences, so many paragraphs, so many pages, that I could simple sit here in front of my computer all day and night raveing on it's every spender and glory. With every word that i put on the screen would bring an even bigger smile to my face. This is not just a book, no it's not even a legend, it goes so farther than that. The word to describe this masterpeice has not been created because nothing till its puplication could have deserved it.

I finally sat down to read the book and while it took me a loooong time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I see now why this book is so controversial, even today still. I love how things that didn't make sense, or you just wanted more of, in the movie went more into detail in the book. Melly dying, the chaos that Rhett and Scarlett went though when Bonnie died, how Scarlett landed Frank. Very good book indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Content - Lousy Package","review":"This is not a review or comment on Margaret Mitchell's work, but on the cheap, shoddy way that Scribner decided to package it. My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom. I've had many, many paperbacks that are in better condition after similar use.Sad, really, for such a wonderful work, to have been packaged this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Fiction, not History","review":"The book is better than the movie, and might be worth reading if you need an immense tome to take on vacation. Much as I despise this silly book, I have to admit it is a prime page turner.Its chief interest as a book is as a window into the viewpoint of history so common in the white upper crust South in the 1930's. The casually racist attitudes of Margaret Mitchell are a good example, and enough to make any quasi-enlightened being howl with outrage. Ditto the views on Andersonville, Reconstruction and especially the benefits of slavery to Black people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love Gone with the Wind!

The fact that it is set against the chaotic background of the American Civil War is just an added bonus since the real storyline of the book is the tale of a woman's struggle against time and change when her world is falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Read","review":"The first time I read GWTW was in the 8th grade. At that time, I didn't comprehend a lot of what went on with the characters. A couple of months ago I read it a second time--14 years after the first time. What an amazing difference it was! I truly related to Scarlett and Rhett. They are the all-time couple. The only part I hated was Bonnie's death. I think that affected me more now that I have a child of my own and I could feel the grief that Rhett was feeling. I will most likely read it again. It made me laugh out loud, think and want to cry. A very emotional read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and will always remain as the best book ever!!!!!","review":"I ablsolutely loved this book! It always kept me turning the pages.

This book is filled with romance, adventure, and hope. Watch Scarlett weave her way through different husbands and lovers while trying to keep her family alive. As opposed to Melanie, Scarlett is rather self-centered and never really changes, she does not care what anyone thinks of her and is prepared to do her own thing. Melanie is a loving, caring, considerate young women who always wants the best for everyone, including her husband, Ashley and Scarlett. I think that this is a great book that is really worth reading. There is constatantly hope for better times, even when better times have come."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a really exciting book!!","review":"\\"Gone With the Wind\\" was one of the most exciting books the I have ever read. I really like the part when Ashley all of a sudden has feelings for her. But, the best part about the book is how I could not put the book down. I first read the book 5 years ago when I was in the fifth grade, but then I re-read it last year. I understood it even more. I am now trying to give it to people so that they can read it. It is also one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anybody, male or female, young or old. So enjoy \\"Gone With the Wind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Wonderful","review":"I loved this book but the end reduced me to tears. And Rhett ,Rhetts character made me love him literally love him like Scarlett did lin the end.

My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film.

Who are these people giving a novel so rich in in scope, so remakable in the development, so intense you can smell the magnolias, a one? It is the only book I have ever read more than twice. Double or tripple readings are only for those very, very special books, right? If it were not for the movie and the hype, the book would have more respect. GWTW forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book of All Time","review":"Gone With the Wind is a beatifully written book that intrigued me from the very beginning! I had to read this book for an English class. My mom suggested it to me and I decided to make her happy I would start it, but I knew I'd never finish it- I mean 1,000 pages???? But, the first time I picked it up I read until page 70 and I would have kept reading, but it was late! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between. I love how the book ends how it ends.(I can't tell you how!)I did read the sequel, and I have to say, it was OK, but not nearly as well written as Gone With the Wind. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good novel. Don't let the 1,000 pages intimidate you because when you read it, you'll forget there are that many pages, honest!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone with the Wind","review":"This book was ordered for my daughter as a Christmas gift.

It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant & deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett & Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"thuroghly romantic, chilling, and VERY well written","review":"This is an amazing book. Suspensfull, and romantic, i was hooked by the first chapter. This classic story is the romantic tale of Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, the strong, smart women of the civil war. The book tells the story of her growth as a person, her strength, her willfullness, and is an ongoing source of delight, tears, and endless romance. I recommened it to everyone and anyone. It is my very favorite book. Margaret Mitchell weaves a colorful and expressive masterpiece, and i am all praise! Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectactular!","review":"It never got boring. Every page was exciting. The character of Scarlet O'Hara is one that will be your favorite forever. All of her imperfections just make you love her more. It was one of those books that you wish wouldn't have ended, even though it is well over one thousand pages long. It is almost sad to think that no other book, in my mind, will ever live up to Gone With the Wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I first saw the movie, and I loved it, so I decided to read the book. I found that the book had so much more depth than the movie which I had already thought breath-taking. Scarlett is someone we can all relate to, yet hopefully not too closely. It is always difficult to stick with a book that is sooo long, but Gone with the Wind was one that wasn't a problem. I loved how Scarlett realized that she loved Rhett because I think that many people overlook their true loves for a lust object that would never make them happy. The book was amazing because it was so beautifully polished and taught many valuable life lessons. I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless soap opera","review":"Hell, I just wasted the better part of my Sunday reading the last couple of hundred pages of this trash, always in the hope that somewhere, there had to be this twist which would make the book worth reading, but it just never came.

It makes Soap Operas look realistic.None of this speaks to the fact that the whole book is RASCIST. The south was built on the backs of African-Americans, and they died to build the South up. They are still fighting for equality, and now we have some romantic idealization of the South, and Margaret Mitchell makes the Klan look like some good group of good ol' boys.I am disgusted that a book this blatently racist and snotty is still held up as a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Sherman!","review":"I use to feel bad about Sherman burning Atlanta, but that was before I read this book.

So, I am so disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is still my favorite historical fiction book","review":"I've been a fan of the story since I first saw Gone with the Wind when I was a little girl. I didn't even know it was based on a book until all the media attention that the sequel Scarlett got when I was in junior high. I immediately went to the library and checked out Gone with the Wind. Even though I loved the movie I loved the book so much more. There are so many details that have been left out. Since then I've read a lot of other historical fiction but this one is still my favorite. There's a good reason why this is such a popular classic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed and I cried","review":"I expected this book to be just a dramatic love story but it is so much more than that.I fell in love with Rhett, expierianced all the pain scarlett went through,cried when Melly died and laughed over and over again at Rhett and scarlett's witty repartee.To me this means this is a great book and to anybody that will listen I would tell you that, to not read it would mean that you are really missing out on a wonderful expierience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most moving, emotional novel I have ever read!","review":"This book is another world that I lose myself in while reading it. I get so involved with the story and plot that when Scarlett is dismal, I am dismal. When Scarlett is defiant, I am defiant. This book never fails to move me. While some people see it as a racist pledge to the Confederacy, I see it as the key to how the South felt about the war, about the Reconstruction, about life..."},{"rating":"2","title":"American classic","review":"Perhaps because it was made into a hit movie, this book is sometimes considered a \\"romance novel\\" instead of great literature. It is, in fact, one of the great American novels. Mitchell does not portray the antebellum South as an ideal but rather a doomed society, like the \\"Tara\\" of Irish myth. The characters are thoroughly developed and complex. A must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, women in fiction, and American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book Ever","review":"Gone with the Wind is a wonderful book. I just finished reading it a few days ago and I was blown away.I loved and hated Scarlett .Even though the ending is heartwrenching, Scarlett took Rhett for granted and she'll get him back somehow, she always gets what wants. Up until I read this book I never realized how rough it was for the south during and after the Civil War.This is a must read, if the book doesn't interest you now, try it again later, that's what I did.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best books I have ever read","review":"I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book.

I recommend this book to anyone who likes civil war romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an great book. The character interaction, the historical sweep, everything. If you love, or even like, the movie, you should definitely read this book. There are so many things, even characters, in the book that were left out of the movie, the book fleshes everything out. I absolutely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite book!","review":"This is the best book ever written. I first read it the summer before eighth grade, and then again around February of that year. There is so much drama. I read the book before seeing the movie, but I don't think it matters what order you do them in, as long as you do both. Everyone should read and watch Gone With the Wind sometime in their life. My favorite character is Scarlett, because she changes and learns so much throughout the book. She learns that she really didn't love Ashley, and she really loved Rhett, although she realized that too late. Scarlett realized how selfish she was to marry two men she didn't love. She married Charles when he was really India's beau, and regretted it when Charles died, like what happened when she stole Frank, her sister's beau. I know I gave this book five stars, but it deserves so much more. Gone With the Wind is a must read for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"This book is captivating from the start.The characters are so real.They aren't all good and Scarlett is a horrible person.That fact only makes you like her more.The ending of this book left me wanting more.That is why I can't wait to read the sequal.Gone With The Wind is a classic and anyone who hasn't read it is missing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Better than the Movie","review":"Let yourself get lost in Atlanta with the characters of Gone With the Wind.

I read it after purchasing it, and then it went on a bookshelf. When I brought it back down to let my daughter read it, she commented that the pages were coming out, and sure enough they were. The glue in the binding has lost all of its stickiness and the pages are all completely coming out. What a HUGE disappointment after the money spent. I was better off with my paperback. Do NOT buy this format of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!","review":"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN! IT WAS PAINFUL FOR ME TO READ THIS GARBAGE!

THIS BOOK COULD HAVE ABOUT 200 PAGES AND STILL BE TOO LONG! TALK ABOUT TRIVIAL DETAIL! (The hat was emerald green, with a large bouncy ostrich plume, and wide emerald ribbons as big as Scarlett's hands. The dress was 12 yards of green sprigged muslin with only tiny puffed sleeves, it was low enough to be a dancing dress, and certainly not suitable for a morning barbecue. The dress was a green plaid tarlatan, so wide it reduced her wasit to nothingless. Oh, she'd lead that waltz with an apple-green watered-silk dress, and dark green ribbons on her bosom and white tuberroses in her hair.)

This book is a classic love story. It totally draws you in with the push-pull relationship between the main characters, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It makes you want to scream at Scarlett because she just pushes Rhett away unknowingly, and Rhett is trying to pull her into love with money and luxurious clothes. This book is a good book because the events could happen in our time, marry for money and make your selves misreable, but who knows how it could end. If you enjoy books that make you throw them down in frustration, but pick them back up again just to find out what happens next, this book is definitely good for you. If you enjoy this book or were unhappy with the ending, breeze through Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind. Gone With the Wind is an outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense and love all mixed together in a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE B-E-S-T BOOK OF ALL TIME!","review":"Gone with the Wind is the most amazing novel ever! I read it in 8th grade for a school project and was so engrossed all 1,024 pages took me just two weeks! Living in the \\"North\\", I had never really thought about how hard it was for the \\"South\\" because I assumed they brought it on themselves. This book really opened my eyes and I'm glad it did. I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could hardly put it down.","review":"It's racist and sexist, and some parts drag on a little too much, yet it made my heart flutter with delight. I love it when books make you feel like this one made me. It started off slowly, but 200 pages into it I was hooked.Scarlett, she's self absorbed and as thick as a brick, but some how loveable. Rhett, why he's condescending yet somehow so wise and sexy. And sweet Melly, while she is a goody-two-shoe, she is never annoying, quiet loveable. She has an inner strength. The characters come alive on the pages.Any book that makes me cry is a good book. Oh, and did I cry! THere were parts where I was blubering for ages. In other parts, my heart was racing and I couldn't read the page fast enough.Well, this book offically rocks my socks, and is one of my favourite books, ahead of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice. Why oh why didn't I read this earlier?!? 6/5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I agree with the hundreds...wait, millions of people over the years who've enjoyed this classic.

If you haven't read the book because you already enjoyed the movie, you are really missing a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story for the Ages","review":"The power of this narrative of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period after the war is overwhelming. Scarlett O'Hara is the centerpiece of this story from the beginning to the end. It is much more than a story of love, rivalry, and misadventure. It is all that and more. It offers the reader a portrait of the Confederacy and the candid view of life there as filtered through the eyes of Scarlett. It is Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes who represent the values of the old South and the ambition of Scarlett and the cynicsm of Rhett Butler reflect the newly emerging South of the Reconstruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It was a very loooong book but really good! Usually with long books there's always a part that drags on forever but it never felt that way with this book.

She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Printed Classic","review":"This copy is pretty much what the First Edition looked like in 1936 and it's easy to see how it got to be so big. Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to \\"reboot\\" this story... Also, don't bother with the \\"authorized\\" sequels; the story stands on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate love story.","review":"Gone With the Wind is the realization of an author's dream - to tell an American story of American attitudes in a deceptively treacherous society that became completely uprooted during an extended period of political turmoil in the United States. The characters are beautifully developed, the flavor of the period is flawlessly interwoven with the stories of the characters' lives, and we cling to each minor triumph and defeat as Mitchell works her way through this huge book. This is one book that you will want to read several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best epic ever written","review":"As the ratings show, this book is accepted by many people to be the best book ever written, and I must agree.

I was utterly and completely engrossed with this book. Mitchell did an incredible job on being very descriptive of everything. As I read I can really picture the scenery, the characters, and the war especially. Scarlet annoyed me and it was devastating how selfish, cruel, and cold hearted she was. Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down. I was interested to see on what would become of her and Rhett, and Melanie and Ashley. The ending was a tear jerker for me especially for what happened to Melanie. The author did well on creating so much depth into this novel. Don't be intimidated by the long and many pages of this book. It was worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational","review":"Gone With The Wind is a superb book. It's story is so intresting.

For starters,the album cover has the Masta himself sitting on some steps with a pen and pad.The use of colour on this picture is perfect,the picture almost talks to you!Then there are the skits! Each time I hear them, I roll on the floor in laughter.The accompanying music in the background couldn't have been more tailour made as well.I can seriously see Masta directing a film in the near future(Has he done so already?).Masta Ace flows with elegance and his narration breeds vivid images like watching your favourite film on a huge plasma screen.Every song touches different topics and the track production shadows this variation as well.The overall feel is intense,and if you are a true lover of Hip Hop,there is no way you would overlook this one! Off you go,buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This album is just about perfect. For once we have an artist focusing on making a fluid album rather then a collection of singles.

It's nice to see Ace taking a whole song for himself instead of so many featured guests like Disposable Arts. I really enjoy \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Soda & Soap\\". Soda & Soap is the most creative song (in terms of wordplay) that i've heard in recent years (and i'm a pretty knowledgable hip hop head). I was wrong to sleep on Ace in the past, but after hearing this album, he deserves to hold the title for hip hop album of the year, because its rare to find an album that has tracks you cant listen to. Fillers and skits are no problem on this album. Buy it before any g-unit or terror squad cd next time you shop. Ace Sh*ts on them. Late"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great effort","review":"This album has it's high and low points. The overly lengthy intro with the choral arrangement can get tedious. The vocals, in English, on Is My Face On Straight are weak. PFM always did better when they sang in Italian as they never quite mastered English and it made for some awkward vocals that detracted from the overall performances. The rest of this disc is terrific. There is a strong Italian classical influence while drawing from jazz and rock to create a sophisticated and complex recording.

Two of these shorts date from 1946, when Curly Howard was at the end of his career. (Very ill at the time, he struggled through these films and it shows.) RHYTHM AND WEEP is the better of the two, with the Stooges auditioning their song-and-dance act for a producer. THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS is a Western spoof that Curly just wasn't up to making.

This lotion is a good substitution for the \\"California Baby\\" skin cream that I used to use on the kids when they were infants. This is the only lotion that I'll use on my boys now..I get compliments all the time from people about their baby soft skin (they are now 2 yr & 4 yr old). Give it a try if you are looking for a \\"Natural\\" lotion to put on your kids..it's cheaper than buying a 2-oz jar of california baby cream which is between $ 13 -$14 a jar. I also use this during the winter months."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"i would not recommend this book for anyone who is intereseted in identifying the trees in the field.

I have read books of all kinds and I must say this is one that I come back to time and time again. Ms. Gillenwater develops the characters in such a way that you feel like they are your good friends. You care about what happens to each and every one of them. Unlike secular romance, Highland Call enforces good morals; but unlike many other Christian novels, the relationships are not dry and boring. The characters are Christian without being unrealistically good. They struggle with right and wrong just as each of us do. The book is well written so you can follow it easily and you don't get characters mixed up. I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone looking for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have read this book many times and it never fails to capture my attention and makes me want to travel to Scotland each time I read it.

There are English translations below, but no \\"romanji\\" (English characters). And, the translations are not word for word.

This time, Bela Lugosi is \\"Dr. Brewster\\" (yet another Anglo-Saxon name for the exotic Hungarian!), whose unholy experiments with apes have given him a face-encircling beard, a slouching gait, and a tendency to sleep in a cage with his pet gorilla. He needs fresh spinal fluid (human only, please) to restore him to normal, so many complications ensue. His only ally is his sympathetic sister (Minerva Urecal), who addresses him as \\"you poor boy!\\" (Lugosi was about 60 at the time.) The film was aparently not even intended to be taken seriously, which is its one small saving grace. Even Lugosi is not as charismatic as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monogram Mayhem","review":"Bela Lugosi makes the most of this Monogram Pictures mediocrity, directed by the immortal William \\"One Shot\\" Beaudine. \\"The Ape Man\\" (1943) remains a silly attempt at tragic horror, but Lugosi shines in the shabbiest of surroundings. There are worse ways to spend 64 minutes. Interestingly enough, Bela's apelike makeup is similar to the Sayer of the Law in \\"Island of Lost Souls\\" (1932)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bela...","review":"Quick word association. What spings to mind when you hear \\"The Ape Man\\"? Didja think Bigfoot? The neanderthal from the Geico commercials? How about the fallen stars of Bela Lugosi and Wallace Ford on full display, preserved for posterity? Because that is exactly what the appeal of this film boils down to. See the great Count reduced to knuckledragging around in furry makeup. Squirm uncomfortably as he digs the needle into his vein. Bela has such an irrepressible *presence* that even his lesser works are worth at least a look. And a depressed sigh. The print used seems to have been run over by a cement truck. And possibly drug behind it. The sound is so lousy that about half the dialogue is unintelligable.

I wish it were required reading for all healthcare professionals in the U.S.! As a Lakota, I found the book accurate and very moving. It's also one of the few books about Indigenous Tribal People written by a European-American that is truly and deeply respectful.

This book is easy to read. It explains many of the tensions among british commanders about organizing the defense. Most of the battle took place over south eastern England. All the sector commanders wanted a full complement of fighters and pilots.British aircraft were being built rapidly and reserves were available. The notion that Britain was down to a handful of pilots was untrue.The Nazis ran low on aircraft and pilots. Hitler had other projects in mind and didn't stick with the strategy of destroying the RAF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and to the point: well done.","review":"This book is not a dramatic retelling of the battle. It is concerned with what went on behind the scenes. It discusses the reasoning of the German commanders concerning an invasion of England and their plans behind the air attack. It's pretty enlightening to see how each side was pretty mistaken about what the other side thought or would do. There are quite a bit of authorities quoted for the author's premises. The newest thing to me was the fact that not all Brits pulled together about resisting the German aggression. The documentation about that reads about like the way people do now in both Britain and the U.S. This is an inside look at the entire campaign of the Battle of Britain and the events leading up to it. There are some things that were new to me and I think would be new to most readers. It's a good writing job and a good research job."},{"rating":"2","title":"African big band.

It deals with how people will respond to advertising in this century (i.e. television, print media, the Internet) and how it will effect us. My broker said this book was more important than the ones he recommended about investing. We are all consumers experiencing an incredible transition from t.v. to cable, from cable to satellite, from magazine and newspaper ads to e-mail and Internet ads?

Still, I came to know both Fischer and Spassky and the political climate at the time. Kudos to the authors for an outstanding chess history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"As an enthusiastic but less-than-expert chess player, I was grateful to Eidinow and Edmonds for a book that is serious about chess at the same time that it is both accessible and engrossing. Similarly, I admired the way that they treated the cold war resonances that for many make this \\"the match of all time,\\" exploring its impact without letting it obscure the real, human drama that they lay before us. A great book-- as enlightening as it is entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Penthouse to the Outhouse","review":"I can remember the Summer of 1972 and Fischer was a major hero. Little did we know at the time that he was a lunatic. I've read a fair amount about Fischer and his life. At a young age, he discovered chess and it consumed him right up to his winning of the world championship. His activities varied from reading chess books, to playing in chess tournaments, to giving simultaneous chess exhibitions, to practicing chess on his own, to discussing chess. To say that he was a one-dimensional person would be a gross understatement. He had the emotional maturity of about a 5 year old. In letters that he wrote, his grammar and spelling were atrocious. To hear him later in life, he sounded like a deranged mental patient off of his meds. As other reviewers have said, his chess acumen was fantastic. The sad, bigger story, however, is that he was a very flawed human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put it down","review":"really wondeful. the appendix chapter his mother is, in my opinion,even more interesting than the book. book, of course, is a fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess statesman, American patriot and just a little off the deep end.","review":"This book is well written, entertaining and a good read for anyone who loves chess and history. While I’m not a grandmaster or even a really good chess player I can appreciate what goes into the game, and I’m obsessed with Bobby Fischer and his antics over the years. While Fischer passed away in 2008, his impact on the game, politics and controversial views still enthrall millions today. This book seems to be a historical record of his life, and the “match of the century�?with the Russian chess machine. This is a book that is worth its price, well written and should keep you entertained and informed during your entire read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius is no excuse","review":"A compelling account of the 1972 world chess championship, accessible to non-chess players and of interest to students of the Cold War: the account of this match is well contextualised in the politics and culture of the time and in the biographies of the two protagonists.At the centre of the account, as repulsive as ever, is Fischer the challenger, a venial, spoilt, perpetually petulant overgrown adoloscent, unforgiveably indulged by the championship organisers in his whims and tantrums. Spassky, the reigning champion, by contrast is a more sympathetic figure, contributing to his own ultimate undoing by acquiesing too easily with the pusilamious and cowardly behaviour of the organisers.Those who do not appreciate chess may regard this story as \\"much ado about nothing\\". Those who love the game will enjoy the account and lament how an event that could have been a marvel of sportsmanship, courage and analytical thinking degenerated into such a farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow a good chess book","review":"As an ameteur chess player, I actually enjoy reading about the game and the people involved with it. However, after reading a book called, \\"The Chess Artist.\\" I was turned off from such works. Nevertheless, when I saw this book displayed on a front rack, I couldn't resist.I really flew through this book. Most of this size take me at least a month. This one took about 5 reading sessions. I suppose that is a credit to the authors. It held my interest long enough to be able to take out chapters at a time.Rather than go on and on about the moves made and chess strategy, it focused more on the personal lives of the characters, and everything surrounding the famous match. There were some parts that were somewhat boring, but for the most part it was entertaining.

I'm an experienced web developer and already know how style sheets work and how to use them - I just wanted a book where I could quickly look up specific syntax, etc.This book definitely doesn't work for that - the index is sorely lacking and the information isn't well-organized at all. So, since a lot of the other reviewers wrote that this book isn't for beginners (I agree) and, since I'm an experienced developer and it's not working for me, I'm not sure who would find this book useful. Especially when there are so many other CSS books to choose from.....Normally O'Reilly books are really good, so I'm a little bit surprised that they published this book without having an editor clean it up and organize it.

I'll be using this film to illustrate every single topic, b/c it literally is like a textbook on \\"how to make a film.\\" I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this movie made me into a lifelong fan of film-making. The question of how Kurosawa created a timeless epic out of a gang of misfit samurai takes at least a lifetime to figure out. Needless to say, most of the remakes and knockoffs of this movie pale in comparison. You can't improve on a classic. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.

Classic but not really standing well against time. The action scenes are good if you don't pay attention to the details in what seems to be a lack of skill for these Samurai. Many things are taken for granted and not explored, such as the skill of the Samurai and the plight of the farmers. I am a modern movie goer and in an attempt to see where the movies of today were spawned from, I watched this movie. I was disappointed on some levels, but impressed on others. It isn't what you think, but it still gives you something you didn't think you would find. If you think you can sit through a three and half hour movie that does not concern itself much with pace, you should watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film for anyone and everyone.","review":"This is possibly, if not THE best movie done by the master of Samurai Movies, Akira Kurosawa.

But I will point out that the film's subtitles had two of the odder translations I've come across, namely \\"sheeyit\\" and \\"mollycoddle.\\"While quite long, SEVEN SAMURAI does not test one's patience because of the humor and engaging personalities the film displays. I was surprised that I couldn't watch the film in widescreen, but that is apparently the way it was shot.No matter. It's still a great movie; anyone who enjoys its realistic, unglamorous portrayal of samurai life is strongly encouraged to watch THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and long movie","review":"I watched this movie after hearing so much hype. While I don't think it's the best movie ever, nor even Kurosawa's best, I still believe it was a pretty good movie. It's long, but the main samurai are really good characters, and the war strategy was pretty fun to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, ever. Though it is not for everyone. First, it is so long it has an intermission. And they actually do character development, so unlike blockbuster American movies, there are no explosions in the first few seconds of film. So if you actually like a good story with interesting characters and something different than a CGI-fest, check it out.Having said that, it is truly a remarkable production, story, and movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEVEN STARS FOR SEVEN SAMURAI!!!","review":"This movie gets better every time I see it. The first time I saw it I thought the fight scenes were slapstick and hilarious, not until I bought this DVD did I realize that Kurosawa was going for realism rather than typical Hollywood sensationalism. The commentary on this DVD is excellent and supplies a plethora of info on Kurosawa's life and career as well as on the impact this movie made for Japanese cinema. The picture quality is excellent, but not in the widescreen format as shown on AMC. The sound is as good as possible I suppose, considering the age of the movie, but I find listening to the commentary much more enjoyable. The subtitles are easily readable, an improvement over AMC's presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad the Japanese classics are so pricey","review":"Seven Samurai is one of the best films ever made. I've seen it several times and get a new insight each time. A new insight I had is the famous last battle the viewer actually does not see most of the bandits getting killed. A parade of empty horses convey that when they pass the three surviving samurai. The commentaries are very well done and you have to be a total geek to hear Kurosawa speak for ninty minutes in Japanese (not my language, also I'm white). However, he covers just about every main topic that I'd associate with him. I truly found his talk about surviving World War Two and discussion of Dostoevsky just fascinating.There's also a good overview of Japanese samurai films. I had a lot of fun with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"What can I say that has not already been said?

Seven Samurai does not reflect truly what a DVD is all about...which is high quality video, great sound and unique whistles and bells that are added value. True, an older movie can be discribed as a profound auteur venture for it's time, but for the quality of sound, picture and aspect ratio...I in retrospect would have been just as happy with a video and would have not worried about the video commentaries. My advice...go rent the video before deciding to purchase this one. If you're dying to see it again and again after that, (which I doubt) pick up the DVD. Sorry, in my book...if I'm not going to watch it more than 3x why pay the convenience for a classic when it has the screen resolution of a Disney flip-book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the purist.","review":"While Seven Samurai contains great acting and brave direction (not many directors would use such long pauses in dialogue and action in a movie, a style used hear to powerful affect) I found over three hours difficult to get through. The plot is a simple one, and could have been told as completely in a much shorter length film. If like me, you are a lover of film watching, rather than a lover of film making, don't expect too much from Seven Samurai."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be understood to be watched...?","review":"Watching the 'direction' in this movie, and others by this director, is like seeing the first ever 'lace-up' shoe or the first ever internal-combustion engine. You may happen to appreciate that the 'overused' ideas, employed in the film, were used there for the first time; the originality pervading the movie from beginning to end alongside gritty and convincing acting. However, it is still subject to a style of story-delivery that was original 50 years ago - that modern film watchers are jaded with.To avoid a long spiel: if you hate black and white; if long silent scenes with no music overplay; if obscured scenes and dramatic angles are not your thing, you just won't enjoy this film.

Where did the 1 hour & 2 minutes disappear to. Hopefully this is a typo. Although I've read some negetive reviews I still believe this film in it's original version is a masterpiece, not to be toyed with. I read someone saying they would prefer a dubbed version. Good luck in finding english speaking actors that can express the same emotions the original actors did. It has been my experience dubbing is far inferior to subtitle. A good example would be Mel Gibson's Road Warrior. Though Mel speaks english somebody's infinite wisdom decided he sounded to austrailian and dubbed the film. Watch both versions of this film dubbed and subtitled and you'll see what I mean. Emotions tend to get lost in the translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Since I liked The magnificent Seven, I had long for this movie for a long time. The time had come and I was totally bored. Who says this is the greatest movie and Kurosawa is the greatest movie maker? Picking up one would be very difficult but probably I will pick Godfather instead. I know there are many Kurosawa admirers but I always found his directing is kind of 'clumsy', weird pace-not smooth, over the top acting (here, esp. Mifune...a clown). I hate his black/white shooting although I love Black/White filmes. Yojimbo was the only movie I enjoyed from his movies. Too bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much praise for an outdated movie ...","review":"This movie is really good, but it's not the masterpiece people keep talking about.

Kambei agrees and assembles a group of six other samurai, and together they build a militia with the villagers while the bandits loom nearby. Soon the raids begin, culminating in a bloody battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Criterion!","review":"You have to congratulate Criterion on this one. They took a movie that isn't incredibly popular, except among perhaps movie critics, and made a great DVD out of it. For the first time in history you can watch this movie uninterrupted. AND there is an excellent commentary track. I listen to many tracks, and this is one of the best ones out there. At 3 hours, Michael Jeck doesn't stop giving out great nuggets of information. Plus there are a bunch of other extras, but they are superfluous. IMO the commentary track is the most important extra a DVD can have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Just finished watching this film and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

It's easy to see why. This is an epic in the same vien as \\"The Last Samuri\\" only it is conciderably better and lacks Tom Cruise which is a good thing. The battles and fight scenes are wonderful. The wet muddy battles looked great on a very nice DVD transfer. The picture looked pretty damn good. I usually am not a huge forien film fan, and I don't usually like subtitles but this movie was so good that non of that bothered me. If you liked The American version of this film, The Magnificent Seven' I deffinetly recomend this. An all time great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greastest samurai film of all time","review":"For anyone who is interested in samurai epics, or for those who are just looking for a enthralling story, Seven Samurai is just what you need. Akira Kurosawa was a master of his craft, and nowhere is it more evident than in this 1956 masterpiece. It's no wonder Hollywood remade this into a western in The Magnificent Seven. The story is superb, gathering a rag-tag team of ronin together to protect a helpless village from brigands. The visuals are phenominal, even considering the period in which it was produced, and the sound is great. One slight downside to this DVD is that it only comes with a mono Japanese soundtrack, so you'll have to read subtitles for three hours, but trust me, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen this movie over 25 times since 1960,","review":"and I rarely watch movies more than once. I've seen chopped versions, butchered versions, not too bad versions, and full versions. This is the full version, and every shot is needed. I see something new and worthwhile every time I watch it. It is certainly the best action movie I've ever seen, and no other action movie has ever come close (save perhaps the beginning of \\"Private Ryan\\"). It is the masterpiece of one of the world's greatest directors, and may well be the best film yet made. I know of no one who has only seen it once. You can watch it entirely as a simple action movie and be enthralled and uplifted; eventually you will see that it illuminates some important universal truths. Yes, it drags in a few places, but who would want a perfect film? This is as close as you get from a human director. People will still be enjoyoing this film a hundred years hence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring kung-fu movie","review":"Save your money and time by not watching this badly made kung-fu movie. The guys in this movie do not know martial arts at all. The story goes as follows: Some shaolin monk gets hired by some korean guys to protect their village. He recruits some other kung-fu fighters and goes to the village and kills all bandits. End of story. The fight scenes are so bad that it is laughable. I have seen movies by bruce lee and Jet Lee and they are vastly superior.

I adore A.Kurosawa's real,timeless masterpieces,but not his \\"samurai films\\" (Seven Samurai,Yojimbo,Sanjuro and Hidden Fortress),which to my mind are his weakest and the least interesting.They BY NO MEANS are on the same league with such TRUE GEMS of Kurosawa like \\"Rashomon\\",\\"High And Low\\",\\"Ikiru\\",\\"Redbeard\\",\\"Bad Sleep Well\\",\\"Throne Of Blood\\",\\"Dersu Uzala\\",\\"Ran\\".Go for these eight films - they are real cinematic treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Legendary and Lengthy","review":"Toshiro Mifune gobbles up the screen. His presence saved this movie for me. There was too much 'drama' in this movie. It took me a really long time to get invested in the characters. I found it simplistic (although that was intentional). The other thing I enjoyed was seeing the countryside. I know it's a classic but it's too long for me. It takes too long to get the samurai and bring them back, and then too long getting ready for the attack. So shoot me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overated","review":"I do believe many people give this film high marks simply because film critics say so. Speaking of overated how about Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game. Do not get me wrong I love foreign films such as The Cranes are Flying, Rififi, Germany Year Zero,and The Passion of Joan of Arc. I really tried to see what amazes and overwhelms most everyone but I guess it passed me by. An excruciatingly boring drivel with terrible acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not great","review":"I finally saw this film after hearing so much about it. It was good, but it's not THE greatest film of all. The editing seems sloppy at times, the action sequences are OK, and the audio is very bare. But then again it was made in 1954. The characters are definitely captivitating and the story is good but this is a bad transfer of a highly acclaimed film. Criterion prides itself for it's superior quality DVDs, but this transfer was poorly done. The film is drenched with scratches, black spots, dirt, burn marks and an annoying light flickering. For the price I paid, I expected a pristine copy. This Criterion is NOT worth buying.

It's long (not that it's a major problem in the first place), involves many different ideas (the dichotomy of samurai as opposed to farmers or peasants, the art of combat, and what it truly means to be honorable in a world that is anything but that), and involves many epic action sequences (such as the rain-soaked climax). Ultimately, it's a movie that works on all ends, inspiring many carbon copies, but they all pale in comparison to this brillant work. The DVD itself is not heavy on extra features, which is fine by me. The movie (along with a interesting commentary on the movie and it's creators) is padding enough to recommend this to film aficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on Every Level","review":"This movie is a classic tale. It works on every level, Characters, Plot, Settings, Storyline, the works. OK you may not understand the culture of Japan, so parts of the samurai culture may not be clearly understood. (see the MAGNIFICANT SEVEN if this is an insurmountable problem.) The movie is long and is not the non stop action sold these days. It is not meant to be. Each step is a struggle, the coming of the bandits, the decision of the villegers, the search for samurai, the interaction between them and the villagers, and that doesn't cover all of the plots involved. If you like well plotted stories this movie is for you. If you like interesting characters this movie is for you. If you like great performances then this movie is DEFINATELY for you. Give this picture a chance some rainey weekend and it will be a pleasant and memorable eyeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST movies I have ever seen!","review":"I became curious about this movie after reading the credits to the Magnificent Seven and seeing it was used as the basis for that movie.I watched the movie and before I knew it, it was over.

About as perfectly balanced as you could hope a film to be; the humourous, lighthearted aspects complement the starker, unromantic depictions of peasant existence, which in turn are meshed expertly with the adeptlt-filmed action sequences. Emotional and compelling, stylish and profound, all at once. If there were a rating above 5-stars, I'd award it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome classic!!!!","review":"This movie is beyond praise. It's one of the best ever and set the standard for so many others that have tried but can't quite duplicate it's power. I don't know what those who gave this movie a low rating are even thinking.

For any real movie fan this is a definite must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is superb.","review":"I don't know what to say that hasn't been said before, but I have to sharewhat I think about this masterpeice. One of the things I always valued about movies is the characters, and presentation of those characters. 7 Samurai is all about that. The western notion that good movies are movies with a well thought out unexpected script is not true. Here you have a movie that has a plot that can be explained in one sentense, yet it makes you sit through the whole thing in complete silence. This movie is all about emotion, and emotion has far more effect and impact than any twist and unexpected turn of a script can have. I could relate to every single of the 7 samurai, because at one or another point of my life I've embodied what they did and felt in the movie. Akira Kurosawa is one of the best directors, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Genius","review":"For all those film goers wanting to make the leap from mainstream (ie: hollywood, colour, english language, no subtitles, widescreen and of course... made in the last few years)to anything but mainstream, you really can't get better than Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai.Not to say you'll be jumping for joy and saying this is the best movie you've ever seen after your first viewing of it.... but it is the kind of movie that you will want to watch over and over again.And on each viewing you will pick up more, you will see how the simplest of stories does have so many sub stories, and you will see how the actors (including Toshiro Mifune) and Kurosawa are masters in making this story not only come to life, but at the same time tug at your heart.So take the leap, accept the subtitles, engrace all 200+ minutes of the movie and I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have tried watching this film several times and have never been able to get through it due to boredom.

Scott plays the marshall with an interesting mix of pragmatism, morality and machismo, each of which pulls him in separate directions; a charismatic actor who is often underrated by film historians, Scott is at his best here, projecting the sheer physicality one imagines a border lawman would have to have possessed back in them days. Fun stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Errol","review":"If you're an Errol FLynn fan let me warn you, Flynn hardly ever even gets to touch a sword in this film!

Such a man must be insane. John Brown was a religious zealot. Who believed serving God was man's ultimate purpose. That meant God before family members. That meant training his children to give up their lives so other men may become free.This movie depicts Mr. Brown as a mad man. The Earl Flynn character says he is against one man taking the law into his own hand. Yet he is depicting Jeb Stuart who joined the Confederate Army who were in open rebellion against the United States of America, because he did not like the election result. In support of nullification of a National election. I will take John Brown's treason over Jeb Stuart's anyday. This movie is sympathetic to one of the worst causes ever fought."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange strange fruit","review":"A truly strange movie...slavery is ok, and the South will \\"sort it out\\" in good time.

Massey's masterful acting shows both sides of Brown - heroic emancipator and vicious cutthroat - alternating from one personality to the other with perfection. Historic figures including Jefferson Davis, JEB Stuart (Flynn) and Robert E. Lee appear as friends who will later become enemies with George A.

Recently my friend came to visit America, and while he was here I pulled out my copy of this book to see what he thought. While many of the terms were accurate, there were a significant number of entries that were outdated, completely off the mark, or close but not quite applied correctly. I handed my friend a red pen and he proceeded to rewrite some entries. He commented several times that the author \\"must have never been to England or spoken with actual English people\\" as there were so many phrases with inaccurate UK definitions or usages.We did like the pronounciation comparison charts, though, and had a good time saying each of the words and comparing pronounciations.

Many of the phrases, expressions and translations offered are somewhat antiquated and dated. The section of this book providing most humour is where the authour offers advice to Britons in America, and what common British expressions we should not say whilst in the States.

The words are separated into arbitrary categories, and there is no overall index, so it is impossible to find any particular term without scanning many pages. The text also suffers from badly designed tables and amateur typography; for example, the author uses ALL CAPS both for ACRONYMS as well as TRADEMARKS (instead of simply including the \\"tm\\" symbol); the overall effect is just as irritating as in this sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a stitch!","review":"Davies has the British American differences all sewn up in \\"Divided by a Common Language\\".

Everything seems like it's inverted and moving in slow motion. If a book were ever measured by its weight, then Stones of Summer would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, you may want to read the book. Once you open it and try to sit down to enjoy it, you realize you are not reading a masterpiece, but instead a long-winded, boring tale about characters that you really could care less about. I really want to meet the person who has read this all the way to the end. He/she probably also competes in \\"iron man\\" triathalons and peruses the tax code for pleasure. The most torturous element of the book is the collection of wholly unlikeable characters. By the middle of the book I didn't care what happened to any of them - in fact I would have liked the book more if they had all died in a fiery car crash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down the Rabbit Hole","review":"I'll keep it short, because most everything has already been said. The book absolutely dominated my attention for a week or two. The alienated Midwest upbringing, the almost violent rebellions (usually for no real reason)-- it all rang perfectly true. That's the first half of the novel.Then came Dow's person saga: his real-life descent into madness. Via the book, I felt each dip and swerve as Dow Mossman's life unraveled. This is the only chronicle of schizophrenia worth reading that I'm aware of.So why 4-star instead of 5-star on the review?

On a scale of 1-5, it gets one banana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past word choices","review":"Okay...I have not been able to finish this book. Some of the author's choices of words are somewhat suspect. In the very first paragraph, he claims that \\"the conversations inside the car were like great wood eyes\\". How in the sweet Spanish Jesus can a conversation be like a great wood eye? This edition should come with a sheet of LSD, then maybe I could begin to grasp some of the concepts.

After a struggle of over ten months I finally finished the sprawling and increasingly incoherent story and must admit I'm mystified. Entire paragraphs were completely incomprehensible, with mixed metaphors and comparisons meant to paint a portrait of images and feelings that left me without even a murky idea of what was intended by them. Certainly not worth the time to read, or the $14 I paid for it (which, frankly, is the only reason I felt compelled to finish it). I dislike saying anything so negative, but I'd like to save someone else the pain of feeling invested in finishing over 500 pages of this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there's no \\"zero stars\\"!","review":"I think the review from \\"island girl\\" in Concord, MA says it all.

Like any other cult, they hold certain beliefs that make perfect sense to them, yet strike the uninitiated as, shall we say, nuts. The author, Dow Mossman, was once asked why the protangonist was missing his hair and several other useful things. Mr. Mossman replied, \\"Because everything is lost.\\" If this strikes you as a pearl of Zarathustrian wisdom, I suppose these 560 pages of \\"oceanic\\" prose, ebbing and flowing away with a charmingly disregard for such stodgy concerns as structure and narrative momentum, just might be your meat.

Stones of Summer is a mudhouse of verbiage that collapses under its own pretentious weight. By the end of the book I felt sorry for the poor author, Dow Mossman.A note on the documentary:I originally gave Stone Reader a positive review on amazon.com despite reservations about the director's dubious 'search' for Mossman and his annoying attempts to upstage the publishing people he interviews. What changed my mind was a recent newspaper story about how he sent our thousands of e-mails begging others to leave favorable reviews at amazon.com, even if they had never seen the movie.

The bad news is that it is not very good. It is the graduate thesis of a Creative Writing student at a Midwestern college. The pity is that the student is not as promising as we have been led to believe. Whoever compared Stones to Stop-Time has obviously not read Frank Conroy's memoir very closely. Stop-Time was understated and lyrical. This bag of showoffy tricks is overstated and hamfisted.

You need to take magic mushrooms to grasp the pseudo profundities of this novel. Unfortunately I don't have any handy. The book is really maddening. It has no structure and no point other than the writer eventually goes nuts, probably because he's tried to rereard the novel himself and realized the hopelessness of it all.

The guy may have had potential at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since he was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: \\"No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.\\" True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so.

The language in these poems is neither dazzling nor surprising, but one can sense that the poet is dedicated to the cause of poetry. The imitations function well as tributes, if not as full-developed poems.I do wonder why the reviewer below would waste fifteen minutes writing a review of someone else's review. That to me seems ridiculous. The poet doesn't need anyone to defend her work. Any new book of poetry is a good thing. This book is fairly inoffensive if not unremarkable.

The problem here is that the vocabulary used here is beyond many readers. While that is fine when such words are required to convey meaning, here they seem to be used just for the sake of using them. They get in the way and obstruct the reading and meaning unnecessarily.The book also presents appreciation of small things as being superior to appreciating other things yet the argument is not backed up with any rationale. For that I find this book to be a bit shallow.

By following the history of tea and its role in the spiritual and cultural development of Japan, this slim volume gives the reader remarkable insight into the Japanese mind. Written with a keen sense of humor, the Book of Tea is very readable and entertaining, while at the same time illustrating the Japanese passion for the simple.

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Japan, Buddhism, Taoism, or tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Enjoyable","review":"Okakura' small distillation of 'Teaism' is really a survey of Eastern philosophy. He points to Zen and Taoism as the foundational ways of thinking that anchor this idea called Teaism. There are brilliant moments of insight in this small and curious book, with many true assessments of the West's shifting perceptions of Eastern civilization. I am reminded of the late Heidegger's philosophy (and indeed Heidegger read 'The Book of Tea), particularly in essays such as 'The Thing' which point out the significance of our everyday objects and their intimate relationship to world and culture. This book is truly a small treasure of Eastern thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I anticipated judging by the title.","review":"This book was nothing like what I expected, but I read it to the end just out of sheer stubbornness.I expected more of a history and evolution of the tea product but the book was all about the [highly opinionated] mentality, mysticism and ritual surrounding the use of tea through history.If this is what you're looking for, go for it.If you are looking for more information regarding the tea plant, you'll be better served looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I found this book so boring I can't believe anyone would write about such a BORING subject and I love tea!

This time, Archer falls in love and self-interest actually hinders him from being the moral center of the novel. What keeps the pace of the novel flowing is the theme of a man condemned by society and Archer's efforts to prove his innocence. There is also plenty of bloodshed, betrayals, and enough plot twists to keep the conclusion a surprise. In spite of the tragic turn the story takes there is the redemption for Archer who makes up for his own dreadful mistake in the past. It explains a great deal about Archer, his motivation and his maturity which grows in later Ross Macdonald novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Military Male bonding stories","review":"I am one of the writers, Gysgt Steve Aldea, and My Experiences in the Marine Corps with Sailors have been true in all of the past three books.Marine Biology, Basic Training and Macho Marines tells it all about what goes on behind closed doors when the military is not snooping between the bed sheets of men in the Military.

Steinbeck is a master at developing characters so well that you think you actually know them personally half-way through the story. This is the tale of multiple families, from all over the country, who end up in the Salinas Valley. Their reasons for settling there vary from honorable to despicable. Steinbeck's storyline mimics the one of Cain and Abel throught he lives of brothers in the book on the Trask side. There are other families and characters that add a richness to the environment as well, such as the Hamiltons, Abra, and Lee the faithful servant. As you follow the lives of the Hamiltons and Trasks, you can't help but wonder if any of this kind of thing really took place back then. I learned alot about farming and days when automobiles weren't around. It was a great read, and an unexpected surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of Eden grabs your attention","review":"East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story. It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California. East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other. Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good. Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of Eden is deep reading","review":"East of Eden is a philosophical investigation into the human mental condition, emphasizing greatly the struggle between good and evil. It explores the complexities of such varied themes as depression, lonesomeness, hate (from Cain and Abel), and of course, love. But one should read this novel with a proverbial ¡grain of salt¡. Steinbeck will sometimes replace character development with his own analysis, much as a historian would look upon past events. For example, he begins a paragraph with ¡When I said Cathy was a monster¡.¡ To the reader, this may be an emotional anticlimax to the plot; it gives the tales a feeling of redundancy. Why not let the stories speak for themselves? It may be that Steinbeck is teaching us something with this novel, something important, something life changing C Timshel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking book - a true classic!","review":"It has been twenty or, sadly, maybe thirty years ago since I've read a Steinbeck. A couple of books that I passed on at that time were 'East of Eden' and 'The Grapes of Wrath'. In 'East of Eden' Steinbeck still amazes me with the depth of his characters, and the intricasies of their relationships with each other. If an award was given for 'best supporting character', I would vote for Samuel Hamilton! His simple joy of life and home-spun wisdom are an interesting contrast with the chronically, evil Kate.

It's also complicated, multi-faceted, and requires patience and understanding to get through.

But, after 35 years, I bought and read the new Oprah-recommended book, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it, particularly because of the vivid descriptions of early 20th Century-era Salinas, California, which is close to where I live. Steinbeck is a very talented writer. Because he was born in the early 1900s, he had a good feel for that era, and even gives an interesting insight into 19th century America with his descriptions of the childhoods Adam and Charles Trask, and their father. If you are ever in Salinas, be sure to check out the Steinbeck Museum on Main Street. Also, after reading this book, you might want to also read Steinbeck's depression-era masterpiece, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and check out the 1939 John Ford movie starring Henry Fonda. Steinbeck did a lot of screenwriting in Hollywood, and had a hand in the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" script, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful American Novel","review":"I have read all of Steinbeck's books and have taught most of them in my classes.

I am a man of forty, and I literally wept at the wonder of this novel. To see that others have the same thoughts, feelings, yearnings as myself even from a half century ago is stunning. I didn't want this book to end because I had become part of the family, and you never want the family to end. It amazes me how Steinbeck can write deeply, but his writing is readable. He really just sucks you into his world, you feel as though you are there around the table, discussing the Hebrew word, looking out the house into the valley, or staring at the house where the \\"circus\\" is going on. I enjoy many other authors, but I can't think of any that can draw you into their world as completely as John Steinbeck, and East of Eden, to me, is the apex of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This is one book that I picked up to read over my vacation at the beach. I finished it before we even got to the beach. I knew I liked Steinbeck, but I had never heard of this one before (unlike The Grapes Of Wrath, Of Mice And Men, etc.) Boy, am I glad I picked it up! At the part where Adam Trask goes to his wife's whorehouse to finally face her, and comes out triumphant, I had to stop reading and let out a shout of victory. This book also made me cry, laugh, get angry and sad. It's one of the few books I have read that has made me feel so many different emotions. To any of you who have read the book already, Timshel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've ever read","review":"The length of the book is long, but I didn't mind AT ALL. When I finished reading it, I hadn't wanted it to end. I wanted to keep along with the Trasks, and the Hamiltons. I wanted to see what became of Caleb and Abra and Lee. The Characters were great, and did not want to leave them. This book has some of the most dynamic characters. Each character had a very important part in the book. I believe that character and symbolism were the most dominant elements to this book. Steinbeck's imagination created a group of great 3-dimensional characters that you didn't want to leave. I liked diging down into the characters, and analyzing their symbolism... Sam Hamilton got me the most by far... and Cathy. The surprises kept me reading, and there were times when I couldn't put it down. Great Great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting classic","review":"Very slow starting but I found myself wanting to continue about 25% of the way through. I enjoyed his analysis of life through the various characters. Great development and depth of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unconventional masterpiece of its time","review":"I was really impressed by the characters and themes that Steinbeck drew and tackled in this novel. I was blown away especially by the character of Lee since he plays such an important role in the novel and he's Chinese. At the time of the novel and its publication, I could not think of characters in novels or in film where minorities were not caricatures or stereotypically portrayed, so I was really surprised to find Lee so well drawn out. He was such a significant moral force in the story.I've read Steinbeck's other work and this is his masterpiece. For 600 pages, you get to live with these characters and it's sad when the book ends. The only thing to do is to reread and it's definitely one of those books worth rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will become part of their family!","review":"This is such a special story, one that I never get sick of reading. Steinbeck paints such a vivid picture of the characters that I actually became attached to them. Of all the stories I have read I have never become so distraught at the death of certain characters as I have with this book. The characters are so life-like and you are sure to be able to relate with them, and even know people like them (especially Cathy). Please read this classic, if you do you the characters will become old friends (and enemies) of yours and it will seem as if you are part of their family."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of Eden","review":"Another Steinbeck classic! I have never been disappointed with a Steinbeck novel and this was no exception. Beautifully written and just flows so easily. It is quite lengthy and VERY descriptive but it wouldn't be true Steinbeck if it were not. Well worth the time for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good middle school read","review":"When I was in middle school, I read Steinbeck voraciously. I cried at the end of Of Mice And Men to the point of total embarrasement. I blinked hard at The Pearl and wanted a Red Pony. Little did I know, that ten years later I would pick up East of Eden and discover (to my shock!) that Steibeck, though a good story teller, was a terrible writer. Lord knows intelligent people will disagree with me on this one, but I found East of Eden to be trite, oversimplified, and downright silly at about every turn. I'm sorry to say that my Steinbeck days are now officially behind me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ludicrous pot-boiler","review":"\\"East of Eden\\" appeals to the unthinking reader like few so-called \\"classics\\" out there. The characters are either very, very bad or very, very good; everyone talks portentiously; readers are given to understand that Steinbeck means to teach us Important Lessons. But there's really nothing to be learned from Steinbeck's black-and-white world; his novel has no connection to reality as we know it. \\"East of Eden\\" belongs in the \\"must to avoid\\" category; do yourself a favor and, if you insist on having a basic understanding of this book, wait until your children are reading it in high school and get yourself the Cliff Notes. I promise you won't miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weaker sense of direction than a drunken cow in the fog.","review":"With this calamitous effort, John Steinbeck makes an effort to create an epic masterpiece. Unfortunately, his brushstrokes grow too large, and the panorama that results has too broad a scope. The book loses its focus in its ramblings, and, consequently, its significance. In the early pages you'll meet some characters who are possibly the most irritating, two dimensional elements in any work of fiction since The Scarlet Letter. However, this doesn't matter because Stienbeck will dump most of these characters in no time. Most of the characters live on farms except for the whores and the others. I personally don't live on a farm and am feeling somewhat depressed about it. Now look at that last section(From In the early pages to depressed about it.). It went absolutely nowhere. If you can find some way to stretch that little bit to the length of East of Eden then you'll have your very own masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrendous novel","review":"I was surprised that this book was written by Steinbeck. For high school, I had to read this book during the summer and I had to put it down in the first few chapters. It didn't seem real and Cathy (the main women character) is so cold and evil. It is a dark novel that will make you cringe and throw up-well that's how I felt. The novel shows the worst in people through the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious reading","review":"whats all the hype about this voluminous novel that says absolutely nothing. It was hard reading--too many characters--two many families-and -insignificant families ,as well , to the plot. It was a waste of my precious time.Is it because it is Steinback's work that this material got praised. No fair-the book was not worthy. The message was scanty if their even was a message or plot. The writing itself was not worth mentioning . An outstanding author he is not (in my opinion). No more Steinback for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"In spite of all the good reviews raving about this masterpiece, I don't like it and I'm not going to struggle with it anymore. If it does get interesting, I'll never know as I'm not going to continue. It was painful reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"JDPariser knows exactly what he's talking about here","review":"Rarely have I encountered a review on Amazon that so completely describes me reaction to a book (or record) as JDPariser's review of this alleged \\"masterpiece\\". Quite simply, this is the single most over-rated novel in the canon of American literature. Let's face it; all of Steinbeck's novels are actually pretty bad. It's a miracle that he won any literary awards, let alone the Nobel Prize for Literature. The fact that Steinbeck's work so easily lends itself to animation (see the Warner Bros. cartoons inspired by \\"Of Mice and Men\\"), gives you a hint of the complexity of Steinbeck's characterizations. Unfortunately, \\"East of Eden\\" lacks the excitement or interest to make a good cartoon. A must to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring book","review":"Why is this a bad choice for anyone looking for lesiure reading? First, it is incredibly long, around 600 pages if I remember correct. Second, it is very difficult to follow due to the number of characters involved and number of plots going on. Third, and most importantly, it is incredibly boring. This book is completely uninteresting and turning the pages becomes more of chore than a pleasure.If memory serves, this book was to be Steinbeck's crowning jewel. Thus, it comes off as contrived and, as with all things overly planned, too complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Steinbeck's Best","review":"It's a shame that Oprah chose this of all Steinbeck's novels to resuscitate her book club. 'East of Eden' is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's worst.This was Steinbeck's bid to enter the lofty realms of the 'serious' author. So it is predictably bleak and angst-ridden, its characters constantly mired in futility and frustration.How different from the far sunnier (and more distinctive) novels, 'Tortilla Flat' and 'Cannery Row' and 'Sweet Thursday' -- any of which would have been a more agreeable choice.....This is as close as Steinbeck comes to one of those potboiler sagas that just seem to go on and on and on, grinding through decade upon decade, and generation upon generation.Pick anything else by Steinbeck.Anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels I&#65533;ve ever read","review":"I am NOT - repeat - NOT a reader. But I've just discovered 2 books that knocked my socks off. One fiction; one non-fiction. The non-fiction, Make Every Girl Want You, showed me how women want to be treated; the fiction book, East of Eden, was BETTER than Of Mice & Men & Grapes of Wrath. Although maybe that's because I was FORCED to read the others back in high school! I loved the biblical references throughout this piece of art. It takes place between the Civil War & World War I, & features 2 sets of brothers. I guess I can really relate to this because I have 2 brothers, I we have gone through similar circumstances (although, luckily, in times of peace, not war). Anyway, great read - Kudos to Oprah. I couldn't put it down, & I'm not typically one to read novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who loving writing","review":"I admit I am only 1/3 of the way through this book, but I have been so impressed with the depth of the writing, the color of the language and the art in play. While Steinbeck clearly is painting with broad brush strokes, and presents a simplified and overplayed image of woman as source of destruction/evil, I still find myself drawn in by the story and the substance of the book thus far. A good choice to kick off Oprah's Book Club again, if only to see a promising, flawed, and complex piece of fiction receive a wide audience. Kudos to her for bringing a work like this to the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Read but no direction","review":"I enjoyed reading the book but I after reading it I felt as though the book had no point. There was no story or direction in the book. After finishing it, I didn't have any thoughts on life or feel as though I was entertained. There was so much action in the beginning but the storyline seemed to stall in the middle and come to no real conclusion. The book is missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"It is surprising that so many people seem to love this book. I found it drifted from place to place and ended up feeling like a bad soap opera. The layers of analogy and metaphor wash over you as you go through it. Probably a good beach book but if you have other things you are interested in they will likely be more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck at his Best","review":"This is by far my favorite Steinbeck novel. This is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of American literature. I enjoyed every word. I read it over and over again to enjoy Steinbeck's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible","review":"Long before Oprah and her book club, I was a kid in school and ran out of books to read. My Mom had the whole collection and I grumbled at the plain dictionary-type covers. Little did I know that I was about to read a collection of the most magical author I've ever known. East of Eden is something that you can only experience yourself. It's my favourite out of all Steinbeck's novels (and there isn't one bad Steinbeck book that's not good). I recommend this to you, your family, your friends, your children. I think everyone should read this book once in their lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the steinbeck you read in highschool","review":"I literally could not put this down. Loose biblical parables have been around forever in literature, but what makes this so great is that it never just cops out by reducing down to one. Maybe the characters are fated or whatever, but they're also among the strongest characters he's written. Who wouldn't want to sit down for a beer with someone like Sam Hamilton or Lee? Who wouldn't want to claw out Cathy Ames's eyes? Who wouldn't want to offer some kind of reassurance to someone like Caleb Trask? A lot of sprawling, multi-generational family novels tend to collapse under their own weight, but Steinbeck is able to ground his so thoroughly in the regional sensibilities and culture of turn of the century California that you never loose a sense of what's happening or why it matters. Forget the Joads and forget George and Lennie, this is the Steinbeck book everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah? Who knew?","review":"A fantasic novel with enough twists, turns, descent, heart ache and mental anguish to entrain even the average 21st Centruy reader.I have always enjoyed Steinbeck and after completing \\"East of Eden\\" I truly believe that he is one of, if not the quintessential American author. As accomplished as Hemmingway and Salinger are, Steinbeck has a gift for relating to the most common-place among us. His descriptive talents are unmatched and his flair for the dramatic is remarkable.If you have a few days and are in the market for a fantastic novel by one of our contry's finest authors I must suggest \\"East of Eden.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"This book is my all time favorite and I see myself rereading it in the future many more times - there is simply so much to learn from it!The writing is beautiful in its simplicity and meaning. There are various story lines that initially seem unrelated yet converge together like streams into a river. The description of the surroundings is so eloquent and makes you feel like you are right there in California. The plot can essentially be boiled down to good vs. evil. You can read the other reviews for more informative plot synopsis. Essentially you just NEED to get this book, sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"This book is amazing. I read it in school and I usually hate the books we read but this book is truly amazing. I loved every word of it. It is funny, sad, and intense all at the same time. This book may seem big and intimidating but it is a fast read and definately worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story of good and evil personified","review":"\\"I enjoyed this American classic by Steinbeck - complex story with many characters and stories interwined, in a tale of good and evil literally personified. I found the story a bit overloaded with parallels to the story of Cain and Abel, particularly the naming of various characters, but, overall, a very enjoyable read, making me want to read more Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books","review":"I recently reread East of Eden. The first time I read it, I thought it was powerful, the second specatcularly powerful. The timeless issues in this book, Cain v. Abel, father and children, knowledge and its pursuit, and of course the concept of pursuing one's own destiny reverberate through each chapter. Whether dealing with Charles and Adam, Lee, Kathy, Caleb and Aron or Samuel and the Hamiltons, the book raises so many questions worth pondering and discussing. I would add this is one of the great book club books. Anybody with a love of thought should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"I loved this book! Since other reviewers already made comments with which I agree, I won't go into details. If you like your books to have meaning and importance in them, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever...","review":"All I can say this is the best book I ever read in my life. \\"Gone with the Wind\\" used to be my favorite, but \\"East of Eden\\" is now my new favorite. It's a long book, but it is well worth the time. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top ten book for your reading career.","review":"This book could not have been written in 1952. It is too sexy, too vibrant, too....awesome, but it was, and you should read it and add it to your top ten collection of best books ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"I was never an avid reader of the Bible but this classic rendition of the old book's makes me want to sit down and read over the original stories again and again. Steinbeck achieves greatness through his tale of two families whose fates are intertwined and destinies preordained by the Bible itself.Although the chapter organization seemed jumbled as if the chapters were somehow mixed in a strange order,however, the sheer insight emanating from Lee and Samuel Hamilton always made me hungry for more.The lack of character development in Cathy (or Kate) is somewhat frustrating as it lead me to question why she kept reverting back to her previous ways when she's better off leaving them behind but she proves to be critical to the forced development of the weakened Adam Trask and also aids critically in the joining of the Hamiltons and the Trasks.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's guaranteed that East of Eden will move you and maybe even change your outlook on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the book - as for Oprah.....","review":"I love this book - but I feel a certain shame about the Oprah book club logo. This book stands as a masterpiece without any endorsements from a pop icon (fad if you will). For someone like Oprah to vainly attatch her name to piece of art is kind of like blasphemy (though oddly enough I don't consider myself religous). Does anyone else out there think it is distasteful to attatch your name to a classic and sell it around the world -as if the book wasn't capable of communicating on its own? Steinbeck is a great author - and he is not to be insulted by this horrid oprah book club logo - restore his works properly like any respectable artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"East Of Eden","review":"Steinbeck incorporates a number of biblical themes in his novel, East Of Eden. I strongly recommend readers to have an affirmative grasp on the Bible before reading the novel. It was not until my friend mentioned some major themes of the Bible that I fully understand the Steinbeck's intentions. The themes that prevail in this novel are family values, free will, and the ultimate choice of good vs. evil. Note: the reader can understand the novel without a strong biblical background, but one will gain so much more if one is able to incorporate the novel's themes with that of the bible. Biblical themes set aside; the plot of the novel is entirely captivating. The binds of brotherhood and family are constantly tested and the reader is able to witness firsthand how important personal values contribute to one's success in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story!","review":"This is one of those books that you long to get back to when you're at work or grocery shopping or wherever! The characters are well-developed and stay with you long after you finish it. I was saddened that the book just didn't go on and on. One of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, complictated about religion, not religious","review":"A book that teach es us how to live. Discusses religion without bein religious. Shows us characters and their spirit without being pathetic. Trully one of the best ever. As I said in others, the only words to describe it are the words in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Homer?..... epic in scale and ambition","review":"Magnificent! One of the best narrative tales in American literary history. Hope, abandonment,impassioned love, pure evil, friendship, loss...and above all the search for reason are unusually well embodied in this special book. I kept thinking that the old adage,\\"they just don't write 'em the way they used to\\" is absolutely on display here. And I'm not sure even with all the writing talent that is out there that it would be possible to write this kind of book today - the moralizing and questioning is vintage mid 20th century. Wonderful author, wonderful book, wonderful residual memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read","review":"Simply put, this book so clearly touches upon what it is to be human and the many trials and joys of our human existence that I dare say it has few rivals in the world of literature. If you have not read it, don't be intimidated by all the rave reviews, just open it up and read it. If you don't agree, you will still have had the pleasure of knowing intimately the wonderful characters of Steinbecks East of Eden as if they were your own extended family, a truely great gift from such a talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic","review":"Great novel, emblematic of Steinbeck's story-writing, including thematic spacer chapters. Classic novel that really gets at the heart of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of Eden -- A Masterpiece","review":"The summary on the back of the book will tell you that thisis a novel about the relationships between brothers. If youread the author's dedication, however, you will come to understand thatthis book is Steinbeck's life's work and, as such, deals with the subjectthat he held most dear. It is a book about man's concience; agreat book -- one of the greatest I have read, and its epic storylineis filled with wonderful characters and constant action.The story transcends three generations, the breadth of the countryand several families and explores its characters and their actionsas only Steinbeck can. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Steinbeck I've read!","review":"When I first picked up East of Eden, I was not sure that I would enjoy it. The first 40 or so pages did not hold my attention, but it seems that once I turned to page 41, I was HOOKED and could not put the large novel down until it was done.The stories of the Hamiltons and Trasks intersect so beautifully and Lee's character is one that I will probably remember forever. So many of his observations about Americans and California are ones that were true in the 1900s and continue to ring true a century later. I highlighted many passages in this book as ones that I won't forget and would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I find it hard to read a book whose characters I have not respect for.

I have to admit, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around. And it is not as good as \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Still, even though it is not Steinbeck's best, it is better than most books I have read in my life (were this by any other author, it probably would have gotten five stars). I thought the story was captivating, and I didn't want to stop reading. I just loved the characters, even though they are a bit one-dimensional. The book often alludes to the Bible, but don't worry about missing the hidden themes, Steinbeck lays them all out in the open. If I have one major complaint, it would be that the ending lacked drama. Other than that, this is Steinbeck at his near best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my Life","review":"It was three years ago when I picked up this book for a way to pass the cold winter days in Virginia. Having come from a dysfunctional family, and fearing that I would be doomed to repeat the past of my family and after fearing that my mother would someday awaken within me, this book changed my life and my perspective on life and how I see it. It is the summation of many philoshical viewpoints on God and self-determination all rolled into one story. The story does take a while to pick up, but I am glad that I stuck with it. Anyone who sticks through it and allows Steinbeck to flesh out the meaning of his novel will be pleased with the end-result. It is a great lesson/message for anyone who has had difficult people in their families (who hasn't?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"east of eden","review":"Terrific!

They all (Adam, Catherine, Lee, Sam Hamilton) have very exaggerated traits that bring out all sorts of facets of humanity. Innocence, evil, rash, thoughtful, acceptance, love, hate--to me, each character seemed to explore one (or more) of those. I felt like I was playing in somebody's head as he went through life.Couple that with the vivid, gorgeous writing, the scenery that Steinbeck evokes of Salinas, and you've got a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My words can't describe it.","review":"Books like this show the reason that John Steinbeck is considered one of the great authors of our lifetime.

I have tended to not buy them even though I have a huge Star Trek book collection. I am a ST:TNG fan and do not enjoy reading the other series books as much. It seems like the publisher is trying to force me to read them in order to make sense of any single title.I understand the marketing strategies here but I wish there were more stand alone titles in any single Trek series. Making me wait 6-8 months for a new title leaves me looking for other types of reading material and not Trek.This book is okay but is a little to confusing for most of us.

Between the two, most of the Gateways story is told, prior to the conclusion in book 7 and you will definitely want to read the conclusion. If you like a series, read these two for sure.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. In Tuscon, they've hooked up with Joey Burns and John Convertino (the braintrust of the amazing Calexico), both of whom guest on Wavelab Performance. There is much about this album that reminds of the desert southwest sound perfected by Calexico, and yet there sneaks in a hint of Euro-ness that makes their sound unique. The guitars can offer fuzztones and feedback while the drums pound frenetically, and yet there isn't the sense that the music is directionless. The vocals are spare and the lyrics won't likely win any poetry contests, but in this context, they work. This may not be the kind of music that stays in the cd player for weeks on end, but it is a refreshing change of pace.And if nothing else, it hints at what may come from the forthcoming formal Calexico/Amor Belhom Duo collaboration entitled \\"Tete A Tete\\". That should be one interesting release."},{"rating":"2","title":"comprehensive, educational nutrition book for women","review":"This book is very practical and handy.

I am glad i brought this dvd because when i found out that this was out, i was searching for a long time including going from store to store and had no choice but to buy it online.

It does not tackle movies that do not have to do with the story like Halloween 5 which did not have Michael Myers at all and a little known fact was not even created by John Carpenter but rather George Romero. It explores all aspects of all films that really left their Mark on the Halloween franchise, with amazing features previously unavailable in sets especialy accept for this one I do not know of another box set that even exists of this amazing collection. A must for anyone who is a die hard fan or has a friend or relative that is a die hard fan.

No horror movie is good without good music. The music in Halloween is the key for making it scary. John Carpenter does the whole score himself. And the dvd is totally remastered. Halloween's opening 5 minutes have been said to be the scariest shots ever to be made. Watch it in both widescreen and full screen. Halloween has good acting from scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Don't think this movie is scary watch it at night with the lights off."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best Horror movie ever!!!","review":"This is my favriote movie ever!!!!!!!!!

Halloween like Psycho has a believible storyline where both characters could really exist. It wasn't until after the first film where Michael gets shot about a hundred times and still lives that the character isn't plauseable anymore. But, the pure terror that is given off by this faceless killer relentlessly stalking his victim is chilling, that when you leave the theater and get in your car to go home, you have to check the back seat to make sure Michael isn't there. Now that's what I call scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing movie","review":"Don't even bother with this disc. Its a joke, a complete and utter joke!! I saw this at my local electronics outlet along with the theatrical version. Both released by the same company. Yet for some reason the theatrical DVD comes with a whole bunch of great features and video and audio remastering while this \\"extended\\" disc is in 2 channel Dolby and comes with no extras. Bah! While the extra scenes added to the original are nice, they're not spectacular. (For those who don't know, the TV network standards required cuts to be made in the movie, the movie would be under time, so Debra Hill and the crew making Halloween 2 spent 3 days shooting additional scenes for the TV Version.) There's really only one scene that stands out - Loomis goes to Myers psych ward room to find \\"Sister\\" carved on the door. There, now go buy the theatrical disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, scary, it doesn't get any better than this!","review":"Let me just begin by saying that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. While it doesn't exactly have the greatest acting or any special effects, it just has a really fresh feeling to it. For the most part, every horror movie after it borrowed elements from it. From the infamous \\"walking withyour back turned only to run into someone and get a quick scare\\" right down to the \\"hurry up and get in the door, he's right behind you!!\\" John Carpenter did an excellent job of directing this movie. A classic any way you look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween set the standard for modern day slasher films.","review":"John Carpenter's Halloween was the most successful independent horror movie of all time. The cast was absolutely perfect. Donald Pleasance was convincing as the paranoid Dr. Loomis, and Jamie Lee Curtis began her film career starring in this instant classic. Even though parts 4-6 were nothing more than tireless retreads of the Michael Meyers story, this a must see for any movie fan. The spine tingling theme music will forever be embedded in the minds of people who see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Night He ..Kept..

But, I do need to tell you about the fantastic Blu Ray edition of this film. The sound is great, and the picture quality is unbelievable. The high def picture of this old film is astonishing.

The transfer has been altered, with blues and oranges washed out. Along with that, it is the theatrical version of the film. Nit picking maybe, but you would think a 25th anniversary edition would have warrented the film being presented in its full glory.The bonus features are basically the only reason to buy this DVD.

And, yes, i probably own it in practically every format. But this version really packs a punch. It is really spectacular to see the crisp images from such a gritty film. You would never know this movie is now 30 years old by the Blu-ray transfer. The only element that was somewhat disappointing is that I noticed the audio dropping out occasionally, probably due to imperfections from the original mono source. Otherwise, you will find new details in this film that you never noticed before on this great hi-def version!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!!!","review":"THIS IS IT!!!!

THE SPOOKIEST PART OF THIS FILM, BESIDES THE CLASSIC SCORE BY DIRECTOR JOHN CARPENTER, IS A SILENT KILLER IN A SNOW WHITE MASK WITH A SHOCK OF HAIR AND ALMOST NON-EXISTENT EYES. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THIS FILM, THEN THIS IS THE EDITION YOU WANT. IT HAS ALMOST EVERY IMAGINABLE GOODIE YOU COULD WANT. THE ONLY THING LACKING IS THE HALLOWEEN DOCUMENTARY FEATURED ON THE RESTORED VHS WITH THE HOLOGRAPHIC COVER.

This film has basically not one drop of blood, but it does not need it.

BOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HALLOWEEN- THE SLASHER MOVIE THAT TERRIFIED A NATION","review":"Penned by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in 1978 neither writer would never have realises how famous this slasher flick would become. To date several sequels have been added to its original, which are not half bad to say the least. Enough about that it is time to review Halloween in detail. This film to be quite honest, scared the wits out of me. Michael Myers, institutionalized for the murder of his sister escapes 15 years later. His doctor (played by the late Donald Pleasance) makes every effort to catch the psychotic killer before anyone falls victim to him. Jamie Lee Curtis (her debut movie) plays Laurie Strode, the person Michael Myers is mainly after. this film is very exciting, full of surprises and I was very pleased with it. The music really sets the scene of a crazed stalker killer coming to kill and kill again. Get out the popcorn leave the lights on when you watch this movie! It's not for the fainthearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the collector","review":"I tried hard to stay away from this box set but I could'nt resist. That 60$ hand puppet was calling my name. I love extra copies. No one will ever be able to stop me. Honestly It has given me the blu ray edition, cleaner copies of Halloween 4 and 5 and of course the extended edition. So for a true fan it's worth it. Especially for Halloween 5 being such a great sequel. Donald Pleasence plays the character of Dr. Lommis a little more eccentric than usual that time around. It's to be enjoyed"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Horror Movie.","review":"This Movie Is Indeed A Classic Horror Story.The Original Version Is So Much Better Than The Newer Remake Of This Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The horror film about the nature of fear","review":"This Blu-ray release is the best middle ground between the Cundey version and the Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition. John Carpenter always in his movies tries to convey some type rudimentary philosophic incite and occasionally reveals much illumination of guarded esoteric issues. Halloween presents us with the archetype of fear and the consequences of human nature when faced with that fright (the shape). Fear is a powerful weapon for the skilled and detriment to those who react inappropriately, thus is fears nature it is \\"the mind killer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last House on the Left","review":"If you want to watch the scariest movie you'll ever see this would be it. This was Wes Craven first film and is based on a true story. Most people can't watch entire film due to graffic content and most video stores especially Blockbuster yanked it for that reason. Want to get scared? This movie will do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloweener? No, a Hollow Weiner.","review":"This movie is not good. ... Past mindless complaints, this movie is fairly plotless, and riddled with idiocy. For instance, why does the killer spend three-fourths of the movie standing around as scary music plays? The horrors of men standing in silly masks, save me! Save your laughter for the scene in which his standing theme resembles the sound of a jet propulsion system. Also, pass the time wondering why Jamie Lee Curtis does not figure out that the killer is probably not dead when she stabs him in the thigh. While this might kill some, he has already survived a coathanger in the eye and a long needle driven into his ear, so you might not want to turn your back. She does, so he can try to kill her again. Also, the killer is generally more impotent than pre-Viagra Bob Dole. Real killers hang in movies like \\"Welcome to Spring Break.\\" ...Skip Banacheck is a better hero than Jamie Lee any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"John (Over-Rated) Carpenter!","review":"Released at the same time as Dawn of the Dead.

The main plot is a boy who murdered his sister and returns years later to kill babysitters in his hometown. Halloween is no treat but a trick. Fans of horror films should rent something better.

So Miss Curtis heads across the street... From there, things fall apart until they reach an asinine conclusion.The terrifyingly haunting music is the only thing that keeps this show from being a complete waste of time.Despite other opinions, this film DOES deserve its \`R' rating, due to its gruesome themes, let alone the violence, language, and semi-clad babysitters.All in all, enjoy \\"Halloween\\" if you must, but PLEASE don't consider it to be a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"Micheal Myers went on to become an institution - the first of what was a two part story over the first night of halloween when Micheal came home to Haddonfield after 15 years sitting in a cell, glassy faced and blank.

Not Gory to be gory(John Carpenter doesn't do that in this movie)It is a suspensful thriller that not only keeps you scared but for some reason interested. The Station wagon that Michael Meyers follows Jamie Lee Curtis and her friends around is just spooky and creepy by itself. The empty house plays a part in this as well. Donald Pleasance in probably his best performance to date is great as the doctor on the trail of this troubled man who becomes a killer and goes and terrorizes the town of Haddonfield but only a few people know it when he shows up. The rest would be oblivious to what is going to happen in their little town.Directed by John CarpenterJamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance and Nick Castle"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MOVIE, but wheres the extras!!!","review":"wonderful, scary movie, but where the hell r the extras, the extended fottage is nice, but they could have at least put SOME extras, but no they make u pay another $30 dollars 4 the same movie and tons of extras, i dont recommend this edition but get the 25th anniversary one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best horror film of all time","review":"This is a great film.

He returns to his home Haddonfield (hence the nickname \\"The Night HE Came Home\\") and stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and you'll find out in H2. Anyway she babysits for a boy on Halloween night and Michael Myers stalks her and her friends and kills them all except her. His doctor at the sanitary, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is trying to find Michael and stop him. I love ... when he sticks the guy to the door with the butcher knife.

Sure the film looks and sounds great but so did the last two DVD incarnations. Commentary tracks provided by Carpenter, Hill, and Curtis are adequate and somewhat disappointing. As for the 86 minute 'new' documentary, it's nothing more than a trumped up version of the 30 minute documentary (Halloween Unmasked 2000) with endless, ENDLESS, ENDLESS, ENDLESS, ENDLESS clips --make that entire sequences-- from the movie. Curtis's own 2000 interview is again repeated here as are the same stories from Hill, Carpenter, Tommy Lee Wallace, P.J. Soles, and Nick Castle.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Classic","review":"The original Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and my personal favorite. Even though I've seen it numerous times I can't get enough. On Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in the small town of Haddonfield Illinois. Now, 15 years later, he has escaped from a mental institution to reek havoc amongst the trick or treaters. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time. The music score for Halloween is still creepy almost 25 years later and is synonymous with the movie.

I'm not so sure","review":"As a rabid horror fan, I've never been certain why so many other horror fans go \\"ga-ga\\" over this 90 minute film of predictability. It lacks any suspense. Albeit, Zombie's \\"reimagining\\" was MUCH worse. This film is so bland and dull. Carpenter's orchestration is the best \\"thing\\" to come out of this film. The characters are dull and lifeless, there is obviously NO talent involved within this film.I must say that the story written for \\"Friday The 13th One\\" is far superior to this jive. I simply do not like this film. The character is never given any light of purpose.

I highly recommend the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginning...","review":"Good movie to start the sequels...Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job in her role.Story is about a 6 year old kid who kills his sister and spends the next 15 years in a mental hospital. He then escapes and goes back to start his set of slayings in his home of Haddonfield, Illinois.The movie is a little slow in certain parts but equally scary in others. Its a good beginning, seen as only a little part of the whole story is told and Michael ends up \\"escaping\\".I can see why other Halloween movies were made after this one. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween night, 1978.","review":"John Carpenter's classic horror flick, Halloween is sickly cool. This was Jamie Lee Curtis's first major role and boy she is brilliant as Laurie. Could this movie be any better, some critics have accused this film as being to slow especially when it comes to killing scenes but I think the tempo is right on. The beginning is so amazing and freaky, Michael Myers kills his sister for having...sex with her boyfriend. After that horrific incident Michael is placed in an instution but when he is a grown man he escapes and he returns to his childhood home to get his pent-up revenge on unsuspecting horny teenagers. But how can Michael kill Laurie when she is a virgin? Well you will just have to watch this little treasure to see what happens, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween: 25th Anniversary DVD","review":"John Carpenter's Halloween is perhaps the most brilliant horror film in the history of cinema. What makes this movie so impressive is the fact that the the filmmakers constructed such an excellent film with such few resources. It is guarunteed to make sleep with the lights on.

Really outstanding. The fright is not from seeing lots of blood (as if that's really frightening and not just unseemly), it's from the idea that on a little night in 1978 evil visited small town U.S.A. and then left as mysteriously as it came (I don't consider any of the sequels anywhere near this film at all). Evil visited Haddonfield. And sorry, the scene were Jamie enters the house and finds all her friends dead is the scariest scene ever filmed...not for shock value, but for disturbing terror.

The story is quite simple to understand. A homicidal maniac (Myers) escapes from a mental institution making a night of babysitting turn in to a night of pure hell for an unsuspecting babysitter (Curtis)Support roles from Donald Pleasance as the half mad psychologist of Myers also add to this film's classic touch, which shall never appear dusty on any video store's horror shelf!A must for Horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME!","review":"HALLOWEEN IS MY SECOND FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE(PSYCHO IS MY FIRST).

Okay, so it's not the scariest, but by far is the funnest. Literally, you'll be screaming, \\"NO! Don't go in THERE, you IDIOT!!!\\" Or even, \\"Uh...behind you...\\" The fact is this film is still scary despite the fact that not too many people die in it and it isn't gory at all. Just like \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" it proves that even low-budjet films can still be classics. It also proves that it is really the music in a horror movie that ultimately makes a horror movie scary as it boasts an unbielievable soundtrack that keeps you wide-eyed. It's sequels, however, became scarier and gorier, but this is still the best. \\"Scream\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\" are just rip-offs of this masterpiece.

You can't SEE anything! Everything is so dark and smooth looking.And seeing that a lot of the scenes happen at night, if you haven't seen this movie before you would be totally lost!The sound quality is good and I do like the Special Features.

I wanted to see it so bad because, they showed parts of it in Scream (that was the best movie ever). This was okay. I didn't think that they would show so much nudity and otha stuff.

It wasn't as scary as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer but it was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not needed extra scenes","review":"The reason I gave this two stars is: When you origanlly watch a movie and you enjoy it, then they add extra scenes to fit a time slot on T.V. it is like they tainted the first version.(in my humble opinion) That is why I rated it two stars...

I bought the movie because it was cheap and I was looking for a good horror movie to add to my collection because I am a big fan of the genre. However, the movie itself was a huge disappointment. It was very slow moving, not scary and overall, the plot was weak. It basically is about a mass murdering other worldly person named Micheal Myers who goes around and slaughters people for no reason but to kill. Not only are there not many kills but hardly anything happens in this movie and it was just very boring. There was almost no action except for the final encounter at the end. Critics said this was one of the best and most scariest horror movies made. They were dead wrong. To name anything positive about the film, I liked Micheal Myers theme song but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You would shiver","review":"I saw the fog and the thing both by John Carpenter and I say that this is the most scariest movie I ever saw.

And it continues to give me chills whenever I watch it. No other movie from nearly 30 years ago has ever been able to do so. This is the most terrifying movie ever and it continues to have the same impact it did when it first came out. A young Jamie Lee Curtis really made her mark and began her career with the role that got her deemed the scream queen (a real honor being the daughter of the original scream queen Janet Lee). She followed up this movie with the sequel, although not at great, a really good movie in and of itself. But the original Halloween just cannot be dupicated and no sequel or rip off has ever even come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Halloween Movie","review":"This movie scared the crap out me when I first say it when I was young.

When the immortal killer Michael first donned his rubber mask in 1978, fear sparked across the globe at this nail biting, edge of your seat thriller, catapulting audience members into a state of pure, exiliharating suspense. The film, with it's perfect cult status, was later followed with a grueling number of deficient sequels, each copying and belittling it's predeccesor until audience members shifted their attentions to other characters in the same macabre genre. The original Halloween continues to be the grandest horror movie of the past millinium, backed excellently in this special edition dvd by a slew of delicious bonus features. So gather your loved ones in October, cozy around the television, and scare yourself silly with this piece of hair raising entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boogyman's Back Home!!!","review":"The horror genre has had it's great moments. Such moments would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Child's Play, Friday the Thirteenth, etc. But the greatest ever is without a doubt, Halloween. None of those other slasher stars started killing at age six. Not only that, but damn that mask is scary! The movie starts out with young Michal Myers, stalking his sister and then killing her brutally. He is sent to a mental institution, where he escapes. Then he comes back to his hometown, where he goes to kill his last remaining family, Laurie Srode, who is played exellently by Jamie Lee Curtis. There is only one man who can stop him, Dr Loomis, who is played by overacting Donald Pleasance. (But he is good enough to make the sequils.) Altogether, this makes one of the most scary movies ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anchor Bay should recall this edition & correct the tranfer","review":"I have the prior limited edition from 1999, which includes a very nice transfer indeed. I bought this edition for the commentary, but was also expecting an improved transfer, given the comments on the front of the disc. Nope. It's a loser. What a shame that they couldn't get the color timing right or improve on their prior four-year-old edition. Very hard to understand given the popularity of this title.."},{"rating":"2","title":"just to clear things up","review":"Just to clear things up since I have seen various references here, the 104 version is not the theatre version. There are extra scenes that were done during Halloween 2 to fill in for missing scenes that were cut when Halloween was going to be put on t.v. Not to say the extended version is not a good version, but the extra time and scenes do come at a price: you loose some of the original movie. This is the 25th anniversary of the original movie, not the sequals or any variations of the movie. If this is bacially adding on to the release they did a few years back, then this will be the ultimate Halloween on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIED WITH THE SHINING, the best horror movie ever!","review":"Halloween was great. But it always seemed a little too short with a narrow plot. But now that i purchased the new version with 12 minutes of extra scenes it seems even more enjoyable.

I've never seen them incorporated into the film. It was pretty awesome, though, you can tell they kinda don't belong in the movie. The 3 actresses(Curtis, Soles, and Loomis) in particular look 3 years older, because as you may or may not know the tv scenes were shot 3 years later during the filming of Halloween II. Also, one complaint I have is the first few minutes, when Michael is killing Judith, the sounds seems off. Like you hear her body hit the floor, before we see it. So, that's a little annoying. I liked it very much overall, though. Halloween is a horror classic, and the tv secens incorporated made it 10 minutes longer, so, that's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I am very happy with my purchase love the great price of this rare dvd i am a very happy customer"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"My all time favorite Horror film!

No way Friday 13th can compare with it. Besides its just about gore, sex, and drugs. I liked Halloween because it is a simple film. Unlike the sequals there is no weird plot about samhain and evil spirits. The Camera view as if you were Michaels is terrific. Donald Plescence and Jamie Lee Curtis deserve a A in acting. The others should get a B-. The good thing is there is no gore in the movie. What truly maked Halloween scary is THE MASK Michael wears. Some sound effects may seem a little corny though. The music is very scary and goes with the movie well.

I've never been disappointed with the new version they put out, until now! As soon as I started watching it I realized it was very inferior to the version I've been watching the last couple of years - the Divimax version.So leave it up to what your DVD standards are and purchase this version to save some $ and get a decent looking version, or buy theHalloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)and own a great quality DVD with plenty of features!J"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE","review":"From the first time I saw this, I was hooked.

This movie is packed with cheap acting, dull score, bad editing, and a real no- good thrills. I appreiciate John Carpenter's work, but it's so overrated! One of the most overrated films I've seen. But the thing I liked is that scenes that you can see in Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, or other slasher flix were started in this film.

I really enjoyed the extra material that they shot for the television release, which puts it at 104 minutes as opposed to 91 minutes of the theatrical version. For me, thus far, the only good version of Halloween on DVD came when they released the extended version on DVD some time ago. With it, it included the R-version of the film, which is discernable by watching the opening scene with Michael in the mask, with no edit and overlayed template to mask his sisters breasts as he brings the knife down.

All of my other DVD's have the outtakes from the original movies. I don't understand why they didn't include these in the 25th anniversary edition.

But this set it $70 for something you already own as well as not H2 but 4 and 5. C'mon, Mr. Carpenter. I already own a DVD of your classic horror masterpiece, I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE. You're becoming just as bad as George Lucas and the Star Wars movies. Simply put, this doesn't bring ANYTHING new to the table.

But evil does come home to roost.Jamir Lee Curtis stars in this flick as the heroine. She was always Hollywood's ugly duckling. I never found her attractive in the least, (...)The movies pays more attention to building up the character of Michael, rather than just brainless slayings. From his doctor we learn much about him, however the real ride begins in part II where we learn even more.I will admit though, of the three modern slashers (Jason, Freddy, and Michael) The Halloween series has the best theme music.

The prices are great and I love the site and can usually find what I'm looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pioneer of modern horror films.","review":"Halloween is a masterpiece. Director John Carpenter has accented atmosphere and suspense, rather than blood and guts, this is what I think the key to the film. Though the story is tired, the visual part left me speechless. When I say that the story is tired I mean, baby-sitters, a man in a mask, a classic horror story. I have been to almost every Halloween site on the internet, and have learned the truth of the mask. It is only a Captain Kirk mask, painted white, side burns shaved off and the eye holes enlarged. I know why they choose it. The eerieness of the pale, emotionless face probably scared me the most. Go get this movie, or any of it's sequels from the video store and you'll know what I mean.\\"Halloween is a merciless thriller, I would compare it to PHYSO.\\"-------Roger Ebert END"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate in Terror","review":"I know everyone that is in to the horror genre has seen this movie. This movie, by far, is the most suspenseful and scary movie ever released. If you notice, while you're watching this movie, the abscence of blood, guts, and cheap tricks to keep you watching. John Carpenter does a great job of keeping you on the edge of you seat with background music and a story line that was new at the time of the picture. I know some horror fans think that the Friday The 13th Movie was the movie that started it all but that is nothing compaired to the actual fear and suspence that one will watching Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad print of a great movie.","review":"Be warned, the remastering of the movie might be crystal clear, but it completely erased the wonderful use of the colors blue and orange in Dean Cundy's photography. No amount of extras are worth a washed out print."},{"rating":"2","title":"New ways to use the jack-o-lantern knife","review":"There was no justice for Tony Moran and Will Sandin. They were the actors who starred as Michael Myers in the original Hallowe'en. They did a wonderful job as they played the part of the mute killer. Both Patty Duke (Miracle Worker) and Jane Wyman (Johnny Belinda) received Oscars for their portrayal of non speaking leads in memorable films. These two do it and nobody remembers. This movie introduced Jamie Lee Curtis, America's favorite actor slash slashee. A really good scary movie for anyone over the age of 40 or under the age of 41. Donald Pleasance can say \\"EEEVEEEL\\" as well as Vincent Price did in his heyday (Fall of the House of Usher, Pit and the Pendulum). Other scary items for Hallowe'en, \\"The Innocents\\" with Deborah Kerr and \\"Ghost Gallery\\" CD in the music section. One other item of interest in Hallowe'en, the credits for stuntwork is singular. Only one stunt person took all the tumbles. A real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orginal!","review":"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. It is very original and has an amazing storyline. Halloween is my favorite movie/horror movie.

Buy this for this halloween to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"all-time classic","review":"the halloween series are one of my favorite franchises and this started it all,i read that the 25th anniversary version looks funny compared to the laser disc version but divimax did a great job to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween....resotred","review":"For anyone who bought this while it was released, they truly own a gem. It's one of a kind documentary is a treat enough for anybody, but the Hologram cover really puts this one in the treasure box. Sure you can still go out and buy the first version, but when you realize you own a version that's out of print, it makes it that much more special. I personally own the 2 disc set with the extened Television version. Most critics say the extended footage is horible, but I think it's a blast to watch, considering the 25th Anniversary edition doesn't even play those scenes seperately. They talk about it for a few seconds and show minor clips. Again, the restored limited edition is a great gem for the true Halloween fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Set","review":"I was anticipating on this set even though I have every one of the Halloween movies on DVD. I was hoping for a complete set but I guess that's not possible since Anchor Bay don't own the rights to Halloween II or H20. Most of all what's even MORE DISAPPOINTING is the fact that Anchor Bay have released Halloween so many times and they still don't even release the original movie and the Extended aka as the TV Version with [CC] CLOSED CAPTIONING for the Deaf & Hearing Impaired or have any SUBTITLES, even Halloween BLURAY is not [CC] or subtitles. Anchor Bay seem to be lazy and not release a proper release with extras, an uncut version or extra footage along with everything CLOSED CAPTION... I wish they get it right for once and quit do with the lazy and quick put together set, believe me the mask and box set idea is pretty lame and an embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Myers best movie until Austin Powers","review":"This is one of the all-time greatest thrillers.

I saw this movie at the age of 8. I'm 17 now and it still sends shivers down my spine. For the next few years no horror movie I've seen has been able to scare me as much as the HALLOWEEN series(except part 3 which had nothing to do with Michael Myers). If you're looking for a great scary horror movie with a really great serial killer, check out HALLOWEEN. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took away directors vision","review":"Scenes in other dvd releases of Halloween had blue tint to them. The movie also had a fall season look to it. Anchor Bay messed up once again. Sure the picture is sharper, but all the blue tint has been washed out. For example there is a scene where we see a door which is tinted blue, now the door is more white and shows no blue at all. There are a lot more scenes like this as well. The fall season look is gone too. Anchor Bay now has all the grass looking bright green. For them to change the classic vision of the movie is pathetic. The only reason anyone should buy this is because of the extras. If you want the movie with a great transfer check out the LE or the restored version. This supposedly great dvd also does not have the extended version. WAY TO GO ANCHOR BAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Criterion Please!!!","review":"I really want to purchase one ultimate version of this movie but they just won't give it to us. The Criterion laser disc has one of the best running commentaries that I've heard and I will not recommend any DVD until it includes all that I heard on laser disc four years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible transfer to High Definition","review":"This review is for the high definition disc only. This is a really good movie that is one of the standards of excellence for very low budget motion pictures, but this high definition transfer is unwatchable. The colors are ugly and wrong. In addition, the excessive use of digital grain reduction technology has both softened the picture and robbed it of much of the detail in the image. Looks like something that was done by amateurs on a home system. Extremely poor and should be avoided -- The worst transfer to high def disc that I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"John Carpenter is usually regardede as one of the great directors of the genre, but I find him terribly overrated. In the seventies and early eighties he had a good grip on suspense, his movies were mostly amateurish, but inciting. Today one would expect him to be a professional, but he's still directing pure dilettantism, lacking the enthusiasm of his earlier work.Although Halloween is quite scary, in a somewhat childish but effective way, the ethichs are really the most terrifying thing about it, hilarious and monstrous at the same time: Teenagers, having fun in their parents beds, are butchered by a heavy-breathing retard wearing a Halloween-mask. Only the virtuous babysitting heroine survives this sexual-fascist Endlösung. One would almost suspect that these kind of movies were made with the support of the Christian Right."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED","review":"cmon r u serious. greatest horror movie ever my ass. it was prolly good in 78 but it doesnt compare 2 some of the movies today. i meen all the reviews for scream said it was pathetic but it sure was a hell of a lot better than this. i thought it was scarier than this 2 and it wasnt that scary itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCREWED IT UP","review":"Buyer Beware! This edition is hideous. The extras are good, but the actual film has been butchered. The colors are all wrong.. I could go on & on. Anchor Bay should just re-release the 2 disc special edition & be done with it! Stay away from this one-- try the previous edition instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...","review":"I watched the 1978 film \\"Halloween\\" a while ago and was thoroughly disappointed in it. It's not scary, it's slow moving and there's basically no plot whatsoever. It rips off of 'The Exorcist' (vastly superior to this film). The detective in this movie is a complete knock-off of the detective in 'The Exorcist', (same accents, same appearance). Overall, \\"Halloween\\" is pretty, well, hollow. Give it a rent if you're a horror buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"this has to be the most suspenseful horror movie ever!","review":"This movie is great. It is highly terrifying, highly suspenseful, and has an engrossing plot. That of a child killer, put in an asylum for the criminally insane, escaping, and going back to the hometown he came from to seek revenge and recompensation. The methods and ways he kills in many ways seem to almost bring out the fear of \\"what if...\\" one of the childhood killers of this day were to get out. Its over 20 years old but it is the BEST in the series (I have seen them all)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween, A Horror Classic","review":"I have seen many slasher movies in my time and Halloween is by far one of the best out of all of them. I would compare this movie to Psycho (1960) Which is another classic in horror. By my opinion from 1970-1990 was the best horror movie era. As if no one knows the storyline this movie takes place in Haddonfield,Illinois when a little boy name Michael Myers kills his sister on Halloween night. Almost over 20 years later Michael escapes from a mental asylum and returns to his home where it is being accompanied by Jamie Lee Curtis when Dr.Loomis played by Donald Pleasence attempts to kill Michael. In all this is a great film to watch in the dark. Its well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slasher","review":"This movie is legendary and very influential. The style is great, music adds to the tension, and I like the killer's eye view from behind the mask, that was brilliant. The trip to the mental hospital was scary, from then on you know nobody is safe. The last half of the movie is very well done, Michael Myers is no Jason Voorhees but he can still cause a lot of mayhem. Part 2 is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary fun","review":"It is a great movie to watch in the dark.I first saw it on halloween night 2004 and i loved it.It would have been better if they hadnt shown us mikes face."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Bloody Time!!!!!!","review":"FINALLY! After the billion rereleases of this movie, rehashing the same stuff we knew about for years, they finally release the version any Halloween fan has been dying for!

It led to a lot of different kind of horror movies to come out in the early 80s where slasher flicks were really popular and if this did not come out then most of the movies today would have never made it to the big screen. This movie had a low budget which was only $300,027 and they used the money wisely and creatively and I admire that a lot and they shot the movie in only 21 days and edited it for another week so for this movie to come out that quick and be so good is just amazing. I recommend this to horror fans and general movie fans because this is so good and a great movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"horrifyingly spooky and thrilling","review":"halloween, my all time favorite movie, was a landmark film in the genre of horror.

That's the highest rating I can give it? :-(","review":"If you have not seen this FABULOUS film yet, then...well...maybe YOU should start going around in a mask and go to an insane asylum. Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance (RIP), and the terrifying William Shatner mask add together to make the best horror film of ALL time. Halloween leaves you with an undeniable chill, rare in the cliched-making-fun-of-cliches films these days. Worth the money 44504fold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treat or Trick?","review":"I saw this B-Movie in the theatre with a fellow film school friend and we sat there easily predicting to eachother what was going to happen next. If you've seen any slasher films before - you've seen this one.I like the fact that there is a cheapo culture out there, it often produces some charismatic stuff, but please don't endow this bland teenager movie with superpowers because when you were a kid you jumped out of your seat.Fortunately for John Carpenter he has a following of people who apparently just can't get enough popcorn.I like dumb movies too like the AMAZING COLOSSAL BEAST and I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF but I'm not about to give them four stars.To anyone that hasn't seen this yet but is intrigued by the success of the series I say ring another doorbell - they're giving out cheap candy over here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot???","review":"I thought movies were supposed to have little things called \\"plots.\\" Well, Halloween has absolutely *no* plot whatsoever. The film is downright boring. The first hour of the film is sooooo boring and slow. The last hour isn't exciting, but it is more suspenseful than the first 60 minutes of the film. I was surprised at how much nudity there was in this film as well. I can't imagine a mother (or father) letting their child watch this film. It's gruesome and demented. I did not like one single solitary thing about Halloween. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best way to start a trend...","review":"I did not like this film. In fact, I found it to be one of the worst of the famed slashers. It was not at all scary, nor did it have many creative kills (there was one, in particular, that I did like though). I guess at its time, just people getting murdered was scary enough, but not in today's world. Also, Michael Myers is not supernatural, so why does he not die? He just keeps coming back to a point of redundancy. Its just dumb and predictably pointless. A cliffhanger ending is an alright lead into the next film, which, I must say, is a much better movie than its predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"where's the blood!?","review":"It's Halloween in Haddonfield, and the story of 6 year old Micheal Myers killing his sister still remains in the quiet town.Only Dr.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) knows what Micheal is like, and what he can do, and that is why Micheal has been put in the mental hospital.The scene about how he escapes from the hospital is too unlikely, just walking out and stealig a car. But, when he's out, he's out, and he will not stop until his sister, Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee-Curtis) is dead.The character of Micheal Myers is played by Tony Moran, and played well too, giving an air of evil. Bullets, knitting needles and clothes hangers won't stop him. Can anyone stop him?Even though there is a lack of blood, and a slightly slow start, Halloween offers suspence, darkness and murdered teenagers. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The night HE came home...","review":"This movie wrox. It's about this little kid (6) who stabs his sister to death on Halloween night. He is then sent to a mental institution where he has sat there staring at walls and never talking for 15 years. But the night before Halloween 1978 he excapes for a day of stalking a babysitter(Jamie Lee Curtis). She sees him staring at her, she doesn't understand why. Little does she know what will happen on that cold, windy Halloween night. Will Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance) trace down Micheal and take him back to the mental institution? Will Laurie Strode have enough wits to challenge micheal to a challenging, deadly game of hide and seek with knives, needles, and coat hangers? You'll have to watch!The DVD is great too! Also, Halloween 2 shows the rest of Laurie's night and continues from Halloween!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is good but there is something you all should know!","review":"This only has the TV version in Dolby 2.O mono sound. The 2 disc set collectors edition that is now out of print came with this TV version in Dolby 2.O mono sound plus the other disc was the normal version in an OUTSTANDING Dolby 5.1 digital remaster. I have seen the extra footage on the tv version disc but I always watch the regular version because the sound is really great. It sounds like a brand new movie. Yes this new version is good but it is a shame they left out the new enhanced version of the film. That is why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. But I read somewhere that a new 25th aniversary edition is going to be put out next year and I bet they make it a 2 disc set or at least have the Dolby 5.1 theatrical version in the set.

This lean feature works because it's both original and daringly basic: Laurie is a young teenage girl up against a monster, with only her wits and her two feet to protect her from the wrong end of a large butcher knife. Will Laurie and her young charges make it to Thanksgiving? You'll remain on the edge of your seat finding out."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIVIMAX VERSION IS AWESOME - DON'T MISS IT!","review":"This film is a classic, nuff said. I have the original Anchor Bay 5.1 Dolby version from years back, awesome edition. This Divimax version is even better! Print is beauuutifullll and 5.1 mix is great. Don't listen to other reviews stating 'too much blue', 'not enough blue', etc, etc, etc. This is the theatrical version without the added scenes for the TV release(thank God!). If you're a fan and on the fence about spending your $ on this, don't be. Buy it now! Extras are great also, though they aren't as important to me as the film. I own a few Divimax editions and all of them are terrific. I only wish there was a DTS track. If you love 'Halloween' and have a higher-end setup, this is the disc to have. Viewing nirvana. Now if they would only release a Divimax of \\"The Fog\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary as hell","review":"What I like about this film is that you are scared throughout the whole thing. When you think that crazy (...) Michael Myers will attack he never does. He attacks right when you least expect he will (like the car sequence) and when he does you either A. S**t your pants, B. Scream, C. Jump out of your seat, or D. All of the above. What I really like about this movie though is that Michael Myers is this force that nobody can stop even if you shoot him six times in the chest or set him on fire. But they should really kill him off now since the sequels are really starting to suck. If you love, like or just think the Halloween series is okay then buy this masterpiece. I would rank it up with \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" (original 1974 version) and the original \\"Psycho\\" and its way better than that \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"Nightmare on Elmstreet\\" (...). This is a classic you can't afford not to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definition of horror","review":"One of the movies that cemented John Carpenter as a visionary director, the original, and still the best, Halloween is a landmark in horror. We all know the storyline by now so I won't go into that, but what I will say is this is what a real horror movie is, able to be scary without blood and gore flying everywhere, its the atmosphere and Carpenter's patented creepy as hell musical score that makes this movie truly horrifying. It was followed by six sequels, none of which can hold a candle to this original classic, and this movie also started the slasher movie craze of the 80's. Extremely recommended if you want a real horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing painful drivel","review":"I am generally a Julia London fan.

I get what London was trying to do but it didn't work. She tried so hard to make her the likeable, youngest child that she made her into a pushover. I wanted to slap her, tell her to stand up for herself and stop eating brownies. The witchcraft angle was old after the first one, and they proceed to do several more after. My pet peeve with writers is when they just want you to buy a romantic spark by just writing it. That's just being lazy. I don't see why either of them liked each other. The ending was anticlimatic, the plot predictable, the characters blah, and yet I still liked it better than the second Rebecca Lear story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing's good but the heroine in TSTL...","review":"After reading Ms. London's BEAUTY QUEEN, I was anxious to read MISS FORTUNE. However, the book just never caught on with me and the heroine is definitely someone I wouldn't want to know or be. I have a problem with romance novel heroines who are in their 30's and still living off their parents yet get angry when their life goals, etc. are questioned. After a while I gave up on Rachel and wondered what anyone would see in her. She really had no redeeming values. I did like the book's hero more and loved how Ms. London used a lot of British slang with this character. I found him charming, but once again, couldn't see what he saw in his lady love."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 50 pages, I skipped to the end","review":"I was so dissapointed by this book!

Leonard is also famous for looking into the lives of petty crooks - but these are among the pettiest. A couple of selfish and self-indulgent losers get their kicks throwing rocks through the windows of homes. The readers are invited to giggle with glee at the stupid fools who live within, and stumble into the night to see what has happened. I tossed this book after reading the first half - a first for me. I have read every Elmore Leonard I could get my hands on. But this one, I couldn't wait get rid of. Skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Vintage Leonard","review":"I picked up a paperback of THE BIG BOUNCE somewhere and was thrilled because I thought it was a new Elmore Leonard. It wasn't until I was halfway through the book that I discovered it was written in 1969, almost 35 years ago. That is how well this book has held up: it reads like a fresh story. And smooth. That is the word that comes to mind: the writing in THE BIG BOUNCE is smooth. It flows and moves along easily. Maybe the best writing I've read of Elmore Leonard's works and I've read many. It's a subdued, subtle story with a great fight scene and a tense house B&E scene. It features Jack Ryan, maybe a little slow en la cabeza but who can swing a bat (or a tree limb) and knows a 100 ways to break into a house, and Nancy as the ambitious rich guy's GF who is more than a little psychotic. Rather than a roller coaster ride of plot twists, this novel is like like a fine vintage wine to be savored and enjoyed on the veranda with a good cigar. Get this book and light one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesser Leonard","review":"I am an avid Elmore Leonard fan and have lost count of the number of books of his that I have read. Some of them rank with the best crime fiction ever written. However, this is not one of them. In fact, this is the first one I have read that is actually bad. The main problem is the very thin plot, which Leonard all too frequently compensates for with flashbacks to the character's earlier life, which have nothing whatever to do with the plot. It is obvious that he does this just to fill space and stretch this short story out to book length.That having been said, I must say that I liked the book's ending. It was surprising and abrupt. But this book is only for Dutch-ophiles who may be curious to see what the master's early work was like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"The most astonishing and strange thing about this book I find are the quotes from newspapers saying it's a great book. When I finished the book I thought the clue, story and good ending everyone is talking about were simply missing as I bought it secondhand on a trip trough China. I found out that the book really has no ending, no suspense, no clue and no good reason te read it. Too bad I just found out after I finished it. It's really a question of whether it should be called a story. I have no clue why someone would read or write it, as it is about as interesting as listening in on a conversation between some dull people on a train."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much \\"Bounce\\" in this title","review":"I've read most of the non-western Elmore Leonard collection. I've enjoyed just about everything he has written. The Big Bounce is probably near the bottom of my favorites.

Probably Tishomingo Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing too exciting...","review":"A bit slower than what I expected. I was more interested in the quick flashback sequences between Jack Ryan and Leon Woody. It was entertaining, but slowed to the pace of a geriatric bingo game, at times. The plot's not too engaging, but Leonard's knack for writing from a character's point of view keeps you amused.I'd recommend \\"Maximum Bob\\" as my favorite Leonard book, so far.A sidenote, but Detroit Tiger fans may get a kick out of the last few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the ending?","review":"I am an avid Elmore Leonard fan. While this book is dated, the basic premise of the story had all the traditional earmarks of a Leonard novel.Once the book begins hitting the climax, the book takes a totally different direction. The main storyline is aborted.I was listening to an unabridged audio version of this book. I returned the book to Amazon since I thought I had an incomplete book.

I'm assuming there are at least five to ten pages missing, but I haven't compared the paperback to the ebook. Was I the only person to experience this?What a nice story. Interesting peeks into a woman's life in the raw west. There was just enough detail to keep the reader involved, but not too much to turn it tedious or boring.All in all a nice story.

It's a movie from 1980 whose main character, Elinor, is based on these writings.

This lady had such a zest for life and she lived life to the fullest. Her friends, too! One quote I thought humorous, expressing that they were ravenously hungry: \\"In a short time we were eating like Lent was just over.\\" Another time she is feeling stupid about something she does... \\"And then I began to think how many kinds of idiot I was.\\" This lady's writing made you feel she was living in this century.

The book bounces around between too many characters and too many story lines with not enough time devoted to any of them to let the reader know whose stories are the crux of the book.Perhaps the problem is that Uris goes over already-told Trinity tales and can't get focused on his main characters. Outside of seeing the word \\"redemption\\" batted around by different characters, I can't find anything that unifies the stories contained in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably dull","review":"What a disappointment!

Here's hoping Uris already is working on another great book to redeem himself from this debacle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time after reading Trinity","review":"I read Trinity 10 years ago and loved it. I picked up Redemption because I enjoyed Trinity so much and because I have read and thouroughly enjoyed every Leon Uris book I read. However, half way into Redemption I felt as if I had already read it (e.g., big wrought iron screens, firemen in Baltimore). I also thought there was enough good history to write about and that Mr. Uris' focus on torid sex was pandering to marketability rather than good writing. I wish he would take one more stab at Ireland and stick to the historical theme more -- there's a lot to tell,"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad state for a great novelist to have reached","review":"After _Trinity_, one of Uris' best works, we are given his worst. It is almost as though he is having trouble remaining focused on the story; there are frequent flashbacks to the climactic passages in _Trinity_, usually for no apparent reason. Some stories gallop, some walk purposefully; _Redemption_ meanders aimlessly, retraces its steps, and bonks into trees.The only redeeming feature of the book is the description of Gallipoli, which is still a sore point in Australia and New Zealand and deserves comprehension and remembrance throughout the Western world. Unfortuately one must suffer through the rest of the book to get to the Gallipoli part, and unless you are extremely interested in that particular topic, this book is not time well spent.For an idea of what Uris has accomplished in the past, try _Topaz_ or _QB VII_ in addition to _Trinity_. Given the other great reading Uris has provided us, let's forgive him for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A yawner","review":"By the time I reached the end of this tedious tome, I didn't care about the characters or the war.

I first read Trinity and it was an awesome book, then I read Redemption later. They were both as good. I don't think it is fair, however, to judge a book when comparing it to another great book. If there was no Trinity (God forbid), and the story from Redemption stood alone, it would also be considered great like its prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredible Disappointment","review":"I've always been a big fan of Leon Uris and my only explanation for Redemption is that it cannot have been written by him! I literally felt like it was another author writing about the continuing saga of the Larkin family (the New Zealand branch) and the remaining Hubbles. The fact that Uris (?) contradicts his own previously written material is confusing and pointless. The characters appear shallow and the women are reduced to two-dimensional sex objects rather than the rich supporting figures they were in Trinity.

This is a wonderful epic saga of the Larkin family. It spreads across about 25 years, and frrom Ireland, to New Zealand to Australia to Egypt. It also encompasses the First World War. We also see a young Winston Churchill who can almost single-handedly be blamed for the Gallipoli fiasco. This is a book that takes you by the throat and won't let go until you turn the final page.

Yes, it was discouraging to realize that much of the book was a poor rehash of a brilliant \\"Trinity,\\" however, I was literally blown away by the account of the battle at Gallipoli. My grandfather fought there for the Anzacs, and my grandmother told me about his experience of waking up one morning and discovering one of his comrades, who had shared his sleeping bag to keep warm, shot dead. Now, my grandfather has been dead since 1959, but I felt like Uris had personally interviewed him for the book! Wow, does he do his homework, and in addition, he has given me an opportunity to know more about my grandfather than my grandmother could ever tell me. I never realized how miraculous my being here is, since so few made it through that battle.

So I read Trinity and loved it which made me excited to get to Redemption. What a let down. I can't understand how an author would follow up such a great book with something so awful. It was basically a review of Trinity with a little more detail...boring! Although, I'm glad I got to read Trinity. I hope Uris' other books are as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is no Trinity","review":"Hate to have to rip Leon Uris, but this book seemed like it was written just to quiet those people who clamored for a Trinity sequel. Either that, or he did it to make an easy buck. After reading this, you would swear he wrote the thing in about a week. The writing on Galipoli isn't bad and this book might be okay if it had to stand on its own. But as the sequel to Trinity, it captures none of the inspiring qualities of the original masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"gave 2 Stars only for Gallipoli","review":"I read 'Trinity' because I was curious about the IRA and the whole situation of Ireland & England. Just wanted to know what the hell it was all about.And I got all the information I wanted and so much more. Trinity not only gave a complete history on the situation but told me what Ireland meant to an Irishman.Now why am I reviewing Trinity instead of Redemption? I don't know. Maybe its because the sequel cant even hold a candle light to its predecessor .Redemption just drags on from basically where Trinity left off. Nothing happens until Gallipoli. But there, the book completely switches pace and becomes very interesting.The Bloody hills of Gallipoli and the British, Australian & the New Zealand forces invasion is described in vivid detail. But that's it. You have to suffer through the rest of the book to get to this part.Give this a miss. Read Trinity instead and hold on to the memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gallipoli novel derailed?","review":"The 200 or so pages in this novel that Leon Uris devotes to the battle of Gallipoli Peninsula in WWI are very well-written and extremely interesting. I have to wonder if Uris originally planned to write an entire book about Gallipoli but didn't have the energy left in his old age. He knew he'd make a pile of money with a sequel to his popular book \\"Trinity\\" so he stuck the Gallipoli story into the sequel.The first 300 pages of this book are a rehash of Trinity and I skimmed over them very quickly. The parts after Gallipoli are mildly interesting but not worth spending a lot of time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the genuine article","review":"After reading \\"Trinity,\\" I cannot have been the only one who hunted high and low for \\"Redemption.\\" I see from other reviews that I am not the only one who was, let's say, mildly appalled by what I found. \\"Redemption\\" has all the earmarks of a novel written for contractual purposes and I'm frankly surprised Uris put his name to it. In my opinion, it is not the genuine article, not by a long shot, and if you're still chasing around to find a copy by the time you read this, then stop. Go on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be A Private Affair","review":"There have been so many songs that have been sampled this past year. Some of them have delivered like Prince's Fury, which samples his clasic track 1999 very well, and others have actually been flawed and lack of merit like Beyonce' and Jay-Z for Deja Vu which sounded similar to Crazy In Love. For Jessica Simpson, she has been not just bad with cover songs like her remake of These Boots Are Made From Walkin' from The Dukes Of Hazard, she also is bad at sampling songs too. Her single, A Public Affair, her first single after her divorce from Nick Lachey, samples the Madonna classic, Holiday. The songs' emotion doesn't deliver very well. The feeling of the song doesn't seem very convincing towards her sound and style. I honestly think she needs to find better material for her next song, because this affair should be private over public.Song: D 1/2+"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shock","review":"Jessica Simpson once again returns to the music that was widely praised when boy bands ruled the airwaves.

The heroine deliberately different, though less endearing--meant apparently to be redeemed in the course of the book. BUT....The pace is so SLOW, and the plot virtually non-existent. I used to love to read romance, but lately the books seem to drip long overblown blah-blah-blah paragraphs and pages and pages supposedly about emotion while nothing at all is going on, or is about to either. In some books, passages are endlessly repeated while plot is nowhere to be found. Ms. Hannah isn't quite as repetitive as some; but though I need characters I care about, even more I need to read a book that is going somewhere sometime somehow. The snail's pace lack of plot here, or one that could have been handled in about five chapters, just isn't what I want to read.I will say on a sentence-by-sentence level, Kristin Hannah is an okay writer; but THE ENCHANTMENT put me to sleep.

After I had forgotten how bad it was, then I tried again. I forced myself to finish it thist time but I did not enjoy it. It is just a silly romance that was sprinkled with only a TINY bit of adventure. And the adventure part was the most appealing thing about the story. Everything else was boring or silly. And when I say silly, I'm talking about the sappy love junk that isn't realistic, especially on the guys part. And the worst part about the book is that Kristin Hannah is obviously not a Christian because she continues to use the GD phrase throughout her books. This is the 3rd one of hers that I've read and it may have to be the last since I cannot such constant disrespect for the Lord.

It had apparently been used as a text in a college class. There was a lot of writing in it but I didn't care. The book is an excellent resource for learning about the origins of the 14th Amendment and just what exactly the writers intended to accomplish by adding this change to the Constitution.

The raised top and channels in the top surface allow for air dissipation, and the intake channel in the back supplies air to the fans. But...the power cord doesn't last. I just went through my 3rd one of these in about 14 months. Unfortunately, I've researched for another option and cannot find one that I believe will work effectively.

For laptops, every model I have seen takes air in on the bottom and exhausts it out the side. This device would help to increase the volume of air in the bottom of the device -- except this device pulls air down rather than pushing it up.

For the three weeks it worked, it worked well; no problems with heat whatsoever, laptop was completely cool even after many hours of continuous use and the internal fans rarely had to run.However, after about three weeks it just stopped. The problem seems to be the on/off switch or connections to the switch. I would look for a different product with a sturdier construction.Update: I got a replacement for the one that stopped in the review above, and even while being *extremely* careful with it (particularly the power cord) it still died after just five months.

The notebooks \\"hot parts\\" are clearely colder. While like this effect, the pad itself is a little small and may not completely cool larger notebooks (mine is a 15.4\\" wide screen).Two little rubber knobs are supposed to provide a little space between the top of the chilpad and the bottom of the notebook. However, if your notebook's rubber feet are in an 'inconvinient' position, they can cause the notebook to be wobly on the pad.

I don't know if it's truly proprietary, but if it is I know why other companies haven't had a similar design--because it is awful.The USB cord on the cooler's end is a fairly sharp needle-like plug which has a small hole which connects to a single pin in the cooler. The issue is this pin and the cord are both flimsy and prone to getting stuck. Well mine did not get stuck this time, it broke off.I've seen the new Targus ones and they seem to be of a better design--hopefully that means Targus learned their lesson.I suppose it gets the job done, but for the price...

I've left my laptop unattended on it to come back and find my laptop very warm.It's not that expensive, so I'd rate it as a decent buy and better than nothing, but I'd get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and a Waste of Money","review":"Got two of these for two brand new laptops just recently purchased - the first about 1 1/2 months ago and the second 2 weeks ago. The first one lasted about a month before the blades started breaking. By then I had already had bought a second one - which I regret. The second one lasted a week before it started emitting horrible horrible grinding sounds and the first fan blade broke off today.My suggestions, spend the extra money on a good laptop cooling bad that'll last at least a year because if you buy cheap crap like this every 1-4 months - that just adds up anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it cool","review":"This is a great buy, I got this because my laptop kept getting to hot for my tastes. Especially when I was doing large projects that required a lot of processing power. I have a 15\\" laptop and was kind of worried about the size of this thing (its pretty small). But I tried it out and it fits perfect. I was kind of hoping that it'd come with an extra usb port so you wouldn't lose the one you're using, but it doesn't.Setup is easy, just plug in, put it under the laptop and you're finished. It keeps the laptop cool (by cooling the underside where all the heat accumulates) and now my computer handles a lot better. Its very soft too, you can't hear this thing at all.I liked this and would definately recommend to those who are having problems with laptop heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working anymore","review":"Its hardly been a month and the product ceased to work!The fans aint moving.Tried to get hold of customer care and it didnt happen either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good concept poorly executed","review":"While my laptop is certainly much happier with a cooling pad, I'm much happier with a different cooling pad. The Targus is cheap for a reason - I've already been through two different cables to connect it to my laptop (the wires came disconnected from the on-off switch); the point at which the cable connected to the pad quickly became loose and I'd often have to jiggle the cord to get it to stay on; and the feet first left marks on my desk, and then eventually fell off and got stuck to things. While I'm glad I discovered the world of laptop cooling pads, I wish I'd discovered something other than this Targus first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Doesn't work.

When it worked it drew the heat out of the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, switch is gone","review":"It works very well. I've been using it more than six months.

I turned it on and in less than 10 seconds I was ready to throw it away; It is too loud. I gave it two stars becuase it does keep my notebook cool, but the constant humming noise of the fans is more than I expected. Previously I was using something homemade which worked great and no noise; I've gone back to using the homemade item.The Chill Pad isn't large enough for a 17\\" laptop.

They're just not as inconspicuous as they once were, and we can definitely hear the whir of the fan as it is still cooling the computer, thereby extending it's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't handle heavy use","review":"It worked perfectly for the first month I had it. Then it just stopped working completely. My laptop stays on for about 8 hours a day and so the heat can be pretty intense. It could be that I just need a mat that can stand up to that kind of use and I just wore this one out. If you use your laptop a lot, I would suggest getting a higher quality mat that can stand up to a lot of use, but if you just need a mat for occasional use, then this might be a good item for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"So I figured I just got a lemon. It happens. But it seems I'm not the only one. I bought this a couple weeks ago to use when I ran a high-graphics program (only time my computer runs freaking hot). So it's not like it was running constantly. It was working fine this afternoon and all of a sudden this evening I noticed I was starting to smell something akin to clothes left in the dryer too long and my legs were burning. I fiddled with the connections to no avail. It's dead. The most annoying part is this is the only laptop cooling device in this town so now I have to take this piece of crap back to the store and get another one until a better model arrives in the mail. Sure it's only $[...], but for $[...] I'm sure I can find something that, oh, I don't know, works for longer than two weeks?At least the fans were quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was wonderful for the first few months...","review":"It cooled my 15.4 laptop fairly well for the first few months and then out of nowhere starting making this grinding noise from the right fan. I don't understand what could be causing this because I don't ever move the cooler, it stays on my desk all the time. I would poke at it and sometimes it would quiet down but nowadays even the gentle poking isn't working. It's LOUD and GRINDING. But again, it's a good investment if you need something you'll only use for 5-6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus Coolpad","review":"Decent price. Customizeble. Saves your notebook from coffee spills. Small fits in your back pack and cools off your laptop.

It saves my lap from getting burned. I also use it on my desk for the fact that it swivels. I love that because I can easily get to the back to the notebook for plugging things in and out.

This fan is surprisingly quiet and feels really sturdy. It fits great under my 15\\" laptop and under my husbands 17\\" as well. The newer version of this has a great new design. The price on Amazon is much cheaper than I saw in several online and regular stores when I was shopping around. All around great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK product but doesn't last long","review":"Expect this item to last about 5 or six months with rigorous use. I have had 3, 1 died in a couple months, one lasted about 5 months and the third is still running after about 9 months, but I bought a backup because its going to die soon. There is something with the fan location that usually causes the pad to make noise after a few months, making it unuseable. At list price it is expensive...I see it is now ten bucks and at that price, buy a few, and, you'll have ONE good cooling pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targus Podium Coolpad","review":"The Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for laptop / notebook computers is best used only for a single location. Its multiple \\"Lego\\" type parts for adjusting its tilt angle can come apart quite easily and be lost if it is used as a portable device. Losing only a few of the stackable pieces can make the coolpad unusable as designed. The oginial Targus Coolpad has only one pre-set tilt angle, but is far more user friendly, especially as a portable unit, which is pretty much the purpose of a laptop / notebook computer. Targus should start making the original model once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Podium CoolPad (not the ChillPad)","review":"I've used the Podium CoolPad for several years now and love it. The three things I like best are:1 - The space under the laptop really helps keep everything cooler,2 - It slides nicely into the bag with the laptop requiring very little space, and3 - It does not require power that drains the battery and adds to the heat problem.The only reason I did not give the Podium CoolPad 5 stars is that I wish it were a couple of inches wider. I like using it on my lap to help keep both the laptop and myself cooler and those extra two inches would add to the stability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"The power cord fatigued into uselessness quickly. Slipping the pad in and out of my backpack caused me to lose the rubber footies in short order. Even when the footies were there, it didn't cool that well unless I overvolted the fans to 10 V. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"It didn't work as I thought it would. The laptop didnt get hot as fast but it was still quite hot.

Purchased two more.","review":"I've been using this Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad for about 3 weeks now. I have to say it has made a big difference on my IBM ThinkPad T40. It used to get so hot that I worried about it locking up some day. Also the battery life was getting shorter everyday. Now it seems that I'm getting a lot better life and I don't worry about the hard drive getting hot and failing. Wish I had this when I got the lap top originally. To that note, I purchased two more chill pads for my kid's laptops which I just purchased in the last month. They are in college so their HP Notebooks get plenty of use. Hope the chill pad works as well for them. I would recommend this product. Great for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small size","review":"This was too small for my 17 inch laptop?

The Targus Chill Pad looks nice, but it's not as useful as I hoped. F1. As another reviewer noted, the power cord often comes out of the plug & I have to check the fans several times to make sure they are still working.2. The fans, while quiet, are not very powerful. I think one with a higher RPM will be more helpful.3. The cooler is about an inch too small (all around) for my laptop. This doesn't bother me very much, but for those of you with larger laptops, the Targus will be much too small.4. Finally, even when the fans are working full time, the wristpad is still very warm to the touch, even after only using the laptop for 10 minutes.

I bought this item at Best Buy about 2 days ago, and already this cooling pad is broken, and I'm going to return it.

The pad itself works well -- the weak link is the power cord. The first one had a bad connection in the plug end. After repairing it with some home soldering and electrical tape to cover the wires, it worked well enough to wait for the replacement cord from Targus.

Within two weeks, the wires into the on/off switch were falling out of the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targus Chill Pad","review":"This cooler stopped working 2 months after I got it.

This product does NOT plug into anything. It's a silly piece of plastic that elevates the laptop back, allowing airflow underneath. It breaks down into something about the size of a notebook and a giant roll of spree candies and gets stuffed into my travel bag. It's easy to use, it's small and light, and it takes up no energy from my laptop (which I've read causes the laptop to heat up even more). I highly recommend this product (or if you feel industrious go build something similar yourself) as a great option to cooling your laptop. Ignore the 360-degree rotation option because the lap top gets a little wobbly when you rotate the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"This is a great, low-tech and efficient accessory for a laptop. I have had one for several years & as I move from notebook to notebook, it follows along very well. Simple - no fans or batteries - it raises the laptop slightly to allow the vents to cool more efficiently. It's also great as a means to swivel the notebook around in place without actually picking it up or otherwise moving it. This was a great buy years ago & I intend to buy another one for my husband's new laptop. The rubber pads on the bottom help keep the notebook in place when swiveling or just typing & I would not use the laptop for any length of time without having this baby in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targus PA248U Chill Pad","review":"Worked for all of a month.

All with the same issues. Either the wire stopped working or one of the fans. It is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long.

The antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are 2 different PA248U models","review":"The chill pad in the picture (silver rectangle) is NOT the model that's shipped today. The model pictured is the older model (item #21) and it was great. It was made of very sturdy plastic and VERY quietly cooled my laptop like a refrigerator. My only complaint with it was that the switch on the cable got broken.The new ones have the exact same model number PA248U (only the new one is item #22) but is a brownish gray, curved like an hourglass, and the switch is on the pad not the cable. Targus was either dumb or deceptive on the model number. This model is a piece of junk: it apparently uses less rigid plastic, runs very loudly until the plastic heats up. Then the fans hit the inside of the housing and either quit working or make even louder scraping sounds. I bought two (thinking I was getting the original pads) and thought I'd try them out. Oddly, they both become defective right after the Amazon return date. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed connector","review":"I've been through two of these chill pads in the last month. The reason is the power connector: it's at the back of the pad. If you ever use your laptop actually on your lap, for example sitting on a bed, you're going to keep bumping into that connector. The connector itself is cheap and doesn't fit well into the cooler's socket. The result is that it eventually breaks off and stops working. If you use your laptop anywhere other than on a desk, I would strongly recommend skipping this one and getting the Antec cooler instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BVYTV"},{"rating":"1","title":"This really Blows!","review":"The product worked great for about a week.

I returned it, got another one. It worked for about 2 months. So I had to deal with Targus. No go on the return. They told me it was a problem caused by misusing it. It had a little on/off toggle installed in the USB cable. Both times it came unwired. Parts stuck out.It was not turned on or off more than once. My computer sits on the desk. I don't even generally move it to sit it on my lap. I did that with the first chill mat. With the second I did not move it. Left it on the desk, just unplugged the USB end of the cord. It came unwired anyway.Don't buy this one, buy one that will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for laptops and Xbox360's!","review":"I used a freeware system monitor utility to see if this thing actually brought down HDD, CPU, and GPU temperatures. Low and behold, it actually did reduce them all by 2 to 5 degrees or more depending on the load of the computer.I also used this little guy to sit underneath my Xbox360 - a device known to produce extreme temperatures. I can't make an objective assessment of this technique, but the cooling is clearly much better than when the xbox is sitting on the carpet. Based on the results from my laptop test, this definitely gives me peace of mind when running the Xbox for Xtended periods of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, plastic, junk","review":"I would not recommend this product.

For pity's sake, don't buy one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at First","review":"I got this to keep my laptop from setting my lap on fire. It worked pretty well if I moved it so that one of the fans was actually under the CPU. This sort of threw the whole system into an oddly unbalanced set up unless I was at my desk. But then, after less than a month of use, the power switch on it broke off leaving disconnected wires and no power. I got out the wire strippers and put the thing back together temporarily, but this thing is just poorly made. Its not a notebook cooler if the fans won't spin.What I did like about this is that it is lightweight so it doesn't add extra pounds to my already too heavy bag, and the fans ran pretty quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power keeps breaking","review":"Does the trick but the power cord pooped out on me twice.

Before purchasing the chill pad my notebook would run extremity hot. Now I don't play that many games on my notebook. But I do watch a lot of movies on it. Before useing the chill pad my movie watching was very limited to one maybe two movies at a time than my notebook would become to hot to use. But with the chill pad I seem to be able to watch one movie after another with no problem. And I'm sure the chill pad would work the same for people who play a lot of games as well. The construction of the pad is good. The wiring on the latest model. Is a lot better than on the older one. There's also a model that comes with UBS ports on it. In conclusion the Targus Chill Pad is a good inexpensive way to keep your notebook cool and in good working order"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little addition to my notebook","review":"I just thought I'd add my 2 cents here because it seems like this item has gotten it's fair share of bad reviews. I've got a really bad back so I spend a lot of my time on the couch lying down and my notebook would get so hot from my clothing or blankets. Since I got my Chill Pad my notebook has never overheated and it has managed to survive through 2 notebooks. I've never had a problem with it all, and I've owned it for about 3 years now.I bought one for my friend a year ago and she has managed to break the power cord twice, so I'll agree with the bad design there. I've found that by tying up the cord (I use a velcro cable tie) it doesn't get yanked out and stays out of the way. I've suggested that she do the same next time around. To be honest, I think the on/off switch could be removed since the pad powers off when the laptop is turned off.All in all, I think this is a pretty decent product for cooling down your notebook and it's well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL item","review":"I live in El Salvador. I just bought an Averatec 3220 laptop and this chill pad. Hey! They are just the same size (12.1\\" screen laptop) and even though i work without A/C, the double fans keeps the laptop as cool as if I have just turned it on! And remember i live in the tropics!

Running the processor for that long can cause thermal shutdowns, so I rigged together a $10 solution using blocks and a fan. It was unwieldly, but it worked. I thought the Targus would be a better solution, since it claims to be designed for just this sort of thing. The weak fans cool the outer casing, but does nothing for the processor, because the thermal shutdowns returned.If you want to cool your lap, this may work fine. If you want to cool your actual computer, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I purchased this the same day I purchased my newest laptop. I've had a few laptops but none were my own, so I wanted to be sure I protected my investment. The reason I purchased this product was because it was all I could find in my area and I did not want to wait for shipping. It made a huge difference in cooling my Laptop's temperature down, but it only worked for two weeks. I have no idea why it stopped, it has not been mishandled, and there is nothing wrong with the cord that I can see. It is also difficult to use in conjunction with a tilted table or laptop stand; the laptop tends to slide off of it. Very disappointing, I wish I had saved my packaging so I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is great when it runs","review":"The main problem is with the electrical connector. You have to wiggle it to make it works. After a while you have to wiggle it more and hope.Don't buy this product until they decide to use a $0.10 connector instead of a $0.05 connector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tornado","review":"I purchased this product about 2-3 months ago, and it has already quit working! It did do an okay job, but what a waste of money it has turned out to be. It is worth purchasing a better-quality laptop cooler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"As a college student, I find it necessary to keep my laptop on for days on end. It would sit on top of a plastic blotter and, within the span of a few weeks, the heat coming from the laptop warped the plastic. Within SECONDS of placing this product under my laptop, the computer stopped spewing heat and the chassis cooled down.Overall, an excellent buy. Worth it's weight in gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cools some but returned for better product","review":"I purchased the Targus CoolPad Notebook lift and it did help cool down the notebook some but was not pleased with the quality and the amount it cooled down. I felt my notebook was not well protected from slipping while using it.I returned it and purchased another product that I am very well pleased with.My notebook is very secure on it and it does keep my notebook much cooler than the Targus did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shoddy","review":"These chinese made motors are really the cheapest possible...Mine stopped working after only a month! Basically junk, as other reviewers have noted. Targus has been good about replacements in the past, but I will try for a refund from CompUSA"},{"rating":"1","title":"cupcake or muffin pan","review":"our inspirion 8200 notebook kept getting so hot when i was using it while sitting it on my lap...\\"laptop\\" anyway it would get so hot at times it would leave burns on my leg in desparation to help..my husband gave me a cupcake/muffin baking pan i simply turned it over and placed the computer on it. Wha-la our laptop stays much cooler and no longer shuts down and we didn't have to spend any money. Just a little good ole fashion ingenuity!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably will not hold up","review":"I have had this for about 5 days now and it has worked pretty good for the first few days. Now i will look under my notebook every so often and the fans are shut off. I have to fiddle with the power cord for it to turn back on. A simple rotation of the cord around the power hole seems to get the fans going but i can't imagine this will hold up much longer.The one thing I like about this is that the cord is long. This is sometimes a distraction but when i am near a deskop I can plug it into that computer instead of my notebook even if it is on the floor below."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 2 months","review":"Works great for cooling your laptop. After 1 day I noticed that the wires near the on/off switch were exposed. I had to keep pushing the cable back in to get it to work. Today it completely stopped working. I just ordered a new cooler different brand. For now I just turned it over and put it under my laptop. It lets air get under there so it does keep it cool just not the way its supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"item is not in good condition","review":"I like this product, but it was not in good condition when I received it. damn it...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One fan made a scraping noise","review":"You're money is better spent on another product.It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made. A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged. I had one fan made a scraping noise.The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I bought Targus because of it's price and ratings on Amazon. I'm disappointed with the results I've gotten from this product. After a month or so, the fans stopped working. I received the same product from a friend and only after a few minutes of work the fans stopped working yet again. It has been my conclusion that the fans stop working at a certain temperature (ironic, isn't it?). I still have both Chill Pads, and when they occasionally stop working I switch one for the other. All that money wasted..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but Only for Limited Time","review":"I bought this product the first time in August. By late September/early October, the fan stopped turning on. I'd flip the switch and nothing would happen.Then, I returned it b/c it was still w/in the 90 days to return for Amazon. Got a new one, b/c I thought the one I had was defective. It worked until early December, but by then I was studying for my first round of law school finals, so obviously, I didn't have time to spend returning the item.I discovered in December that if I carefully switched the switch to a certain point, very delicately in just the right position somewhere between the middle and on, it would work. But, if I made the slightest movement, it would stop the fans again!Now, the 90 days has passed and I'm stuck w/ it. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I'm buying another brand, and hopefully that will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hotpad","review":"Even tho this is pretty cheap, it totally doesn't cool down my notebook PC, so it's just a piece of totally useless metal plate. In theory it should lift up your notebook to allow better air flow at the bottom, but in reality no, it doesn't have any cooling affect at all. It's cheap, but still a waste of money for a student like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike two...I'm moving on","review":"I use a laptop at home...on my lap. I've gone thru two of these units now. The first unit lasted only about 2 weeks, but I'd lost the receipt so couldn't do anything about getting money back. So I bought another, and it lasted about 4 months until it started to not really work well, and now (a total of 7 months into ownership) it finally died completely. The concept is great. The product is cheaply made and doesn't last as long as it should. Computer stores sell this product for like $40...insane.Today I'm buying a different brand...we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I'm in the habit of sitting on my bed or sofa and using my laptop, and I bought this so I would be able to play Warcraft without burning my legs. It worked pretty well for about a year, and then the fans died. Figuring that it had been dropped or otherwise mishandled, I went out to buy another one. It died after a month. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I went back to using my senior yearbook as a heat shield rather than buying a third. It gets two stars instead of one because it actually kept my computer (and my lap) comparitively cool...still, you'd be better off cooling your laptop with a ziplock baggie full of ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me!","review":"I bought this product an I do believe less than a month later it stopped working. I also have a friend that purchased it, and it stopped working a few weeks after she bought it. I really regret buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Bad Implementation","review":"I had high hopes for this product, which is perhaps why I'm not giving it a high rating.This Chill Pad simply does not work. The idea is great, I'd love something that takes the heat away from my MacBook Pro, but this simply doesn't do it. My hands and lap are sweating as I type this review.For $20 I can't really complain. But buyer's beware, this won't magically take away all of the heat. It does provide some sort of shield between your lap and your laptop, but a book or newspaper can provide the same protection. The fans do little to no cooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Noisy","review":"I loved it when I first bought it but after approx. 4 months it really started getting loud. Whenever it was on it sounded like a jet. I owned this for alittle over a year and recently threw it away because the fans were working inconsistently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I have this chill pad and all I can say is I wish we had taken it back. It is not good if you like to use your laptop on your couch on your lap, it might be better on a hard surface. If you use it on your lap the laptop will constantly be sliding off the unit. We have had ours for a little over a year and the fans just went out, not that they cooled that well in the first place. I wouldn't waste your money if you want something you can use for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bargain At Any Price! BUY THE ZALMAN!","review":"BUY A ZALMAN!!!I purchased this chill mat, and it worked for a short period of time. The connector would not stay in, because it was a prong-type connector and not a USB connector. The company sent me a new cord, but it would not stay in, either. I tried every which way to support the connector, so it would stay in, but finally gave up!Bought the Zalman, and it has a variable fan, which is almost silent and haven't had a moment's problem with it.You won't regret going with the Zalman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I received the package. When I went to plug it in to use it it didn't work. Plain and simple. The product also was put together very cheezy."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor wiring","review":"soon within months of using this product, the wiring was not working. this seller quickly sent me a new wiring, which worked perfectly for a year, but not has stopped working again. the manufacturer was unwilling to send me a new wire since it is now out of warranty. my roommate has this same item, and her wiring doesn't work either. granted, the product works fairly well while in warranty, but the wire that connects from the laptop to the cooling pad is not built to last for more than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable - there are better options out there I hope!","review":"The cooling mat was okay at first (although it has never been very portable because of the bulky shape). Within a month, the fans started \\"sputtering\\" and turning off whenever they wanted until one day they stopped turning on at all. We still use it as a barrier between the computer and legs but it works the same as a book which I am sure you can find around your house for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"New model is too LOUD","review":"I've had the previous version for about a year and was happy with it - until the power cord failed. A few times I forgot the thing was attached to my laptop's USB port and jerked the cable pretty hard.So for ten bucks, I didn't hesitate to buy another. Unfortunately they've redesigned the unit (doesn't look like the picture as shown on this date) and the two fans are a lot noisier now. It looks better I guess, but the sound is going to drive me nuts until I find a replacement.Can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Model NOT the same as pictured","review":"The item I received was NOT the same as the item pictured. I previously owned one of the Targus PA248U Chill Pads pictured, and it was a wonderful product - small, quiet, and effective. So I ordered another from Amazon, expecting to get the same product. However, the item I received was the \\"next generation\\" of this item, which is totally different than the item pictured but with the same model number. The item that was actually shipped to me was hour-glass shaped, black, and was EXTREMELY loud. (I could actually hear the fan running from over 50 feet away.)Kudos to Amazon for accepting the returned item and giving me a full refund, including return shipping. I'd like to see them update the pictures on this item though, so that other people don't have the same problems I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"complete waste of my money. the first time i bought it, worked fine for 2 months, then the stupid on off switch cable was comming apart, so i bought a new one. then the new one had the same exact issue. in addition, i have a 17 inch laptop, this cooler barely does the work, it will work fine for anything smaller than a 17 inch. i purchased a coolermaster notepal and that cooler is so much better. the only good thing with this is that it works fine if you want to work on your lap, other then that, i would not invest my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product but not durable","review":"When I first bought this product it was great. It kept my laptop cool, its light weight and its very quiet. But it fell apart quickly. The on/off switch broke off and I ended up just securing the wires by hand and lots of duct tape. Then the little plastic pieces over the fans broke off. Granted, I used this daily for two years and took it around the world a few times so I got a lot of use out of it. I suppose if you just keep it at home most of the time it would last a lot longer.BTW: I recently bought the newer version of this (dark gray and thicker) and it sucks, its much louder than the older model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill on the Pad","review":"My notebook is happy to chill on this pad.. the product works well at keeping the computer cool enough so that the cpu cooling fan itself doesn't even need to run, 90%+ of the time. On the more rare occassions that I'm not jammin to music or there's other miscellaneous background noise, peace & quiet time basically, the fans in the pad are audibly noticeable. The pad fans' sound/noise is minimal though. Using the product several hours almost daily for about 2 months and it's running great. With the wear and tear I know it will incur going forward, I'll be satisfied if it runs effectively for 2 years. Indications so far seem that to be a reasonable expectation, at which time I'll update my rating to 5 stars. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Off is on...on is off which was ok till it stopped working completely (after just a few days).

My only criticism is that it is a little small for my laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus PA248U Tornado Notebook Chill Pad","review":"Excellent product. I was having trouble with the fan running constantly in my laptop. Since the purchase of this Chill Pad it hasn't come on once! Plus, it's light and fits right in the bag with the laptop. Recommend it to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notebook Chill Pad","review":"I like the product. It helps with the heat if you have your computer on your lap. It is very lightweight and easy to carry around. The only thing I was dissappointed with is it doesn't cool off the computer as much as I would have liked. But it does elevate your computer some and keeps it off of sensitive surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targus Chill Pad Vibrates","review":"Please do yourself a favor and forget about buying this noise maker. The chiller seems to convert your computer energy, via USB, into vibration noises. The air current seems to simply be a by-product of the need to rattle. Opt for a sturdier, more effective chiller. I'm avoiding this brand simply out of spite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else","review":"I should have read reviews for this product before purchasing, but I just picked it up quick at the store, and I'm sorry I did. The product is very cheaply made. The fans make too much noise. And now, after only typical usage, nothing heavy or out of the ordinary, not even a lot of travel, the fans are working only intermittently, and I am going to have to replace this product. Definitely not worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Although its a bit pricey, its a really good product. You can change the height depending on how much space you need your laptop to have from the surface. It helps so much with the ventilation process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 3 days after purchase","review":"After i bought this product (not on amazon) it wouldnt work after a couple days cause where you plug the port into the chill mat broke. and it was kind of noisy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it nice and cool","review":"I before I got this product my HP laptop got so hot on its bottom that I couldn't touch it for more than five seconds! After buying it, my computer is nice and cool, even after long use on my lap. Using it is also extremely easy. It plugs into the USB port and takes very little energy from your computer so you can use it even on battery. It also comes with an on/off button so you can control its use. My suggestion: if you are worried about your computer getting to hot or creating damage to your wood top desks, buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!","review":"I am a long time very satisified Amazon.com customer. I recently purchased this Chill Mat manufactured by Targus. After owning it for approximately 3 weeks I noticed permanent black stains on my dining room table and coffee table where I regularly use the chill mat. The stains are a result of the little black rubber feet on the bottom of the mat.My furninture is permanently damaged from using this product, and I just felt the need to warn others that may be considering purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targus Chill Pad is really disappointing","review":"I bought this to use at home with my powerbook. I use an Antec cooling pad at my office which works very well. This cooling pad is really disappointing. The fans barely move and my powerbook's fan still has to come on to supplement. I bought this one to save 5 bucks. I should have just paid 5 bucks more for another Antec cooling pad. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cool!","review":"Good price and fast shipping. But, the fan noise may lull you to sleep if you enjoy the white noise. I can't realy complain for the price was nice and the product does do what it was intended to do, and I do like that it has a USB connection and you don't have to plug it into a wall outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"great item @ first but......","review":"When we first bought this product, it was great! It worked and cooled our HP notebook. The fans were a bit noisy but it did it's job. Now 3 months later the on/off switch that is on the usb doesn't work. Therefore our product doesn't work for our laptop. I had contacted the company via email with their website about their warranty. They have not gotten back to me about replacing this usb cord. Due to this issue, I will never purchase another item from this company. This is a poor idea for a design with on/off switch is on the usb cord. It should have been on the mat itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Chill Pad","review":"My Dell Latitude gets very hard workouts every day and runs hot most of the time. The internal fan just doesn't work adequately. The Targus fan made all the difference. Runs cool and operation of laptop has actually improved. A slightly bit noisy but not problemmatical. Next generation they should quiet them down a bit. Well worth it and highly recommended and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"In theory this is an awesome product, but...","review":"in reality, it isn't. I have had my Chillpad for some time now. I don't take it with me, so it stays in the same spot on my desk all of the time. I have had some of the same problems other reviewers had: the on/off switch has fallen apart completely and the fans can be pretty loud. The product itself seems cheaply constructed and I wish the fans were moved to the back and not in the middle of the pad. With that being said, the fans do help keep my laptop cool. Long story short, if your laptop runs too hot, this will help. I just would shop around for other alternatives first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was on sale!","review":"I bought this in February and the price was 13.99. I thought it was such a great deal with all the good reviews so I bought it. Well, it doesn't look like the picture...it's the one with the curved sides. But that didn't really bother me. It worked great at first, it was just kind of loud. Now it randomly chooses to work at all! I don't know if it's the connection or what...but now it's merely a surface to sit the laptop on.I suggest not bargain shopping on this sort of thing. :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but won't last long","review":"I bought this Chill pad and had it for about 6 months before the fans stopped working. Targus was nice enough to send me a replacement free of charge. That one worked for about 3 months before it stopped working and once again Targue send me what appeared to be a better more expensive model (Not this one I'm writing the review for). I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop cooler unless you want to be stuck having the frustration of sending it back to Targus every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"would have been nice if it didn't break!","review":"this notebook chill pad is a great product...until it broke about a few months later. It's not like I man-handled it either.

Less than two weeks out of the box, one of the fans began to grind and make noise periodically. The upside was that Targus agreed to replace the unit; the downside was that they wanted five weeks to do it. Five weeks! What am I supposed to do in the meantime?This is the first product of its type that I have owned, but I was pretty shocked, given its price, at how flimsy it was when I took it out of the box. Since I purchased it, the price has dropped drastically (at least temporarily), but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it even at the reduced price. It is just a mickey mouse device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, Clunky Sounds only after 2-3 months","review":"Worked well when brand spanking new but not a long-term product.
