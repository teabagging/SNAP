This edition steps things up a bit with higher-end materials than the usual plastic.That said, I would have liked it if the quality of construction had also been stepped up to match. A bit more precision on the cutting, and rounding all of the edges would have really made a big difference (the metal's stamped, and so winds up rounded on one side but not the other).Still, it's a pleasure to play with these pieces.

The music and dance moves are terrific!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time!","review":"Tamilee's videos/DVDs are usually excellent but not this one! Boring, boring, boring. Most of the work out is like an extended warm-up. Slowwww. If you are an intermediate or experienced exerciser, you're going to need to pick up the pace on your own, otherwise you won't break a sweat. Also, Tamilee sings every few minutes throughout the workout and it's extremely annoying. The music is really low volume and slow-paced so it doesn't provide much energy to the workout. The good points: She's her usual ethusiastic self and cues the moves well. It's also cool that the participants in the video are all different body sizes. I'm glad I checked this out from the library or I'd be mighty ticked at shelling out cash for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tunes but definitely not a great workout","review":"I ordered this video from collagevideo.com (they sell exercise videos and DVDs), who gave it a \\"beginners\\" labeling. Well, beginners is right, because I didn't break a sweat each time I did this tape. It barely gets your heart pumping. It has good '60s soul songs but if you're looking for a video to really exercise to, then this isn't the tape for you. It's just too slow. However I suppose it's good for some people who may need low-low-impact exercises. My overall rating is 2 stars because I didn't feel like I had exercised after this tape. It felt like I had just walked briskly up a flight of stairs...and that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun moves!","review":"I really enjoy this workout by Tamilee...it's my favorite Tamilee of all that I've tried so far! Very 60s girl group moves (think Supremes)!I can't say that I work up a huge sweat doing this one, but it's so fun that I just don't care! Not too complicated either. Tamilee seems to be having a good time. It's pretty low impact and I had no problems doing the workout on my carpeted surface.I'm looking forward to trying the other Tamilee Fit to the Hits workout as soon as Amazon gets it in stock!!!Recommend to anyone who always wanted to be a 60s backup singer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't sing along","review":"I really enjoy Tamilee and think she has a great, athletic body.

If you're sensitive to smells this might not be the product for you, it has a distinctive smell (almost sour) which does get a bit stronger during the night (nothing I couldn't handle). When I put the patch on I felt a tingling sensation and warming. I was pretty open to the fact that this might not do anything for me; however, I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up. I felt good and the patch was very 'brown' (and stinky). What surprised me was how differently brown the patch had gotten depending on what part of the sole it had adhered to. After taking a shower the 'foot patch smell' was gone. All in all, I liked the product. Also, my boyfriend (who slept in the same bed with the same cover on) tried one patch on one of his soles and his was hardly discolored at all in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Sucker.","review":"Okay, so these are little adhesive patches with botanical(?) stuff in them that smells horrible. You wear these on your feet at night, and I think they make your feet sweat, and the sweat turns the funky botanical stuff dark. Think smelly adhesive tea bags taped to your feet.

Thank you for all your information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takara Foot Patch is Stink, Very Sticky and Doesn't Work!","review":"I've tried it and will not every use it again! First of all, it's very very stink! Smells like smoke meat! In addition, it gets very sticky due to the adhesive that you must use. Even after scrubbing my feet the \\"glue\\" stays on and the smell never goes away, just like being sprayed by a skunk! I've also tested the integrity of the product because you see pictures where at first the patch is clear in the before photo and black/brown in the after photo. Well, actually I had put water on it and guess what, it turned brown. I have discovered that it is the sweat that causes it to change color. The product, like most others, are too good to be true! I suggest that you don't waste your time or money on this horrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Don't waste your time or money.

Most of the DVD is decidedly green-tinted. My VHS of copies of the interviews are clearly better overall in picture quality and color balance. I am an avid collector and this tape is not necessary if you've bought the other tapes, such as Longleat '83 and The Stranger episodes with the Doctors interviews. I don't recommend this DVD for anybody because if you're a fan, you already have the interviews, probably in better quality, and if you're new to DW, you'll be lost, totally lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"Book arrived in new condition at a good price, and in timely arrival.Would do business with this vendor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"New edition spares the frustration!","review":"Boyd's revised edition of Virgil's Aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the AP Latin: Virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all Classicists. With all the lines on the AP syllabus and no more, Boyd's Aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test. Each page has a paragraph of Latin text, with numerous footnotes underneath, offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints. A glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words. While Clyde Pharr's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary, the Pharr text contains ALL of books 1-9 only, meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the Aeneid. Thus, Boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered: it contains only what is on the syllabus. It is a great way to study Virgil's classic epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition!","review":"This CD is an excellent addition to Peter's book.

All the while feeling great and very motivated to continue. My preferance for foods has changed. I now crave vegetables, grains and fish.

(See my review about the book.). I definitely would not recommend the CD either because it is poorly organized in its presentation of the program. Glickman seems to be in conversation with some guy who sounds like a paid DJ. The information was also repetitive in nature such that I got the impression that Glickman was using up \\"air time\\".

I shouldn't have hesitated. I truly love this wonderful decorating book and I am very particular about which ones appeal to me. I love a cottage look which I understand is a broad term and interpretted differently by each person. To clarify, this book appeals to my aesthetic which is quaint, cozy and casual but not too \\"precious\\". You won't find lots of pink, bows, or ruffles. You will find mismatched furniture and dishes, natural materials and textures (think wood or stone floors instead of gleaming marble or wall-to-wall carpeting) quilts, florals, denim, checks, tarnished silver and antique glass bottles.

This time I experienced, through Nebel-Rhodes, the downward spiral of alcoholism and the altered states of the bi-polar personality. Many authors write about their lives as alcoholics or their hell with manic depression, but Nebel-Rhodes takes you with her on the trip. From her achingly disjointed childhood journey, through her multiple relationships seeking love and acceptance, to her release to a higher power, the author lets you run with her from Virginia to Nepal as the alcoholism consumes her spirit and nearly her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Effort","review":"Season one and two of this TV series stayed true to the heart of the story.

I will buy season 3 but I wont watch it, in fact I can barely get through the last three episodes of season two. I felt let down by the producers.

This season warped a beautiful show into a depressing, \\"action\\" farce with too much angst and not enough of the concepts the first two seasons embraced - compassion, wonder, family, justice, and love. If you're an old fan, its probably necessary to complete the set. I'll probably buy it at some point so I can throw out my old tapes, but I won't watch it. For new fans, I would simply recommend making up your own ending to season 2 (or enjoying one of the fine endings others have come up with over the years) and enjoying the show for what it was meant to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible end to a great series","review":"If you are considering buying all three years of this series, you need to reconsider.

Now I have it for posterity. Catherine and Vincent - gone, but never forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I can never watch 3rd season again","review":"I was one of the many fans who fought CBS to bring back this wonderful show. That old saying \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" sure came true in my opinion here. I will always feel betrayed by CBS, Ron Koslow the producer and the writers of this show. Better they had been truthful to those of us fighting that Linda Hamilton would not be returning and the show would be going in a completely new direction. The show was titled \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and with the terribly painful killing of The Beauty the soul of this show and the reason for watching was lost to me.I know there are many fans of third season. Enjoy but I cannot.I still entertain some faint hope that this will come back someday as a movie with Vincent and Catherine. Hopefully with Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton before they are too old to play the roles, but perhaps with new actors if need be.

But with this record, it just isn't the case. This album doesn't work: it self-destructs, sometimes violently. If you want to hear this sort of thing done right, check out Storm and Stress' \\"Under Thunder and Florescent Lights\\", a much more thoroughly thought out free jazz/post rock hybrid.Pretentious, over-rated, less fun than \\"Portable Model Of\\", less beautiful than \\"How Memory Works\\", this is Joan of Arc's most ambitious album, and also their worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"?!","review":"$98 for a cutting board?

A great book read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RQ is a must have in ones collection of music","review":"I found RQ to be a very interesting mix of songs....some that make you reflect on life and search your feelings and some that make you smile and just want to do a sing-a-long with them. I hope this cd has a warranty as mine will probably be worn out. Keep up the good work Cris & Tret."},{"rating":"2","title":"These songs don't just grow on you - they flow through you!","review":"Unlike artists whose music & lyrics offer little substance & follow trends, Cris & Tret set the bar high, writing directly from their lives & hearts to ours. 'Radio Quiet entices us not only to listen to, but also explore each song/story for ourselves, from wherever we are. These songs don't just grow on you - they flow through, challenge & inspire you to grow. For me, 'Radio Quiet' is the continuance of a soundtrack for life that makes the unlikely more attainable, the pain more bearable, the laughter sweeter, & the love deeper! If you haven't heard them yet, or for a while - Don't waste another minute, you owe yourself the gift that Cris, Tret, &'Radio Quiet' are!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"something's missing","review":"having enjoyed previous albums of this duo so very much, we were let down by this album. There was a palpalble absence of lyrical depth that can only be described as disappointing. A few songs, however, still show the old sparkle, and promise that subsequent albums may hit the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The songs all sound the same, with a beat that, after so much repetition, is annoying.

All of the music and words of their songs have so much depth and meaning.

I was excited to have another Cris Album. I own them all!! I was so disappointed in it. I have listened to it several times looking for the depth, sincerity and thought provoking movement that is present in ALL of Cris's work. It simply is not available in this CD. I am glad to add a New solo album \\"Ashes\\" from Cris recently that returns to all of the creativity and depth that make her a tremendous artist! The break up of the duo may have wounded her personal life, but it seems to have saved her career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Pulls You In...And Keeps You There!","review":"I started reading this book in a local bookstore and it got me curious so I had to purchase the book to find out the rest of the story. I found the book to be excellent: it keeps you on the edge of your seat, it leads you to believe things (only to find out you didn't know what you thought you knew), it has different twists to throw you off, is well written, and is easy to read. To be honest, I'm 32 years old and pick up \\"young adult\\" type books in order to give me a break from books by Grisham or Clancey. It's good to enjoy a book without having to think too hard.

Having the markings where you are looking down on them was something I with I had thought up. Well, they are great and they are made of plastic so they are light. My only complaint is that they didn't put 1/3 cup markings heads up. Definitly gets my stamp of approval."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottoms crack","review":"I love OXO products - truly great design.

Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware-don't buy because they CRACK.","review":"I bought 3 different size measuring cups of this type and each one eventually got a hairline crack at the mold injection site (either side of bump on bottom of cup). You won't see it until you notice your countertop is wet after measuring a liquid in it, as it leaks very slowly....wrote Oxo about this problem, as these measuring cups are not cheap, and bought a better brand thinking they would be high quality. I am awaiting Oxo's response. I think buying glass would be a better idea, you don't have to worry about whether or not to use it in the microwave either, causing the crack to happen even sooner. I always top rack washed them in my DW. Kind of a bummer, as I really liked the accurate measuring lines for liquids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great timesaver.","review":"These measuring cups, while only a subtle improvement over others, will save you time and aggravation. The vertically-readable scales allow you to quickly and precisely measure just the right amount of whatever liquid your recipe calls for. And you will be able to do it without bending over to see the marks, contorting yourself to simultaneously pour and view, or time-wasting trial and error. About the only negative I can say is that at least one of these cups has begun scuffing off the scale which over time could compromise accuracy. As of now this has not been a real problem, though.Buy these measuring cups and throw everything else away, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real piece of crap","review":"Sound quality on this unit -incoming and outgoing messages - is awful. After about a month, the machine started freezing, not picking up calls etc. I called ATT customer sevice, they had no insight into the nature of the problem.

The problem is not with Amazon, rather it is with the DVD. After replacing the one I ordered, the problem still occurs. At 19 minutes or so, it skips and your workout is ruined. Upon looking at the back of the DVD, there are bubbles all over it. I think this is the problem. So, I am also going to write to the company that makes this and let them know the problem.

If your a beginner without a clue like I was, this book will defintely put things into perpective. After reading this book, I was hungry for more information, I needed more knowledge.

I had the same problem with our old Honeywell air cleaners - and I wonder if they didn't work well because I was using non-Honeywell filters in them. (In that case it was no longer possible to buy the Honeywell filters.) This is one area where Amazon quality seems very low to me - why do they allow sellers to claim these are genuine filters?

Death Valley is a huge park and to produce a quality guide one must go into some depth and do copius research. Aside from some nice color photos here there just is not much good to say about this little book. Except for the one or two day rushed visitor, who will never again return, this guide doesn't even come close to being helpful. If you just want to make a one-time quicky visit, drive through and never take the time to really see and discover Death Valley I suppose you could find this of some use.

I'm highlighting pages and finding out things about myself, my husband AND my boy who is ADHD, Aspergers, gifted and has CAPD (auditory processing problems). I personally feel they are all somewhat related, and you don't get true giftedness without some other problems. I disagree with a previous reviewer who thought it was a book more for professionals.

Now, a few years later, I came across the Celtic Devotional. I greatly enjoy the religious freedom of the book - many faiths can use this without compromise. She claims in the beginning that it is a mix of paganism and gnostic Christianity. She blends them quite well together and I especially enjoy following her meditations in the morning and at night. As a follower of the druidic path, I was happy to see that time is divided by seasons and that each season has its own problems, petitions, wonders, and thanksgivings. The only thing about the book I would change would be the structure. Some of the meditations are too short and the prayers too vague, but, then again, that allows us more freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditative, sweet, good.","review":"Skillful daughter, Creative Son, Grandfather counsel, Grandmother wisdom....

The book is separated into seasonal prayers and meditations, with a morning and evening prayer for each day of the week and each Celtic season of the year.

I met George Abela as a student in my classroom and was most impressed with his genuity, focus, and compassion. This text far in excess fulfills its mission: to lay out the case of all aspects of vascular disease, without being pedantic or practice-biased. Even today, years after its publication, it has a proper place in the library of any clinician who wants a complete understanding of the complex multiform disease processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Workout","review":"Tamilee's workouts consist of a combination of isometrics, Pilates-style moves, and good old-fashioned repetitions. I alternate this workout with her Tighter Assets Cardioblast (which burns more calories). Thus, this weight loss workout is fine on its own, and is particularly effective when used in combination with Tamilee's more action-packed Cardioblast. Both are demanding workouts, but I am a 59-year-old with arthritis, and I can still complete this workout. A final advantage of this workout is that it only takes approximately 30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Circuit Training-Excellent Abs","review":"This workout alternates between lower and upper body and is chaptered. The lower body portion uses a step and gets the heart rate up nicely while working legs and glutes at the same time. The last segment before the stretch is abs with a heavy dumbbell - very effective. The 10-minute bonus abs section focuses entirely on obliques - excellent to add on for a total of a 40-minute workout. I felt my obliques and glutes the next day and I consider myself advanced. I really like the workout, but have a couple of gripes (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars):1. The Natural Journeys commercial plays at the beginning and cannot be skipped.2. The body part Tamilee neglects is chest. I noticed this also with the I Want That Body DVD (which is otherwise an excellent DVD also)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for light days","review":"I love the instruction of Tamilee, and even though her vids do not contain material for advanced exercisers to feel completely fatigued, I like the fact that on a \\"slow day\\" I can feel like I have accomplished something. This video is great in that area - the moves are great for the lower body, just squeeze while you are doing the moves!! The time flies, and I feel this is the perfect workout for a Friday, or for those days that you don't feel like, or just can't muster the energy for huffing and puffing.Most of the work is done on the step, and if you have bad knees, this is definitely not for you. The moves are mainly squats and lunges, with a little upper body mixed in.. I use 8 lb weights, and if nothing else, I feel that I at least get a little bit of heart rate increase with the moves. All in all, definitely worth the purchase.P.S. Make sure to stretch your legs on your own before this one, as she begins with the workout straight away without this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice","review":"I had told a fit friend of mine to find me a workout DVD to help me get started on an at-home weight loss program and this is the DVD he gave to me. I was extremely out of shape when I first popped this workout into the DVD player but found Tamilee to be comforting in helping me get stared. There are two other girls who exercise with Tamilee and one to follow for an easier workout. I started by following the girl in the back and found myself really feeling my muscles working. I was very pleased with the whole DVD and have kept it as part of my workout rotation.Another feature I was very please with was the Nutrition System menu located in the Special Features. It gives wonderful advice on eating right, what to and what not to eat along with a meal guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great workout from Tamilee","review":"Once again I really like this DVD. It definately got me breathing hard/sweating, but I didn't feel like I was getting my butt completely kicked, which is a good thing for me. I'm the type of exerciser who likes to get my heart rate up moderately along with getting moderately sweaty. Similar to 'I Want That Body' this DVD is classic toning that, for me, becomes low-level cardio (the lower body step parts). Tamilee is a great instructor, she has a great speaking voice, and the moves are simple enough that one viewing prior to actually doing the workout should be enough for anyone 'learn' them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"My biggest complaint about this DVD is there is virtually no warm-up and an insufficient cool down. In addition, although you will break a sweat, the movements are very jerky, and at times very fast paced, although for short intervals. Its a fast workout right out of the box -- there is nothing to build up to. And, I could see how someone could seriously hurt themselves using this DVD by trying to keep up. The 10 minute abs is o.k. Another overall comment I have is she does not ease into things and explain them very well. I'm sure there must be better out there -- but this is not it. I doubt I'll use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informational...","review":"Having been to Maui twice, my husband and I are planning an extended trip to Hawaii next year, this time to take in the other islands as well.

Well, I was very disappointed. The action scenes are all the same. A group of Russian soldiers is dug in as waves of German tanks and infantry approach only to be beaten back. Then there is the occassional strafing run by German planes. Some of the scenes are actually laughable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emily is thrilled with Alexa","review":"After a two month wait(out of stock) for Princess Alexa,I finally purchased her yesterday with my 5 year old granddaughter, Emily. I let her decide if she was what we had waited for. Emily was very excited to buy her. Have these people that package the doll ever had kids? It took 15 minutes of cutting and untwisting the ties that held this sweet doll captive. I was exhausted. We read over the details of Alexa and had fun making her make noises and giggles. A 5 year old can figure out how to turn off and on after being coached by an adult. Emily especially loves the burps. We took her to the ice cream parlor with us and let her coo and giggle along with her new mommy(Emily). The outfit is not as cute as it could be but she is a nice comfortable size for a 5 year old to cuddle. I think we made a good choice in purchasing Princess Alexa and hope she stays in our family for a long time.

I found this book to be dry and drawn out, and in addition, it did not seem to elaborate on some of the more intricate topics as much as it should have. I often needed to refer to many outside sources to educate myself on topics. The thing that bothered me the most was that its index was lacking and the book didn't even have a glossary-- some textbook this is! While Garraty managed to stick a few humorous and lively sentences into the text, my recommendation is that unless a teacher wants to put his class to sleep, use another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dislike this book very much","review":"Unfortunatly this book does not recount American history. It is a 1076 paged book of Mr. John A. Garraty's interpretations and opinions of American History. The writing is confusing, and drawn out. There is one particular sentence that has caused great debate in my AP US History. My biggest complaint: there are important concepts that are mentioned but are not defined. For example: Thomas Jefferson's \\"pell-mell\\" approach to his presidency. This is not a good book to use in AP US History classes.

It not only presented the how, when and what, but the why; possibly the most important of the questions a text answers, or attempts to. However, that should be expected in any text, what this book offered was a more personal account based on narrative instead of rhetoric.

This is a wonderful tail of secrets, love, passion, advocacy, and care I have ever seen. What was also beautiful was the city itself- set in beautiful Iran. This movie also shows that women are treated respectably and can educate themselves. That they have their own way of expressing addressing their own issues and that we as westerners need to let them do that- with our support.I would not change anything in this movie.

In such a case I would for instance recommend the <The Finite Element Method>-works of Zienkievicz and Taylor, if you are interested in FEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a good book to begin learning the fundamentals of fluid mechanics in a science point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"This book claims to be an introduction to fluids. If so, it is the worst introduction I have seen. While other books are trying to get the student to understand what viscosity is or how to calculate presure with depth in a fluid, this book is literally teaching Eigenvectors of a Symmetric Tensor.

It is every bit as rigorous as Panton, but Kundu takes a step back to revisit some of the mathematics. He even goes so far as to remind the reader at one point that i = sqrt(-1). I would have appreciated this as a grad student myself.The section on waves, the wave equation and simplifications to analyze gravity is excellent. It shows his background in Oceanography. His section on potential flow really makes the correlation between the mathematics and the physical intuition necessary to make sense of the mathematics.Overall, I find it to be a rigorous yet readable text."},{"rating":"2","title":"So-so book","review":"I used this book in a graduate level course.

This is the best book to read after Munson and is much easier and much more useful than Batchelor. Most of the concepts are very nicely explained and there is a strong emphasis on understanding the physics of each phenomenon. There is an introductory part on continuum mechanics which is very helpful. This book is almost error free although a lot of equations are presented in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction in Fluid Mechanics","review":"One of the best introduction books in thisfield. This new edition has a chapter onBiofluid Mechanics. Over all, it is interestingand fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read for scientists","review":"Pijush Kundu's textbook has established itself as the standard in introductory fluid mechanics. While most fluid dynamics texts are based around engineering, this book is an excellent cross section for scientists hoping to gain a thorough intuition about the subject. In addition, the first few chapters offer intuitive explanations of such vector operators as div and curl. The idea of curl was a complete mystery to me until I read Kundu's explanation of vorticity. This book is a must have for any applied scientist working in the physical world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully clear explanations.","review":"This book is amazing. While accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of physics, it is nonetheless a complete introduction to the science of fluid mechanics. It manages to give clear, complete explanations of concepts, while avoiding much of the tedious algebra and dry style of, say, Batchelor. Don't get me wrong though--Kundu is not lacking in rigor. As a first text to learn fluid mechanics from, to my knowledge, Kundu has no equal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great choice for students","review":"This book is not a great resource for a student.

I ran into the same problem with the \\"Jaguar Day\\": magic blended with science. If a series like \\"Go, Diego, Go\\" builds itself up as science-based, with great information and lessons about nature, it should remain grounded in reality. True, the animals do talk, but it is easier for a 2 or 3 year-old to process this flight of fancy than it is for them to understand the fantastical when it is interwoven with factual representations of animals and wildlife, with no indication that one is real and one is imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magically Weird","review":"I bought this DVD for my 1.5 year old daughter, who loves Diego. She enjoys this DVD tremendously so for that reason I give it two stars. However, the first two episodes (this DVD contains a total of four episodes) are just too bizarre. In the first, a shape-shifting magic man steals a flying flute by turning into any animal he wants. In the second, Diego's grandfather's strawberry farm is saved by the green iguana, who poops out strawberry seeds to replenish the fields. I usually skip to the third and fourth episodes, which are undersea adventures with whales and octupuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Diego Adventures","review":"While my 2.5 yr old likes all the shows on this dvd, she particularly loves the first episode on the dvd, Kicho's Magic Flute.

For better descriptions of the points and their use in self-defense, check out the books by George Dillman, Erle Montaigue, and Rick Clark. The techniques used to show applications in this book appear to be quite stiff. I guess it's hard to be well-balanced and fluid when you are wearing a gold ( or is it silver?) ninja outfit. Actually, the ninja suits are not a bad idea. This way, the author and his helpers can walk down the street without people pointing and laughing.

Mr. Roeder makes some good arguments in the book against some of the religious rhetoric that we are often confronted with from the religious right, while telling a story that is not only fast moving but heartwarming and romantic as well. You don't need to have read the other stories in the series to appreciate this one, but it certainly wouldn't hurt...and if you are so inclined read them in the order intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet!!","review":"This Time Around is simply the best novel so far in the Gay Youth Chronicles series.

If you have a glue gun, you can use it to put those collections of shells to good use. Would recommend for the serious crafter and those wanting to do something besides putting your shells in a glass jar. Full of many colorful photographs and ideas. Some a little over-the-top, but if you have a beach cottage or home by the water, or even a ocean-themed room, this is full of ideas and instructions.

FAR from their best.","review":"It's old, dated and not very good at all. I love Xymox and their later albums are FAR better than this. It's all pompous, self agonising nonsense with a pretty low production level. If you find it cheap as a 2nd hand give it a go if you must. NOT worth buying new. Trust me, don't be tempted! Notes From The Underground, Xymox Live and Creatures blow this old junk into the abyss. This can be viewed as a demo disc but that's about it. FAR too much boring sampling and clanking noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first CD","review":"My first experience with Xymox was actually their 1989 album 'Twist of Shadows' which I purchased on cassette. After being quite impressed with the entire album I bought 'Clan of Xymox' on compact disc which is, in my opinion, their best and most original work to date. And as mentioned by another fan, the almost 'other-worldly' vocals of Mr. Moorings are what really makes the group stand out. Seems like most people either love or hate this album.

No. When apprised of my problem, the customer service person said that I had to deal with the entity I purchased the holdter from (Amazon). He refused to honor the warranty, using the example that if I purchased a TV from a big-box store, I'd have to retun it to them, not them maker. Great example ...?The product was purchased new.

The special effects are cheesy - there's no blood when the people are shot, which is totally bogus.

Given, it's no Schindler's list or Europa Europa it can still compete with them I think. I mainly ordered it because I enjoy watching films with Stallan Skarsgrd, so if that is why you are ordering this film then buy it because he is excellent in it. One thing that buyers should know is that the image quality of the film is that of a VHS. It did not receive a good transfer to DVD, if not for that reason I would have given it five stars. It also may be that it is a foreign movie from the 90s and cameras weren't all that then, but don't let that deter you from purchasing this wonderful and thought provoking movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and heavy.","review":"The movie is about a true hero who saved the lives of many Jews during the Holocaust,at great risk to his own safety. His efforts were incredibly selfless. Unfortunately, the movie starts out at the finishing stages of Wallenberg's life, when Jews were ruthlessly being murdered, and violated, and he was losing his ability to stop it. It is quite violent and lacks redeeming hope. You don't get to enjoy the success stories that he experienced in his early days of rescuing people. Everyone Wallenberg sets out to save is murdered before his eyes. There is also uneccesary nudity displayed by a character who is supposed to be mentally ill. This continues through out the film. I wish the story would have been told from a different perspective. The true story of Wallenberg's life is one of hope and sacrifice, not hopelessness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A courageous man,but a dull depiction of his acts.","review":"I am extremely interested in heroic tales of the Holocaust Era.Though this film is good from the informational aspect, it is just plain dull viewing.The life of Wallenberg would best be suited to more skillful hands than those who directed and produced this one.Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgaard (THE OX) never comes to life at any time as the defiant diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.An earlier made-for-TV version of WALLENBERG was far superior in all ways.Too bad it has never been released to tape to my knowledge.For those interested in the Hungarian-Jewish slaughter of WW2,I would recommend MUSIC BOX or SUNSHINE.Though these films do not specifically address the 65,000 Jews of the Budapest ghetto,THESE films are at least engrossing and DO communicate the atrocities to some degree that occured in Hungary in a much more engaging and compelling way for the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"please read this book","review":"Thank you, thank you to Lois Bhatt for writing this book detailing her experience with breast cancer.

Watching Catherine Bell as Mac and David James Elliott as Harm, you will also see why CB and DJE have such a popular fanbase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't Buy It To Watch JAG.....","review":".....bought it for the 2 shows with NCIS in them. I was a JAG fan in the beginning of the series, but by season 4,they started getting ridiculous, so never saw those 2 NCIS episodes (season 8, Ice Queen) the first time around. Can't speak for the rest of the season since I didn't watch any of them, but LOVED those 2 prequels to NCIS, so for that fact alone,I was very happy with this DVD set. Had to order it throough amazon because no stores around here had season 8 - everyone must be doing the same thing I am, looking for those 2 shows! So I was happy with the product, got what I expected, and as usual, everything with Amazon went great, got it sooner than they projected. I'm guessing that if you're a die-hard JAG fan that watched all 9 seasons, you'll enjoy this. If you're an NCIS fan, you'll definitely enjoy it, seeing Gibbs,Tony,Abby and Ducky (and Agent Blackadder,whom I am very glad got sent back to the FBI) in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not finish friendly","review":"I purchased this holster for a Smith and Wesson M&P full size 9mm with a Crimson Trace Railmaster Laser. When the gun is holstered it fits like a glove. However, getting the firearm in & out of the holster is not only somewhat difficult but hard on the finish of the gun. Afer only 3-4 times of putting the gun in the holster & removing it, it wore the finish from the SS slide. If you don't care about holster wear only after a few days then this is the holster for you. I understand holster wear over time but the hard surface of the holster combinded with metal rivets making direct concact with your gun is simply bad design.

The story was excellent, the characters well described, there was plenty of banter between the characters,and I'll definitely read more of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pace and succinct writing style","review":"While I am by no means an avid mystery genre reader, I stumbled upon this book and was immediately drawn to it, not because of the story (which was okay but at times unrealistic) and not because of character development (we find out very little about the characters other than their basic personality types and vices) but because of how well it is written, in comparison to most mystery novels I have read, which tend to rely too heavily on cliche expressions.Full Dark House is a deftly written mystery that keeps its audience intrigued primarily in how each chapter is constructed. The chapters are short, witty, and succinct but also end on cliff hangers, teasers, and ominous foreshadowing statements. For this reason alone I enjoyed reading the story and feel I can rely on the author's abilities to keep my interest in the next novel in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY so pricey?","review":"I'd like to try these novels but why are the Kindle prices so high? Why should I pay $4.00 more than the paperback price for the Kindle version of an 8-year-old novel? I appreciate that novelists want to make money -- but the pricing of paperbacks versus e-books needs work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, pedantic and pseudo-everything","review":"If you don't mind \\"new age\\" pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific and pseudo-historical fad \\"intellectualism\\" and you don't mind skipping pages and pages of slow moving empty dialogue, knock yourself out. If you prefer fast-paced \\"London\\" based mysteries try Will Thomas' new books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate!","review":"This is my favourite Winterreise. The performance went straight into my heart and has remained there since ten years ago. This is a rare, very inspired performance, relaxed concentration and a good forward drive when the music demands it. I rate this performance far above any of Fischer-Dieskau's Winterreisen, either with Moore or Demus. I always return to this one. It is a pity that there is no listening samples here, as you have no guarantee that your taste is like mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"These teas are good, but...","review":"The price here is too high!

How I love this Transformer! He was my favorite in the show and now we get a Masterpiece-Scale Alternators figure with show acurate features (okay, maybe not perfect but give him a break, IT'S HOUND!) He has rubber tires, chrome, clear plastic headlights and windhiselds, a flip-up faction symbol, and a hidden gun compartment in his spare tire holder. The only thing he does not have is a shoulder cannon! His articulation is terrific and his features are spot-on!Keep in mind, this is an Alternator, a dead line to most, and as such he has some bits that can fall off or break. Do not get this for your five year old. In fact, don't get it for your thirteen year old either! Get it for the eighteen year old who still collects Transformers. He will have the reverence to take care of the toy properly. Not to say he is filled with breaky-bits, but he isn't the SMASH AND BASH toy that your five year old needs. Get them a WALK AND TALK robot instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I purchased this CD after seeing here on Amazon. Since it had no track listing I had no idea what to expect. I had hoped it would be a collection of the 12\\" single versions of Benatar's hits. It was not. It is a collection of live versions of some of her work from her first three albums. Not that bad, but very misleading since most of the songs are not extended at all. It would have helped is there was listing of the tracks so that Amazon buyers would know what they were getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Helpful but Not the CD","review":"The chapters and format of the book appear to be very helpful. I purchased the book because it included a CD with the tutorials on it. Unfortunately, I have not been able to follow the tutorials because I receive a message that I need permission of the authors.The authors discontinued their support line and you have to rely on forums that may or may not answer your questions.

Please retire, so that we can remember you as you were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"As a huge fan of EN I was VERY excited about receiving this album. When I got it into my hands, I realized that it was definately worth the wait. While continuing down the path that they took on Silence Is Sexy in which they went a bit more \\"melodic\\" and \\"somber\\", they also dipped back into their former selves and came up with some very gritty, dark songs that are very remenicent to their greater beginnings. A great album all together with some soon-to-be Neubauten classics (Grundst��ck, and Selbstportrait Mit Kater to name a few)"},{"rating":"2","title":"you won't regret silence is sexy!","review":"\\"silence is sexy\\", EN's previous effort, is easily one of my favourite albums of all time and the benchmark for any future EN release. So, how does this latest work stand in comparison with it? well, it's ALMOST as good and nothing short of brilliant. \\"Ich gehe jetzt\\", the killer opening track, is astounding, dark and foreboding. But I won't comment on every single track, let it suffice to say that this is top-notch material...The tone of the album is calm, subdued (think \\"silence is sexy\\"), sometimes spaced with sudden burst of fury (again, think the previous album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" a slight disappointment.","review":"There are many great reviews of this album, but I must say I was slightly disappointed by this latest release. It is supposed to be somewhat of a second half of \\"Silence Is Sexy,\\" (all of Neubauten's albums follow a definite theme) but it certainly lacks the intense emotional depth and drive that E.N. is famous for. \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" feels vaguely superficial, detatched, and even pretentious at times (especially the lyrics, which are mostly in German). Blixa's high pitched screech is over-utilized. There are some high points however, and the instrumentals are amazing as always. If you are a first time listener, I highly recommend \\"Silence Is Sexy,\\" or their \\"Strategies Against Architecture\\" series over this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucked","review":"it sucked. the novelty of sound wears of after oh, about 5 seconds. this reminds me of penderecki's operas, i cannot stand this: it is tonal, not musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"I was told about his band that they made some of the most brutal industrial music ever...nothing could be further from the truth with this album.

Nidless to say it never did. The reason is simple: it's just imposible to like this CD. Almost all remixes sound alike; some songs don't need to be remixed (sound better original:#5 and6), some songs shouldn't be remixed (songs are borring or plain out bad: #2 and 4). My bigest problem with DFA remixes on this particular item is: most of the rems are toooooooooo long. The most horrifying experience was #4 She wants to move. Besides being an average song, remix is unimaginative, repetetive and downright anoying. It seems like they just remixed it on home made software and looped it for five-six repits. At some point I was close to just trowing this CD away. Even relatively better choise of songs for stronger finish of this disastros \\"chapter two\\" doesnt save it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Road Trip, the fourth and final installment of the Friday the 13th series by Eric Morse is an excellent book, completing Morse's round up of loose ends left over by the movies!! With Road Trip, Morse concludes the series with some very unforgettable scenes. I don't want to give too much away, (especially for price!)Road Trip begins when a bus loaded with football players, cheerleaders, and a mascot goes off course and crashes into Camp Crystal Lake, of course murderous hilarity ensues! Any fan of the Friday the 13th movies will absolutely love these books, my personal favorite being Carnival. I'm sorry but when I talk about these books I have got to praise Eric Morse a lot, he wrote these books so well at times I felt I was actually in them, that is how good these books are and completely make them worth the money. To tell you the truth, these books are probably better than the upcoming Jason X release and promise to give you more enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great but not really scary.","review":"It was a good book but not as scary as \\"The Carnival\\". Teddy, got his revenge with the mask, for being treated like dirt. Some of the killings were pretty grousome. It wasn't exactly what I expected from the title \\"Road Trip\\". Eric Morse is a great author and I would like it if this wasn't his last Friday the 13th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the barrel - avoid like the plague...","review":"This is Z-grade fanfiction at its worst. Although they're ostensibly tied in with the FRIDAY THE 13th franchise, Eric Morse's books have little in common with the series and instead offer rote young adult \\"horror\\" that wouldn't even pass muster with the GOOSEBUMPS crowd. Want poor characterization? Check. In the mood for poor grammar and internet fanfiction-level writing? Check. Inept plotting? Double-check. It's no wonder the publisher buried these books rather than giving them any sort of release. Whatever small amount the \\"author\\" was paid for turning out this drivel was way too much. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is really a piece of trash to be used as a coaster","review":"I was very disapointed when I spent $4.00 on this book.For one the discriptions are lame and chessy.Whoever wrote this book has no imagination.It also practaically nothing to do with the movie.I wouldnt even recomend this book to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced product with little benefits","review":"I have to say I am very disappointed. After spending around 15 dollars for this product I have come to find that it does no good for my skin. Instead it leaves a slimy film layer on my face and even after blotting it continues to show up. Although, it says oil free, I believe that it may be better for dry skin people. Also, the soy-rich seems to be complete b.s. all it really does for your skin is leave it with a weird tint and sparkle but no health benefits.

Besides burning my eyes if it gets anywhere near them, the lotion itself actually peels. If I run my finger over my face, it's as if my skin were rubbing off after a sunburn. The little moist rolls it leaves makes it impossible to wear under makeup, which is why I bought it. Even if I didn't wear foundation, though, why would I want a lotion that balls up on me and leaves what looks like bits of dead skin all over my face?I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively disappointed!","review":"I've only been using this product for about a week and a half, but I have decided that is more than enough! I can clean my face religiously before putting this on, but whenever I do put it on it somehow collects and rubs off in pieces! The weirdest thing I've ever seen, really. The smell is too much like sunscreen, though much milder and you sort of get used to it. This product made my face break out and I also noticed many more blackheads, even in places I NEVER get them!! When cleaning my face from this product as well, there's an insurmountable level of dirt! I've also noticed dry patches on my skin that were never there before. Very unusual.I've used other Aveeno moisturizers before, and other than switching moisturizers I have not changed anything else in my routine. The other moisturizers have never even come close to doing things like this, and I have to say that I am very disappointed in this product. I will never buy it again, and I will warn friends against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stains clothing and bedding!","review":"I normally love Aveeno products so was happy when they came out with a face moisturizer. But I've had nothing but trouble and didn't realize it was caused by this product until yesterday. I've been noticing stains on the necklines of my shirts and on my pillowcases, so did a test: I rubbed some of this product on an already-stained (and ruined) pillowcase and waited an hour. Just as I thought, it resulted in a reddish stain. I've also been having trouble with burning eyes lately but hadn't attributed it to this lotion until I noticed someone else here had the same problem. I likely won't be running a test with on that! :-) Anyway -- just a word of warning. I also found this lotion to be a bit greasy. Otherwise, I really like Aveeno products but I won't buy this one again, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively the Worst Moisturizer Ever!!","review":"I wouldn't say that I have sensitive skin when it comes to moisturizers but I officially have it now. On the first day, this moisturizer left a weird film across my face. It felt smooth but really weird, like saran wrap on your face. The second day it stung my face. I discontinued using it. Today I have dry skin all over my face, except for the places that turned red. I also, ended up getting it in my eyes at some point which I have to agree with everyone stung like crazy. Now even my eyelids have dry skin. I am not talking about the dry skin that you use moisturizer for in the first place. I am talking about dry skin that feels like sandpaper and leaves your make-up looking awful. I will never buy Aveeno products again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all","review":"I had hopes for this moisturizer because I usually love Aveeno products. However, I have been sorely disappointed. First, it feels more like suncreen than it does a moisturizer. Secondly, and most irrating to me, I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and have had the worst acne break outs I've experienced in a long time. Today I woke up with more pimples, and I've decided I've had enough...it's going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"sensitive skin beware!","review":"Like some others have mentioned, I had several issues after my first use of this product. First it made my face burn so much I actually turned a fan on it until the worst of it was over. I have used moisturizers that burned a little before but this was on a new level. After applying it made weird skin lotion balls when I ran my fingers over it, as if it was sloughing off the dead skin. This would be okay for nighttime application I guess, but not for morning. Now my face is peeling all over, really, really badly and it is dryer than it's ever been before. Needless to say, I am not at all happy about walking around with a face full of very visibly peeling skin, but I think it is going to take a week of better moisturizer to combat the damage this has done. I do not recommend this product for anyone, but especially those with even slightly sensitive skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns eyes horribly","review":"I use Clinique Dramatically Different during the summer but when the dry Arizona winter hits, I need something stronger so I bought Aveeno SPF30.

I have had lotions that burned before but nothing like this!!! I washed my eyes to no avail. It burned for hours!!!

Western superiority is derived not from guns and cannons, but from science and math and technology and a modernized government that made superior ships and weapons possible. To claim that the rise of the western world was made possible by gold and silver from what was to become Latin America is nonsense. Europe would have become superiour even without the Americas by its modern science and technology and government. For a proof of this read what I wrote on the book of Blaut on \\"Eight Eurocentric Historians\\" (http://www.amazon.com/Eight-Eurocentric-Historians-J-M-Blaut/dp/1572305916/ref=cm_cr-mr-title).

But when i read it I couldn't put it down. I also read some to my husband who got extremely turned on. We both found the trilogy very exciting and erotic. To read these books you must have an open mind; it makes the words on the page jump out at you, to the point where you can feel them. I hope to read more erotic stories that are written in the same fashion, by Anne Rice. She makes the books come alive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read!","review":"When I read the first of the Sleeping Beauty books by Anne Rice, I read it in an afternoon. I immediately went out and bought the remaining two books in the trilogy. I had purchased the first one out of curiosity, after paging through it. At first, these books may seem to be just a lot of sex, and S and M type of stuff, but there is more to it than that. Rice explores the feelings of the characters and how they adjust to their situation and surroundings, and how they relate to each other in such an extraordinary setting. I found myself reading as fast as I could to find out what happened to Beauty and her friends. If you are offended by extremely explicit and graphic sex, you would not like these books. But if that doesn't bother you, and you like a sense of fantasy and seductiveness, these are the books for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly exciting read...","review":"Though I was skeptical at first, I rapidly found that this series is stimulating, colorful, and entrancing. Anne Rice does a wonderful job of delving into the thoughts behind submission, offering beautifully written descriptions of the desires of the characters. To truly appreciate this body of work, one really must read all three books in the series. By following Beauty through all the books, you can watch as her character developes and see how she comes to understand and love her submission. As well, the ending of the third book ties everything together as only a fairy tale can. I loved this series, and although I would have liked a bit more variance in the punishment scenes, I still find myself pouring over the books and my favorite passages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best work","review":"The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy was the first set of books I read from Anne Rice and I must say that even after reading almost all of her other books afterward, these are still the best. The sexuality explored in the novels is well-written, sensual, and eye-opening. More than anything I like the idea of Rice taking a classic fairy tale and putting that type of twist on it. I recommend these books to anyone who likes beautiful, well-written erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, intellectual and sexy","review":"Anne Rice really goes above and beyond what other authors even attempt. She goes into the world of erotica and looks at the dynamics of BDSM. Although it is not a training manual, it does help to view what goes on inside the head of the dominant and the submissive, which tells the reader why this life is so powerful. The first book, Claiming, sets the scene of the story and begins the journey, the next two really are the ones to challenge one's ideas on gender and power. (But Claiming is far from boring!) The first pages of each book reach out and grab the reader and will not let go until you finish.

I read these after I completed 50 Shades of Grey so I knew what I was getting into. I prefer to have them in the trilogy form as they are all together and you just go from one book to the next. They are very detailed and completely opposite of 50 Shades of Grey. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked reading these and I couldn't wait to see how the final outcome would conclude. I was a little let down at some points as it seemed not all the stories concluded but rather left you wanting more details, but overall, the main stories (as you will find out there are more than one in the books)were wrapped up nicely and with a finality that seemed fitting. I would recommend these books to someone who likes this type of fantasy and can handle the maturity of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is great, print quality sucks","review":"The story is great and a damn good read, but I only score the item itself so poorly because the print quality of the books and their cardboard box is quite terrible.

The extent of desire regardless of sex or statute. At first I was intrigued why a woman would write this but personally read it as an irony of human nature. But overall it wasn't until the third book that I knew who would learn to control the heart of princess Beauty, which I would think would intrigue most curiosities of any possible reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk on the very wild side","review":"These books are for people with dark and wierd ways of looking at what might be, They take us the that unknown place of our minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mind is a scary place....","review":"As a long time fan of Anne Rice, I've read almost all of her series, with the exception of her new ones.

I loved all three!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"This book was ok, but not anything to write home about. I have no qualms with the writing, it was the fantastic writing I've come to expect of Anne Rice, rather it was the way the subject matter was presented. This is the book that makes people believe that Dominant/submissive relationships are abusive, when in fact they are not.If you're someome looking for a book about very taboo erotica this is the book for you. For everyone else: Try if you want, but you won't miss anything if you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with YAWN2","review":"I generally like Anne Rice's books, but with these, she seems to have beaten one general (and simple) theme to death. After the first book she doesn't exhibit much originality at all, but just rehashes the same material over ad infinitum. I would liked to have seen more variations on a theme. The titilation factor was lacking except in select rather brief segments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hated it","review":"I consider myself open-minded and progressive, so for me to say that I hated this says something.

About a fourth of the way into the first book, I stopped and looked up the word erotic in the dictionary. I was right - the contents of this trilogy do not contain anything erotic.

A lot of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money & time","review":"The best thing about this series of novels are the covers: luscious reclining semi-nudes with lovely breasts. I never got further than halfway through part one: The Claiming of the Sleeping Beauty, which should have been titled: The Whimpering of the Sleeping Beauty. Endless accounts of spanking, raping, torture, whimpering, crying and what have you. No character development, no psychological insights or even intriques. Extremely repetitive. Oh and another annoying thing, the walking on hands and knees, what's up with that? I guess I am (maybe) more into Bondage LIght and the Beauty books are way too heavy handed for me.I am sorry I waste my money. Buyers beware.

After the first page you question whether you should even continue. I mean, what a perverse fairy tale! But I am so glad that I went on because it really is a fabulous read. It is quite erotic, almost literally on every page and I thought the characters were all very interesting and likeable. It is obviously not to be taken remotely serious, it is purely for fun and it is that and more. It is a quick read because you really can't put it down! Its a very guilty pleasure. The writing is, as usual eloquent and thorough as only Anne can manage. You really get into the story and into the minds of the characters. It's not just books full of sexual fantasies, they really are quite good and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most amusing investigation of sexual obsession ever written","review":"An absolute delight. Enjoyed them all and wish there were more. Beauty is awakened and plunged into a medieval world world of sexual slavery, obsession, pain and ecstacy. Invites the question why are we here and how it can be a more exciting trip. Takes one way beyond other books in the world of extreme pleasure, obsession. Expodes the idea that there must be guilt and retribution for simple pleasures. Where can we find more. A paradise with out the consequences, an dangerous adventure with a happy ending. Its very funny, over the top silly and stimulating in many ways. Bravo Ann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book ever","review":"When a book has as its main appeal to be innovative and shocking, the worst possible disaster is to be boring.And boring this series is. It is an endless sucession of beatings and spankings in the rear. Sleeping Beauty goes as a slave to the castle of the prince who rescued her, only to be joined by several princes and princesses who are also slaves there.The characters have no psychological life, the dialogues are childish and there is no plot or action, besides the monotonous spanking of buttocks. If eroticism was this, soon there would be no sex in this planet.The only emotion this book offered me is the willingness to spank Ms. Rice hard for writing such trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected....","review":"When I saw this series at the bookstore, I rushed to buy it, as I am a huge fan of Anne Rice. But, instead of a well-woven story with lovable characters, I found myself digusted at the book and the characters. Although I love Rice this is one series that I could not finish reading, and that is saying a lot since I have finished all of her other novels. Yes, it does pertain a lot to erotica, but maybe if it was done with likable characters and a better plot I could have enjoyed the series more."},{"rating":"1","title":"To rough","review":"I enjoy erotic romance novels.

I missed the sweetness of people who care for each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"what went wrong?","review":"I was disappointed. Granted, as I am both an Anne Rice and BDSM enthusiast, I had *high* expectations. This arc began with great promise, and the beginning of The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty awoke a definite sense of eroticism, that dark sensuality ... [and then] this degenerated into a marathon of spankings and punishments so hardcore it gets ridiculous. This stuff doesn't turn you on, it makes you roll your eyes. ... The tender, erotic aspects of a dominatrix/slave relationship were tossed aside for pages of being spanked on the buttocks and men having phallic shaped objects shoved into them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out fascinating, gets repetitious and tiresome","review":"If you are into BDSM, or just fantisize about it, this trilogy will feed that fantasy to the max. Deeply erotic, it touches every conceivable permutation of slave/owner and bondage/discipline fantasy that any individual could conceive of, short of absolute brutality and injury. To Ann Rice's credit, by the third book, she does develop some new twists (if you last that long--I barely did, because I was getting bored with the endless permutations on the same theme), and the ending of the third book is something of a surprise. This Trilogy is quite a departure from her vampire books. The writing is technically good, but I found the series overall repetitious and not worth the time. I read all three, ultimately, to be able to say that I had. I certainly wouldn't do it again. I then turned around and sold the set on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and in the end boring","review":"I did not have a problem with the subject matter. I got bored with the same scenes repeted again and again. Book 1 was constant debasement in a castle with a european style. Book 2 was constant debasement in a rustic village. Book 3 was a small change with 2 of the slaves getting a little of their own back, but they still put up with almost constant debasement in a shiek's palace (eastern style). After a while even her very explicit scenes, which most of them were, got boring. I thought I would find these books exciting but the ending was a relief, finally it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Erotica","review":"This is a must have for anyone into erotic literature.

I read over many parts that seemed to repeat. I would say give it a try it may surprise you, either way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smut","review":"The worst piece of smut that I ever ordered from kindle; I deleted it immediately but still had to pay for it.

People have tried to duplicate them with limited success. They stand alone. They are what they are. I promise you, they will stay with you, affectionately for the rest of your life. I first read these books many years ago. i re-read them maybe five years ago. I have found that they provide deep insights into the way a womans mind works. Many women don't want to go there and that's okay. But I believe all women are tempted, to a greater or lesser degree, to at least peek thruogh the key hole to see what it might be like. But total trust is required and alass is lacking. Few suitable men are available. Or there is a lack of opportunity. Or they just can't trust enough. Or their men don't know what to do. So it never happens. But if you want to see what total surrender looks and feels like. Ann tells you here and it is worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"These were just utter crap","review":"There's good erotica and there is bad erotica and then there is good bad errotica, which is just campy and fun.

Roquelaure is, but she is not my beloved Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I got this box set and read all the books. The premise of the series is extraordinarily good, and could have been not only sexually hot but philosophically and literarily deep. However, the execution was not good. Mostly, the series starts off decently but just gets more and more boring as it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"The recent reprint of these books say \\"if you liked 50 Shades of Gray you will love the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy.\\" Well - no. If all you liked about the 50 Shades books was the spankings and beating, then yes you will probably love these books because that is all they are about (with some rape thrown in) - at least the first one because I have zero interest in reading the other two. If, on the other hand, you liked the character and relationship development in the 50 Shades books (clunky though it was at times) you will be bored out of your mind by this because there is zero character/relationship here. The book appears to exist solely for the purpose of legitimizing Rice's bizarre fantasy life by treating it as art - which it most assuredly is not. I thought EL James was a poor writer - But in this at least Rice surpasses her for awfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for Content...Disappointed","review":"I've only just gotten through the first book...boring and very odd. But I will definitely continue on to the next two books since I purchased them as a set. I feel the set is way overpriced for the content. I paid the same price for \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and got more than my money's worth out of that reading. The whole physical set was so much nicer, more reading, bigger books, soooo much more interesting...better books. I definitely would not place this trilogy (Sleeping Beauty) in the same price category as \\"50 Shades of Grey\\"...no comparison in quality of content.Thank you,V"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS - BLAH BORING READ!!","review":"I've never left a review without fully using a product or reading an entire book - but I'm making an exception this time - this book stinks!! I keep trying to get into the story but find myself saying out loud WTF?! This is complete garbage!! I read all types of books from deep religious to hard core porn so this isn't me being shocked or disgusted - it's just BORING!! I guess I'll keep reading because I cant return my order (I checked - I'm too late) but man I'm struggling - not turned on in the least - hate every single character - I could care a less about Beauty - no character development so don't really care what happens to her - BLAH BLAH BLAH!! This is going to be a jagged pill - and from what I read from the other reviews book 2 & 3 are no better - I was SO hopeful the story improved as you read. I'm neither amused nor entertained - to be perfectly honest dreadfully bored is more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rereleased, still a classic","review":"With the number of Anne Rice fans increasing, it makes sense that the novels written under her pseudonym be released to the public that knows her vampire chronicles so well. While partially a fairytale, this trio of novels about beauty are erotic fiction with the passion that Rice creates in her vampires -- only in this series with regard to beauty. Bondage, whipping and the feel of the passion between a man and a woman is thoroughly engrossing in this trio. Don't expect the mystery of the vampire series. Expect instead the mental passion that you feel when Lestat finds and seizes his victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy it in the least!","review":"I bought these books because they sounded as if they were going to be a good read but that's not what happened when I actually started reading them. These entire books are all sex and don't get me wrong, I don't mind it but it's page after page of pointless sex. I found myself skimming through the pages so that I may get to some actual facts about the books but it never happens. Every good book must have love and passion in it, but these books are just ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Sorry but unless you have a spanking fetish, there is very little erotic about this book other than the fact that it's about sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"I had high hopes for these Novels and I hated them! HORRIBLE! Rape, brutal treatment..etc..too much to enjoy a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, it's a bore!","review":"I have to agree with the person who wrote that the series is a bore!! You get tired of pages and pages of descriptions of spanking, which are not even all that well-written. I suppose Ms. Rice was trying to write in a fairy-tale style, but fairy tales, at least, have a plot!! There's no love in this series, which is what would turn me on the most, but rather degradation and humiliation of princes and princesses, which, in Beauty's case, in my opinion, was unnecessary. Unlike \\"The Girl Who...\\" series, which also continues a popular story -- Pippi Longstocking -- there's no sense of justice, no sense of fairness and no redeeming value whatsoever. And I, too, am not a prude, but found this series incredibly tedious. Please save your money, as I wish someone had advised me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The author says if you like 50 Shades-you will like this. There is nothing similar in this trilogy that compares to 50. In 50 it was two ppl making a choice. In Sleeping trilogy-they were all forced into sex-slavery-and humiliation. There was no men on men or women on women in 50. The author needs to at least re-write her intro to the trilogy and tell that it is for ppl that like depraved sex stories. I am totally open minded-I purchased and read all three books, but I would not advise anyone who liked 50 to fall for this set of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little too much for my taste","review":"After reading 50 shades of Grey I was looking for another erotica type book series.

Anne Rice is a good writer but this one is not one of them. Unless this has a surprise ending I am keeping it at a one star. I don't feel connections of any of the characters.

Not my bag I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I love erotica, and typically I love the control aspect of sexual escapades. These books had both, but I wasn't even slightly turned on as I read the first book, I skipped 3/4ths of the 2nd, and have not even bothered with the third. I don't find constant debasement and rape a turn-on I guess, that is exactly what happened in these books.I thought 50 Shades of Grey was bad, but I can't even adequately describe exactly how awful these books were. I am not sure what I hated more: the opening rape scene, the lack of imagination and repetitiveness in all the sex scenes, lack of character development.These books and story lines, could have really fantastic if they didn't lack in every way possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time","review":"I read this book thinking it might be a good summer read.

I expected Desire, love, and sensuality. THERE WAS NONE!!! This book was absolutley horrific. The opening scene of rape and moving on to torture and sodomy is not for the faint of heart. There is not a inch of sexy or profocotive.....just bonewrenching horrifying. No woman or man should go through anything like that and for the author to think of these scenes as an \\"erotic\\" read is scary in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I'd hoped for...","review":"OK, let me state right up front that I adored Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Therefore, I was honestly hoping to be enthralled by her 'Beauty' trilogy. I was most disappointed, however. Anne took a great idea and turned it into almost pure farce--spanking on top of beating on top of...well, you get the idea. Virtually the entire storyline for all three books revolved around mercilessly beaten buttocks and anuses (and the innumerable things the author dreamed up to insert into them). It was SO constant that I quickly lapsed from amusement to boredom on into irritation. The principal bootlicking wretches, otherwise masquerading as main characters, were hard to empathise with or even like. After three books I still found Beauty to be a guttering twit. I know many, many people ardently loved this series, and there were occasional brilliant flashes of Rice's lush prose, but ultimately I just couldn't find much to like in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredabley erotic","review":"One of the best series I have read in a long time!

It does not compare. 50 shades is consenting ADULTS and there is love and care. Beauty is children being given as \\"tributes\\" to a queen to be sex slaves. It is degrading, repetitive of spankings, Sodomy with multiple items, and no love or care whatsoever. Teens being forced to engage in all sorts of sex acts with both sexes and punished if they refuse or dont appear to enjoy it. It is a kingdom of perversion!

I couldn't even bring myself to read the other two, but flipped through them to confirm that they were just like the first. Basically this book is about rape, spanking, and sodomy. It's so unsubstantial and has little to no character or plot development. Penthouse Letters is more interesting. Why, Anne, why????? There could have been SO much more to this trilogy, but page after page was just sex. If you're into S&M and rape, then this is the book for you. Me? Not so much.

I found it surprising that this was written by the same author who wrote 'Interview With A Vampire' - which I liked. I am very open minded but this crossed a line.

Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable.

Beyond the lack of content, it was poorly edited with entire paragraphs being duplicated in various instances of the 101 'things'. There was little of value that I gained from the book. I bought this because our family will travel to disney for the first time next year and I can't say I have taken much away from it.

It was a jagged read and I would not recommend it for Disneyphiles that already know the \\"common\\" secrets of WDW.

I suppose if you had absolutely positively never in your life been to Disney or read anything at all about the park, you might be interested... then again, probably not.

As many other reviewers have stated, there is no real substance to the information. You're given little tidbits of information, but none of it is expanded upon. So many of the 101 facts are really basic. If you've read any book about Disney World, you probably know these things already. It's almost as though this book is a compilation of facts from other books on the subject.

I was so looking forward to Claudia Koonz introducing me to the unknown women of Nazi Germany and in that she did not disappoint me. Koonz introduces the reader to a montage of women from her interviews with Nazi leader, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink to concentration camp survivor, Frau Dr. Jolana Roth. Koonz's presentation of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish women adds to the understanding of the woman's role during the Third Reich. With all of it's wealth of knowledge, do not expect this to be an easy read. At times, the book's molasses-like flow bogs down the reader with contrasting statements, vagueness and repetitiveness.

A whisper is louder than a scream is an old saying, and it was so relevant in the case of the women's role in making Nazism a power and force to be reckoned with.Aside from the in-depth research, Ms Koonz's strength lies in her powers of detailed description of how nazism went froma man-centered group of hate-politicians to an active community."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I have just finished taking a semester long course with Claudia Koonz at Duke University, and have been inspired to read more about the cultural aspects of Nazi Germany.

I have to say i cried when i first started to read the manual. And the Panic Attack Eliminator was like an epiphany. The Linden Method is honest, safe and has a real understanding of how panic can control your life. The after sales support is also superb.I am not totally cured, but i know this is mostly down to me. The Method itself is sound, and if it doesn't completely cure you, I'm sure it will at the very least make your panic disorder much more manageable.Very strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linden Method","review":"The book does NOT teach you how to deal with specific issues that you are anxious about.

The Weekes books are remarkable for their clarity and absence of medical jargon.To bypass all the \\"magical\\" promises and hype of others and avoid the often addictive medication path, read Dr. Weekes's life altering books or order the \\"Pass Through Panic\\" CD from Amazon and hear her compassionate, encouraging voice outlining the way to overcome anxiety, panic attacks, phobia and depression.

It is largely about him and his illness and recovery. He hates valium. He feels you can change your thinking and all will be well. The nine pillars are a combination of CBT, meditation and yoga. NOne of these are harmful in fact they do work. It is silly and nonproductive to think that you can control your anxiety by ignoring it and doing other things.

You will just want to hear it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a film!","review":"\\"Miss Potter\\" is that rare movie which manages to be sentimental and heartfelt without being cheesy or melodramatic. It has sad moments balanced by a happy ending and GORGEOUS panoramic views of the English countryside. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are adorable together, and perfect for their roles. It is a movie quite appropriate for anyone, of any age-- although it features a beloved children's book author, it is an adult movie-- but one in which \\"[...]\\" is the only word approaching profanity, and in which the single kiss that occurs is sweet and almost asexual. \\"Miss Potter\\" is clearly a romance, but it is also about a woman struggling to make a name for herself in Victorian Britain, at a time when the only acceptable role for a married woman was to BE a married woman, and when there was not much of a place for a respectable UNmarried woman in society.All in all, a delightful movie, and one which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This lovely story of the life of Beatrix Potter is both magical in its depiction of her creativity and in the blossoming romance between Beatrix and her publisher.

If I thought the CD of the soundtrack of this film included Ewan McGregor singing (for just a few minutes) \\"Let Me Teach You How To Dance\\" I would buy it in a heartbeat. And a reminder, if you are prone to skip the credits at the end of films -- don't do it here. The song \\"When I Taught You How To Dance\\" that plays at the end of the credits is enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for young artists and writers","review":"Plenty of reviews on this site testify to the marvelous quality of this film, and its extraordinary performances. And there is no doubt that the film is a pure delight to watch. What I want to point out is that this is an excellent film for young writers and artists, as it is the story of how a young woman with considerable talent fights for recognition and finally receives it. Her story is exceptional, but then again it is not, because writers and artists do achieve success all the time. However the struggles of the beginning artist are considerable, and the need for faith throughout one's career never ends. I heartily recommend this film to anyone who wants to write, to paint, to dance, to sing, to do anything creative, and especially to those who are up against opposition from family and friends. . You will find the film comforting and affirming. And as others have indicated here, its an extraordinarily fine and wondrously enjoyable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Potter..............the best!!!","review":"Miss Potter is the endearing movie about the author of the Peter Rabbit series.This was a world we could only hope to visit, thru the magic of movies.Beautiful scenery, decency, hope, enduring love, struggles, determination.It's all there.Take the time, and watch it.

They always think a movie is good when its garbage and when a movie is actually good they don't like it. I just recently saw this movie and was expecting a really nice, romantic love story (from the reviews that I read) like the notebook. But it was so boring. There was no chemistry between the two main characters. There was no romance. Even the drama (where her fiance dies) is not emotional. I usually cry over everything. But not in this movie. Renee Zellweger does not act good in this movie. I saw nothing amazing in any of the performances. She just came across wierd and loopy. I would not recommend this film to anyone. I thought it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down once again....","review":"I was so excited when I saw this DVD. Finally, I thought, a movie about Harry Potter's obscure aunt. It's about time they shine the spotlight on her and give Harry a break. I popped up some popcorn, popped the DVD into my bigscreen and prepared to be blown away. About half way through I was very worried by the lack of \\"magical hyjinx.\\" There was no broom riding, magic frog potions, dragons, nothing. Just a few rabbits- and no, they weren't even being pulled out of hats. It turns out Harry was the only one in the family with magic powers after all. I still couldn't turn it off though, the chance that she may pull out a wand and turn a pumpkin into a coach kept my eyes glued to the screen.

Ewan McGregor also gives a good performance but it is Ren��e Zellweger who makes it magical.My only wish is that the film was longer to include more of what Beatrix Potter did for the Lake District.The blu-ray version is worth an investment, picture quality is superb.

I love Renee Zellweger's rendition of Beatrix Potter as she combined the right amount of shy reticence with steely independence. It took tremendous strength of character to move from her parents' home and become her own person, esp. in Victorian times.The photography and settings are simply out of this world, the story is one that you can watch with the entire family, and the reality of a woman's place during that time makes this a great movie that can generate conversation for all. My only regret was that the movie was only 90 minutes - I would have loved to have seen more of her later life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie!","review":"Renee Zellweger always becomes the character. She was joined by a fabulously casted ensemble of actors. The story was good, and relatively faithful to Beatrix Potter's life. The extras on the DVD were great, especially the biographical material on Potter, and the scenes from the lands she left in trust for the British people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Potter","review":"I loved this film. I initially borrowed the DVD and loved it so much I purchased it. I've also read the biography, \\"Beatrix Potter A Life in Nature\\" by Linda Lear, which I suppose this movie was based. Although I also gave the book a 5-star rating, I found the book to be a much more somber account of Beatrix Potter's life than this film portrays. This movie, on the other hand, is a light-hearted period romance that I think any woman would enjoy. My only disappointment is that I thought it ended rather abruptly, but I suppose there would've been no point in dragging Potter's life out the the very end -- it would've bored the audience and destroyed the light-hearted tone of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD","review":"This DVD was so well done.

Not only is the filmography terrific, but every detail is in place. Renee Zellweger is fantastic, moving the viewer right into her life. The animations are so well done they just seem to become a necessary part of the whole film. I promised myself I would go to the Lake District in the UK after seeing this film. There are parts where you just hold your breath and gasp a the serene beauty. This is an interesting film, I'm not sure I would call it a chick flick, yet I'm not too sure many men will apprecaite the fantasy that is involved. However, the women will recognize the struggle for talented ladies to get recognition, no matter what the era. Love this movie. Can't wait to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quaint","review":"The movie is very entertaining. Zellweger is good as Ms. Potter. The scenes of how she falls in love with Ewan McGregor's character are good. How both Miss Potter and publisher spent enormous amount of time getting the colors just right was interesting. I thought the animations were hit and miss. However, overall the animations do demonstrate how her characters were fully integrated into her life.I can't think of any real negatives. It is a very good period piece. Her paintings were amazing.The English landscapes were breathtaking. Friends of mine are going to start living in England this fall. I definitely want to go visit.

I have a regular DVD copy of it which, I suppose, will have to suffice, because my Blu-ray copy will not play on my Sony Blu-ray player. I even updated the firmware as suggested, but it did not help. I wish Amazon would post a disclaimer to this fact so that others will be spared the inconvenience of having to return unplayable copies. I have purchased many Blu-ray discs over the past six months, and this is the first one that I've had a problem with. The production of the disc appears to have been done in Australia which may--or may not--have something to do with the incompatibility.

I thought both Renee Zellweger & Ewan McGregor were fabulous in this period biopic about children's author Beatrix Potter!I was impressed to learn all the challenges Ms. Potter faced in order to become a successful author. Ms. Potter was very forward thinking for her time during an era in which women of high society were expected to marry & have children--- not to become independent, career minded and remain unmarried indefinitely.... or at least until one was ready to do so!!Scenes of the English countryside where Ms. Potter lived in her later years, has me wanting to visit England!

So this is a good joke book. But there's a point in a joke sometimes (and if you've ever seen a Jim Carrey movie, you'll know what I'm talking about) when you realize that the clown suddenly wants to be taken seriously, that he has a \\"serious message\\" and a heart dripping treacle. I find this disgusting. Very displeasing to both the eyes and the nose. It makes me want to take a shower. If Gudding wants to make jokes--fine, he's good at it. His poems are wonderfully naughty bathroom-stall graffiti. When he (or worse, readers) start to make claims for their importance as either thinking or art, then the joke's on them but nobody's laughing anymore. At this point I am tremendously bored by both these poems and their dorky Star-Trek grad school apologists. The indignant comparisons of academic credentials by previous posters--now that's funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Defense of What?","review":"Mr. Gudding, through equal parts esoteric double-talk and sheer force of ego, has produced an annoying collection of poems that, aside from further alienating any reader who questions the current climate of American poetry, delivers little more than a few giggles for the benefit of, no doubt, cloistered academics whose experience with the outside world has dimmed to the point of emotional [immaturity]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Paper, a little Darker than pictured","review":"This paper is exactly what I needed. It is a nice, thick paper. It is however, a bit darker (I have uploaded photos) than the image here. Another annoyance is the tape to hold the end of the paper onto the roll is placed so that you lose a good 6 inches. Regardless, I will be ordering again when I run out because it is very effective and I'd rather lose 6 inches of thick paper than have thin paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to throw your snow 20 feet?","review":"This compact, lightweight Toro is the David of snowthrowers, I've owned it for 3 seasons (CCR2450, the base model) and it just tears through anything below freezing. I have cowrorkers that bought the big metal 8hp throwers you see out there that make you look like a real man, well they end up scraping the last .25 inch layer of packed snow off their pavement and they have to stop and unclog their throwers every 5 minutes. This thing gets down to the pavement everytime, even the packed stuff and I've NEVER had to unclog it. The only possible drawbacks are the 20\\" swath is a little narrow, and in really deep stuff that the plow left behind (a foot or more) you may have to hit the drifts more than once to get everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Breaking the Mold ...","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. From the beginning to the end, I could not put it down! The two authors, Camerin Courtney and Todd Hertz, get oh so real in this book. They bring up many topics that I think a lot of Christian singles deal with and go through (definitely some I've gone through!), but don't necessarily want to talk about out of embarrassment or fear of being judged. Both authors share very personal experiences that are very relatable. This book really is an honest look at dating, raging hormones, and platonic vs. not-so-much guy girl friendships. One of the best things about the book for me was that it is a straight-up SHE SAID, HE SAID. It made the reading a lot more fun and I liked getting the guy perspective, especially since I am not at all fluent in \\"guy-speak\\"! ha ha If you are a single out there, get this book! You will be very happy you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Practical Than Others","review":"I liked this product so much I bought two of these.While perhaps not as fancy-looking as some of the other notebook stands available, this one is exponentially more practical. By lifting the machine off the table without touching much of the bottom, the machine stays remarkably cool, thus increasing the notebook's performance.Additionally, the stand swivels quite nicely -- another feature not offered by competitive products.That said, I was a bit dismayed when the pegs at the bottom of the stand popped off when I slid it slightly across the table. They were easy to stick back on, but the fact that they fell off to begin with is still disappointing. This happened with both stands I purchased, so it seems its an inherent problem with the product. I suppose at some point I should buy some Crazy Glue to permanently solve the problem.Overall, I recommend the product, but suggest an additional purchase of Crazy Glue or similar highly adhesive substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded Expectations","review":"MacBook fits perfectly on it.

A great diving board into the ocean..."},{"rating":"1","title":"good introduction ....","review":"The introduction to this translation of Sanskrit poetry is very good. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the other reviewers about the translation. The English rhymes in such short poems make them seem utterly trivial. The amount of dexterity required to produce a few rhymes gives them a slightness, which I suspect cannot be true of the originals. I cannot read Sanskrit, but since it is an inflected language there is room for subleties that are obliterated by the one dimensional tendency of pushing towards a rhyme. One gets no sense of the art and craft that we are told is in these possibly sophisticated miniature poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apoptygma Berzerk - Cambodia","review":"Cambodia is an awful song, there, I said it. I have no idea how this came to be a single, the music is boring, the lyrics are horrible, the vocal melody is laughable. On this two track single, we are treated to this horrible song and a live version of Unicorn. Now, Unicorn is a great song, and normally I love it, but in this live version, it is absolutely slaughtered. The vocals are so bad they become annoying, and the music, well the music is sequenced so you really can not screw it up. But again, the vocals are so bad that it destroys the entire song beginning to end. This is an absolutely worthless single and Apop should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work for Me","review":"I read the reviews below and hoped for the same experience.

Since this was a 10 year anniversary edition, perhaps some of Bill Hicks' contemporaries and acolytes could have expanded on his original work. As it stands, this appears to be a lame attempt to cash in on a dated piece of work without making the effort to fully investigate Bill Hicks' career. The subject deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and inspiring","review":"my expectations for this book were low. released on the 10th anniversary of his death, i was expecting it to be just a collection of transcripts of material already made public. however, this is not the case. in fact, because some of the material is drawn from his early days (early 80s), it was a surprise to me to see he had already pierced the social construction of reality at such an early age. i had mistakenly assumed that this didn't happen until the later in the decade (assumed mostly because of his growing up in the monolithic culture that he did). this book is a great reminder of how genuine a person bill was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cups, great customer service","review":"Love these cups, very lightweight, look like glass and not plastic, easy to grip, could not be happier with their appearance.

When this collection was originally reased it was of corse on vynal and there is some produstion quality to it that makes that easy to tell. Of course I have never been one to judge that, I kind of like the raw sound that allot of the early goth had. Not to denote any of the newer goth or ninties goth it's all good, I love it when you can tell that a band is doing something for the art and for the exression and not for fame and money but because this is \\"this is what they want to do\\" slef expression.

The Empress doesn't give off the vibe that she started from the bottom of the drum and bass scene and worked her way up, and her music and mixing skills prove that. This cd starts off melodic, but it gets cheesy. The pitch is too high in certain points and for the songs that aren't meant to be played that way, it ruins it.If you want a good all around drum and bass cd, get Reid Speed's Resonance or DB's Secret Art of Science or any one of Dieselboy's cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service Ramps","review":"These ramps are nice if you need to conserve space as the ramp portion detaches.

The period instruments sound so wonderful and lush. It was recorded in just the right environment and sounds superb.The approach to both pieces is spot on and you will want to listen to this recording many times just for the sheer fun of it.The provided booklet provides some helpful notes on the background of the pieces - when and why Bach wrote them. And also the libretto (which is ALWAYS nice to have). I like to have all that information available and knowing when and why can deepen our appreciation of the music. However, the first and most important thing is to hear the music.This recording is among the best of these works. So, you would do well to begin here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mush of sound from Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque","review":"This Erato recording is one of the mushiest and least distinct recordings of Bach's Easter Oratorio and Magnificat I have ever heard.The tone has been pitched to the half-step lower Baroque pitching which has been done before. That is not the problem.What is the problem is an Orchestra and Choir that fight itself in tempi,where bowing and enunciation is lost in a cacaphony of muck and mire.The Oratorio fares better than the Magnificat which this listener would never recommend to any serious listener.Stick with the Lausonne version.It is clear and crisp and not so frenetic.Not at all recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Borodin Bargain Bar None","review":"If you want a compact collection of excellent performances of Alexander Borodin's orchestral music, here it is: The three symphonies, In the Steppes of Central Asia, Petite Suite, selections from Prince Igor and the orchestrated Notturno from the Second String Quartet. The sound is fine, and the performances are even better. As is always the case, you might find individual works that come off better in other recordings, but taken as a whole there is none better. I'm giving this four stars because while I very much enjoy the compositions on the second disc, I'm not all that crazy about those on the first. The Second Symphony, the Notturno and In the Steppes of Central Asia have always been among my favorites, but Prince Igor has never really hit the spot for me, and the other two symphonies, while mildly interesting, pale in comparison to the wonderful No. 2.

If Ms. Kemp wants to be a published author she really needs to learn how to write.Sorry, but it's so bad it's a rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Green This Way Comes","review":"Shadow's Fall is one of those books that defines genre labeling, so it often gets overlooked by mainstream readers. It's a neat little story, combining elements of a modern fantasy, which reminded me of a meeting between Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", and Baum's \\"Oz\\" stories. The mythical universe of Shadow's Fall comes alive in this book and the reader experiences the best feeling that one could have when reading such a book: you wish you could go there and visit the place for yourself. Higher praise is simply not possible. Green is better known for his fun, romping Deathstalker stories, but this one shows that the author can branch out and write a less traditional story (although in one of the Deathstalker books, there's a couple of chapters which reminded me of Shadow's Fall). All in all, a good story and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily, one of the best books I've ever set eyes on!!","review":"This is one of the greatest books I've ever read in my life. The way Simon Green portrays his characters is unrivaled. It's the type of book that your average person will fall in love with, simply because we all see a little of ourselves in every character. It's a very thought-provoking book, as well, since Simon Green approaches all sorts of philsophical issues throughout the book. All in all, a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where dreams go to die","review":"I only got this book through a very kind friend. And I was delighted.Shadow's Fall is a town where dreams go to die, and bizarre things are commonplace. (Cartoon animals playing with normal animals?) Except there's a prophecy (<sigh> there's always a prophec) of the town's doom tied to one man--and that man has come to town.It's almost a surreal mystery. And the pieces tie together very nicely; Green thought out the setting pretty well. Perhaps the worst flaw in the book is the pretty-much-irrelevant chapter dealing with Polly's problems, which I thought could've been removed from the book without changing it much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite book of all time","review":"I picked up this book years ago on a whim. By the time I was done with it, I wanted there to be more. But after searching all I could on the author, I found out this was a different kind of book than what he usually does. That's too bad because this is the book that I hold as the standard for everything I've read since. Nothing even comes close. It has everything from cartoon characters, elves, Father time, and of course the unliving turnip headed Jack Fetch. I longed for a movie version, or even an comic adaption, but the best book I've ever read went out of print and disapeared from everywhere but used book stores. It's a shame this book didn't get the recognition it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Idea Falls Short","review":"I thought that Shadows Fall was extremely entertaining up to the halfway mark. Strangely enough, once the action started to pick up a bit I became more and more disenchanted. For one thing, there are far too many subplots woven together to keep the work as a whole cohesive. Shadows Fall has interesting characters (including a thinly disguised rock star who is no longer with us), a creative setting, and an impressive premise. It also has a very disappointing conclusion. Maybe this one book could have been divided into a trilogy or series with each subplot given the attention it deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Ideas Went to this Town to Die","review":"The ideas and concepts and even some of the characters were so fantastic that I was really upset when I realized that nothing was happening!

I almost put it down permanently several times. Then I got suckered in by the action that started happening mid-way through the book. It seemed as if the pace was picking up, and indeed there were some interesting character twists (like the relationship between Time and Hart that I had a feeling about), but then it degenerates into 200 pages of violence, with the last 30 being like something out of a zombie horror film, gratuituous and sadistic. I was so sickened by it it gave me nightmares afterwards. SKIP THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zatoichi - In Color!","review":"I'd bought the box set 1 - 4 and I've just seen this episode 4 - it's probably the best of the first 4 and it's in color! I seem to remember the previous ones being in black and white? Well, the technicolor transfer to DVD here is just dazzling. The colors are rich and full, and with the viewing of this episode 4 I've come to realize what the Zatoici pictures are - minor works of art. Each scene is a painted picture of imagery and color. And as I mentioned, this Episode 4 \\"The Fugitive\\" may be the best in the box set, and not only for it being in color but for the story as well. To tell you the truth, episode 3 \\"New Tale of Zatoichi\\" had rather put me to sleep, beautiful as it was. In episode 4, not a long episode, things move faster and there are a couple of exciting scenes which make this episode one of the more memorable. The picture ends with rather a tear and a smile. Works of art. Not a bad place to start with Zatoichi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff!","review":"I found this when I lived in Vancouver, Canada.

So rather than having to remember to take the driver back and forth, I decided to get him another one.

I have a heavy 14-volt impact drill using Ni-Cad batteries. So when those batteries needed to be replaced and the cost was very high, I looked for alternatives. This tool was a definite upgrade for my uses. It was very compact (note \\"pocket\\" in description), had better battery technology, still provided variable power, and the torque proved nearly as good as my much heavier cordless drill. Apparently brand name tools do live up to their reputation! Since cost for this product, with 2 batteries and charger, was less than replacement batteries for other drill, the decision was easy. Thanks to companies marketing on the internet able to provide great products at superior prices to what you are usually able to find locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I read the reviews that said it's a good little tool for light duty work. It's not in my opinion. The chuck sticks at times, the drill speed is way too slow. I would say it's a unitasker fit for people who want to use it to screw 2-3 screws into soft wood. If you have a lot of work to do, get a more powerful drill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck not as good as 10.8V Pocket Driver","review":"I like everything *except* the new chuck.It does not hold the bits I use.I have several, older, 10.8V Pocket Drivers I have been using with no problems.

Based on the positive reviews I bought this plus the Titan bit set as a gift for Christmas. Big mistake! If you want to draw circles to decorate a wall, you could dip the end of the bit in wet paint and make great little circles...but don't try to drill any holes! This can't hold a bit straight no matter what you do. Tried different chucks in it too, and even took it to a tool store for advice, but they just said there was nothing that could be done to make it work well. A big waste of money. Apparently it can still drive screws, but what a lot of money to spend for a screwdriver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch 12 volt","review":"I'm real happy with this driver. Its not 18 volt and I didn't have 18 volt expectations. It is light, holds a charge long, the led light is handy, I like that it came with 2 batteries (I bought the combo pack) and case. I feel it provides more longstanding power than I expected. I even used it to power my hold saw for a 4\\" hole this weekend and it didn't kill the battery.I was surprised that it had a quick release instead of a chuck. I hadn't had that before and initially didn't care for that; however, I now like it and also picked up a cheap chuck that works with the quick release. I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best investment in small tool","review":"This pocket driver has a lot of zip for such a small tool.

It replaces most of my screwdrivers. The LIon batteries are great because they keep the charge until they are almost out and with the 30 minute charge you get back to work quickly.

I picked up an adapter set so I can fasten socket head cap screws. I use it primarily for driving bolts, 4mm to 10mm snug then I torque with a torque wrench. I also use it for electrical terminal block connections thanks to the variable torque settings. This driver is tough! It has been submerged in hydraulic fluid, dropped from 10ft, dusted with metal grindings and it keeps on working. After the hydraulic fluid incident, I just sprayed WD-40 into the motor area and blow it with compressed air, good-to-go! This driver is small enough to fit in my travel tool case too. I was surprised how much torque it has and it also feels good in my hands. When it finally dies, I will be getting another one without a doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pocket driver ever!","review":"I bought one and loved it....my dad came over to help me with a project and used it and he loved it....so guess what he got for Christmas!?!?! It's small, compact, light and has enough power to drive just about any screw you want. If you get some hex shanked drill bits it can be used to drill a pilot hole before you put in your screw. Great product, would recommend to any craftsman or for just general use around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this!!!","review":"For residential or commercial use, you can't go wrong. Working in the home improvement industry, my line of work is window and door installations. Working off a scaffold with an 18 volt cordless drill is now a thing of the past. The PS20 is a fraction of the weight of its 18 volt big brother, plus it fits conveniently in my tool pouch. It's magnetic tip keeps the screws where they belong when reaching. Don't get me wrong, my 18 volt Bosch is a workhorse but you can't beat the PS20 for its portability, power (impressive for a 12 volt), and battery life. Another great Bosch product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good to be Read in an Airport","review":"This book starts off with a light-hearted introduction, but quickly plunges the reader into a maze of possibilities. It is a book to be read slowly, thinking about each plane as it is presented. The best part of the book is it's concluding story, which is something like a metaphor for Le Guin's life to this point, a blur of possibilities, imaginings, and outcomes. This book is highly recommended for Le Guin fans or as an introduction to her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and beautiful","review":"Oh, why didn't I think of it first? The idea of changing physical planes when waiting in an airport is wonderful! I loved the book, some stories better than others. I've read every one of her adult books I can get my hands on (I own 90%) of them. It is amazing how Le Guin manages to be new every time. What a mind the woman has!After reading Le Guin, the next book I read has to be a masterpiece not to suffer by comparison. It isn't that Le Guin writes good books. Every sentence she writes is beautiful. And then that they fit together and tell a story is just icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, engaging, and whimsical","review":"This was my first book of Le Guin's and afterwards I was a fan. This collection of short sci-fi stories is a smart and creative cultural critique. I actually use this book for my class as a metaphor for challenging dominant cultural narratives and my students love it. Her stories aren't ideological- if anything they are more a probe into the ideological that disrupt narratives that often dictate our society.

A book I can re-visit again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Used Book","review":"I know the book is a used paperback, and didn't expect it to be perfect, but I don't consider the condition to be sellable.

Reading the reviews for this cd, I thought it was going to be perfect. I was a little disappointed. However in my opinion I WOULD GIVE THIS CD A REVIEW OF 3.5/5.There are some great tracks including: Skittles (Pop A Pill), Whateva, Whateva feat. Kinfolks, Use What U Got & Round & Round.But there were some tracks that were to SOFT: \\"Still Gettin My Clit Licked\\" & \\"Call Me\\" feat.

The in and out of the computer was good, just be aware that only the gain changes the level going in to the computer, and the channels are always sent to the computer no matter the settings of the board. It says 10 in and I guess that is technically true, but two of your ins are just the stereo main mix. It also has 10 channels out just know that 2 of these channels are dedicated to either the headphone or monitor output. It is nice that you can route back 8 channels to the board and use them in the mix as well, and you still get your inputs to the computer.

The section on the Mehdia is well-researched, but a little slow. The sections on Nelson's ship and the Graf Spee were riveting and hard to put down. The author weaves the history of the ship with the story of the modern search and investigative efforts in a very readable fashion. Not a lot of interesting modern day photos and certainly not a lot of artifact photos as these wrecks are located in low visibility water conditions.

You sense the same sort of bouncy, tuneful joy in his work that you feel in the early Beatles recordings. Owsley could be a little more mature, but then again, since when did boyishness ever disqualify you from being a rocker?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pop guitar album","review":"I like this album. It reminds me of a more radio-friendly Jason Falkner. Really nice guitar sounds, good slick production, good vocals, catchy kinda-quirky melodies. My only real complaint is that there aren't any really great songs on here, just 11 really good songs. There isn't anything that stays with me for days n'days. I know when I put this CD on, I'm gonna enjoy it, and hum along, tap my foot, and (if I'm alone) sing along and come up with my own fun harmonies, but after the CD is over, I'm gonna put it away and get something else out. Still, it's a very good CD, and I look forward to hearing more from Owsley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Happy, Play Owsley","review":"Saw Owsley opening for Chris Isaak last year and really enjoyed the show.

I knew I definitely wanted to hear \\"Zavelow House\\" again, so off I went to the bookstore, hoping to like more of it than just the one song. Well, I love the first seven tracks immensely! but after that, it tends to lose engergy for me. However, it's still a HIT rather than a MISS for this 45-yr old. \\"Zavelow House\\" is just *the best* song on the entire CD, altho I cannot seem to get the chorus from \\"On the Radio\\" out of my head.

It is a scene toward the middle of the movie where a woman with very large breasts is barely covered. The scene is about 5 minutes long.

It is not my type of animated movie however. I thought all of Tim Burton's works were lame. I am more impressed with the animation work in Alvin And The Chipmunks, Ice Age, and Shrek.These movies had less sinister plots, and were good enough for the entire the family.

Obviously is not like in the cinema, but when you try to relax your eyes to distinguish all the colours and images, is hard to keep this state.The notes recomend a completly dark room, because even the light of you reproducer can affect the 3D images.Anyway it is a MUST in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"Not sure what all the excitement is about.Who was this for? It's far too scary to be a kids' movie; not scary enough to be an adults' movie, and it gets off to an awfully slow start, with many unnecessary characters.And it was just to trippy, too dreamy. I know it comes from a book, and it probably works better as a book. The relentlessly surreal sequences toward the end got to be too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT family friendly","review":"I have to say, we watched this with our children, 5 and 7 and I was disappointed with the lack of family friendliness of this movie. I thought it was too scary for a PG movie and didn't like the heavy chested, lack of clothing part of the movie with little kids. Thought that was a bit much. We have seen so many other animated movies like this, but I was disappointed and a bit shocked by some of the content of this movie, from a parents perspective. I would have not let my kids see it if I would have watched it in advance! Perhaps older children would be fine but mine were definitely freaked out by it and afraid to go to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coraline AWESOME. this version- suck","review":"my review is about this particular set since Coraline is an excellent film and in blu-ray is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! however, i bought this version with the digital copy in mind (trying to stay on the legal side) and universal, unlike other companies who have extended the valid dates for their digital copies, are not so nice about it. customer support was completely unhelpful jovially saying thanks! but providing no alternative for the digital copy aspect of this set for which i paid. highly disappointed in this version and universal's inability to work with the consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great disc, disappointing 3D","review":"Well, our whole family loved Coraline, so buying it on Blu was a no-brainer. The movie quality is what one would expect from a new movie (especially animated) on high-def.My big disappointment came when I checked out the 3D version. Rather than using the Real 3D technology as was in the theatre version, they used color-alternate anaglyphic 3D (like old school 3D movies). The included glasses are the typical cardboard type. It works well enough, but I was hoping for something a bit more advanced. Also, rather than using the typical red/cyan anaglyphic, it's purple/green, so additional pairs of glasses will be a bit tougher to come by.Why oh why couldn't they have stuck with the Real 3D tech for the disc? :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome","review":"I guess I am too old for this.

If this is what kids want, there is a worse future ahead of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gaimen's Coraline","review":"I read the book first, and it is much better than the movie. I don't know why the movie made the parents so mean. In the book, they work from home, but they aren't hateful to her when she asks questions. There are also several unnecessary changes that make the story less interesting. Why change the painting over the fireplace and then make it less interesting? Why does the other dad play piano? The other parents are creepy because they are always waiting for Coraline and don't seem to have any other purpose but to give her their undivided attention, which makes them very creepy when you realize they are always watching her and waiting, but you don't know what they are waiting to do. Coraline is suspicious of the other parents right away and everything is darker in the other world. The movie has none of the sense of setting and foreboding of the book.Read the book if you want a more interesting and scary story."},{"rating":"2","title":"i really liked this one","review":"creepy yet cute. more for adults i would say. probably would scare the crap outta little kids haha a a"},{"rating":"1","title":"took forever and 3d doesn't work","review":"I ordered this video on 9/30 and it didn't arrive until 10/25 or so.

The Blu-Ray I recieved was not made for 3D TVs. This is made to watch with the cheap blue and red 3D glasses that come with the product. The box does not even say Blu-Ray 3D like the image used to advertise. Do not buy this movie if you are looking to watch it on a 3D TV that uses Active or Passive glasses.

This is not a Blu-Ray 3D movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"More adult than most kids films.","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit I loved this flick and I'll be the first one to pick it up on DVD. This movie deviates from my normal taste in movies like Highlander and the Transporter. I am 19 years old and saw this with my 46 year old father when it came out and we loved it. I thought this movie was a little to intense for a children's movie as it will probably scare the crap out of it's directed audience. The core message is to appreciate what you have(the good and the bad). I loved the fact that it was done in stop motion and not CG I recommend this not as a kids movie, but as an adventure/horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 3D animation movie","review":"This movie is excellent, the story is quite dark and complex for a child's movie. Animation is perfect.The 3D effects could have be more visible, but there are some nice effects, apparently 3D in the \\"other world\\" is voluntarily emphazised by the director to contrast with the \\"ordinary\\" world wich is quite flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy this for the 3-D","review":"I'm someone who has seen the movie in theatres, and has read the book. As a film, \\"Coraline\\" is great, different in tone from the book but equally valid and entertaining. The experience of watching it in 3-D at home, however, was not as enjoyable. It was markedly different from the 3-D I saw in theatres. Even after following the prescribed optimal viewing procedures (keeping the room dark, setting picture mode to \\"standard,\\" letting my eyes get adjusted) I found the 3-D to be terribly desaturated in color, fuzzy, and not terribly effective. In the movie house, the 3-D was seamlessly integrated into the film and added texture. At home, it became distracting and fuzzy, and didn't do justice to the photography. By all means buy this movie, but I'd recommend seeing it in 2-D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!

I only got the 3D blu-ray in this set! The cover didn't even match the picture, as mine only said blu-ray 3D and nothing on the back said otherwise. If it is written on here as two discs and 4 formats then it will confuse consumers. The support I spoke with said that it's been happening frequently and that they probably don't have the version the website says they have. I ordered from another vendor.C'mon, Amazon!

The film has Tim Burton written all over it, but to my knowledge he had nothing to do with this sinister little film. I'm a sucker for Stop Motion Animation and 'Coraline ' delivers some excellent visuals that might put the little ones(under 10)in your bed every night for weeks after seeing it. I bought the Blu Ray set and it looks and sounds fantastic, but the 3-D is disappointing as the color seems to be very off or washed out. I haven't seen any 3-D films that look right in my home, so maybe it's my home theater equipment?

Supposedly this is supposed to be a \\"nontraditional\\" animated film... which it is. Unfortunately, it's also a very lousy film. First of all, it's not for kids; it's dark, it has a sarcastic view of the world, it's scary at times and it's definitely not funny. 2nd of all, it's not going to appeal to any human being of any age range, largely for the afore mentioned reasons and also because the whole plot is strange, although understandable.2.

There's a story alright but the problem here is that when it's not confusing it's downright creepy. Who were they targetting for this flick? Little kids who might get the bejesus scared out of them?

Whoever created this movie gets a thumbs UP!! Good job!!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"This movie is very artistic. It's music, it's visuals, even the story content. A must have. I'm sorry my 4 year old and I absolutely love it!! It doesn't get old. In fact, we're gonna watch it again tonight and I've had it for at least a year. It's a masterpiece!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst 3D edit I've ever seen","review":"They took an amazing 3D theater experience and ruined it. First of all, it uses 1950's style monochrome red/green lenses. The 3d scenes are blurry and unconvincing. Furthermore, the \\"3D\\" disc only contains selected scenes of 3D footage! The rest of the time, you're watching standard 2D scenes through color-destroying glasses. I can't believe that the film-makers let the studio get away with such a shoddy DVD edit of what was once a beautiful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but not great","review":"I bought this movie looking for something different.

We we watched it I was very disappointed. It was weird......story didn't make any sense. Neither myself or my children understood the point of the movie. And I have to say that the sceen with the large busted woman with a bikini bottom and pasties on was a little inappropriate for my kids (6 and 8yrs.). Luckily neither of my children noticed it much except for my daughter to comment \\"she has huge boobs\\". I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone with younger kids. I guess if you like Tim Burton you might enjoy this movie but I think most of his work is a little out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives me the heeby jeebies!","review":"I watched this movie a few years ago when it first came out on DVD. I am fifteen and it still haunts me. It is very creepy and disturbing. My older sister was 21 at the time we watched the movie together and she had nightmares about it. I don't understand the hype. The people who gave this movie high praise must be demented. My cousin is also terrified of this movie. She watches horror movies all the time and they don't bother her, but she despises this movie. One time, my cousin and I were staying at a relative's house and there was a small door in the wall like the one Coraline crawls through in the movie to get to the other world. My cousin and I were so scared that we couldn't sleep in that bedroom. This movie is definitely not for kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FUBAR","review":"I ordered \\"Coraline (Single Disc Edition w/3D)\\". I received \\"Coraline (Single Edition w/2D).

I believed this would add a high degree of reliability to assure correct, and accurate order. Amazon has replied that they have no control over what is in vendor's wharehouses, or what is shipped. So why does Amazon advertise that they personally pack, and ship, order?? If it ain't correct, don't ship it! It is not what I orderd, do not pack it! Look at order. Look at product.

Good graphics and sound.Cons:Not suitable for young audiences.Despite that we consider our self an open-minded couple, we believe that because of the darkness of the plot this film should be rated PG13 not suitable for young kids. My disappointment is because this film is advertized as a cartoon for open audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weird movie!","review":"I thought that this was a really weird movie.

That said it was too scary for younger children and a bit over there heads. The most disturbing thing is the 70 years old lady dressed like a stripper!! She is all but naked with a bathing suit bottom and nipple covers (and nothing I mean nothing else) on her size double ZZ breast. Why would any decent person put that in a child's movie!!! Why am I the only person who even found it disturbing? Please protect your kids from this. I am so sorry I did not cheick it out on [...] before watching it with my kids.

We looked carefully to find a version that was NOT analgyph, that did not come with special glasses. As of January 2013, this item did not show it included such glasses so we thought we had the right one. WRONG. It comes with the inexpensive glasses. So...it may work OK with standard TV, but it is not optimized for the new 3D TV/DVD/Active glass combo. Other complaint: the movie disc is two sided - one for 3d & one for 2d viewing. BUT, it is not labelled, so you have to insert it in the player to figure out which side it's playing on - big annoyance and time-waster."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE for anyone younger than 13!!!","review":"This movie visually for a person old enough, is very pleasing. I would NOT NOT NOT let anyone younger than 13 watch it! It has a very suggestive nature. The term \\"Jerk wad\\" is not something that young kids need to hear. Let alone the old burlesque dancers bobbing around in nothing but pasties and ginormus breasts!! It's definatly a disturbing story...to say the least! VERY VERY creepy for kids! I think it should have been rated PG-13!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for young children!","review":"I decided to watch this cartoon b/c my son (3 yrs old) already seen it twice.

From evil people with buttons as eyes, naked obese creepy old ladies (boobs are like watermelons and naked with tassel covering the nipples), just about any creepy and screwed up thing for a little kid that you can think of.

It's similar to films like \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" or \\"Corpse Bride\\", but not as quirky. However, it's a solid, entertaining film with beautiful visuals. However, the 3D is very weak. This film has brilliant colors and the 3D glasses reduce the film to almost B/W because of the red/green filters that are used unlike the polarizing lenses in movie theaters. Also, they can give you a bit of a headache.Watch this film in 2D at home. Save the 3D for your local IMAX theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!","review":"I, like many, have seen this film more times than I would openly admit and, I must say that this is the BEST EVER version of Hercules against the Moon Men I've seen. I am referring to the picture quality. It is very sharp. I did not notice the \\"compressed aspect\\" as has been mentioned in other reviews here. The Witch's Curse does not look as clean unfortunately but, it also is the best version I've seen -with respect to picture quality.There are some nice extras and I am very happy with the overall item."},{"rating":"1","title":"campy formula flick, the stuff of late-night kids TV in the 1960s","review":"I saw and loved this as a kid, but now my kids found this as laughable as I did. There is absolutely nothing to this except background passtime junk. There was a place for that when \\"nothing else is on\\", but that era is behind us now that we can immediately get what we want when we want it via the internet. OK, the action is good, the muscles are impressive, and the story is grindingly typical and unsurprising if solid. But really, it is a waste of time and electricity. Seeing it again gave me no nostalgic memories, like, say watching the Stoodges or the Bowery Boys does.

As our world has continued on the bumpy and circuitous path toward enlightenment, taking steps forward and back, this book continues to remind us that throughout the world, we are more alike than different and our shared humanity is reason to put down arms and get along. I have chosen this book as a gift for my favorite graduates every spring, connecting my generation to future ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this book.","review":"I am so glad Family of Man is still available. I would also suggest that in conjunction with this book, you offer Family of Women, and Family of Children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural Elitism","review":"Though a beautiful idea of connecting all humanity, this project falls short and is sadly a product of it's time. I will state just a few brief examples of the many. First, women are again and again portrayed either in the embrace of their lovers, caring for children, or cooking. There is a page depicting women doing all sorts of 'work' like cleaning various things, while on the next page men engage in board meetings, lab experiments, drafting, etc. The typical African man is depicted as a half clothed (if not fully naked) tribesmen. In the 24 instances where a black man is clothed, 17 of them are photos from the United States. There is so much more that can be said (such as the absence of gay or lesbian couples, the \\"Western\\" narrative of love/marriage/birth, etc). I'm simply disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Solid construction. I attached this to a milk crate that then sits in the tank well of my kayak. The width of the item is the exact same width as the milk crate so it's a perfect fit. There are no stops inside the tubes so your rod will slide down until the reel sits against the top of the tube. Maybe a feature, maybe a problem depending on usage. I'm taking it as a feature. Some tubes have a slot cut in the top so the reel actually slides down a bit into the tube. These tubes do not have that feature.BTW, it is supposed to come with the mounting screws but mine did not, so be warned. For me it didn't matter as I used zip ties for attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some pretty groovy stuff","review":"This is Sonic Youth's most accessible and listener-friendly CD in quite awhile, but I think the hardcore SY fans will still like it. In the past I was able to appreciate their occasional shrieking experimental noise pieces from an abstract art perspective, but that didn't make for music that I went back to for repeat listenings. On the Ripped CD, the noise and distortion are more directly in service of the melodies, and some excellent melodies there are indeed. I'm particularly impressed with \\"Turquoise Boy,\\" which features an ethereal vocal from Kim (she and Thurston are as ultra-cool and laid-back as ever on the new songs) and a superb balance between chaos and control. I also like the spooky Doors-ish feel of \\"Rats,\\" and just about all the other songs are great too. The whole album just has a combination of factors that make it one of the best SY discs ever. (The \\"fake bootleg\\" cover art is pretty bad, though.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off-beat songs that sparkle.","review":"Great album from SY. It's a very neat and organized record with short but strong compositions. It's hard to compare it to any previous albums, because there is a subtle quality to it that is just like nothing they've done before. This is being called a pop record, but compared to the standard of \\"pop\\" music in today's industry, this is far too high quality and sophisticated to be called that. It took me a few listens to really hear the excellent musicianship on songs like \\"The Neutral\\" or \\"Pink Steam.\\" Thurston described it as a \\"super song record\\" and I definitly agree with that.

I would not let even my dog listen to this album, for fear he would hate me. What was Eddie thinking? By the way, PJ was awesome!- a concerned citizen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Focused Effort","review":"Despite the nondescript cover, this is the most solid and focused collection they've come up with since 1992. Neither the sound nor the performances drift into wispiness as so much of their stuff from the past 20 years does.As always their influences are on their sleeves. \\"Incinerate\\" sounds more like Television that Television does. \\"Reena\\" sounds like the Allman Brothers (but tighter). \\"What a Waste\\" is Ziggy Stardust all the way. \\"Or\\" is Graham Lewis all the way. But the first three of those are solid tight songs - as is the low-end punky \\"Sleepin' Around\\" and Renaldo's impressionistic \\"Rats\\". Solid record, quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow out...","review":"I've always been a fan of Sonic Youth. This album doesn't have as much raging-guitar experimentation, but its still shows up. This album has a very mellow, chill mood.

Many relaxing riffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guy Forsyth's best album to date.","review":"Can you live without is a great album. It's less bluesy than Forsyth's other 2 albums but is still strongly influenced by the blues tradition. It's a great mix of rock, blues and a little folk and has that sound that belongs only to Guy Forsyth. I've listened to this band for years now and have been a fan since the first time I saw them. But the band currently is the best it's ever been and this album reflects that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Calico Girl instead!!!!","review":"Though the music is great, PLEASE do not buy this album, especially as a digital download. Sony Records, now the owner of Texas Music Group, refuses to pay Guy royalties for digital downloads of this album.

There is no new material in this book, just reprints or different angles of shots that were already used in 'Seaside Interiors\\".

By the time Mellon Collie came out the smashing pumpkins had established themselves as one of the great alt-rock bands of the 90's. It's amazing that a band can put out an album as masterful as Gish and to top it as the pumpkins did with Mellon Collie and the Infinate Sadness. I urge you to buy this album and support a near abolished creature, the Musician. This album has great creativity. There are amazing lyrics and uncontainable guitar riffs. Billy Corgan takes his guitar and brings it to life. Great work from a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for the Pumpkin fan","review":"Gish was my introduction to the Smashing Pumpkins and a cd that stayed in heavy rotation throughout the early 90's.

This CD is unbelieveable. i could not believe how great this band is. first off im a drummer and jimmy chamberlain needs no introduction. second, James Iha! i love his huge chords and those solos that are vintage. Billy has a very unique voice. hmm... if you listen to this record you will find that no matter what they do there is always a hint of sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumpkin's Smashing debut!","review":"This is the root of the Pumpkin's music.

SP were part of a group of new bands trying to push the boundaries (along with Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Sonic Youth, Jane's Addiction, Faith No More, Dinosaur Jr., Soundgarden, et al). I had this back in 91 and was struck by how similiar I thought it sounded to Jane's Addiction. Since I was in mourning over Jane's breakup, I ate this up (I even saw SP tour to support this album - in between Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers in Oct 91!!). Anyway, while this album has a lot of great songs, fans of Siamese Dream may be surprised by some of Gish's more psychadelic leanings. It's a good album, but listening to it 15 years later, I realize that it loses steam and focus on the second half. Nonetheless, it'll always hold a place in my heart (props to the reviewer from Ontario who nailed high school in the early 90s on the head)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great indie sounding album","review":"The pumpkins were basically unknowns when this was released, and it wasn't nearly as big as the mammoths siamese dream and mellon collie, but this is some great sounding stuff. I am one, co written by James Iha kicks off the album with some hendrix style guitar work, and drifts into a softer mood with rhinoceros, and D'arcy even does the singing on the final song which is a great closer. My only complaint is only 10 songs, which could have been more if they would have added album worthy b-sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goldie","review":"I think it is necessary to give a review of this album. More than 10 years have passed since i heard it, and it s a really 'good' album. B Corgan does things w Zwan now but this is remembered.There are so many influences here. It sounds like true Pumpkins, but we have some Floyd, Hendrix, etc. Crush sounds like it borrowed a bit from Meddle and Atom Heart mother of PF, and other songs here well sound nothing like any other group.This is an album of all hits. I was 16 when i first heard it back in '91, now i'm 27 and it feels like it has a timeless quality to it. I feel i'll be 35 and 45 and i'll get it out to hear it.Cheers to this band.4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"They should have been Nirvana!","review":"I think that Nirvana's Nevermind completly overshadowed this beautiful album from a band that sounded unlike anything else at the time.

Anyways I think the smashing pumpkins in general deserve alot more credit than given!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starchildren...","review":"Gish is not the best Smashing Pumpkins album, but it is by far the most innocent. Siamese Dream had this compelling power surge hiding behind every note. Gish, however, contains something that SD doesn't- innocence. This is the strength of this incredible record. It's a man and his passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice book.","review":"This books explains how a US single family house evolved to its current standard, including structure, plumbing, electrics, etc. The author is both knowledgeable on how things in our houses work and very good at communicating his knowledge to a lay person. Although there are a few \\"fix it yourself\\" or \\"complete guide\\" books that are good at providing quick solutions, this book will help you understand how some of the solutions work.

It was Anne Rice (!) that praised the novel in the New York Times Review talking about great fiction and regreting that modern fiction was poorly written (she has since denied herself by writing poor executed popular fiction for teenagers). Anyway, the point is that this book feels like nothing you've read about the subject -serial killer- before. It is more like an inside monologue. Don't expect cheap thrills, or killer-on-the-loose-page-turner.Sometimes weird, often hypnotizing,The Minus Man deserves to be successful. I hope that the movie coming out (good or bad) will give this book a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"when you read this book think of Owen Wilson","review":"It's so simple and that is scary.With this story we get to see inside the mind of a simple man.A simple man that simply kills.His habit of killing is the equivalent to a nicotine addiction.He simply needs his fix and he doesn't have to go to great lengths to get it.A drop of some poison as easy as buying a pack of cigarettes. I loved this book but I have to admit that I had the ADVANTAGE of seeing the movie first.Owen Wilson is so damn lovable and cute and that made the story so damn terrifying.It is a completely believable work of fiction.I'm not sure what you should do first---rent the movie or read the book. Whichever order, make sure you do both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even an Anti-Hero","review":"The main character is a serial killer. I didn't identify with him, feel sympathy for him, or like him. The author complicates the novel by throwing in timecrawls -- sudden flashbacks with no warning. They make a bad novel worse.The plot explores how the killer goes wandering the country, killing at random. The author writes a thin veneer of charming sociopath, which isn't even correct from a psychological standpoint.My recommendation: burn this book for warmth while reading a good Stephen King novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't drink from a stranger's flask","review":"The Minus Man is a harrowing journey into the mind of a mild mannered man who happens to be a psychopath. His method of killing is a quiet one, poison laced Southern Comfort. Lew McCreary's novel is spellbinding, using a finely tuned skill to make the reader care for, if not love a murderer. And a mass murderer at that. Van Siegert is one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in recent memory. His calm descriptions of killing are intended to convey a sense of normalcy in murder. The fact that he kills for no reason is scary enough, the idea that he can easily validate his murders is terrifying. If you are a fan of novels about psycho killers but want something that's not a slasherflick on the page, check out this book!The Minus Man was made into an excellent film starring Owen Wilson (in a sorely overlooked performance) as the quiet, yet lethal Van Siegert. Read the book, watch the movie, and don't drink from a stranger's flask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barely a 4 star read, but it made it.","review":"I really had to think about giving this book a 4 star rating.While I found the book to be mostly enjoyable, it was obvious that Mr. McCreary is not an accomplished writer. I also did not like how one of the supporting characters in the book murders his wife. I found this to be a little to unbelievable.However, I must admit that the narrative of the serial killer is quite interesting. It was interesting to hear the mind of someone who barely feels. Someone who just moves throughout life with hardly any planning of the future being made.I will give this book 4 stars out of 5. Just barely though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I love the Sog. This is a great knife. It has a very sharp edge and will be easy to sharpen with my sharpening kit. The spring assist is great. It's like having a legal switchblade. Switchblades are illegal in my state. The clip allows me to carry it in my pants pocket where it's easily retrieved. I would recommend this to a friend. The next knife I buy will also be a SOG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent knife","review":"The weight, feel & finish of this knife combine to make it one of my all time favorite folders. The side clip took a bit of tweaking to make it not grip so tightly but now it stays where I put it but comes out easily with one hand.The blades finish has held up and not scratched as I thought it would and the texture of the handle makes it very secure while using.It easily opens one handed and positively locks with a click so you know it's not going to fold up on you while you're using it.It comes very sharp from the factory and I recommend this knife to anyone that needs a good utility pocket or defensive knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Apartheid","review":"Despite my interests in history as it relates to science (and more specifically to medicine), I found this work to be sorely tedious. Nonetheless, it would have been redeemable had there been useful organization, instead wondering almost aimlessly among events not much better arranged than a high school term paper. The frequency of repetition also taxed my patience heavily. The irony of the epilogue leaving potential credibility for Linus Pauling's work with high-dose vitamin C in same way he criticized other charlatans' benefactors shouldn't be lost on the reader, but it's more likely the difficult delivery will discourage any reader from getting that far who isn't already heavily invested in evidence-based science. This certainly won't be the work that invites the lay public to be interested in science."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ALBUM","review":"I REMEMBER BUYING THIS BACK IN 1990,AND BEING A DIEHARD IRON MAIDEN FAN,I WAS REALLY AMAZED WITH THIS ALBUM.NOW,DON'T EXPECT THIS TO SOUND LIKE MAIDEN BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.IT IS NOT REALLY A HEAVY METAL ALBUM,IT IS MORE LIKE A ROCK ALBUM.HOWEVER THE MUSIC IS JUST AMAZING.TRACK#1,THE LION IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS EVER.IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THE ALBUM IN WORDS AND IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND AS WELL.EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW ON MUSIC,BUT IF YOU CAN FIND THIS JEWEL,BUY IT.OTHER GREAT TRACKS FROM THIS ALBUM INCLUDE:FALLEN HEROES,SILVER AND GOLD,MISUNDERSTOOD,AND BLOOD ON THE OCEAN WHICH MAKES YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO IT IN YOUR CAR DRIVING DOWN A DISTANT ROAD IN THE RAIN.WOW,WHAT GREAT MEMORIES THIS ALBUM BRINGS.ADRIAN SMITH IS NOT ONLY THE GREATEST GUITARRIST AND SONGWRITER EVER BUT VERY CAPABLE SINGER AS WELL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deservedly forgotten","review":"These reviews make me laugh.Yes, Adrian tried somehting different.

Beth sings from her soul, which I feel has been through so much. I don't know how, but I just know she has had hard times somewhere in her life. She sings to the hard times I have had in mine, and somehow I just know she understands. What a gift this girl has. Not only does she have the voice of an angel, she has communication with one, too. I love this music, I love this voice. What else can I say, except \\"thank you\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I owned BNC\\"s first 2 cds so I was thrilled to see she had a Greatest Hits cd.

The connectors are gold plated, and this cable set made a noticeable difference over the one the one I was previously using to connect my HD DVR to the big screen TV. The ends are clearly marked with the respective video signals - Red (Cr), Blue (Cs) and Green (Y), so you will have no problem keeping the connections straight between your components. They also come with a lifetime warranty. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stiff and somewhat difficult to manipulate","review":"For its intended use this cable cuts the mustard. The only complaint is the cable is rather stiff and heavy. It tends to unplug itself when I move my receiver forward in my cabinet.

Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reaction","review":"I wanted to like this deodorant but it did not work well for me. The smell was great but I felt like I had to reapply it every few hours -- I was actually carrying it around in my bag with me. Also, whether it was the over-application or just a bad reaction, it made my the skin around my underarms peel. I've never had that with a deodorant ever, so that was a huge turn-off.I've since switched to the Thai crystal and it seems to be working well. No peeling or burning. BUT, everyone is different, so give EarthScience a try if you want something natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed it into the trash after a week","review":"This product doesn't work, even a little bit.

I was hoping that \\"Chronicles of the Juice Man\\" would be as good as or better than \\"Vol. 16 For Da Summer\\". I wasn't disappointed. Paul hooked up a great CD, and Juicy matched it beat for beat and song for song. There are some blazing tracks on Juicy's CD. Project Pat is on a couple of songs, and a lot of the CD is Juicy rapping about Pat's recent probation violation and jail sentence. As you would expect from the Juice, there's also a lot of songs about sex. La Chat is really prominent on the CD with her tight flows and witty lyrics (take that \\"Lady\\" Boo!!). Die hard Mafia fans will dig this. Those who haven't been hypnotized yet will be if they get this CD. Looking forward to \\"Unbreakables\\".

Delightfully drawn characters, fresh paint on an old style of writing mysteries, just enough violence to suit the plot. What more do I need to say? Oh, yeah, get it and enjoy with a great cup of tea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Worst Book I Have Ever Read","review":"I can't even believe anyone published such abominable writing. The prose was hackneyed in the extreme. The plot was meandering. She had an omnipotent narrator, so the readers knew things that the detective didn't know. The detective Pitt, and his wife Charlotte, seemed like minor characters in a plot that should have been driven by them. And once again, the prose was just unbearably, laughably bad. It was so bad that at times, I couldn't even follow the meaning of the dialogue. Atrocious! I feel ashamed that I bought it, and read it, but I had heard good things about Anne Perry. Well, that will teach me to read a sample of anything before I pay good money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another pager-turner from Anne Perry!","review":"This is the second in the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series. I started reading it as soon as I had finished The Cater Street Hangman (the first)! Inspector Pitt is now married to his Charlotte and they make a delightful couple. Although pregnant with their first child, Charlotte does some detecting of her own in this case, helped by her well-to-do sister, Emily. The plot is excellent and the characters are very well-drawn. The strict rules regarding class which most of the Victorian upper-class people in this book feel compelled to follow appear somewhat laughable to us in this more enlightened age but are very destructive for all that! I could not put this book down until I knew whodunnit and I was quite a way through it before I guessed the culprit! A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. There's no relationship.","review":"If you like historical details, and want to know about Victorian London, manners and mores, this is the book for you. If you like full drawn characters that you can relate to, I'd skip these. I love serials, and bought the first four. I wish I'd only bought the first two. This is the second book and there is nothing about the courtship or wedding, or the relationship, or parents and sibling reactions. Anne Perry keeps telling me that Charlotte is independent, but I really only have her word for that, as marrying Thomas \\"beneath her station\\" seems to be the only independent thought she has. I'm disappointed in the characters, or lack of same; all of these people are strangers to each other, but even worse they are strangers to me. I disagree with other reviews that say the writing is good. It is adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"19th Century England","review":"This is only one story in Perry's list of over a dozen mysteries which recreate the atmosphere of late 19th century British Victorian hypocrisy and corruption. Her principle characters are Inspector Thomas Pitt and his well born wife Charlotte. While Thomas does his best to keep Charlotte out of his cases, when her curiosity is peaked her sense of adventure launches her into the fray. More than once it is Charlotte who uncovers the villain, even though she must probe for answers while exhibiting behavior appropriate for a woman of her class. In this story, Charlotte rattles the closets of the rich to unearth truths about the murder of two babies found in London's aristocratic Callander Square."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even for those who don't LOVE mystery novels","review":"Great book. Anne Perry's characters come alive with all their Victorian sensibilities. If I didn't know better, I'd think Anne Perry WAS a 19th century writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for a remix album.","review":"I'm not a fan of remix material. However, this is indeed a good remix album. The best tracks are Raptura (combichrist mix), Raptura (God Module Mix), and Forgotten Tears (Suicide Cammando mix).

So attracted, in fact, that any means or removing it, masking tape, lint roller, washing/drying it, praying over it, screaming at it, did nothing to remove the hairs. So if you have a pet or know someone with a pet, I would strongly reccommend that you reconsider this jacket, unless you want to look like said pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the bee's knees, unfortunately...","review":"For awhile I've been a fan of Ugorski's milking everything possible from the written notes, but this disc just rubs me the wrong way. A lot of architecture and structure are lost, the music constantly falls apart, one is constantly made aware of where Maestro Anatol's fingers are and what they're doing, but I regrettably miss out on too much of the music. Too much whimsy, it's just entirely too wayward, I'm sorry, but I was expecting these performances to be monumental and breathtaking... There's an incredible sense of magic, I'll give it that, but it feels almost like piano for beginners, like a sort of cop out from an aged pianist who no longer has the goods but indulges himself and his loyal following -- but, the thing is, this guy definitely still has chops, but he just gets way too carried away with trying to reinvent the wheel that he just can't see the forest for the trees.

I set up my fishing spot, my lure, fishing rod and line, and my lure. It is fun to figure out what the fish are biting on. I really like the 3D view from under the water. You can see the vegetation, the logs, wood, and other obstacles, plus you can see some fish, either behind your lure or in front of your lure. You just don't know where the fish will be coming from. In some cases, the fish actually takes the whole picture screen and gives you a rush to see if he takes your bait. I have a fishing CD that is just the opposite. You can see the top of the water and the fish while they are surfaced. It doesn't have the depth the Bass Fishing CD has. Try it, you'll love it. But be patient, a lot of the fish are large in weight and you have to bring them in very carefully. That's the challenge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am pleased","review":"One of my loves is playing the piano. And this book is a good book to learn the songs you love on the instrument you love.

The fun thing about the secondary (HD-2) channels is that most are being broadcast commercial free (for a while, at least).

The cast is awesome, you really feel the pain and anguish in Amalia (played by Lee Grant) as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son's life. This movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved. I love the way that Randal Kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless. The movie at times feels a little forced but I can't think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental Dreck","review":"Wildly offensive film which uses the AIDS crisis as an opportunity for self-righteous shallow soap-opera. Eric Roberts' lover leaves him when Roberts is diagnosed with HIV. This potentially powerful situation could have led to an honest portrayal of the pressures, both external and internal, present on gay relationships. But no, Randal Kleiser (the director of Grease and the Blue Lagoon) has no interest in anything that \\"deep.\\" He wants lots of opportunities for tearful farewells, tearful recriminations, and tearful tearfulness. The film succeeds best as a depiction of a community meeting a devastating plague with passive aggressiveness, bitchiness, anger, rage, hatred, unforgivingness, and a notable lack of grace. As a gay man who has lost several friends to AIDS, and who knows several couples who have worked very hard to salvage relationships despite one partner being HIV+, I found this film unspeakably offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the best movie that I have ever seen","review":"This movie is so touching, and I am not ashmed to say that I was balling at the end.

Politically correct to the point of being stupid. The film's incessant attempts at humor fail. Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film. He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false. It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character. The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant. The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss. Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off. Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments. If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie like the, well...you know.","review":"I want the two hours I wasted watching this piece of tripe back! 45 minutes into this maudlin, didactic, hyper-melodramatic film I was screaming \\"Die already!\\" at the screen.

Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Age","review":"VERY disappointed, as this was simply a disc. I don't own a Nintendo game. The way it showed on TV I thought it was a game I was purchasing. I can't use this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a game","review":"I like brain age but you can't buy it expecting a game. You can't really spend tons of time on it in a day because other than Sudoku you can only access each activity once a day. I have found that my math skills are improving and I like the challenge of doing better than the day before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy","review":"Essentially a good idea, but utterly hamstrung by poor speech recognition and VERY poor character recognition.Make no mistake, these two things serve to completely ruin the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game i luv to play","review":"This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What You Think It Is","review":"When I first saw this game come out I was like... that game is going to be so boring. But, one day I don't know what came over me and I bought it. I started playing it and I loved the games that you could play... they are kind of fun and I couldn't believe it but they help your brain!! The best feature that this game has is that it can tell you your brain age.. which is totally awesome. I liked everything about this game and you may see some other reviews that say that it has poor recognition, well... that's not true... it's amazing how it detects your writing no matter how horrible and your voice. Don't take this game for granted like I did... you will truly love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Game","review":"There are many screens that give useful information about the brain, but navigating through the screens (before actually playing a game) can be quite tedious. This occurs every time you want to play or finish a game. Also, the handwriting recognition software is poor and causes you to lose points when the game cannot recognize your writing. For example, I have to write a \\"g\\" so that the software will recognize the writing as a #9. The software gives an inaccurate depiction of your brain age because you will lose points when it cannot recognize your handwriting. The voice recognition is poor and I don't even have an accent. Don't waste your money. Playing a game of chess with somebody will give you more stimulation and less aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scissor... Sciiissssoooorrr... SCISSOR","review":"Voice recognition in this game needs some work. Kind of bums your score when it doesn't recognize you voice... on ONE word. My voice isn't really all that high either.... my boyfriend had no trouble. He has a really deep voice.Aside from that... this game is just OKAY at most. I'd say try out Big Brain Academy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Age","review":"At first , I did not like the game .But ,I do now .It does have a flaw about being able to hear , there is a question asked of the player --Can you speak or not If you choose speak for some reason it will go just so far and then it says it can't hear you other than that its a good game and I probably will look into buying Brain age II ."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least is has Soduku","review":"I found it rather frustrating how often it misunderstood my speech (English IS my first language) and even more-so my numbers it frequently misread my 1's, as 4's and made up numbers for my 8's, all of which I could probably \\"train\\" myself for. What I couldn't stand and ultimately lead to my abandoning this game was the repetitiveness and the number of screens you need to just to get to the training. The attempted humor FAILS and I don't need to see the same \\"how to make this software more useful\\" screens over and over and over for a program intended for daily training, guess what, its working I remember them from yesterday and every day prior, shut up and let me get to the training already.Soduku was fun, unfortunately it didn't have many games and your score was horribly punished by the games inability to interpret your numbers.Something intended for daily training should not be so annoying just to get to the training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Age failure","review":"Overall it is a good game. However, when I speak into the unit to identify a color it sometimes marks the answer wrong when it was obviousely correct. Also, when writing answers on the screen occasionally it interpets the answer wrong. These incorrect interpetations counts against the final score which is suppose to indicate improvement in overall brain function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game.","review":"This \\"Game\\" is everything I expected it to be. I try to use it every day. It only takes a short time to do the training.

It's fun but educational as well and really challenges you to use your brain in ways you've forgotten to use them since you were in middle school (at least if you're an adult like me). Extremely challenging in the memory activities and the head counting. The only complaint that I have with this game is that it does not recognize some letters that you write on the screen. For example, it rarely recognizes the letter \\"K\\" and I'm not sure how many different ways there are to write the letter. So besides being frustrated with it not recognizing some letters, the game is awesome. I play it everyday and my husband and I are constantly trying to beat each other's brain ages! We also have Brain Age 2 and it does not have any of the writing/lettering issues that this game has. I highly recommend BOTH of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"The portion you speak, rather awkward in public, plus, \\"say red\\", this is rated incorrectly.

Why call it one name in Europe and another in the US and Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"needed more info before buying","review":"I read the caution on the package before opening.

Enter a 1 then 2 for 12 and it sees a 4!!! Say Yellow - the only 2 syllable color (from Red, Black, Blue) and it is incorrect! There is no way to input voice recognition change which is common on most software now. It doesn't even alow you to override your score when it gets it wrong.

I have purchased TWO of the Brain Age 1 games, hoping that the first one was just malfunctioning. Unfortunately, they both don't work! It doesn't matter how neatly I write the word or if I use lower or upper case! The game doesn't translate to the correct letter most of the time! And when I DO get the correct word recognized, the game often doesn't accept it! I AM SO FRUSTRATED by this!!! You would have thought that they would have tested this and gotten the bugs out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BRAIN FRUSTRATION!","review":"First of all, I do not have an accent or any kind of speech impediment. The only language I have ever spoke is English. BUT, the microphone interpreter on both Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2 are terrible!! It is MOST frustrating when the mic misinterprets your answers and counts them as incorrect!!! I thought that there might be an improvement on the 2nd Brain Age, but couldn't even get past the \\"rock, paper, scissors\\" without the same problem. I much prefer Flashfocus or Brain Boost! Maybe it's the mic on my DS Lite. Oh by the way, my two teenagers ALSO have a problem with the microphone (and my daughter uses her own DS Lite)! Weird!! I am at the point of getting rid of the games just to recoup some of the money that I put out for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I just purchased this game and was excited to use it. My husband used it first and he does have sloppy handwriting and had a lot of answers marked incorrect because he felt the game was unable to read his writing. I tried it and had the same problem. I have neat writing and have tried all different ways and speeds to write the answers, both the math and the word memorization. I am 37 and it ranked my brain age as 80. The system recognized all of my 0's as 5's and my k's as x's and even at times mistook s's for i's (How is that even possible?). The concept of the game is good but frustrating because you are getting the answers correct but being marked incorrect because of the game's malfunctions. If you can get passed being judged incorrectly by the game then it is good training for your brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really isn't a game...","review":"I've wanted to check this out for a long time. My wife mentioned recently that she had tried it at a friends and liked it, so I picked one up. My daughter has a DS and now it only sees games about half the time. We all use the Brain age, and the competition in the family keeps us all trying to get our ages down. Most of the exercises are simple but trying to increase the speed of the calculations is difficult. Some of the exercises are very hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointed","review":"I cannot get the voice recognition function to work and therefore I cannot play any of the verbal games, only written math or Sudoku, which I do not enjoy. I expected there to be more options and definitely more reading/verbal skills building, so I really do not use this much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally flawed","review":"After five minutes on the initial test having my speaking \\"blue\\" misrecognised constantly, and my written \\"4\\" interpreted as either a 9 or a 0, I looked through the manual for the instructions on how to train it to recognise YOUR speech and handwriting.It didn't have one. Because it doesn't have those features. Which renders the game next to useless. Am I prepared to alter the way I speak and write to play this, and keep that in mind constantly while I try to solve puzzles? No.The REALLY stupid thing is that it prints the number 4 (in questions etc) the way that character is usually printed on books, on your keyboard etc, i.e. with three contiguous strokes forming a figure with a pointy top, but it seems trained to recognise only an \\"open\\" four, i.e. one with no join at the top.Play \\"Big Brain Academy\\" instead - less famous but FAR more playable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain-cercise...","review":"Brain Age, the first of its kind offers a unique experience for gamers of all ages and it will also introduce gaming to non-gamers. It uses the DS's stylus for most game play functions along with voice recognition. This game is perfect for the casual gamer and for the little brainiac in all of us. It is packed with a host of simple math games, word games, and puzzle games that test your brain. Its definitely a worthy buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sudoku...","review":"was the main reason I got this but the other games are pretty stimulating. I like the Brain age kind of funny to see your \\"Brain Age\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom loved it!","review":"Bought this for my 8 year old grandson. He was mildly entertained by it and had to be encouraged to play it instead of other more exciting games. However, his 30-something mom loved it.

May have to get Mom her own DS for Christmas or something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Older than I thought!","review":"Game is fun to do and it's even better when you've made progress and reduced your \\"brain\\" age.

It does just that. It has several different kinds of games and I try to play it 5 - 10 minutes a day.It also has around 100 Suduko puzzles and the interface for playing them is quite excellent.The brain age checks are fun and varied (though some are hard). Some of the games offer a normal and hard mode (maybe the all do, but I have not unlocked them yet). Most of the hard modes are a just a step up, with the exception of triangle math.It's a fun game and it will make your brain feel a bit younger."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"This game is awesome. Everyday, my brain gets younger by playing it. The puzzles are great and i play it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and Fun","review":"Not only is this game fun, but it's educational too. It can really help improve your memory and other brain functioning skills. The game may not look, or sound, like much, but in this case, looks are deceiving. Brain Age is a lot of fun, and very addicting. And the kicker is that it's actually educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ACCURATE AT ALL!!!!!","review":"I'm a stay-at-home mom who spends all day speaking to 1 and 5 years olds, so I thought I'd get this game to refresh my mind and keep it active. First of all, the voice recognition is EXTREMELY POOR! I had BLACK written in BLACK saying BLACK 20 times before it registered, so my initial brain age was something like 83. It has MAJOR ISSUES reading my writing as well...tonight, for example, it read a 14 as a 41, it read a 4 as an 11, and a 10 as a 50! It's soooo annoying! Make sure you have a screen protector or else you can wear out the touchpad where the MORE button is...the professor guy says the same thing over and over and you have to touch MORE about 7 times after you finish each type of training. I maybe use the training once a week now when I'm bored and have been using this software mainly for the Sudoku. Save your money, it's really not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good and educational","review":"Fun and educational, as other reviewers wrote the \\"blue\\" on the speaking task doesn't work well, it's best to practice and see what works before you take a real \\"test\\". Regarding accuracy I'm not sure about the \\"brain age\\" but it's still a good daily exervise. Overall it's pretty good and I enjoy doing my daily tasks.- I wish there were more tasks though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem with number recognition!","review":"The goal is to measure your \\"brain age\\" by your response time and accuracy answering questions, many of which are numerical. I make my eights as a \\"stack of zeros\\", the way I was taught in drafting class. Brain Age does not recognize that as an eight, calling it, instead a zero or an error. I must either remember to make my eights the way Brain Age insists, slowing my response time, or live with Brain Age recording every answer with an eight in it as an error. Either way hurts my score. In short, the people who programmed Brain Age do not have the mental flexibility that they are trying to encourage in the users.Oh yeah, my wife loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FORGET FOCUS FACTOR, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.......Improves concentration, helps support healthy brain function","review":"I am so happy that Nintendo came up with a game that I can play without me worrying about wasting time. In this game, you will go through a Daily Training. This Daily Training does help stimulate your brain so you are more focus, alert, and clear in your judgment. Math problems and reading are just a few parts of the Training. I personally like the Math challenges because I truly believe it works your memory like no other. I used to have problems articulating what I have in mind. Lately, I've noticed I don't stutter as much and people now find logic at to what I have to say. You need to purchase this game if you are in for a tenacious cognition. Having Brain Age will help you in getting all the knowledge you have stored in your brain to use!

A little frightening!I wish the sudoku area had more games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"While I really enjoy Sudoku puzzles & brain games of all kinds, I found this program very frustrating. On the timed tests, it frequently misinterpreted letters or numbers and graded me down accordingly. If you do not make your numbers in the exact same way as the program (including the stylus strokes in the same order), prepare for your 4's to be interpreted as 9's etc. The scientist character makes annoying and occasionally judgmental comments regarding your progress (\\"feeling a little tired today?\\") and if you miss training for a few days, prepare to be scolded.I appreciate the premise that exercising one's brain has numerous benefits in the short and long-term, however the \\"cute\\" commentary and the difficulty with character recognition was annoying enough to merit only 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good brain practice","review":"It's a fun way to exercise your brain. It is mostly math, some tricky color recognition (which, on our Nintendo DS, doesn't seem to work 100%, it has a problem recognizing the word \\"blue\\"), reading, and syllable count and Sudokus. I think there is still more to it but we haven't delved into all its depth yet.Definitely a worthwhile game."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD GAME","review":"Daughter has a ball playing with this as do the adults that have been trying it out...every one is trying to be 20!

The guy on the game keeps up with when you last played and how long it has been since you trained your brain last. There are quite a few things that I didn't know about this game until I started playing it more and more. There are a few thing that I might change about the game, like the stupid looking floating head that instructs you on your training. But over all this is a pretty decent game and worth $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this game!","review":"I have been enjoying this game. Some things I would get rid of. Not allowing you to train yourself more than once a day. Drawing the pictures. I found myself very addicted to the Sudoko part of it.

I feel the product could use an upgrade in the character recognition area. The numbers 4 and 9 are often confused by the program (Sudoko). x and k are also problematic (memory improvement section of the game). The penmanship of the person using the game is not sloppy.

If your at all a fan of comic books you might find the story line similar to the comics you find in the dollar bin. Just not properly thought out with some large plot holes.

Design is superb for the purpose intended. Materials and workmanship are good. Required some additional sharpening, which is normal. Good blade, good handle. Sheath is well designed and very versatile. Velcro strapping used to secure knife in sheath is a little flimsy. They should have probably used a little heaver material there. This is an excellent product and I would buy the same knife again if I should lose this one. I would recommend it to anyone that thinks they might ever have the need for this type of knife. It isn't something that you would whittle with or use as a general purpose knife. But it is a great knife for what it was designed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust","review":"I had this knife only 3 months and its starting to rust. Not Good!

I had looked at a lot of research regarding female circumcision and was prepared to write paper loaded with righteous indignation over the practice. But, before I had even finished the introduction, my viewpoint was changing. This book made me look at the practice of female circumcision with a much less biased perspective. I was made to see what people within the cultures that practice it think about it. Do I still think that it is a terrible thing to do? Of course! But, I can see why it is done and I can see why simply trying to end the practice by force will be counterproductive. My thanks to the author for helping me learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick delivery, book in good cond","review":"Good, quick transaction. Book on good shape. Excellent purchase.

It is a vegetarian cookbook with discussion about balancing doshas, and includes Western recipes. It does not, however, give quite as much discussion about each recipe in that context as I would have liked. It is based on the Maharishi Mahesh's approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last! A book that blends taste and wisdom","review":"Congratulations to the author for being the first to put together a full course \\"banquet\\" of knowledge that brings the timeless, healing wisdom of Ayurveda food science to the public attention.

If you want to cook for your family in a way that optimally combines health and yumminess, let Hopodar's book be your guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic!","review":"Hospodar has produced a vegetarian cookbook that executes a rare triple play: incredibly delicious recipes, healthful, and very entertainingly written text. As well as giving us many unusual dishes, the author has a knack for taking popular dishes, and giving them a twist that makes them something very special. For example, I've enjoyed the middle Eastern spread Hummus for many years, but found myself in hummus hog heaven when I tried her recipe which uses cashews and coconut. This book also imparts such valuable cooking knowledge, I find myself making up my own recipes as well as using hers, armed with my new-found knowledge of spice combinations and cooking techniques. Finally, this book is one great read! Check out \\"The Ten Commandments Of Bean Cookery\\" and you'll see this is a book for the living room chair as well as the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most easy to follow recipes I've ever used","review":"Heaven's Banquet has a recipe format that I've never seen before, that makes the instructions very easy to follow. Every recipe I've tried has come out perfectly and is utterly scrumptious. I feel that this is the last cookbook I'll ever need to buy. It has everything I need to make healthy and delicious meals--two concepts that don't usually fit together! also, Miriam Hospodar has a wonderful sense of humor that makes reading and using the book a lot of fun, and makes the serious knowledge it contains go down easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Best vegetarian cookbook ever.","review":"At first perusal, I wasn't very impressed with this book. It seemed sort of lengthy and all the recipes seemed a little too simple, like why would you even need a recipe to make that?However, after trying some of the recipes I have become a huge fan of this book. Whether I'm looking for something Ayurvedic or just something to make quickly for dinner, I can find the absolute perfect thing in this book.The recipes may seem simple, but they are plentiful and amazing. I have tried many vegetarian cookbooks, but this one is way beyond what I could have hoped for in a singe resource. The author obviously did a huge amount of researching and testing to make the incredible variety that are available in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Banquet of Information","review":"I am relatively new to the Ayruvedic Lifestyle having read several books and consulted an Aryuvedic Physician. The book however is a wealth of information about Ayruveda and eating healthy. The author presents much general information in an informative and at times humorous style that is clear. The recipes are sometimes complex but once the reader assembles the ingredients, the rest is fully explained. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious in learning how to cook for balance and health."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Joy of Cooking\\" for the 21st century","review":"This is the book to cook from for delicious new flavors and dishes, and to learn from to discover the effects of foods and spicing on the body and mind. Every page is full of interesting, well researched information about food , how it changes as it is prepared, and how it effects the person who eats it. The cultural richness is delightful, and the ease with which the author moves from tradition to tradition while maintaining the angle of cooking for the various Ayurvedic body-mind types is awe-inspiring. For those looking for a wider range of culinary experience, this book is a treasure. And for those learning how to navigate the 21st century emphasis on healthful cooking, it is invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.....","review":"Fairly typical fare for this type of cooking.

BAD choice. I was expecting to have recipes which were dosha specific or modifications for recipes, but this book has none of that. This just seems like a cook book, with a brief explanation of ayurveda in the introduction. Many recipes use white flour, white sugar/brown sugar, and lots of various dairy products. With the little information I have received, I know this does not follow many ayurvedic practitioners' beliefs. Honestly, the recipes don't seem all that impressive. I am regretting my decision. The only reason for the 2 stars is because the seller shipped it promptly. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO SAILING!...","review":"If you only have time or space for one sailing magazine, this would be it! From the professional to the enthusiastic beginner, Sailing World is a must for the sailing afficianado. Where else can you find a balanced, well-written magazine that not only covers collegiate sailing, new products, America's Cup, international sailing, new boats, expert techniques, and intelligent editorials. I have found that other sailing publications try to be \\"too much\\" and they lose their focus in either large and countless advertisements to pay for their large format, or juxtapose a beginner's article against a highly technical article for experts, leaving the reader confused.

It gives a good feeling for the time period and for the dangers of travel around the the early 1900's. It's a good airplane book as well as a good history. Teddy Roosevelt shines as an explorer and as a charismatic personality. I enjoyed the way the author cleaned up the story quickly at the end but still gave all the follow-up information a reader would want. I recommend it because it holds your attention and gives you the desire to keep turning pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River of Doubt: expedition and metaphor","review":"The River of Doubt is about both a journey of geographic exploration, and the challenges that people set for themselves. This expedition is as much about the individuals who took part as it is about the exploration of the river.Reading the book gave me a taste of the Amazonian rainforest, the dangers of unknown exploration and a sense of the courage of most of the participants.Clearly, both Theodore Roosevelt and Colonel Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon were extraordinarily talented men.It left me with a sense of sadness that this triumphant achievement did not bring a greater sense of fulfillment to most of the survivors.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A GOOD READ!","review":"I literally had to force myself to finish this book which was one of my Book Club's selections. It was redundant and totally borning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing Book","review":"This is an engrossing book about an American icon, reading almost like a fictional novel, with interesting, but real, characters facing unknown obstacles, thrills and dangers. It details, with vivid writing, the conquering of the unexplored River of Doubt in Brazil by Theodore Roosevelt and his companions after he was out of politics in 1913. In his fifties, the former president didn't intend such an arduous and harrowing journey. It such grew, and once started, there was no turning back. The book is highly recommended.You won't be disappointed.The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challelnging Adventures","review":"My book club chose this book. I probably wouldn't have done so on my own but now I am glad that I read it. I learned more than I knew before about Theodore Roosevelt's life, character and family. I also learned about some of the local natives, animal and plant life around the territory of the Amazon River.

What an amazing adventure that he lived to tell about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River of Doubt","review":"I found this very interesting although I was always afraid while I was reading it. Of course I knew Theodore Roosevelt didn't die during this excursion, but I was always nervous. It was such a relief to get to the end although it really kept my interest. I also learned a lot about the jungle and know I don't want to go there. A very good look at Theodore Roosevelt's personality and drive to do dangerous things. I can't imagine someone going into the jungle like he did with so little preparation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling read -- from all angles","review":"A truly excellent account of President Roosevelt's intrepid, and final, journey to the far (and unknown) reaches of a remote foreign land. \\"The River of Doubt\\" is a book of tremendous scope, and yet the author manages to weave many disparate elements into a cohesive and captivating narrative. If you're looking for a detailed description of science -- from the tiniest creatures and fungi to the massive scale and evolution of the planet's continents -- you can find it here. You can also find a remarkably personal story; the pasts of every significant expedition member are integrated into relevant events in the book's chronology.Ultimately, my only (minor) gripe is that the final chapters speed by at an accelerated pace, and consequently, the Epilogue is granted a more important role, as many loose ends are not tied up in the context of the narrative itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"well wrtten thriller","review":"I really liked this book. It is a harrowing journey, unbelievable in it's chaotic (and not well done) preparation. It reads quickly especially when they begin descending the river. It's hard to believe they survived at all. I learned so much about the flora and fauna of the Amazon as well as the people experiencing this expedition This is definitely a thriller and very well written. It also has an excellent index."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I picked up this book after reading a review about it a recent Time Magazine article.

Although the book, in my opinion, didn't really take off until about halfway into it, it still had a lot of interesting facts about life in the Amazon, so you had the sense that you were reading not only a non-fiction book but a National Geographic article (author Millard is one of their editors). This was my third or fourth book about Roosevelt, but it was a little bit different.

This is not one of those books. The lush descriptions of the deadly flora and fauna of the rainforest made me perfectly happy to enjoy it all from a distance. But the same descriptions make Roosevelt and his fellow explorers very real, and gave me a good appreciation for the dangers they faced and the risks they took."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE READ!!!!","review":"What an incredible book, this is one from the moment I started reading I could not put down.

This is one of those stories that plays itself out on the \\"big screen\\" of your mind. The vivid descriptions that fill the book work to bring the story to life.The milky water flows beneath you. The roar of a consuming water fall speaks danger. A spindly shaft that guarantees death. The overpowering and completely unexpected silence of the living jungle consumes all with fear. All of these may be experienced in the scope of the few hours it takes to read this tale. For this alone, read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK.","review":"Could have fit the real story into about 100 pages. Instead the author gives you detailed information on what Roosevelt and his crew may have encountered in the Amazon. From fish to moss. May have seen this stuff or may not have. Good story, hard to stretch into a book IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Soggy Experience","review":"On the one hand, I found certain aspects of this book interesting, mainly because I was woefully ignorant of TR's history, but I actually found out little about him, but much about his co-explorer, Rondon. The author's credentials as a writer of National Geographic articles and such is impressive but she knows little about non-fiction writing. She puts words in her character's mouths and attributes thoughts to them that I'm sure they never knew they had. As I understand it, this is a no-no in non-fiction writing and destroys the faith of the reader. None of her characters are believable. Her research was obviously extensive, but she will go off at annoying tangents, such as when she fancies herself a geologist for pages and pages, telling the reader about the earth's origins at exhaustive length. I am reading this for a book group, but I felt my progress was plodding and the book was only intermittently acceptable. Too many glaring faults for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and lacked good story telling","review":"I'm shocked that this book would receive such critical acclaim. It is a surprisingly dry and dull telling of what should be an exciting and compelling story. Additionally, to call this book biographical is a stretch since the author contends only with the surface character of Teddy Roosevelt as limited to the natural and all-too-common responses to their challenges. One learns nothing of the man that wasn't already known in much greater degree elsewhere. Finally, the author continually leaves the real story to press an obvoius ideological commitment to Darwinism. It reads like a philosophical apologetic. It was, at times, as if I was reading National Geographic. Very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real enough","review":"I was disappointed in River of Doubt, anticipating a gripping tale about both Teddy Roosevelt and what was then the unexplored Amazon River region. Roosevelt never really emerges as a person. Even more annoying, the description of the flora and fauna of the Amazon is anthropomorphic, failing to comprehend or acknowledge the most rudimentary and accepted concepts of species development and evolution. The author repeatedly tells us that nature adapted itself and developed strategies to accomplish specific tasks, which is a backwards view to say the least. Plants and animals have no more capability to alter their physical structure than we humans do.

She brought the persona of Roosevelt to life and I must say I enjoyed seeing him through the lens of this journey as an explorer and naturalist. The Amazon and the river the men travel are just as much characters in this story as the diverse crew.

Expertly written by Candice Miller, she lets the fascinating real life story tell itself. For anyone remotely interested in geography, Latin America or adventure, this is a MUST read. The Amazon Rain Forest was like the moon in the early 1900s, and Teddy Roosevelt sets out to descend an uncharted river which almost proves to be his undoing. An emotional, crosscultural story of human nature, and human endurance, this book is tremendous. I devoured it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Compelling","review":"I couldn't put down Candice Millard's engaging account of Theodore Roosevelt's journey through a hostile and unexplored region of the Amazon along the treacherous River of Doubt. It is an amazing tail that conveys the horror, adventure and triumph Roosevelt and his fellow explorers must have experienced.The account is made even more interesting because of the information Millard weaves through her narrative about the river and Amazon, both of which are central characters in this story. Her experience as a writer for the National Geographic is a real plus.I recommend this book to readers curious about Pres.

I thought I knew everything worth knowing about the man and a micro-history like this didn't seem likely to add much. I was wrong! His ordeal in the Amazon basin was amazing and Ms. Millard tells the story in a very engaging way. While most readers will know how it turns out for TR, there are a whole cast of characters that you begin to care about and their lives during and after the trip are nearly of equal interest. The book is well paced and the story is framed in an easy to follow yet dramatic way. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar work from Ms Millard!","review":"Absolutely facinating.

I was unaware of this almost superhuman feat accomplished by Teddy Roosevelt and his comrades; and, I am left amazed that this expidition to map the River of Doubt actually occurred. There is a passage in the book that asserts that the likes of him (Roosevelt) will never come again. After reading this book, its hard not to agree!

While reading both Morris books on TR this seemed to be a great add on to my study of the former President. This is a really good book. The author, a former writer for National Geographic does a good job of keeping this book on the entertaining side.The story is really amazing, to the point where you might ask yourself - what was TR thinking going on such a trip - was he tired of life and ready to be done with it? One small critique of the work is the fact that the author maybe spends a bit to much time talking about the ecology of the Amazon where it almost feels like filler. But, the context is needed, but maybe not so much.This is a good book. Pick it up for a road trip and sit back for a wild adventure.JVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"TR's Darkest Journey was very enlightening actually....","review":"This book is well researched with the details unfolding in nice order.

(PS I'm not a fast reader) You couldn't make up an adventure fiction novel as good as \\"The River of Doubt\\" which is true! Its a must read for adventure seekers. If you are planning a trip through the Amazon, (even though we're a hundred years past TR's expedition), I promote this as required reading. Very enjoyable and educational. It was historically wonderful. Thank you Candice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History comes alives in a riveting adventure","review":"I loved this book. This book was great in so many ways. It is a great portrait of Teddy Roosevelt in his quest to explore an uncharted tributary of the Amazon after his presidency. It is a fascinating look at life in the unexplored rain forest - featuring the people, plants, animals and general ecology. It's a riveting life-or-death adventure. The author does a great job moving between the people in the present drama, their backgrounds, and the \\"life of the forest.\\" It's a beautifully written page-turner. It leaves one with a profound sense of the place, people and time. I can't recommend this book more highly. Years ago, I read Undaunted Courage, the story of Lewis and Clark's expedition.

However, it's difficult to imagine who the targeted reader might be. A beginner cannot possibly use it. There is no word to word translation and no explanations of unusual syntax or grammar. An advanced student on the other hand, would be disturbed by the persistent transcription of every single character. For an advanced student this is just a waste of space. The translations to English contain far too much slang to be useful for a non native English speaker. I'm not interested in all the strange ways you can express the origiginal Japanese in English. I'm just interested in what it actually means, and unfortunately this book more than once fails to convey that."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 9 yr olds LOVE this watch","review":"This watch is full of \\"extra features\\" and boys love that.

Figures, it's made in China.It's an okay thermometer. I needed a thermometer for shallow deep frying (about 1 inch of oil) and this seemed to be a good middle of the road choice.

It's not going to have interviews with Dave Mason or Bekka Bramlett, or the Vito / Burnett years because that came AFTER the autobio, Folks.If you're looking to see Stevie hit the high notes on \\"Stand Back\\" or seeing Lindsey finger pick a guitar like no other, this is NOT the dvd for you -- buy a performance recording instead.

Even the best licks and lyrics are thin.....ok so they got Stevie singing silver spoon at the right moment (duh!), but there were so many opportunities for really great segments from the old films and tracks......the band is always about the music and there simply wasn't enough of it to make this a great DVD. Is is worth it for the serious fan? Of course it is, which is why I can recommend it, but if you are looking for insight into the band I would suggest starting with the Dance DVD first.....it's somewhat biographical and definitely not the same as the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?

This colander does that for me.This is the first durable colander I've seen that has incorporated the rapid drain ability of a sieve (the other way around, a self-standing, largish-capacity sieve, is an old idea). While I agree that this is the best small-capacity colander ever, there is room for improvement.PROS:-- Self standing-- Sufficiently large to handle one pound of dry pasta, cooked-- Sturdy but light: heavy-gauge stainless steel construction throughout, including handles-- Fast draining-- Easy to clean and dishwasher-safeCONS-- For both safety and comfort, I want bigger loop handles-- It may be \\"simply elegant,\\" but it also seems expensive for a basic utensil of this capacity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it - it's the best I've used","review":"Cooks Illustrated was right when they chose this colander as their favorite - the small holes keep the food in while letting the liquid out. It's a great size, and a must have in the kitchen. I've gotten rid of my other colanders - I only need this one. Beware, though, it arrived in an unpadded light cardboard 'envelope' and was dented.

We've had one of these for over 10 years, use it practically daily in generally careless (i.e., non-coddling) fashion, and it shows absolutely no signs of wear. It's not dented and the handles aren't loose in the slightest. There's nothing flimsy about this at all from our experience. It has vastly outlived our wire mesh colanders, and in practice it can serve for draining all but the tiniest foodstuffs. We don't try to drain quinoa in this, as one other commenter pointed out, but it'll do for every kind of pasta, including things like orzo. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quinoa-friendly","review":"Despite the description, the holes are just large enough to let some grains of uncooked quinoa fall through.

I LOVE this colander! The best part about it is that it doesn't shred my pasta when I drain it. The holes are too small for spaghetti to try to escape.

I routinely handle my data files in fortran rather than go all the way writing 'C' code. Reading/writing arrays with a single statement, good math functions, universal availability etc make fortran a very good scientific tool. (more like an advanced calculator). I will rather write a small fortran program than calculate something in my head. Some scientific packages use fortran as their base language, so a knowledge of fortran is not going to be wasted. And so math/science books use fortran, so you will definitely benefit if you can understand the language. You could probably translate one of those into C/C++ and make some easy money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Two more beautiful male voices you'll never hear. Ramey's strength is his astonishing technical expertise and Hampson's is his musicality and expressiveness. They both sound like they're having a ball singing together. My kids (ages 7 and 4) love this CD. I would have liked a greater variety of selections (half are Verdi duets), but this is one of the best of the many opera CDs I own. Ramey is one of the best basses in the world and one of the few who sounds absolutely clear and not muddy when he sings. My favorite of his recordings is \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\" with Kiri Te Kanawa, directed by Solti. (I saw him in Simon Boccanegra, by the way, and he has magnificent stage presence.) This was the first time I'd heard Hampson, but this CD made me want to order more of his recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the low voices get the acclaim they deserve!!!","review":"Bass & Baritone voices have played second fiddle to Tenors for too long. \\"No Tenors Allowed\\" places Ramey and Hampson on the cover, where they belong.

It's fun, funny and beautiful. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I HATE it...when it ends.","review":"I received the CD 24 hours ago and I've already played it three times. I can't tell you how much I love it. Ramey is at his very best and Hampson is simply wonderful. I never could understand the obsession with Tenors; these are REAL voices singing some absolutely wonderful duets. I just wish there were more. A second CD is certainly one to be wished for. The worst thing about this CD is that it ends. You want it to go on forever and ever. My favorite (if that is possible, I love all the cuts) is Donizetti's Marino Faliero. I've never heard it before, but this duet is simply magnificent.Don't miss this fantastic combination of voices and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"Picture shows a USB A extension cable while the actual product is a USB A male to M Mini USB.On a positive note the shipping was fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"Ok, if you are looking for a flashlight to use as a duty light for traffic stops and building searches then this is probably not what you are looking for.

It should have been easy to install except one of the screws I needed to loosen on my truck was completely rusted tight. It quickly became a real challenge to get it installed.After installation I didn't care for the look. Because of my hood design the bug shield only covers the middle portion of my hood giving my white truck the appearance of a narrow black mustache. That aside I took my 2600 mile trip. I noticed fewer bug splatters on my windshield but I still got rock chips on my hood, which is the main reason I bought this.I would not recommend buying a bug shield to anyone who is attempting to stop rock chips on their hood.UPDATE: Went through a carwash and had the bug shield torn off.

Beyond that, however, the performances by Ivan Davis really breathe life into the selections, all twelve of them, not that they needed a lot of CPR in the first place. There is sparkle and brilliance where it ought to be, as well as a number of sly winks when called for. In other words, Davis gets the mood just right every time. Being musically untrained, I can't comment on his technical expertise, but to my layman's ears it all sounds perfect. There are other collections out there that are more comprehensive, but I've not yet encountered any others so far that strike me as energetic and engaging as this one-disc release. If you want to keep a small but powerful dose of Gottschalk on the shelf, this is the bottle that it comes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as \\"Good\\" as I Had Thought...","review":"I bought this product in \\"good condition\\" and when I got it, I instantly noticed that the collector's box it came in was old and frayed.

My GSD loves his too.I've not given any dog a rawhide chew for many, many years. Some may report no problems but a Lab chewed off the end of a rawhide chew; I lost him due to that darn thing.

Our Frenchie weighs 22 pounds, the bulldog weighs 42 lbs. and the 2 Boxers are about 65 each, and the wolf size is great for all of them, even though they are strong chewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great & long lasting!","review":"This works fantastic for my husky to chew on! It's a great alternative to raw hide and doesn't show as much wear as quickly as a raw hide does. He isn't able to break it apart and just gnaws it down slowly over time. Whenever he is walking around looking for something to chew on we give him this or his nylabone dinosaur (another great chew, but didn't last as long as this one). I'd say we finally threw this out after about 2-3 months of chewing. (We decided to throw it out when it was short enough that it looked like he could probably swallow it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Our three Dobermans and Bulldog love this.

My vet recommended the Nylabone as it was supposed to be good for her teeth, so I got one, but it ended up chipping off about half of one of her little front teeth. In addition, once some chewing has occurred, the bone gets a lot of hard, sharp jagged edges that can cut both the dog's gums and my hands.It is definitely durable and my dog loved to chew on it, but I'd rather spend more money and have her go through a bunch of softer chew toys than to find more broken teeth. Also worth noting is that a different reviewer also mentioned a broken tooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE- Cracked Teeth!!!","review":"My Greater Swiss Mountain dog cracked two molars on nylabones. Both had to be surgically removed at a cost of about $1,000. I did not realize that the nylabone was the culprit with the first tooth, but witnessed and heard the crack the second time.

Do not buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only chew bone durable enough for a sled dog.","review":"I have an old Alaskan husky, and he eats even the large Zoe and Greenie chews within a couple of minutes. This is the first commercial chew bone that he actually chews on (as opposed to tearing it apart and swallowing). It's not terrifically attractive, in fact he ignored it completely for a couple of days, but now he chews on it regularly, and it's definitely reducing tartar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like rocks","review":"I bought two bones for my small dogs(yorkie and bichon). I believe they enjoyed them at first, but later in the day they had stopped playing with them and at dinner time I noticed they were not eating as much as they normally would. I have to guess that these toys might be to hard for my small dogs. A few days later my brother brought over his beagle and she loved them. The chicken flavor is noticeable when you take them out of the package. I would recommend these bones for medium to large breed dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last!","review":"First of all this thing is a lot smaller than \\"giant\\" as the title suggests. Second, it is not durable. Within minutes of giving it to my dog, he chewed pieces off it. I was afraid that he was going to swallow the nylon pieces and took it away immediately. It might be a good little toy for a small dog, but definitely not for a big dog. The title is very deceiving, just like the \\"large everlasting chicken treat\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both dogs completely uninterested","review":"I bought this bone for my 2 dogs- a greyhound who is an aggressive chewer, and a border collie who's more interested in taste (he likes to just lick rawhide.) I had hoped this would prove a longer lasting alternative to rawhide for the greyhound, and if not, I thought at least the other dog would like it. Well I bought this weeks ago and so far I can't convince either dog to be interested.

Even though both are labeled \\"Dura Chew\\" The dogs have not yet taken off sizeable pieces of this bone, but they can leave pretty clear tooth markings. This chew needs closer monitoring than the other nylabones we have bought.*************UPDATE: It is a little more than a year since I first put up this review and I just bought a liver flavored Nylabone that is also made from this white colored material. I'm uploading a customer photo to show the difference. If you have a dog that is an agressive chewer, you may want to stay away from the white nylabone material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but I was expecting the Wolf size to be bigger","review":"The product is very good. It is the type of bone I was planning to get for my dogs. They don't seem to chew on it much. I am not sure why, they both love to chew and have chewed on the previous nylabone dura chews. I love the fact that this product lasts so long and it is hard for them to destroy.When I ordered the product I couldn't find what size the Wolf bone was - dimensions ect. I just assumed that wolves are fairly large animals so this bone must the the same size as the long one I purchased last year. I was wrong. Wolf is the medium size as far as I can tell. There is nothing wrong with the product. I just wish that the size would have been a little more clear when I ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dog chew","review":"Have had this bone for about a month now. My dog loves to chew on everything. She worked this bone over good the first few days. Now she uses it about 10 mins a day.

However, I will say it is durable and the few times he has chewed it, there has been little wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what I was looking for","review":"Needed a replacement nylabone and this was exactly the size I was thinking it was. My dog (a smooth collie) is not a real heavy chewer but even at ~50lbs the wolf seems to be the size that fits her mouth well. Haven't got one in the store for a while but it seemed to be a good deal. Gives her something to do when bored besides chew holes in pillows and blankets :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your dog will either love it or hate it","review":"I've never had a dog that has been interested in one of these bones. I've had a siberian husky and a mutt in the past and neither one would chomp on one of these nylabones. I have tried the different flavors and textures, but neither one was interested. Years have past and we recently got a new siberian husky since we missed our old one. While he was teething I bought this for him hoping it may work, it didn't. I tried everything to cajole into liking this bone; however, nothing would make him like this thing. My mom told me that her golden retreiver enjoys these, so perhaps it's just a breed thing. It's worth a shot to see if your dog would like this, but be warned that I have had no success."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Flavor","review":"I got this because I thought my dog would like it better since it claimed to be bacon flavored. He really liked the original one, so I thought might as well try it. But there was not the slightest scent of bacon. My dog chewed it once or twice, and is not interested in it anymore. Not very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog will not touch it","review":"My 1 year-old Golden Retriever shows no interest in this bone.

Well, it wasn't, and I found that kind of disappointing because I have a teething American Pitbull Terrier Pup who would have probaby liked the textured part. So, what I basically got was a normal Nylabone. Oh well. This is still great for the Dogs and their chewing needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE PRODUCT","review":"I would not recommend this product for anyone who cares about their pet. Apparently the manufacturer of this product does not take measures to insure their product is safe. I ordered the correct size of bone for my Labrador Retriever according to the manufacturers size chart. Brand new out of the package no more than 10 minutes, while my dog was chewing on the bone, a large piece about the size of a marble broke off and my dog swallowed it. I examined the bone and discovered there were numerous air bubbles in the casting making the bone weak and susceptible to breaking. I can only hope that the consumed part of this product will pass without any complications. I will not buy this product again and will be going to normal beef bones in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for overzealous chewers.","review":"I initially started my dog off on these as the gummy version was too easy for her to tear apart. A few months later during my vet visit, she noticed my dog had two slab fractures on her molars. Granted, my dog would tear into these, but now she has ruined her teeth and may require a root canal. I now use kongs with treats that I replace once they start to look worn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dental risk","review":"I just spent $1,400 on dental work for my two dogs, both of whom broke multiple teeth on these bones. The Bones do prevent tartar build-up but at an unacceptable cost. I believe this product should carry safety warnings because the vet told us that this is a common problem with the hard bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogs loved it... but made them sick! What's the point???","review":"When it says don't leave dogs unattended with this bone they mean it. It also says don't allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that... they mean that too. My 18 month old Pit was loving this bone and I tried to take every piece that she chewed off away from her as it came off. A few pieces must have got past me and in her tummy and on the floor, because she started having violent vomiting a day latter, then our 8 year old pit started doing the same. We were for sure that we had got some Chinese chicken strips or something then we started going through the vomit (sick what we do for our kids) and found Nylabone chunks in both dogs vomit. Haven't had a issue since. My husband has banned any product from this company from entering our house again.Buyer beware and watch your dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've never found a better chew toy.I have a nine-month-old lab with a strong chew drive, and he loves his Nylabone. It took him about five months to get through a medium-sized puppy one, so I went ahead and bought a larger one made with harder plastic (the \\"Dura Chew\\" kind). He's had it for about a month now and loves it, but has only chewed about an inch down. I prefer it over sterilized bones because it's safer for his teeth and the little bristles that get raised by chewing certainly can't hurt in terms of tartar control.The only downside is that those little bristles catch on fabric, so watch out if your dog likes to present you with toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOG CHEWS.","review":"THE NYLABONE IS AN EXCELLENT DOG CHEW. MY DOGS SPEND MANY HOURS CHEWING THEIRS. MINE PREFER THE BACON FLAVOR. THE NYLABONE IS QUITE DURABLE AND LASTS A VERY LONG TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"Very disappointed in this product. It's basically just a piece of plastic. Our dog tried to chew on it once, but had no interest in it after that. He didn't even seem to notice or care about the bacon flavor. Granted, he is a greyhound and they can be pretty picky, but he is more of a chewer than most other greyhounds. Overall, very dissatisfied - will never purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nylabone","review":"I thought it would be great, but my dog doesn't even touch it. Sits in his basket of toys negelcted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Chew","review":"My 18-month old Lab loves this Nylabone. It's the perfect size for him. It has lasted a few months and he normally spends time chewing it each night. He is a strong chewer, but not the strongest I've seen. I recently ordered another since he gnawed his first one to about half the original size. I wouldn't allow him to chew this much past the half way point as it could become a choking hazard. I gave this 4 stars since it is not really a healthy material to ingest. Small pieces are not supposed to hurt the dogs, but there is no nutritional value.A natural alternative to this would be Deer Antlers. They are more expensive, but will last quite a while. Our dog loves those as well, but the Nylabones provide a nice variety so he doesn't get too bored with any one chew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nylabone","review":"Item was as described and arrived on time.

Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest cd in country music history!","review":"This cd is GREAT! I especially love the song \\"Kiss me now\\". It is so sweet!

If you buy one cd, it has to be this one. It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I think Lila's new record is incredibe!

At least Lila has her own songs! Go Lila, you Rock!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the wisest purchase I have ever made!","review":"Everyone should have this CD! I listen to it all the time, and have yet to get tired of it. Every single song is catchy and has a tune that truly sticks in your head, in addition to making you want to get up and dance. There is not a bad song on the disc, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an album!","review":"Lila's voice has come such a long way since her first album. It has transformed from a somewhat monotonous voice to one that is so pure and filled with emotion. Her singing has gotten so beautiful that each song is filled with spark and a life. And she is enunciating so much better on this album than on her first. She sings the lyrics with clarity and with proper amount of emotion. The album is really well put together. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it didn't have enough ballads. The ballads really are the best songs. Just compare these ballads to those on her first album, and you can see how her voice has gotten so pure. This is the best follow up album I have heard because the growth in Lila's voice is so evident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This new CD is so far above her last album, \\"Lila\\". Her voice has come such a long way. The melodies and energy in \\"Something in the Air\\" are almost guranteed to be a hit with everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great person, a great voice, a great album!","review":"Hey, like most of you, I think that Lila is also sooo underrated, it's not fair because she is really good. She has an outstanding voice not like most other country singers. I personally know because I have a karaoke system in my house and I pop in CD's every once in a while to sing to when I'm bored. Now, I think I have fairly an average voice and man, I can't pull off the songs as good as Lila can on this CD, while I think I'm better than Shania Twain when I sing her songs, because I guess they don't require that much vocal talent and does not have a lot of difficulty. Man, I got to give it up for Lila for doing so great on all the songs. So yeah, this is a great album with a great variety of songs, from the upbeat dances and ballads, to the inbetweens--it just has it all. Want to find some more underrated artists? Check out Hoku and Jennifer Love Hewitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lila McCann Rules","review":"Lila has the best voice in the world. I would rate her better than any other country singer.

It is short, and not only does it only include the 2 cities, but the coverage of those is very brief. The narration is all right but just didn't inspire me as much as others such as Rick Steves accomplish. At the end of the video my reaction was \\"that's it?\\". Very unsatisfying. And where is Beijing? How can a trip to China called \\"China to the MAX\\" not include the place of the Forbidden City, among other reasons. And if you want the Great Wall, forget about it. Yes, I know the \\"max\\" is a play on words - but you really realize how lame it is after you watch this video and realize what a minimal tour of China you just got. I'm not a huge fan of Samantha Brown, a little too \\"perky\\" and stereotypical American for my tastes, however, her China episodes left me feeling a lot more satisfied than this video.

I loved the book and was hoping the characters created so vividly by Mary McGarry Morris would translate well to the screen. Alas, this was not to be. The original character of Martha Horgan, was an annoying, disturbed woman with a myopic view of truth. The character was totally unsympathetic as it embodied all the qualities we do not want to see in ourselves. Debra Winger's Martha is a childlike retarded woman. She plays this so drippy sweet, I'm surprised her blood sugar did not soar beyond human tolerance during the filming. The only annoyance I feel is that the film missed the whole point of the book, tries to slap the \\"Made in USA-Upbeat Ending\\" at the end of the travesty and wasted my time.Save yourself the trouble and read the book.

We still went out after he changed his clothes. I later hooked a fish and the rod was pulled backwards as I was trolling in the Kayak. The plastic mount broke, but my rod managed to stay in the left over slot. I am replacing what I used and broke for my friend.

Loosen up a little bit - no one is out to get you! And the author & illustrator of this book certainly are not implying that mothers are incapable - quite the opposite. Ever hear of sarcasm? Humor?

Nothing out of the ordinary with some absurd plotting (a politician faced with death threats walking casually through the Place Vendome just so he can get killed, a ludicrous jailbreak from a prison with only rotten wood over the shower windows), the last reel is fairly good when the politics briefly kicks in and the movie refuses to go for the soft and easy ending, but it's outstayed its welcome by then.A decent extras package includes a featurette with Testi and Sollima plus trailer and stills gallery, although the 1.85:1 transfer is grainy in places."},{"rating":"2","title":"One very good reason to own this DVD","review":"This DVD has Boris Karloff's out of print last film; The Snake People. I'm not going to comment on the Snake People because I haven't watched it yet, but on Rattlers, I thought it was going to be another low-budget, audio-poor snore-fest. Instead I was entertained. Yes, the bathtub scene is in the film. Yes, the acting is laughable, but in a good way. And yes, there are some parts of the film that drags, but not for very long. There are also movie trailers on this DVD to films that as far as I know, no longer exist. That scores big points with me.

Gary North does a superb interpretation and exegesis of Leviticus 19:19 and the nature of Old Covenant laws.This is a book that covers a wide variety of issues relating to theonomy. Even if you are not a critic of theonomy and are just seeking to know more, this book also serves as a good introduction to the movement.Wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"very simple","review":"Zionism, Communism, Reconstructionism (Theonomy)...all millennial heresy, and all inspired by the Kingdom of Satan.

However as I am now working my way through the game for a third time I find that the guide isn't always correct about the exact placement of the various Scrollstands or Spirit/Focus fonts. By no means is this guide the best one ever put out by Prima however the information on techniques, essence gems, and strategies for defeating opponents is well worth the price.Pros: Overhead maps, enemy strategies,essence gem list, all side quests detailed.Cons: Somewhat confusing layout, misses a few key item locations"},{"rating":"2","title":"before to listen to this CD I didnt' think it was so good","review":"I've got the CD (Back dor good).

Angela Lansbury makes a really awful Marple and the addition of various \\"big name\\" stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson ruin the mood even further since the director is apparently forced to linger and linger on meaningless scenes that give the \\"stars\\" extra screen time.The sets look like somebody decided to save money by putting in the minimum effort to make them look like they came from 1953. You could barely tell the difference between the interiors from this film and what you would expect to see on Magnum P.I.Although this is probably one of the less exciting Miss Marple stories the terrible production values, awful casting, and absurd cliches ruin whatever chances this had of being watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Agatha Christie fan.","review":"The original murder mystery by Agatha Christie was a very clever whodunnit. This film really loses all of the flavor of Christie's work, and turns the characters and plot into a campy cartoon of caricatures -- even Miss Marple isn't as sharp as she should have been. A lot of scenes are wasted and filled with pointless dialogue that really detracts from the story. I don't believe anyone watching this film could figure out the murderer from the 'clues' given. The director really missed the boat on this one. A far superior version of this appeared on British television."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the book instead","review":"for Agatha Christie fans only.

The reader is treated to sixty-three wonderfully told and entertaining short stories that have the full flavor of a yarn that evokes memories and nostalgia in equal proportions. These are original stories that provide little \\"windows in time\\" revealing the romance, spirit, adventure, insights, and occasional frustrations of growing up on a farm. A true delight, Farm Kid is the perfect book for a browsy afternoon and will prove a popular addition to any family or community library collection. Also very highly recommended are Justin Isherwood's previous short story collections: The Book Of Plough; Christmas Stories & The Story Chair; and The Farm West Of Mars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good B-Movie Mystery","review":"Whether or not you prefer The Shadow of radio or the pulps, this is not the invisible crimefighter or the black-clad crime-buster. Rod La Rocque plays a more mild-mannered, Clark Kent-style of alter ego to The Shadow. The Shadow (in disguise) only makes two brief appearances in the first film, THE SHADOW STRIKES (1937).INTERNATIONAL CRIME (1938) is better than the first. Rod reprises his role as Lamont Cranston, only this time he is both a radio announcer and a one-man detective agency. Astrid Allwyn plays the ditzy Phoebe Lane. There is also appearances from Commissioner Weston (portrayed as an old grouch) and cabbi, Moe Shrevnitz.I recommend this double feature (which is brilliantly restored, by the way) DVD to any lovers of mysteries, old films, B-Movies, or those of you will take a chance on seeing The Shadow's first two movie appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"These are okay detective movies, but it's really not The Shadow.Lamont Cranston has been turned into Lamont Granston and he's an ordinary joe who's a crime reporter. That's as exciting as it gets. There's nothing in these movies that has anything to do with The Shadow so you've been warned.You might want to save your money since these two \\"Shadow\\" movies aren't what they claim to be.

I hate to bounce and I am usually a 34c and refuse to be \\"that girl\\" jogging down the street getting black eyes from her chest flopping all over, yeah you know what I mean. Plus gravity will do enough damage I don't need to help it out. This bra keeps everything in place and secure. The straps have velcro but it is not irritating and hold tight plus I like the adjustable back. It gives full coverage and is deceptively attractive. The straps don't dig in. It does use a bit of compression to hold the girls in place but it is not uncomfortable in any way. In fact it slims your side so if you are a golfer or just like have a bigger range in movement this works great. It also lasts forever and unlike bras that use spandex, this bra does not loose shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest sports bra ever!","review":"I am a 36 DD, and have a very hard time finding sports bras that actually work. No pull over the head ones for me. I am a horseback rider and 5 day a week runner, and play tennis and soccer, so I need a bra that will hold everything in place, no bouncing down the street. I had found this bra years ago in the mall and loved it, I bought 5. They lasted years with heavy wear. I had trouble finding them again however, as the stores in the mall no longer carried them. I tried a few other bras in the meantime, but none of them could compare to this one. Even my old worn out champion bras were better than any new ones I tried. I was so happy to find them online, and at half the price! For big busted women who want as little movement as possible, this is the only bra for you! I will never buy another type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra!","review":"I'm a 34DD equestrian and runner training for my first half marathon. I highly recommend this bra.It is better than the extreme Shock Absorber that I had before. It holds up better in washing and has virtually no bounce when running or horseback riding. The only bad thing I can say is that the overlay snap in the back comes undone all the time but that could be because I went a size smaller than I normally wear. My favorite thing about this bra, besides the great support, is that the band is snug but it still has enough stretch to not cause heartburn or pain across your sternum, or difficulty breathing. These are problems I had with the Shock Absorber.Anyway, I've have trouble finding a bra with no bounce, and I will be sticking with this one from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've ever owned...","review":"This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sized small","review":"I wish bra manufacturers would get together on what constitutes a certain size. I wear 42 DD in many bra brands, but in others it's too small. This one is WAY too small. Maybe bras that have little stretch should be have more gradations in size. Even if this bra fit, I don't think I'd like it. I don't like the way the two layers are only attatched at the edges; I think that would be uncomfortable and the extra snap seems superfluous. I've never had two or three bra hooks just suddenly give way, and I've never heard of it happening to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient for full-figure/high-impact","review":"As a 34DD, I have struggled for a long time to find a sports bra adequate for high-impact activity. This is okay, but there is so much bounce, the velcro straps dig into your shoulders, especially if you wear for a longer period of time, and after several runs and washes, the support is just not great.

It provides ample space for them to move around and play. The ledges and ramps provided really allow the animals to utilize all of the space. Of course, I don't have all the ledges in place now because my gliders would rather climb around the outer bars of the cage and jump from place to place. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the back part of the cage had thin metal tabs which connected the two sections. These tabs broke before I could get the cage stable.

Cave could have given the Nazis at Dachau lessons. I'm sorry I finished it but I kept thinking there would be some resolution, some repudiation of the torture.There never was.I've hated Nick Cave ever since. The projects he chooses show he has not changed. A few years ago he was attracted to the \\"Cat Piano\\" animation, a cat piano being a musical instrument that gets its sound from the torture of cats.I don't know if this \\"revised edition\\" is any different.

I think 10-20% of this book could've been disposed of, particularly in the third quarter of the book where Cave becomes overly descriptive & self-indulgent. Does he really need to waste a page describing the swamp or his collection of playing cards? Sure he paints a picture but the book gets too bogged down that it disrupts the flow & pacing of the book & actually detracts from the plot. That is my one & only complaint but for me it's not a deal-breaker as there is plenty I enjoyed from this twisted genius.This is not an easy book to recommend as it certainly won't appeal to most people but if you're after something different or if you're a little intrigued give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Dark, Lyrical","review":"Nick Cave is the love-child of James Joyce and Flannery O'Conner.

Definitly not recommended for the faint-at-heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice!","review":"I knew Cave could write lyrics, but this book proves he's also able to write a whole book. What I liked best of it is that the main character lives in his own world. You don't really know how the other characters experience him and the village where they live, but I'm sure it's very differently of how he sees himself and his surroundings. An interistingly written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a dark and amazing vision","review":"If you are a fan of Nick Cave's music, there would be no reason why you shouldn't read this book. It's intense, gruesome, disturbing, but yet beautiful in the way he uses language and keeps you interested in the story. It's a great view of a southern hell: full of fundamentalists and inbred hillbilly's. My only critiscm is that it does tend to ramble a bit at the end, but with such great prose it didn't bother me too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"To those of you who didn't understand it...","review":"...read it again. This book is complicated. One of the hardest I've ever read. Most of it is written in sort of a southern accent mixed with gothic poetry. I don't think I've ever read anything like it. Parts are so disgusting you almost have to \\"look away.\\"I was basically blown away by this book. The way he describes the scenery and the things that go through the main character, Euchrid's mind is amazing. Admittedly, I am a huge fan of The Bad Seeds. But I am also a fan of thousands of other music groups and I don't think you necessarily have to be a fan of Nick Cave's music to appreciate this book. However, I stress this again: it is very graphic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Nick, Keep making records.","review":"The greatest Vogon poetry ever committed to wood pulp. Cave takes great pains to fit that gargantuan head up his pontificating anus. Hence, the ass saw the angel, and vice versa.To be fair, I did not finish the book. In fact, I've read only the prologue. But that small taste was enough to inform me that this was definitely not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time.","review":"This is one of the worst, if not the worst book I have ever read. Just because it is set in the South and chock-a-block with disgusting characters and even more disgusting imagery does not make it Faulkner. Not even close. Truly a despicable piece of junk.

But for Vonnegut's association, I could have easily neglected this significant treatise combining musical, philosophical, spiritual, etc., commentaries reflecting much of what is fundamentally important to our human collective. As such, the broadcast projects fabulous power, so I looked into the DVD. Featuring 155 minutes, I thought, \\"Great! The DVD is twice as long as the teevee version.\\" So, I order the DVD but am distressed to learn that we can't simply run the entire program with one simple press of the play button but must instead manually start each chapter!! Annoying!!! That significantly detracts from an otherwise noteworthy sequence. So much for continuity. For that reason, the producers have earned 1 Giant Leap two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Giant loss","review":"If you have seen Baraka, then pass this one up.It is a cheap, over produced, myopic, new-age attempt at racial relations.If this is what you're looking for, then buy it.If I could return a dvd based strictly upon content, I would have done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another one, much better, exists","review":"you all probably didn't see swedish 'lucky people center international'go find it and you will forget about this leap'lucky people..' is a real masterpiece of 'koyaanisqatsi' level, much much more clever, nice and driving"},{"rating":"2","title":"got Spirit?","review":"This film is what I would call a spiritual adventure.

As someone who has also translated their poetry, I can say from experience that this is no ordinary task.

This disc evokes many emotions from me. It literally feels 'warm' to me. Not that this music is sappy or lounge-like. Not at all. This stuff swings. It simmers. It bubbles over. There is an infectious quality to \\"Remember\\", \\"This I Dig of You\\", and \\"Dig Dis\\" especially. \\"Split Feelin's\\" really chugs along with enthusiasm and light spirit. The title track is great and \\"If I Should Lose You\\" displays a tender quality to Mobley's horn playing that reminds me somewhat of Dexter Gordon in his more introspective moments. This is one of the best hard-bop era recordings. Period. It's not called a classic for no reason...ESSENTIAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid but get Roll Call also","review":"This quartet release is strong but fairly straight ahead. Roll Call is a quintet released also in 1960 and has Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and is a hotter smoking album. I have the Japanese import 24 bit Gelder remaster of Roll Call and the original 16 bit version of Soul Station. Mobley burned himself out after playing for 15 years from 1955-1970 and was one of the many casualties.

Marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't get much better than this","review":"i seldom play this cd, yet whenever i do i'm reminded again of how very good this recording is. bluesy, some bop, straight up jazz tenor sax at its best. while i'm listening to hank mobley here i want to keep listening to his playing. a big clear tenor sound in no hurry, free of theory, or testing the limits of the sax, or breaking new ground, or looking for a new sound. jazz at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome tenor sax jazz.","review":"I have been collecting Bebop, Hard-Bop, and West-Coast jazz from the 50's and 60's for a while now. This was one of my recent buys. I'm very happy with it. Its very smooth, and very accessible. Its important to note that Art Blakey from the Jazz Messengers plays the drums on this and Paul Chambers plays the bass-both legends in this period of jazz.I like this album just a little bit more than \\"No Room for Squares\\", but that is another good album by Hank you would like if you like this album.

Even when they're in place over my eyes, looking down I can tell they'll fall off if I shake my head. The stems don't really wrap behind the ears at all. Also, these glasses won't fit into any old hard sunglasses case; they just take up too much volume. If a soft sleeve is all you need, that should be no problem.That said, I do like them. They certainly don't make for any pressure points on my temples, and that's a danger for me with any pair of glasses.

I play in church and tend to get a little loud with larger diamater sticks. these are the thinest sticks I have been able to find that will stand up to most of what I throw at them.I have tried other thin sticks, but they don't last one night. Of course you can't go crazy with them or you will break off the tip, but they last a long time for such a thin stick. When I practice I turn the stick backwards and play with the fat end so I won't break them, and to give a little more weight to make the wrist a little stronger. They give you fantastic speed, and the nylon tip will add a little volume to your playing so you really don't have to strike the cymbal as hard as with a wood tip stick.

Some of her technique is a little different than what I was taught by my Kendo Sensei in college, (he was a champion from Japan) but this is a workout video and not an instructional video. I got lots of giggles from Ilaria's accent (mainly the word \\"diagonal\\") and I liked how she explained the sword movements pre-workout. If you are tired of traditional workout videos and want something to change up the routine, I recommend this video. I also recommend buying a bokka from Amazon.

I've gotten more than my share of use out of it already! I like it because I feel like it's easy enough for a complete beginner like me, but I didn't feel like I was being \\"babied\\" or anything. The workouts - especially the \\"relaxing\\" one - are effective, and I always feel happy and actually stress-free when I'm done with them.

If you don't have much background in yoga and need to have all the various postures explained in some detail, this is the DVD for you. Even if you do have some experience with yoga, they will take you back to the basics where you might need a little correction here and there. Also, on the disc Rodney Yee and his partner take you through the steps of two yoga workouts that will lead you in the end to a wonderful feeling of relaxation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similiar to Am and PM Yoga","review":"First of all I have to say of all the Yoga dvd's I have I like Rodney Yee's the best. I own his Am and PM Yoga and found this dvd to be similar except Rodney only does the morning workout and Colleen Saidman doe the evening workout, compared to Rodney instructing in his earlier released am and pm yoga. The new dvd give you a description on how to align your body and do the movements which I find difficult to visually watch and do at the same time on other dvd's.

Out of the first 50, four failed during verification. I'm burning at only 4x and I get absolutely no coasters when burning other brands (Sony or Verbatim). I'm very dissatisfied and I can only assume that the company has changed their manufacturing process. The media ID is TY03.Not only did I get coasters, but when the discs did work, I would find some random bad spots where pixelation in my project would appear. When I used Verbatim discs and exactly the same processing, the problems did not show up. I'm using Sony Vegas Pro 11 and DVD Architect.

I originally bought them because of the positive reviews for lack of issues while burning and playing. They do play in all dvd players but like I said I have wasted at least 10 and I have about 25 blanks ones left so you do the math on how many more will most likely be bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Discs on the Market","review":"I've purchased these several times (from the vendor Media Supply)and I've yet to have a problem with a single disc burned.

I've tried many brands and all of them skips very badly, except this one. I've tried varying burning speeds and verifying the DVDs after burning. The dvds play well on computers and dvd players at home, but skips every 30 seconds in the van. I thought there is something wrong with the dvd player in the van and almost change the player.that is until I read online that I should use the best quality dvds so i bought Taiyo Yuden.I am super happy about this batch of DVDs. Not a single coaster. Every single one works in the van even burning at 8x.I always thought DVD-R is such a commodity that everything should just work, I did not know there is a major quality difference if you want to burn movies in a volatile environmental like a mini-van. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Disc","review":"I brought this product by accident, but boy what a great accident this was.

The one called Roman Holiday had many scratches on the playing side which meant very rough handling by a previous owner. I thought I had paid for an unused DVD. This particular DVD plays well up to 95 % of its length; then it gets stuck and will not play even after multiple forward prods. The other 2 DVDs of the set are free of scratches but I have not played them yet.But wait, there's a surprise. A couple of days ago I saw the weatherman Al Roker on the NBC AM show and he said if we rub a banana over a scratched DVD and then rub it off, the DVD should play. That's what I did and it worked!!!! Since I don't know if this is a permanent fix I think I should get a free replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh Oh","review":"Two of the three were fine, but the third was scratched beyond belief and wouldn't play at all.

Vladimir Ashkenazy leads the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Anthony Burton has written the music notes. On this recording we get to hear three composers, i.e., Rachmaninov, Shostakovich and Witold Lutoslawski. Sound quality is perfect and the performance of Peter Jablonski is astounding.

The episodes themselves and the clue games are also particularly nice ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite film","review":"Bollywood went through a significant change in style around the year 2000 when this film came out, especially in the sytle of music. This film is sort of evidence of that change, having elements of both the old and new styles. In my opinion, the music wasn't the most memorable, though I do love what they did with the title theme interwoven throughout the story. The true virtue of this film is gripping story (and the young Preity of course). This film is certainly a pro-life film (perhaps the best that has been done to date in any country), but also gives an interesting look at the community dynamic when such an important question of morality arises (i.e. how to treat a young girl who gets pregnant out of wedlock.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"My major issue with this movie is that Saif Ali Khan is not a nice guy in this movie, which made me sad. He's a great actor, and the movie, was okay. My major problem is that the summary was misleading; you never want Saif and the girl to get together since he is such a creep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Freud","review":"For an easy to read basic overview of psychoanalytic thought, I highly recommend Michael Kahn's Basic Freud. Basic Freud describes many theories about the unconscious, psychosexual development, the Oedipus complex, the repetition compulsion, anxiety, defense mechanisms, guilt, dreams, grief, and transference. Mr. Kahn uses simple diction so the book is very easy to understand for those of us who aren't psychoanalysts. Mr. Kahn uses case studies from his own practice to help illustrate the aforementioned theories and how they play out in real life.By delving into the unconscious Freud discovered so many possibilities for why we are the way we are and why we act in certain ways. This book is so enlightening to read and eye opening to the ideas of Sigmund Freud and his theories on the unconscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nothing negative about this book","review":"Sure it's big, but it serves to purposes, and serves them both very well. I've only had to use it one time, and that was because we were made to do our mid-term paper in MLA 09' BY HAND. I've not had to write a paper by hand in over 20 years.

Like most things that try to be two things at once it fails. It is neither a good dictionary, being too limited in scope, and not the the best thesaurus for the same reason. Many of the words I have looked up do not appear at all, and they were not that esoteric. So I find myself going back to my old American College Dictionary and International Thesaurus repeatedly. I can understand why it is recommended by teachers of young children and people who are not proficient in English, but for a bright high school or college student it is way too limited. I do not recommend it and am looking for something well beyond the basic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacements for my 2003 Honda Element","review":"I bought these to replace the OEM plugs in my 2003 Honda Element, at 102,000 miles. I had used these in my Honda VTX 1800C motorcycle as well and I've always had good results. Like oil and tires, plugs can generate plenty of controversy. I can only say that they work very well for me, as well as OEM when it comes to performance and MPG. In the VTX1800C, they foul much less often than the original Denso plugs, but this would NOT be an issue in an otherwise healthy Element. I'd recommend them without reservation for the Element or the VTX."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, good performance.","review":"These start good, run good, and after being in for a while don't seem to be performing any different.

The pace was wrong. 2. The story was not complete in itself. 3. Main character was not identifiable. 4. Editor could not get interested in the characters. 5. Nothing happened in the story. 6. Character did not have a serious enough problem. 7. The story was just too grim. 8. The story was offensive, or the editor thought it was offensive.Nine out of ten stories that are rejected fall into one or another of these eight categories.\\"This book remains a standard on my bookshelf as a reference to help me write clearly, concisely, and confidently. Newer editions of The Writer's Handbook should be studied as well, but this version is written for those who wrote for the children of the 1980s, who are now upper-middle aged readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered the book (it was recommended through another book, The Irresistible Revolution), but I really enjoyed it. A lot of people have a misconception that Jesus didn't pray, as he is the begotten son of God, but it was incredible to see how intricate the story of His prayers are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent special effects in DUMB Godzilla ghost movie","review":"Forget radioactive monsters. Forget every movie up to this point. Now we have all the angry war dead spirits from WW2 going into Godzilla and he looking like a fat blind aligator (with a beer belly) attacking Tokyo! Oh no! Now Baragon, Mothera and Ghidra are spirits awoken by a weird old man and different groups of uncarring idiots (who get theirs) and the battle begins to stop the possessed Godzilla. Special effects are the best I've seen in these recent movies- REALLY GOOD- but the story...... What ever happened to monster island and radioactive beasties wasn't that hard enough to swallow??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse then the American godzilla movie","review":"Wow was this movie bad. For one the effects ranged from not bad with a few of the long shots to terrible with others. Secondly the same lame audio track kept playing through the film. Godzilla himself didn't look right which is why they didn't use this suit again, he looks more like a snake (his face I mean) and I really hated those eyes with no pupils.Really the movie just felt cheap, like a bad made for TV movie on the Sci Fi Channel. The millennium series is great with one huge exception, this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This Godzilla movie epitomizes everything that can go wrong in this genre. Godzilla is not supposed to be magical and involved with enemies who look like Barney rejects. The effects in this movie suck, and the monsters look horrible. There is way too much focus on stupid human sub-plots (as usual) and bad pacing. The score is also horrible and only features the famous themes at the very last shot & credits. The original Gojira was scary, serious, and held a lot of symbolisms. This movie is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not cool","review":"they should not make godzilla a bad guy he has to be a good guy espeacily when he is fighting agenst king gidorah and for once let mothra team up with godzilla i mean come on godzilla is the protector of japan not the destroyer this is an out rage. please make godzilla a good guy for ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural Godzilla?","review":"At first I was leery about a supernatural take on Godzilla, but then I realize--since when has Godzilla been about the plot? Not since Godzilla 1954 has a plot been relevant in a Godzilla movie, which is why this movie shines where it counts: the monster fights!GMK has some of the best daikaiju fights in the Godzilla Millennium series. It is nowhere near as good as the Gamera Heisei trilogy (Gamera:GotU, Gamera: Advent of Legion, and Gamera: Revenge of Irys) but it has Godzilla returning to his truly antagonistic roots and the return of Baragon.I only recommend this if you are a fan of Godzilla movies. If you aren't then it is only worth a rent or foryour kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"Great Godzilla. good twist on the legend. Very serious take on the monster. Good performances. Much destruction. some dark humor. Lots of people getting smushed and burned up. Godzilla is not cute in this one. He's evil. The other monsters try to stop his rampage...but he's supernatural in this one. Creepy. Maybe, a bit strange seeing King Ghidorah as a beautiful, glorious force for good. Buy it. Watch it. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre offering","review":"This film re-imagined our favorite monsters in a way that I found most irritating. New-agey hoo-haa was substituted for substance. Not only did the monsters have to carry on the guilt of Japanese actions in the Pacific during WW2, they also had to carry the anger of the victims of the war. The portrayal of Godzilla as evil made this more of a Mothra-as-hero movie than a Godzilla movie. My 10 year old daughter kept asking me why Godzilla didn't have eyes (they are white throughout this film) and I told her that maybe they were going for a ZombieGodzilla look. Honestly, why does Toho have to mess with a perfectly good formula??? What happened to Coke when they tried reinventing the taste that has stood them in good stead for almost 100 years?I found Final Wars to be vastly superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah - Giant Monsters All-Out Attack","review":"This was the best Godzilla movie I've seen in years. The monsters look beautiful, the story is decent, the movie is fast paced, the action isn't all based on the monsters, and the score accompanies the movie well. Some of the acting is pretty bad but all of the main actors do a great job. Taizo Tachibana is a pretty good, strong character and Yuri is vulnerable enough for the audience to feel her struggle, physically, mentally, and emotionally. The monster battles are fun and entertaining and Godzilla is brought back to his slow, unstoppable force from the first film. I watched the movie with subtitles so I can't comment on the quality of the english dub. The mythologies of monsters are changed but that isn't anything that hasn't been done in countless films before. A must see for any Godzilla fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baragon returns","review":"I really did not care for this movie. Well I enjoyed the return of Baragon, special effects and Godzilla. I didn't really like King Ghidorah as a \\"good Guy\\". Also, besides Baragon I'm tired of viewing the same old monsters. I heard they were going to use Baragon, Rodan and Varan but were concerned that these creatures were not as marketable as Mothra and Ghidorah. I would have liked it they used the original script with Varan, Baragon and Rodan. For me This is worth watching only once or twice. Give it a spin to at least see Baragon and Godzilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy.","review":"Hey, I'm not complaining. This is the best piece of rubber-suit mayhem to cross over the pond in at least ten years. Hey, it's not as socially relevant as \\"Gojira\\" or as downright fun as \\"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\\", but it's better than \\"Godzilla 2000\\" and certainly better than that piece of expensive computer-generated garbage that (sane) men call \\"Fraudzilla\\". And maybe they didn't keep Varan and Angilas, but at least they dropped Ourga and Matthew Broderick. Lets hope this is the Sean Connery of Godzilla films, here to rip the franchise out of the Lazenbine hands of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER!","review":"I own the Region 2 and Region 3 versions of this movie and have watched each dvd at least 10 times. It has everything you want from a Godzilla movie, lots of destruction, excellent monster battles, the best special effects, the coolest and darkest music, and most of all, Godzilla returns to his roots as a force of destruction. This is also the first movie where I actually cared for what was going to happen with the human characters. Back to Godzilla, his suit is definitely the best I have ever seen, and matches his power.I give the movie a 5/5.As for the DVD, well, you get the English Dubbed version, along with the original Japanese language. Unfortunately the subtitles are actually dubtitles, so they follow the dialog from the dub rather than the Japanese translations, so there are a lot of lines that are messed up.Still, if you cannot get the R2 or R3 dvd, this is definitely a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Great Fun","review":"Watch as Godzilla kills EVERYONE!

The human drama is pretty well done also.This would get 5 stars if the monster action were longer than it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was easily the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen.

And that's about the only good thing I can say. There is no Chinese on the disk I received. It's horrible in English. I'm thinking it might rate 2 stars if I could see the subtitles. The English Dub is like fingers on a blackboard to me. The plot is terrible. The characters are so over the top, I can't suspend my disbelief enough.

The camera goes down little back streets and in front of familiar landmarks, inside grand palazzi and modest apartments, all without ever giving the appearance of a staged set. For Venice lovers, it is a wonderful thing to figure out where the characters are at any time. You find yourself stopping the disc to look at the street markers, or repeating the opening credits over and over so you can see your favorite hotel. Don't know how this series would fare for those who are just attuned to the procedural plot points, and don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this series","review":"Not even close to the Donna Leon's great books.

H. Lawrence considered himself \\"a passionately religious man\\" and Charles Burack's study focuses on the emotive rhetoric of his novels that aims at \\"the religious initiation of the reader.\\" Burack examines ways in which Lawrence's expressive style transforms the reader's consciousness and stimulates ontological awareness, demonstrating how the writer sets out to educate or initiate the reader by subverting conventional responses and engaging vital potentialities. This book reveals the intimate transactions between Lawrence's language, with its characteristic rhythms and image patterns, and an implied or attuned reader's sensibility. It is a valuable contribution to our understanding of Lawrence's creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"half the package","review":"If you have Verbatim Digital Vinyl CD-Rs you've probably run into a problem: how do you label them? There isn't much room to write on them and conventional labels would ruin the nostalgic look -- even if you could get them to stick.You'll need these labels -- they're the right size to fit on the core without covering the vinyl look-alike surface. Unfortunately, you'll also need software, or at least a template, to print the labels, and this package doesn't have any software. I tried Verbatim's website, but no software there, either.

The white label is nearly see-thru...

THe ending left me a few questions... \\" WHAT? ITS ENDING LIKE THAT? BUT WHAT ABOUT.... \\" If there was supposed to be a point in this book, either I missed it, or there isnt any except for the fact that Laurence YEp read an article and was so touched by it, he decided to make an horrible, FAKE story out of an INCREDIBLE story about an Asian individual ( Im Asian and I know how hard it is to find stories with Asians as the hero/heroine ) As for the excrutiatingly painfully LONG details, I would bet all my money that Laurence Yep only wrote them to make up for the bad storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the WORST books I have ever read!","review":"This book is basically about a young boy who moves from China to America with his father.

However, I did not appreciate the fact that North Americans were stereotyped as \\"demons\\".

Don't read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good storyline But too many details","review":"This book's storyline appeared interesting when I looked at the back of the book and I was eager to read it for the class assignment. Since I am Asian, I know how hard it is to find Asians as the hero/heroine. As I was reading it, many racial comments in the book disturbed me. For example, the words \\" Ching-Chong Chinaman \\" came up a few times in the book, provoking my classmates to start staring at me and grin. Of course, I was too busy trying to understand the details, to tell them what they deserved at the time. Details are what make a story a story, but too many details just confuse the reader. Laurence Yep probably wrote this book, imagining what it would be like to be read by a non-asian reader. Even the 1000 times that the word \\"demon\\" popped up, seemed to bother me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZ, oh, what are we talking about?","review":"Dragonwings is an okay, so-so story about a boy (Moonshadow) and his dad (windrider) who want to build the newfangled invention an aeroplane. The story is confusing, and when they don't understand an english word, it's spelled out in a way where you have to pronounce it to find out what it means. Moonshadow is an innagrant from China and faces problems dealing with his race.

The characters are delusional. I mean, if a guy thinks that once upon a time, he was a dragon, he is most likely mentally impaired. This book should sooner be chosen for torture purposes in gulags or concentration camps than in a 7th grade english class. If you are interested in purchasing this book, I suggest that you refrain from reading it, and use it as a fire-starter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I thought this book was disapointing.

I read the beginning, middle, and end. I believe many of those chapters could have been ripped out, and the book would be the same, but less boring. I was made to read it at school. The detail went COMPLETELY over the top. It took yep three pages to describe the climbing up a hill as a \\"family\\".

I was required to read this book for my 7th grade literature class and must state that I was not at all impressed. The book lacked any kind of plot and the boys father was quite obviously insane. It is characters like those in this book that make me feel ashamed to be the same species as them. If this book had a climax, I couldn't find it. It is basically just the story of some chinese people who come to america and the boys father believes that he was formerly a dragon. After a number of absolutely pointless things happen to them.

Laurance Yep is also telling that people are all same. Dragonwings also tells you about the power of nature when the earthquake comes.

This book is interesting because is relating many activities that Chines people do in the USA. In the same way it contains many themes that make it interesting for the reader. This book is cultural for me, because is teaching or showing the costumes of the Chinese people and their traditions.

Unfortunately I lost that knife a couple of years later, but have no doubt that if I still had it today, it would be just as solid and perform as well as new. This knife is a similar construction with the Stainless Steel body and lock back design and it performs flawlessly. I can really appreciate the options to carry tip up/down on the left and right hand side as well as the overall fit and finish of this knife as well as the Spydercos that I've seen and collected in the years past.

Also included is a short definition of the word apocrypha, which Kimball insists orginally meant \\"one too sacred and secret to be in everyone's hands.\\" However, its etymoligical derivative, which is rendered into apocrypha by joining apo-(away)+kryptein(to hide)=Greek apocryphos, does not suggest Kimball's definition. The stories found here are very interesting, and are full of tales not only of the young Messiah's life and deeds, but of the lives of Mary and Joseph, and the rest of Jesus' family as well. While these hidden stories may seem a bit jejune to the sceptic, they will still nevertheless be a fascinating collection of extra-biblical stories for the individual seeking knowledge on the early life of Christ; and they will also be a fair study companion for the search of the historical Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"Easy reading with a lot of new material presented but not for anyone who would pursue the subject further.

The ignorance come from the many misunderstood poorly researched and misinterpreted ancient texts. The Arrogance comes from thinking they know it all. I started to think as I read they were truly trying to inform us about a little known subject, but in the end I knew it was for money, that exact same thing that Jesus condemned at the Temple over the money exchangers disrespecting G-d. This book if written by Divinity Historians can be good, but not this one for obvious reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice fantasy but plainly delusional.","review":"Although I found this book interesting I was continually affronted by the authors gullibility. He weaves an interesting fantasy and so I can imagine many people wanting to believe that the ideas he comes up with are truth.

He hawks so-called \\"hidden\\" works allegedly \\"suppressed\\" by church authorities over the centuries, but his claims are false. Everything he claims is \\"suppressed knowledge\\" is actually part of the vast canon of known Apocypha, or psueudo-Biblical writings long known to be forgeries. These things were regularly sold to credulous believers during the middle ages and even earlier, just as con artists sold fake sacred nails and finger bones allegedly from saints and even Jesus himself.People have been falling for this con for centuries, and they'll continue to do so.

The key difference is that the Raco uses carriage bolts to secure the box to the brace, so you can get them REALLY TIGHT like they should be when you are suspending anything overhead, while the 22200 just used regular bolts with lockwashers - which spin when they are tightened very much. Fortunately I was able to get into the attic to re-tighten the bolts from above - but that may not always be possible & the alternative will be to start over - or trash it & go get the good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean scent, but not long lasting","review":"Like most Davidoff scents I have tried this one seems to be fleeting.

Very clean, appropriately masculine and quite refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be an informed buyer, not just a cheapskate.","review":"First of all, know that these speaker stands are not wood. They are an engineered wood product, which in this case results in a \\"wood\\" that will almost certainly split even if great care is used when assembling. I've used MDF wood in the past which has been supurb. These are not. I never used the stands because they were so flimsy and unstable. I ordered a pair of Sanus metal stands (Sanus SF30B Black Pair 30\\" Speaker Stands) instead and now have stable stands I can depend on and which are attractive enough to be proud of. The small difference in price is well worth spending if you want a product that will last forever and bring joy every day when you see them under your speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy / poor construction materials","review":"The stands are packaged well and look good, but they are not designed to hold a speaker of any significant weight. I have a pair of these stands with Klipsch RB-81 II speakers (bookshelf speakers with an 8\\" driver). The stands are definitely not stable with these speakers on them. If you or a pet bump into these stands with a large style bookshelf speaker, the stands will topple easily and your speaker will be on the floor. Also the partical board used for the wood is very soft and the screws can strip easy. If your speakers are small and the stands are in a location where they will not get tocuhed/bumped, then they may be ok for you. Otherwise, look to a stand more sturdy (amazon sells plenty that are more sturdy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value stands","review":"These are well worth the money.

The match between the screws holding the top and bottom sections to the uprights were very hard to locate.i have done a fair amount of assemblies (IKEA, etc.) but these were by far the most difficult. In addition, 2 of the 4 upright pieces split both on top and bottom after being assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked when screws installed","review":"Started the screws into the pillars and cracks started forming. Once the screws were completely seated, the cracks ran completely through the pillar. Looked at the second stand and found a crack ready to split even before installing a screw. Returned these immediately and will not take another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not wood, title is misleading","review":"These stands look really good, but I will have to either have amazon replace them or sanus send me new pillars since one pillar split during very careful assembly. Having read another review that talked about the pillars splitting I was especially careful to not over tighten the screws and one still split. The little feet are wonderful, the design looks amazing in my family room, but these are disposable speaker stands since the materials are not really good for their purpose. I would recommend spending a little more to get real wood or metal materials rather than these.Also, amazon shoud fix the product listing so it doesn't say wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","review":"These speaker stands are pure junk. When assembling, the pillars split where the screws are screwed in. I called Sanus and they sent my replacement pillars. The replacements split at the screw holes in the same way when assembling.

They should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap garbage.","review":"Save up some money and buy something better, either metal or real wood.

Immediately the upright on one of them split in half and dumped my speaker on the floor. When i examined the stand to my surprise I saw the reason. These are pressed paper bogus wood and never should be used in the manner of construction that they are used for. Again these are not wood and are not good. I called Amazon to the supervisory level and they would do nothing and then they called me back from the U.S. and refunded me completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere!!","review":"I order two sets of these stands for my front and rear bookshelf speakers in my home theater. I read the reviews here and all sounded good. I even contacted the speaker manufacturer, HSU Research, who told me these were the very stands they use in their demo room. The price was right so I ordered up. When they arrived I removed them from the box and began to assemble them. By the time I got the fourth screw in I called it quits. All the screw holes were pre-drilled and I went very slowly as not to over tighten. EVERY joint split from the assembly screws. Not just one which could be a fluke. Every piece split. These stands are something my wife and I would call \\"first apartment\\" quality. If your broke and don't care, they'll do. Probably won't last long as they are starting off split. If you want a quality stand, go with something else. We ended up with the VTI DF series metal stands."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job","review":"Received this and assembled in 5 minutes.

You get what you pay for, Right? I had to run out & buy some of that rubber material that is used to stop rugs from slipping. I cut out (2) 5\\" squares, so my speakers don't slide around on the stand. Also, these stands don't really hide the spkr. wire. I don't have a router to make the holes larger; you see, I use Monster wire & it is TOO thick for the wire to go through the hole. So I live with looking at the wire, no big deal. Just one more thing; (To me was Much More Important!)the company these spkr. stands came from,(the name evades me right now) The box was a \\"RE-PACK\\", it looked like it had been beat up & the tell tale packing tape holding the box together, But I didn't feel like going through the trouble of writing & shipping for an RA... At the time I received them, my Father was Dying & my mind wasn't really on the stands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality!","review":"First of all, I liked the design. However, I was a little disappointed about the quality. When I screwed the bottom part to the middle pole WITH MILD STRENGTH, it cracked about an inch from the bottom all the way to the top of the screw. This is a extremely rigid product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, look good, work well, great value","review":"I have 16x7.5x9\\" speakers on these and they could easily take larger ones. Get the stands at least 24\\" high. Use the sticky rubber corner triangles it comes with on the platform you rest the speakers on, for good sound isolation. I have used these stands on carpet in my last place and now hardwood floors, and in both cases they significantly improved the sound versus putting them on the floor, table, or shelves. The cable doesn't fit through the tiny hole but it's not a problem, you just thread it through the gap above the back panel. The wire has a tendency to be visible through the gap at the front sometimes, but again not a problem you just pull on it a bit at the back until it recedes back into the shadows.Basically they look good and work well, the price is fantastic, and the minor niggles people complain about are easily solvable in minutes, so I have no problem giving these five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stands for cheap price","review":"Stands are not wood but paticle board with a flat paint finish.

Big.","review":"Measure! These are bigger than you might think. They are definitely on the cheap side (though not priced cheap) so be careful when screwing them together. Go slowly and ensure the screws are straight to avoid cracking. Not much else to say. They stand, the speaker rests on them fine, and they're staying. If you can find something that looks a little better for the same price, try the other instead.

Seriously. I mean i could be doing something wrong but all 16 ??? some more, some less but all were cracked. I assembled cheap entertainment center from wal-mart evening before and everything fit and had no problem.2. if your floor is anything other than carpet, like tile, laminate or hardwood the floor spikes are not for you. so you can't pull the wire through the hole down and underneath the stand and the idea that wire would be inside the stand and invisible doesn't work.3. The rubber triangles that suppose to stick to the corners of the top surface were gone in half hour.very weak adhesion. also same as #2, their size doesn't allow to pull the wires through the hole and under the speaker.I am really bewildered how such garbage can be sold.

This is the worst product I have ever bought from Amazon.Another was that it arrived in the original packaging, without any protection. This packaging came wet and damaged. Don't bother ording it, a cardboard cutout would have held up better. Didn't even get to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap build quality","review":"The wood was cracking and splitting as I tried to assemble these. Seem to be very cheap quality and the assembly is shotty. I learned from my mistakes on the first one, and was very very careful in assembling the second one, which went a little better. All-in-all, not a sturdy speaker stand at all. I have 2 Sony bookshelf speakers sitting on them, and I will be careful to never bump them or move them around too much! Do yourself a favor and go with the Vantage Point speaker stands instead. The quality and sturdiness is not even comparable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speaker stands for the price.","review":"Of course they are not real wood, but for the price they look great. To all who say the wood cracks, take it easy! Went together perfectly. To all who say the screw heads stick out, you put it together wrong! Read the instructions. Screw holes are scooped out for nice level surface. I did spray on an extra coat of black paint and use double back tape to secure my awesome Bose speakers.

However, after visitng the website, looking at the pics and reviews for both, decided to go with the lower-cost option and am absolutely content with that choice. Stands look great, are easy to assemble, structurally secure and sound great with my P162s. I really don't know if a true audiophile could tell the difference between BF and NF, so it mainly comes down to the look and finish. In my mind paying twice as much for slightly better looking (yet, functinally same) stands wasn't worth it - but you decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"Quite a nice set for the price. Quality seems good and packaging is top notch with each item being securely wrapped in foam. Only issue I have is that the bottom base is a little large. Hardly an issue for a large room, but it could take away from your decor slightly, especially with a small room. Would buy again though, and they look good too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but. . .","review":"I received my order sooner than expected. My low rating is based on the contruction. Each of the standing supports split when the screw was inserted. I do not like returning items and consider myself a do-it-your-selfer. I was able to repair each of the ends and strengthen the support with glue and clamps. Quality control missed on this item. I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"They look great, are easy to put together. The pre-drilled holes were not drilled deep enough and the posts cracked. I noticed one of them had lines running from one hole to the other and it split the post when i put the screws in. I am not some guy who does this stuff once in a while, I do this kind of stuff on a daily basis. I would send them back but it was less hassle to glue them. I would not recomend this product. If you do buy them PLEASE re-drill the holes before putting screws in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wood Splits Every Time Even With Pre-Drilling !!","review":"The first one I assembled split badly at every position when I screwed in the screws. And I have a lot of carpentry experience. I screwed the screws slowly and with considerable care using only a screwdriver. And then the vertical pieces split, one of them badly. I will upload a photo later. So, I drilled out the second stand with 1/8 inch drill bit thinking that would take care of things. Wrong! It still split all but one screw location, only not nearly as bad. I am going to write to the company and see if they will send me some new posts. I didn't like drilling to the next size holes because the screws don't always tighten. But they tightened a lot better than the split ones! To say the least, I am not happy with the materials -- especially for this price. This should not happen. For just a few pieces of wood, they sure charge a lot of money -- especially when the wood splits so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Stands","review":"The stands are exactly what i expected them to be.

When I assembled the product I immediately found that the pre-drilled holes were too small for the screws, which meant almost every screw I used split the base of the wood. It looks unattractive, but it's not really noticeable.I ended up throwing away the plastic rear covers because I quickly realized that it would be near impossible to run my speaker cables through it with the plastic piece in the grooves.

Using the slits as a guide, just use the included Sharpie marker to make accurate lines on the ball. This is pretty much impossible to do freehand due to the curvature of the ball.It comes in different colors, but I chose the clear plastic so I could line up the template with the label on the side of the ball. That's recommended for a roll that's more true.I see many golfers using a line on their golf balls for putting. This is recommended for better alignment by many golf instructors.

She encourages you to depart from her methods and by explaining the whys and wherefores of knitted fabrics, makes this possible.For those who have read Elizabeth Zimmerman and disliked her chattiness and her approach to patterns in the past, you will not likely enjoy this book either. For the majority of knitters, though, this book is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful patterns","review":"As usual, Elizabeth Zimmerman presents knitting in a fun, helpful way.

Thanks to EZ, I've dared take my own knitting to places I never would've dreamed.

If it ever comes in CC or better yet on DVD, let me know !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brides of Dracula is a Hammer classic","review":"Despite the fact that \\"Dracula\\" doesn't actually appear in \\"Brides of Dracula\\", this film is still one of the best of Hammer's vampire movies.It's got everything that one falls in love with when it comes to Hammer horror: Great gothic atmosphere, wonderful period sets and costumes, and of course a great story to complement it all.The plot is fairly simple in this one: The countess has her son chained up in his bedroom. A fair maiden visiting the castle see him and unwittingly sets him loose. He wreaks havoc in the village, turning maidens into vampires. Naturally, when vampires attack Dr. Van Helsing can't be far behind-and Peter Cushing plays him to utter perfection.\\"Brides of Dracula\\" is definitly the most unusual of the Hammer \\"Dracula\\" series-but it certainly stands out as one of their best. Fans of gothic horror will no doubt be pleased. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cushing in his Glory","review":"Peter Cushing's performace as the very serious, but incredibly brave Dr. Van Helsing has never been surpassed by any other actor. Indeed, this Hammer Horror seems to be more centered on him and his Church sanctioned quest to find and destroy the vampires, than the vampires themselves. And yet-it works. And works well. He keeps cool in the face of danger, and his character finds an excellent balance between a factual scientist and a believer in God. Such a sight is both refreashing and an inspiration. See anytime. But I recommend that you wait till October when that Halloween atmosphere is ideal for such a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong entry in the Dracula series","review":"Despite the title, there is no Dracula in this film, but instead we have a vampire named Baron Meinster. The Baron gets a young French girl to release him from the shackles his mother has put him in. The Baron begins taking young women and has plans to take the French girl, but Professor Van Helsing arrives and begins to realize what is going on and he tries to stop Meinster. The film is solid all the way through, good story and credible acting. David Peel does a fine job as the slick, but evil vampire and whoever did his make-up should be commended. Peter Cushing delivers a grand performance as Van Helsing, Horror of Dracula is a better film, but I think this is Cushing's best portrayl as the vampire hunter. This is also a beautiful film with all the lush, vibrant sets and costumes that Hammer often had. Unlike some of the Hammer Dracula films, this one does have a satisfying ending that seems more planned than rushed. This one is certainly worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best vampire movies of all time","review":"I say this is one of the best vampire movies because the vampire is one of the most handsome vampires I have seen. I always love a handsome vampire! Peter Cushing is his usual talented self, and the elderly woman who plays the vampire's mother is a great old actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexual Perversity in Transylvania?","review":"Sometimes overlooked because it didn't star Christopher Lee, \\"The Brides of Dracula\\" is actually one of Hammer's greatest achievements. Peter Cushing was never better as the unflappable Dr. Van Helsing, who eventually falls victim to the bite of the vampire himself. In the film, vampirism itself is likened to a \\"sexual perversion\\" with parallels to libertineism, homosexuality, incest and hanging out with the wrong crowd. Hammer's usual high production values are at their peak. David Peel's Baron Meinster took a lot of heat for not fitting the vampire cliche (what? a blond vampire?), but he's suprisingly effective. A highlight is the scene where an old woman coaxes a newly interred vampire out of the grave for the first time, in sort of a satanic Lamaze ritual. It was three years before Hammer would make another vampire film and six years before Christopher Lee returned. None of these films quite had the style or freshness of the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is just right!","review":"This production does everything right. Why is Arnold Ostman's conducting so underrated in the U.S.?- He is masterful, and this production is with period instruments! the cast could not be better. Anyone ELSE out there let down by Battle's MET performance? Here's your relief. This production does ALOT with very little- forget about special effects, This lets you simply enjoy the story, humor, and great cast! The Queen of the night is refreshingly flirty with Pamino and more connected to the storyline than in most productions. Stefan Dahlberg is superb.

It was plenty for my purposes and the device worked great. Since I just bought one that worked like total crap, I still had my equipment out to test this thing in lab. Produces clean 13.0V all the way up to the advertised 600mA draw and even a bit over, though at some point the device cuts power (which is what it's supposed to do).Giving a 4-star because of said disparity between specs.

But after buying it, I sadly realized that it suffered from the classic \\"album version\\" syndrome.

I suddenly understood why this CD was out of print.However, \\"The Shamen Collection\\" was exactly what I was looking for. If you've heard The Shamen on the radio, on a dance compilation, or from P2P downloads, you probably heard what's on \\"The Shamen Collection.\\" The Collection is a more expensive two-disc set, but it's defintely worth it.

How can it go wrong?You'd be surprised.I'm an ambient music fan too, so believe me when I say I have a high tolerance for tedium. But this album offers no sonic innovation, no driving groove, no emotion. None. It trots out some uninspired rap stylings that just plod along in a kind of formulaic rave, and it does so to backbeats that wouldn't be out of place at a kid's birthday party. It's a wet noodle.The high point of the whole deal is when Mr. McKenna gets his chance, but he seems oddly unenthusiastic and the music his rap is set to is more of the same soggy gunk on the rest of the album. I can't recommend paying more than three or four bucks for this. It's nothing special--in fact, it's a bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nearly forgotten pop genius","review":"Roy Wood's work with The Move, ELO, solo and with Wizzard is amazingly robust and inventive. He remains his peculiar self while channeling everyone from the Beatles to Phil Spector to the Beach Boys to Carl Perkins etc. You name it--Wood is a human jukebox. His work with Wizzard especially reaches the phantasmogorical. This is big, daring, rocking, tuneful, ambitious, sometimes dangerous stuff--postmodern before its time. And three decades later, it still sounds fresh and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent greatest hits","review":"Roy Wood is a talented musician and performer.

This knife fits easily in her hand and she feels confident using it. She spent the first day cutting stuff just getting used to it.

This collection captures Pierre at his prime over a 20-year period. (How can he be only 43 years old with such a long period of high quality work?) If you want a journey into a fusion of European jazz, high-energy folk, soul-felt romantic airs, and some of the most enticing fingerstyle guitar on the planet, I can think of no better collection than this. \\"Nice Feeling\\" is the kind of CD you can listen to nonstop for days on end and still cry for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest!","review":"I've been listening to these tunes for many years in their original releases. Bensusan was amazing audiences when he was a teenager. You can hear John Renbourn's influence in his fluid and lyrical style. He was a great influence on Michael Hedges. I read an interview with Hedges where he said that if he were able to perform like any other musician, it would be Bensusan. I highly recommend Bensusan's first solo recording, Pres de Paris, which many, myself included, regard as a masterpiece. Very inventive and engaging. Masterful guitar work, good voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very peaceful, soothing, and satisfying guitar music.","review":"I've been listening to this CD on broadcast.com, and it is very beautiful. Bensusan's melodies trip lovingly, reminding me of late summer afternoons where amber light filters through lace curtains and dust dances its mid-air ballet.

Even though I had read several online reviews that warned against screwing the top and bottom plates too firmly into place, I couldn't believe how little effort it took to split the wood on the uprights. And I was being careful!!! I had to disassemble the thing, add wood glue, put on a clamp, and then revisit the situation after the glue had dried. Very high annoyance factor.

The shipping was prompt and assembly was easy. Be careful assembling the stands because its very easy to crack them if the screws aren't straight. I must say that my speakers look great on these stands and the stands themselves match well with my decor'. I would suggest attaching the speakers to your stands using a double sided tape. I used some molding tape on mine and they are quite secure. Overall, not the best stands out there. But for a afforable, decent looking stand, they are a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will do their job.","review":"I own these stands and a pair of the 24 inch versions. These BF-31B's are being used to support Polk Audio Monitor 30 speakers and they do their job without pain or glory. I did fasten those speakers with industrial velcro pads as a precaution. Those wondering about the assembly method, I can confirm that it can be done safely(no cracks, no splinters) using an old school manual screwdriver.Nice for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get what you pay for but they are great looking stands!!","review":"Comes in a plain white box with black lettering and packaged nicely. Finish is a perfect flat black with no marks or blemishes. Straight forward assembly design which really don't need instructions if you just use a little common sense. A child that plays with building blocks could figure the assembly out. The wood is particle board so beware of using power drills, if you do put it on the most forgiving setting before drilling you will crack it with to much power. Looks amazingly expensive and hight quility when put together and setting next to the television, but that's my little secret :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic cheap worthy","review":"these stands are something great. they are the only 31 inch stands you can buy under a hundred dollars. now with some people that brings up risks, there are reviews mentioning cracking due too screws being to tight or pilot holes to small. well there is an easy solution to this, GO SLOW, USE YOUR HANDS, DON'T BE LAZY, if your careful, which you should considering you may be putting up to a 1000 dollar speaker on them, well then you'll probly get steel ones;) but take your time and they will be fine. These are sturdy and safe little stand. they hold Polk Audio Monitor 30's just fine. the wire hide system works well and the carpet spikes work well too. so over all they are great audio phile stands for a great price"},{"rating":"2","title":"They work fine for my purpose.","review":"I have an Onkyo 7.1 system and use the stands for the front speakers. Luckily they have a small footprint. I don't know what I would have done if they were bigger. The cord run is not a problem, as the stands are near my cabinet and the cord does not show. The price was right and they blend well with my system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker Stand work PERFECT, just minor drilling","review":"The speaker Stands are just fine, I see many reviews that people have cracked them. yes the holes for the pre screw insert are a bit small. you could get smaller screws, OR just get a little bigger size drill bit and make the holes bigger. it worked great for me and no cracking or anything. i love them stands. now the only problem I have is that they uped the price to 50 bucks a set!... however.. i guess its still okay with free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"They hold speakers.","review":"I got these stands to hold a pair of small Equater monitors in my home studio. The 31\\" are obviously to short to keep them at ear level so I had to make boxes to put under the speakers to hold them up. But you cans beat them for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, you get what you pay for...","review":"...which is absolute junk. If you're lucky enough to get ALL the parts in the box, assemble it and not split each upright piece end as you lightly screw in each screw and somehow get the short leg pieces to fit in the bottom plate, you may have a decent looking stand. The problem is: you can't assemble it without splitting all 4 ends of the uprights, and you will not get the legs in the bottom unless you use a hammer (I just tossed them, was missing some anyway). All in all with some black marker to hide the split open areas, these will do fine hiding behind my couch, which is good considering how embarrassing they would be to display in the open. Next time, I will spend more on something designed and manufactured with a little more pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the money you pay","review":"Yes, these are cheaply made but they are very good for the money you pay for them. I needed a cheap pair of stands for a pair of small bookshelf speakers Energy CB-5) and these stands do the job very well. They are pretty sturdy and look decent. I didn't have the wood splitting problem that some others have said. I am very happy with them and I would have given them a 5 star rating if the spikes would actually fit into the holes.Definitely recommend them if you need a pair of cheap stands for smaller bookshelf speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for....","review":"AS mentioned early cable management is a joke. Construction is pretty cheezy. Be careful how much weight you put on these. Good for satellite speakers for surround. I was going to use these for some bookshelf speakers in my office and I'm having second thoughts because I do not want my speakers to take a nosedive.During construction I would use some glue to reinforce the screws and maybe get some wood screws which are just a little larger.If I had known these points before purchasing I would have moved on to another manufacturer. I hope that helps you and your decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stands are cheap but look great","review":"The stands seem to be ok. They're made out of cheap material but they're able to do what they're made for, which is to hold your speaker.When putting the stands together, make sure you're very careful. They seem to crack very easy. There's no need to over tightern the bolt. Just tight them enough to be flush with the groove. Also, the spike are hard to put in. What worked for me was to put the spikes in a little and then place it on the floor and lean on the board.Anyways, the stands are pretty good and i would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgrade to Amazon's description of this item.","review":"FYI here are some product details not specified on Amazon's description.

I bought two pairs and am happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product.","review":"I just received these yesterday, so my review is based on first impressions, but I believe they will suit my uses perfectly.They look nice, seem sturdy enough, and are light. I only have 2 complaints: the surface the speaker sits on is only 5 inch square, and the \\"wire management hole\\" on the top plate barely accepts 16ga wire, but if you do get the wire through it causes your speaker to wobble. My advice, don't use that hole. For $40 these are non-issues for me.Just be warned, when assembling these units start from the base up. Don't follow the instructions. 1. put the carpet spikes in, 2. hand start all the screws in the base, 3. put the speaker wire through the hole in the base, 4. screw in the long pieces of wood, 5. put in the back plastic pieces before putting the top part in, and 6. screw in the top.

The \\"wood\\" will split."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From These...","review":"This is MISLEADING...\\"Wood Speaker Stands\\"...this is some sort of horrible, compressed core laminate...It is a pain in the butt to assemble and if you can not line up the holes perfectly, you will end up splitting the crappy material that these things are made of.If you do buy them, keep four toothpicks handy when you assemble these. Insert the tooth picks in the pre drilled holes of the vertical supports, in order to line them up with the holes in the base plate and top plate. even then, be very careful.In short, this product is TOTAL GARBAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I know they are not best speaker stands out there, but they do the job for me and they look great.

I'm using them to hold speakers weighing around 8 lbs each. If you are concerned about them being knocked over by pets (including kids) or just because they're in a high traffic area these aren't the best option. You would be better off looking for a stand that can be filled with sand for additional weight and stability.

They went together easily enough and are tall enough for my needs. The only complaint that I have is their half hearted attempt at cable management at the bottom by simply drilling a hole for the cable to go thru. They could have just as simply added a channel on the bottom of the base that would allow the speaker wire to be recessed if one (I) wishes not to use the standoffs that would elevate the unit. Also the same would be said for the platform were the speaker sits as well.Don't get me wrong I do still love what they do for me, just some slight adjustments would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little stands","review":"Assembled super easy. Sturdy enough for the price.

I wish the base was a little bigger, but it hold them good.The Concealed wire management is also not bad, but you will need to take off the banana plugs before inserting the speaker wires (the hole is not enough to pass both in)Others also mention to insert the carpet spikes first, which is a good suggestion.You will need to use your brain to assemble it, use your senses to decide whether you need to tighten the screw very much or not, it's always the question how much is enough. You will not have any dynamic load on it, so, tighten tell it's all in is enough.Again, this is very nice looking speaker stand for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied! USE TOOTHPICKS","review":"I wasnt sure what to expect seeing the mixed reviews here but dont hesitate to buy them! Very inexpensive but work extremely well for their pupose, which is just to stand there.The most important thing is to take your time while assembling and make sure things are correct before any screws are installed. Toothpicks work great, makes it less of a chore lining up the holes. Just put toothpicks in the holes and slide the other piece over the toothpicks so all holes are in line and then screw them in one by one.After all is complete, they look very sharp and more expensive than what you paid, and you dont think about them ever again (which is a good thing). Dont use the included soft pads, use high quality 3m poster hanging goo. works great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Particle Wood cheap stands","review":"I don't write many reviews on here, so please take this to heart . . .

Overall I am happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, decent quality","review":"Purchased these stands to support book shelf speakers and they work great.

I was able to run the speaker wires through the holes on the top of each stand so my wires are virtually invisible and it looks pretty darn good! The only down side to these stands is that they aren't made of solid wood so you shouldn't put more than 15lbs on them. If you have a stereo system similar to mine, I would highly recommend these stands; especially if you consider the stands Onkyo offers for this model are well over $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Speaker Stands, but....","review":"When I recieved the stands one of the screw holes supporting the top plate was stripped and the corresponding wood support where the screw screwed into it was split.

These are very cheaply made. I screwed the bases in place and the legs began easily splitting down the middle...this didn't affect the stability of the stand though. I feel bad giving them a poor review since they'll do the job and if you're even bothering to look at them you're basically looking for an upgrade over the stack of phonebooks you're currently using.

But this is a very humorous movie, starring some of Russia's best comedians - Yuri Nikulin and Andrei Mironov.In Bulgaria, they used to show it on every New Year's day.The plot is like this: A russian turist (Nikulin) in Istanbul slips and falls and says \\"Chort Poberi\\" (which means something like \\"damn\\", or \\"hell\\", or \\"go to the devil\\" in russian language.)This happens to be a password for some bandits, who await their man (Mironov) to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his would-be broken arm. Without realizing what is happening, Nikulin's character smuggles the diamonds. Then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits. And there is a happy end...Watch this film, I'm sure you will enjoy it. In Bulgaria, you can legally buy it on a DVD for just $2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nam vsyo ravno!","review":"An hilarious movie about mistaken identity, the Russian mafia, the KGB and an unsuspecting nice guy in the middle of it all!Nikulin is hilarious as usual, and what can you say about the peerless Mironov?I watched this movie back in St.P some 14 years ago, and even when my Russian was just in the basic stage I could still follow it. Once my Russian progressed, I grasped all the very funny word play and situational humour.If you like enjoying yourself - buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we see the same movie?","review":"Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it. No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next. If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal. Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases. I have to wonder what they could be: \\"Damned Melon!\\" or \\"I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!\\"??? I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether. In sum, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite, same old same old","review":"karl jenkins hooked us in with the novelty of the first Adiemus album a few years back.

However, in 3, Jenkins slipped up. The beauty and grand feeling of the first two are replaced by jigs, and pretty trite ones at that. Phrases are unnecessarily repeated, and obvious hooks are run over and over to the point of distraction. And fairly frequently, the music will just bounce to a stop and then go on again, a technique that grows tired very quickly. In the service of this style, the instrumentation and vocals (which are still pristine) sound awfully contrived, even pretentious. There's some very impressive musical ability on display here, but it too often just doesn't amount to anything with emotion.I really wanted to like this album, but I just can't. There are some good moments, but it's too hard to let the sounds carry you away when you're busy rolling your eyes.

After doing much research it seems like eneloop is one of the higher rated rechargeable batteries out there.[...]The above is a great link that goes over the details of why they are such a good choice for rechargeable batteries.\\"In A NutshellOverall, the best rechargeable AA battery is the Eneloop Pro (aka Sanyo XX Battery Powered By Eneloop). These batteries hold their charge for 12 months. They also have a high energy capacity (2500 mAh), and they perform better than similar high-capacity AAs (see my article for more information).Another good rechargeable AA is Maha's Imedion battery, which is cheaper than the Eneloop Pro (about $5 less for a pack of 4). Imedions are also low-discharge, high-capacity batteries, but they do not perform as well as the Sanyo XX (see this reviews for the details on their performance).\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent price and quality.","review":"These retain their charge for weeks with almost no discharge. I've been using these for over 3 years in all devices in my home with no issues.I have Energizer NiMH batteries as well and they seem to perform comparably to these Eneloop batteries.---Be sure to charge at a correct rate, or you'll damage and decrease the lifespan of your batteries. According to various sources, a rate no less than 30% and no more than 50% the MAH capacity of your battery is best.Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed to be recharged frequently","review":"These batteries were placed in a satellite TV remote control.

I like many other photographers used to use single use batteries as rechargeable batteries weren't reliable & would discharge over a few weeks. I can charge these & pull them out of my camera bag two weeks later & they are ready to go. Couple these with a reliable microprocessor controlled charger (I use the excellent MAHA 801D) & these will be the last batteries you buy for many years. It is also nice not filling up landfill sites with used batteries. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series of rechargables","review":"One of the frustrations of rechargeables is that everyone makes different chargers. So if you're not careful, you end up with six chargers for twelve batteries, and completely ruin the intended benefits. So you need to pick one system and stick with it. I think the eneloop system is very reliable. The shells that allow the AAs to mimic Cs and Ds really work! Those are a little trickier to insert, but it's much easier than stocking up on every kind of battery out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing retained life","review":"We haven't had these long but we LOVE them! we like to use re-usable batteries in our wii remotes and our Energizer ones were horrible, they wouldn't hold a charge for anything.

Historically, this is an area rechargeable batteries have failed at. These batteries do not last forever, but they do last a long time. One down side - don't bother with the C or D battery adapters. They do not fit well, and if you can get them to fit, they drain VERY fast.

I'm quite satisfied with them in the radio, but they don't seem to last very long in my camera. Definitely not as long as the regular Duracell alkaline batteries I was using before--which was one of the claims I saw--that they lasted longer than alkalines.Though I definitely can see that the price for the amount of use you get from them is stacked in favor of the Eneloops. There is a much quicker drop-off though, from usability to non-usability as compared to the Duracells. I think I'll stick with non-rechargeable batteries in my camera, or at least, always have some with me as a backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than others I've tried","review":"The kids were burning through the regular batteries playing the Wii.

I just gave up and put in a standard Energizer AA in the mouse and have been happier with the duration even if I DO have to change it out from time to time.Hey at least now I just swap out the batt and remain wireless rather than having to be tethered for a couple of hours while it charges.Can't really recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sanyo Customer Service","review":"Batteries good.

They have performed as advertised. They are long lasting and hold their charge a long time while waiting in my camera bag.I've gradually replaced all the AA (and AAA) batteries in my house with these as my old batteries have died.

I always end up clicking 250 pics in a day. I never saw the low battery sign on my amera.On my last trip I clicked 515 pics. Still the battery was good. We even watched all the photos couple of times while traveling. For the first time I saw the low battery sign after all this.All my friends hv now decided to switch to these batteries. Very Very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BATTERIES. SAVE MONEY. BE GREEN","review":"I love these batteries. I use them in remotes (DVD player, TV, etc), wireless mouse and for my Nintendo Wii. In the Wii remote, they last forever, especially when you don't use the infrared camera (pointing at the screen) that much. Just using the accelerometer uses very little power. It depends on the Wii game.You can recharge them several times so it is less expensive than to keep buying alkaline batteries. It is also better for the environment.Note: They may not last as long in high current devices (like motors) because I think they were designed for low current devices such as bluetooth devices, TV remotes, etc. I need test them out on high current devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fully Charge - A Joke","review":"After charging overnight and following the instructions the battery is only at 85% charge.

They got good reviews here on Amazon and Consumer Reports gave them a reasonably high rating, and yet my own experience with them is that they are little better than your average AA when it comes to lasting in a digital point and shoot camera. I got maybe a dozen shots out of a pair of batteries before my camera, a Canon A590, gave up the ghost. Compared to the Duracell Power Pixes I was using, and which I can highly recommend, these Sanyos are a poor imitation of a battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst batteries ever","review":"When they arrived I took two out and put into my device.

Industrial Sanyo 2700mAh will perform better and even after 1yr or storage will have more juice left due to much higher initial capacity. And I think 2700mAh Sanyo are fairly cheaper than Eneloops."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL WORTHLESS CRAP GIMMICK","review":"After just a couple of months of use, these have turned to useless junk.

After that period of time the Eneloop batteries were just as dead as my other batteries. This morning I tried to use my camera (it's been awhile) but again both the regular and the Eneloop rechargable batteries have no charge at all.

They'll be great for our digital camera's and other items we use frequently. The other thing I read was that they have a longer duration than most rechargeable batteries. I can't attest to that yet as we've only had them a while but if that's also the case you can't beat these batteries. At $24.99 for an 8-pack, you also can't beat the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than regular rechageables","review":"Bought these a few months back and did not use them as the flash I use them in was being repaired.

These Eneloops have lasted just as long as Alkaline Batteries, maybe a little longer, WITH the additional aspect that they are rechargeable. Highly recommend these batteries for those who use AAA frequently; they will pay for themselves after a couple charges.UPDATE 12-18-2010Still using these batteries to this day, though not nearly as frequently.

Other rechargables are dead within a few days of charging, but Eneloops and other low-self discharge batteries will hold a charge for over a year, which is why they can sell them charged and keep them on the shelf at the store.

None are even close to these on holding their charge over time and out of the box.

Stop wasting your money on conventional batteries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eneloop 8 pak","review":"Great product ... am in the process of swapping my regular rechargeable to these type of hybrids. Great for cameras; you do take a bit of a hit in the capacity compared to a conventional rechargeable (eneloop I think runs about 2100mah where a \\"regular\\" rechargeable has about 2700mah) but being able to leave it in the camera for a month and still have a charged battery in it is invaluable.

Batteries arrived charged & made huge difference in product performance (electric shaver & water pik- daily used items) compared to other rechargables or throw aways. I used 2-3 weeks before recharging. The recharge gave even better performance-I was shocked. These don't seem to run down as quick as others, and maintain a steady power for a good amount of time. I'm very satisfied & ordering again even though they cost more (double)- the improved product performance & length of charge is worth it. They're the best rechargables I've used. Glad I found them:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Batteries","review":"I purchased 12 of these about a year ago. I have previously used powerex and nexcell NiMH in two cameras.

They can be recharged when they have been used up, and then they will actually hold almost all of that charge for a long time in my battery case. The other batteries I have had, seem to loose a majority of their charge while just sitting in the battery case and really should be recharged again before you put them to work.

They last pretty long in the Wii remotes. We have not had to replace them in some of the kids toys where the NiMh batteries would have needed replacing by now. They are not perfect as far as holding a charge while in storage, but are far better than NiMh. Overall a great purchase and I will purchase this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rechargeable Batteries Ever","review":"Eneloop rechargeable batteries are THE BEST! Their charged shelf life is incredibly long, unlike the other well known name brands that lose their charge on the shelf in a few days, and those well known name brand rechargeables don't even have half the life of a regular battery while in use. Eneloop rechargeable batteries, however, last as long or longer on one charge as any alkaline battery on the market.There's no other battery in my opinion, and once you have enough eneloop batteries to cover all your battery applications, you'll never buy another battery again. Try them - you'll definitely like them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Batteries","review":"These batteries work just as they say.

In the past every time I charged the NiMH batteries and left them for more than a week, they would discharge on their own....usually when I needed them most.

The rated capacities for the AA are 2000mah and 800mah for AAA. These Eneloops recharge to approximately 98% of rated capacity, give or take a percent. The other low self discharge batteries I use are the Imedion brand. These rate at 2100 and 800 for the AA and AAA, respectively. However, those batteries routinely re-charged to at least 100% on all 12 AA batteries I've purchased. The lowest was 2100 and the best was 2152! I'm assuming the AAA's are just as good.So be sure to check the prices of both the Eneloops (Amazon) and the Imedions (Thomas Distributing) when buying batteries. If the Eneloops are a buck or two cheaper per 4-pack I'll usually go with those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rechargeable Batteries for Camera","review":"I'm very impressed with the performance of these batteries.

If Amazon carried Maha, I'd buy them instead, but the Sanyo Eneloops are a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Eneloop Batteries","review":"I purchased a set of 4 these batteries from a dealer in Singapore a year ago and have been using them in a TV remote ever since with no initial charge. I have about 75% charge still on that set. When the batteries were released in the US last September I purchased a set with charger and stuck them in my Canon A620 camera. I was able to take 375 pictures before I had to recharge them, about what I would expect from a 2000mAh battery. I have now purchased 2 8-packs to keep for emergencies. Eneloop batteries also do very well in LED flashlights. I expect as the technology matures, the capacity will increase on par with standard NiMH batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes the rechargeable picture.","review":"Where possible, I've been replacing batteries with rechargeables. Only it's not a good idea for certain kinds of devices - remote controls, media center keyboards, PS2 remote controllers, clocks, flashlights - devices with low, occasional power draws where other rechargeable batteries just don't last because of self-drain. These solve that problem! No more alkaline batteries needed! I'm using the Maha 2500mah AAs for high-drain devices (e.g., camera flash) and these everywhere else. They charge great in the wonderful Maha smart charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use with metal enclosure","review":"The first time I used these batteries they shorted out and burned my hand. The fault is that the wrapper does not wrap around the negative connector leaving about 1/16 of a inch of metal exposed. If used with a battery enclosure that is metal it could short out like mine did. The AA batteries are not made this way only the AAA. Do NOT buy until they have changed this. I was lucky enough to have caught before they exploded and only burned my hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do hold their charge!","review":"I don't buy any other brand of rechargeable NiMHs anymore. Having tried Energizer, Sony, Rayovac and Eneloops, these are the best. They hold a charge, and they keep on working for a long time. I'm using a Sony CycleEnergy charger, a very basic one, so I don't know how they do if they're quick-charged, but I love em. I think they also provide a flatter power curve over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome batteries!","review":"I switched to these, and use them for my 360 controllers, remotes, G700 mouse, and many other things. I have probably 20 of them, and they work great, and hold charges well. I used some Duracell rechargables, and they were bad in remotes because after 30-60 days I need to charge them again.

These little guys have certainly lived up to their reputation! The only thing is I wish the charger came in the pack or was at least sold separately (without add'l batteries).

The Sanyo Eneloop batteries have now re-defined rechargeable batteries by holding their charge when not in use. I use the Sanyo Eneloops in power hungry devices such as my electric toothbrush and remotes for the Nintendo Wii. It is amazing how many batteries that thing goes through. I have always cringed at the thought of tossing away spent batteries, but now feel with the Sanyo Eneloop batteries, there is no need to buy those packs of alkaline batteries.

They charge quickly - quicker than any other rechargeables and they last and last and last. Even in my old digital camera - a real power hog - I now get months of use before I need to recharge. I am replacing all my rechargeables with these eneloops.One caveat - the original package contained 'adapters' to use with the AA batteries.

The batteries hold the charge well, and the new charger is a welcome improvement to my 3+ year old Panasonic charger. The new charger is able to charge two batteries as seperate set, compared to my current charger which charges all four as one. There is a more slimmer model charger made by Sanyo which is capable of charging each battery independently but the charger only works with 110V which does not make it a great travel charger, which is why I opted for this charger as universal compability in voltage was important to me.

Now I need to get more batteries to use them in the balance board. I don't know how they are in other devices, but from my experience, they are a wonderful addition to my Wii.

Even had many similar experiences in the army even though it was a different MOS and locations.

This album has it all; mellow songs, sensual songs, and of course, the songs that make you smile with delight. This is one of my favorite jazz albums because of Hunter's perfection and Parker's masterful drumming. I highly recommend this to anyone who can appreciate good music.

It's an awesome documentary of the Revolutionary war, including politics and battles, with enough details of personalities and strategies to satisfy most. I particularly liked the period music soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful.","review":"This was a very sad and biased documentary. In fact most of the interviews are with british historians second guessing the American revolution. The founding fathers are portrayed as rich guys who wish they were more british. They describe the american revolution coming about because the founders wished they were respected more by british royalty. The first thing mentioned in the documentary is how everyone in the colonies worshipped the king and wanted to be king. I can't believe this aired on PBS, in America! The stamp act is portrayed as being a good idea, and a small tax that the colonies should've thanked the British for. Do not watch this, it's a hack job. Meant to push people away from patriotism and toward world government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But See Simon Sharma's History Of Britain Too!","review":"As usual, this documentary shows the taxes imposed upon the colonists as being evil and tyrannical. This is a good documentary, but it is American made, so must be taken as such.A better version of part one can be found on Simon Sharma's excellant series, A History Of Britain, in the episode 'The Wrong Empire', which sees the story from the British perspective. Apart from that, we have a good documentary series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the classroom!","review":"I used a number of clips in my 8th Grade US History class....it does a great job of sharing the experiences and emotions of the people involved in the American Revolution with the characters themselves telling the story.

I remember that this scene was narrated that the English general saw armed farmers and ranchers watching his surrendered troops and he believed he saw a \\"new generation\\" of man.

It also wasn't funny watching a sophomoric approach to firing people - especially by gutless managers that couldn't do it themselves. (I've never heard of that in reality.) Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' \\"Go To Meeting\\" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society. I can't believe this movie is being considered for an award!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock & Doris redux","review":"I can't fathom why this had so much hype. There was certainly nothing special about it-just another updated Hudson/Day flick, except with \\"NEW! IMPROVED! SEX SCENES!\\" Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga *BOTH* nominated for BSA? Really?? Schmooze away and you'll get a Nomination! I guess it really is about Academy politics. As Mo'Nique said, \\"I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics.\\" I was relieved when she won. The performances here were not nomination-worthy, just average. Clooney was fine, again nothing special. Pair this withThe Hurt Locker(not as over-hyped but just as over-rated) and it's tedium at it's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic ending and very little drama or excitement in between","review":"I was ready to give this movie three stars for being mediocre but watchable. Then came this horrible ending like those songs that just fade away. Right away I dropped two stars and unfortunately, I had to give it the lowest Amazon rating. Some writers commented on the chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. They do nothing most of the film and then she just walks away when he shows up at her door to find she has a husband and family. You call that chemistry? I call it boring. I did enjoy the part played by the young girl, although her acting was strictly minor league. I suspect I will get slammed by other readers for this review. That is fine. I have to say what I really feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More 24-Hour Rentals","review":"Great movie, but the 24-hour viewing window is absurd.

It was very entertaining and not at all predicatable. It is nice to see a film for adults. The acting was fantastic. I hope to see more of Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick in the future. Of course Jason Bateman is always good and I am glad to see him in more films. George Clooney was fantastic too. The scene at the end where he stands there and says nothing but watching his facial expressions change was superb acting. Using out of work people in the scenes was genious. Jason Reitman is a great director and look forward to his next project."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Clooney's Best Role","review":"The major theme is that top level successes in any given career may have to make unbearable sacrifices. Frankly, I've always felt a strong dislike for Clooney, but here he finally drops most of his Hollywood smug arrogance and played a character developing real humility, depth, and maturity by the end. His co-worker, boss, and lady friend are very well written and acted as well.

Everyone seemed to rate it very highly. First off, the intro and opening credits were horrible: the music was so awful I wanted to leave then and there, not to mention the camera views and picture quality. After surviving this part, the movie kicks off. None of the people were that memorable or likable. And NOTHING happened. I kept waiting for George Clooney to return home, to change his life, to go after the woman he loved, basically to do anything to prevent me from getting up to leave. The only reason I stayed was because of all the reviews (which I now know to completely disregard). It was a total waste of time and money, and absolutely pointless. From now on, I will make my spontaneous movie-going decisions based on the OPPOSITE of the movie critics reviews. I *strongly* recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont believe the hype","review":"I cant believe the hype this film is getting - or maybe I just didn't get it. It starts off ok enough Clooney in cruise control playing George Clooney just like every other film he is in. Then oh oh trout pout love interest Vera Farmiga shows up - with the worst body double you have ever seen for the nude scene - and the film becomes yet another sappy rom-com.But what makes this worse is that while it tries to take itself seriously regarding lay-offs, unemployment, love marriage, whats the point of it all blah blah - it runs off down the buddy movie path with that old clich�� of the old pro (Clooney) and the young eager but green new recruit ( Anna Kendrick ) who Clooney takes under his wing and guides her through the job while she helps him become a better person.Oh dear how many movies have tread this wearisome path.

George Clooney is just so likeable, and Vera Fermiga (sp?) and Anna Kendrick were both fabulous.A really different movie, loved the family in northern Wisconsin, everything about it was authentic and you could see the price the main character had paid for his no-strings-attached lifestyle. This is a movie men and women will both like. I actually watched it twice, and I am not a chick flick kind of girl. This is NOT a chick flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clooney as Clooney","review":"George Clooney once again playing himself in a romantic comedy which is really neither that romantic nor funny. Don't get me wrong, Clooney is always pretty good as himself. The story is very, very slow moving. Editing is terrible- the story gets very choppy and even confusing in places. Interesting premises to work with-business travel, relationships on the road, making a successful career out of firing others - but the supporting cast and editing really get in the way. Watch the deleted scenes-they would have really helped make this a better movie. There were scenes in the movie which didn't truly make sense until I saw the deleted scenes.

The novel is mostly interior monologue by the incessant traveler played well by George Clooney as a corporate hatchetman. I guess they needed more of a plot, of course, to make the film work better. This is an adult drama. No violence, no shoot em ups. Not for everyone, only those with a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd like to see more","review":"George Clooney is the detached central character in Oscar nomination form. He's a professional fire man, who personally fires surplus employees on behalf of companies across the USA and obsessively clocks up air mile privileges along the way. Clooney's relationships with colleagues, a girl he meets in transit, sister and family act as counterpoints to his otherwise lonely existence. Old and contemporary themes find a home here in the pursuit of love and life's meaning amid the background detachment of modern air travel. The human drama and fragility of the characters from the fired (not actors but people fired in life) to those doing the firing holds your interest throughout. The movies taught direction and memorable musical score adds zest to the visual palate. I'd like to see more. Yep I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I'm not a big George Clooney fan, so I didn't have high hopes for UP IN THE AIR.

Some of my other cartridges always offer some new and interesting twists all the time and always seem new. This particular cartridge gets real old real fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Exercise","review":"I work with this game and the Brain Age game and find that regular work with both of these games improves my memory. In this game's memory exercises, the game flashes numbers on the screen for a second or two and then you have to type in the number. They start out with two digits and go up to 6 digits. An interesting feature is that the game scales the difficulty, increasing the number of digits it flashes as you get them correct and scaling back the number of digits when you make a mistake. This scaling feature carries through all the different exercises. It is a well designed thought out game that appeals to a wide age range--4-100."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THE GAME & IS A CHALLENGE","review":"THE GAME HAS MANY CHALLENGES AND DIFFERENT LEVELS. IT'S A GREAT GAME TO MAKE YOU THINK. YOU USE PLAIN COMMON SENSE ON SOME AND OTHERS YOU HAVE TO GIVE MORE THOUGHT ON. IT IS A GAME FOR ANY YOUNG SCHOOL AGE CHILD TO ADULT.

I highly recommend this game if you are interested in challenging your brain and competing against yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a Bigger Brain","review":"I've wanted this game since I first got my DS almost a year ago. It is similar to the Brain Age games, but approaches training in a totally different way. There are 5 areas of your brain to improve, and 3 levels of difficulty per mini-game (about 3 each area) to keep you busy. The games are interesting and unusual, and I'll keep at'em until my brain is really big. The Brain Age games are still faves. Keep in mind this keeps track of your progress and trains your brain in a totally different way. Don't expect BA3, but do expect to have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"More challenging than you might think.","review":"Not just for the kids. This game provides an adequate challenge to all ages.

You can choose to test yourself or practice. Either way, the number of game choices is limited -- and unlocking practice games is a pain as you need to play the same game in each category over and over (even if you score well each time) in order to advance. I'm surprised the other people found this fun. Well, I got a B- on my first test and in a couple days I scored an A. I guess maybe I'm too smart for this. (But I admit I was stupid to have wasted $20 on the game, so I guess I'm no smartie after all.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"i can't believe nintendo would allow a product like this to be released. its absolute rubbish as one reviewer here noted in amazement that many people seem to like it at least on the amazon reviews. makes me wonder if this thing is rigged.the game absolutely sucks with no attraction whatsoever. gameplay is zero and instructions suck. the types of challenges are lame and the graphics are incomprehensible.i would say save your money and buy brain age or brain age 2. in fact buy almost anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is lame","review":"I can't believe so many people like this game.

Some of it appears to be outdated, but what can you expect from a bargain priced book with a publish date of 1998.

Perhaps it is because I have always admired Sophie Marceau's work and beauty, but before I knew it, I was totally entranced. It was like a lyrical daydream. There were even several paragraphs that really stood out as superb, original writing.

The emotional content was superb. Everything Jinx felt I felt as well. Many of the situations were very familliar and I liked the alternative veiw the girls in the book had on the meaning of the word \\"crush.\\" It was beautifully written, beautifully created and my heart ached greatly as I finished the story.

Sadly, both are out of print due to the failure of the Publisher. They correct the common errors of harmony and provide hip, alternative changes in red type (example \\"Here's Sonny Rollins' bridge for this tune\\"). It's great to learn from a master pianist. I met Dick at his Master Class at the Ravinia Jazz Festival in around 1995 and told him I thought he had the best looking hands and technique I had seen since Teddy Wilson and begged him to write several more volumes of this series of books.

I bought \\"Zero Zero Zero\\" to get an idea of whether I'd like to buy more of the earlier Sam. It has happened so often that I've heard one album by an artist, only to buy more and find that I'd somehow picked the one anomolous album. (For instance Jules Shear--\\"Between Us\\" is altogether different from anything else he's done--I loved it, and read reviews from fans of his other work who hated it--something for everyone, I guess).On the strength of \\"Zero Zero Zero\\", I will buy more Sam Phillips albums. I liked it well enough to want to hear more, even though it wasn't a cohesive album, like \\"A Boot and A Shoe\\" (which was excellent, by the way).Particularly strong tracks--\\"I Need Love\\", \\"Black Sky\\", & \\"You Lost My Mind\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriate Title...","review":"Contrary to what the above reviewer stated, this is an album for DIE HARD (as in you are such a fan you actually shelled out seven bucks to see the artist in Die Hard III) Sam Phillips fans ONLY. The curious selection of \\"hits\\" and remakes suggests this Best Of collection is for people who already own her other work and are looking for something new. Unfortunately, it fails on almost every level. The two \\"new\\" songs are lackluster at best and everything else has been heard before. To make matters worse, Virgin insists on charging the absurd retail price of 17.99. Amazon's price reduction lessens the sting a little bit, but I would still recommend buying The Indescribable Wow first and then getting into her other great albums gradually. This way you will avoid that burning sensation that I'm feeling as I write this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unnecessary release","review":"While Sam in very telented, this recording is a waste of money and time.

I have two matching JBL bookshelf speakers and I couldn't ask more from the component system. The Disk Player has a remote which can go directly to a specific disk or play them all. I will play for at least 5 hours without intervention. Check online for all the specs and check out the photos of the Disk Player. As far as durability, I have had the one I listen to now for four years and no problems at all. I reordered another when this one malfunctions but so far it works great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Component for the Price","review":"I replaced a Sony with this Sherwood hoping it would have a longer lifespan than the Sony's 4 Years. I was pleased with the sound and simple operation.The remote works great for changing tracks & discs. It would be awesome if volume control was included. That is the only missing feature that I have noticed.For the price and limited choices for cd players, you can't go wrong with this product. I highly recommend it.ltkluby"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fakin' It","review":"Nothing like starting with a few false premises and going downhill from there.If this thing IS meant for converting official state atheists in the former Soviet Union, then maybe the author really thinks the Estonians and Khazakhis are too dumb to breathe.Don't blame me -- I didn't write this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to apologetics","review":"For those not academically trained in theology, philsosophy, or apologetics, Beisner's book provides a nice introduction to key questions and their possible solutions. The well studied skeptic will not find all the arguments convincing, as Beisner does not offer his book to such an audience. I have successfully used the book for interested seekers who would not be able to follow more sophisticated arguments offered by figures like Alvin Plantinga. At the end of the book, Beisner offers a list of recommended reading for advanced studies in areas such as philosophy, logic, science, and so on. Having studied under Beisner, I have found him to be a constant help in answering hard questions, some of which were my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"This day and age we need to atleast let our children read about the positivie side of life.

The story begins when a young Vietnamese-American girl starts a small vegetable garden in a plot of land in a neglected, garbage-filled lot. From this small start, a project begins which transforms the neighborhood.This is a moving story which presents multi-cultural urban life in both its negative and positive aspects. Each chapter is told in the first person by a different member of the community. Thus, by the end of the book we have heard a great diversity of voices: male and female, of many age groups, and of many different ethnic backgrounds.I was really impressed with this book, and recommend it to both younger readers and adults. For an interesting companion text to \\"Seedfolks,\\" try \\"O Pioneers!\\", the classic novel by Willa Cather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seedfolks","review":"This book tries too hard to be meaningful, diverse, and deep.

It takes place in Clevland in a poor neighborhood. One little girl goes out to a vacant lot and plants some lima beans, and soon everyone is beginning their own gardens.I liked this book because it tells how gardening can be fun but hard work also. Gardening also changes many peoples' lives and it makes them happy. It doesn't matter where they are from or what they are like. Everyone just works together. Seedfolks is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"RASUL.","review":"I didn't like the book because it has no action.Paul Fliechman, the only action you had was when sae young got beat up and thats what I thought about SEED FOLKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine description of life's paralells","review":"When something begins with one person, it continues with another. A resources that is pure and unspoiled will always be touched by man. That is the general idea of the book.

Soon the people argue over boundaries and such and conflict begins. Such is human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intertwined lives","review":"I enjoyed this story of a community that comes together because of the act of one little girl.

Seedfolks was a good book because it taught about all different kinds of diversity and how people can come together. What readers arn't prepared for is the ending. The ending is completley blank. You see each chapter focuses in on a different character's point of view, only one chapter, then it goes on to another character leaving you hanging. At the end they have no info on what happened to the character's after their chapter. For example one chapter told a story of a child and a dad who were trying to plant something to raise money, the child talked about having a new bike and a better life and all but it just left off at the part where they planted their seeds! I found this book very boering and I would not put it on my read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"seedfolks","review":"Seedfolks by Pual Fleischman is a story of racial divide changed to community through the actions of a little girl. It all starts when she plants beans in honor of her dead father. People take notice, and one by one, people in the neighborhood begin to plant various crops from their native lands. Eventually they build a strong, protective, and friendly community that grows along side the garden.The story is told through the eyes of 13 different characters each explaining their diverse background, what they've seen in the garden, and why they're now involved. The style makes the book a quick read, and because the characters are not directly revisited, it's not confusing.Overall, this book's inspirational sense of true community is not only achieved in the fictional garden, but ideally in day-to-day life. Seadfolks leaves you with an uplifting, warm and fuzzy all over feeling, and a strong desire to make change."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"An emotional, well written story.

It seemed that each chapter almost had the same basic idea, that they were either depressed or lonely, so they planted something, with a few exceptions.

I definitely don't reccomend this for anyone under 11, because of reference to dumping children in garbage cans (Maricela) and cheating (Curtis)."},{"rating":"1","title":"seed folk","review":"it was boring cause it all was just what the people in the building were doing and thinking at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"planting a communtiy","review":"The story had strength as well as weakness. Its strengths included describing the way people plant their seeds. This method helped me understand how very important it is to know what you're doing when planting seeds so you can have a great outcome .The major weakness was the part of Florence, which could have been given longer to develop her character better.My overall impression of this story was that it was wonderful. I can't believe that just by a little girl being so sad and taking her pain to the vacant lot to plant her some seeds made the whole the community come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"book for kids","review":"The whole story is about a garden that was an emptylot filled with garbage and infested with rats until a little girl planted a bean seed and gave a few people hope on life. Like this guy Curtis that believes if was to plant a tomato garden he could win back Leticia's heart. The entire storie is about people trying to do their best in life, with the hope of a garden?I think the strength of the book is mostly about how people found a better way to live or interact with others alot better than they did before the little girl started the garden. I believe the main weakness was how a 16 year old girl wanted to kill herself all because she was a young mom and was'nt truly accepted.My overall impression of this book was unsatisfying, boring. It just wasn't my kind of book I'm not into stories about people's lives and how a garden affects them in life situations.I would recommend this book to a 12 year old girl thats into nature type of stuff, It struck me as a little girls book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"i was excited about this book...until i read it. there are too many GOOD books out there to waste time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"seedfolks","review":"SEED FOLKSSeed folks is a very interesting book.

This book was about these people who started in a lot filled with garbage. There are 13 characters in the book that plant things in the garden. Their names are Kim, Ana, Wendell, Gonzalo, Leona, Sam, Virgil, Sae Young, Curtis, Nora, Marcila, Amir and Florence. My favorite character is Curtis, because he finds a kid on the street and takes care of him. He also pays him to watch his tomatos while he's at work. Another character that I liked was Sae Young. She is very brave because, one day at her laundromat she is robbed, she's so scared after it that she won't leave her house. But one day she finally she leaves her house like she did before. Although there is one thing I didn't like. That was it didn't really tell you what happens in the end.

I teach 6th grade, and Seedfolks provides a lesson on overcoming differences and working together to build unity.

Beautifully shot in black and white, wonderfully acted, and very funny. As usual, Benigni's real-life wife is in the movie. She shows up towards the end, and as usual she is wonderful. There is also a nice cameo at the beginning from Ellen Barkin, who looks so very very young. The entire movie has Jim Jarmusch's sense of quirky humour written all over it - if you like the rest of his work, you will love this movie.

Poor Sean, not only does he had to live in Graymoor mansion, but he suspects he may be the next victim, and he may just well be. I throughly enjoyed this book, but I do not advise any person to read Chapter 28 alone, or without the benefit of a good, strong drink. I have never read anything this intense. At the same time, Mark Roeder also manages to show us that in addition to hate in Verona, there are also love and strong bonds of friendship, even friendships and help from the dearly departed. This book was a great fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting more","review":"Someone is Killing the Gay Boys of Verona is the third book in a series for author Mark Roeder. While each book stands on its own and can be enjoyed regardless of the order in which they are read, this story draws on the background of the previous two books. Tears came to my eyes when the main character of this book seeks the help of his older gay friends Nathan and Ethan, who have now been together for at least 20 years. It is an immensely satisfying read and will leave you wanting more... Like a story about the two step brothers who were killed in the Graymoor Mansion 100 years before.This is a ghost story, but it is also so realistic of the gay youth of today who, more than any previous generation of gays are coming out of the closet while they're still in high school and demanding the right to date each other and attend the high school dances. Mark Roeder has a big, beautiful heart, and it comes through with loving clarity in this latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Is Killing the Gay Boys of Verona","review":"This was a very disappointing book to read.

So I can switch back and forth easily between the two pods without moving the base unit around. It does not interfere with the operation of either of the pods. I use it for my Canon SX20IS camera. It does interfere with battery replacement in my model camera, but nothing else. You'll have to remove the part on the camera to get the battery door open.

Not the best quick connect adapters out there, but when you want something to add to homemade camera gear or other mounts that don't have their own adapters you can't beat these things. They are rugged and I added one to every piece of camera gear I own. I also like the fact that the plates have a \\" thread in them so things can be put on tripods that don't have a quick connect. I only wish they had spring loaded releases like the one on my bogen tripod head.

He edits the text to eliminate much of the parallel speech while retaining the brightest of the lines. Shakespeare's many metaphors and images, though brilliant, can tend to confuse the average audience.

It is a great little camera with amazing images, but it's size deters it from being truly wobble-free. With this Sima Video Bracket, I can now capture live events without looking as if I spent all my time at the bar. The bracket allows my images to be virtual shake free, and I can't believe it took me so long to discover this item.The only downside regarding use on such a camera as the GL2, is that it interferes just barely with the LCD monitor. So rather than have the LCD screen open all the way, it is now open almost all the way, which for me is no problem, as I can still see it just fine, but for others that may not be to their liking. Smaller cameras may not have this issue.In all, I am very satisfied with this product, I would have easily paid $25 for this item that I purchased for $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does The Job","review":"This product does the job it is made for.

Furthermore, the dictionary is pathetically under cross-referenced, with very serious omissions in this regard indeed. I don't think this is a good investment for anyone.

All actors are Asian, and there are some very cute women there. The movie looks at the social structure of a rural, poor Asian community as far as women and their marriages are concerned. We see a girl being given away for marriage against her wishes, so that her poor family can get significant monetary benefit from her union. We see a girl losing her innocence and driven to the extreme to commit a crime to save the man she's actually in love with. I recommend this movie.

I highly recommend this performance, and do not think there could be many versions better than this ever. But, I really really hate to admit that the sound is sometimes over driven, like a little blurred on louder passages. Has it to do with poor engineering? This is not a huge problem though, and it only occurs occasionally. It is just that from the level of performance of this CD I wish it is absolutely perfect.The choir eliminates vibrato most of the time, and this approach in my opinion is the best and most appropriate for such music.

And the justification he uses for his actions, that SHE REALLY WANTS IT regardless of how hard she fights and how much she begs him to stop, is disgusting. I found myself hoping he was actually the villian and a hero (or perhaps just a good therapist) would appear to set her straight - abuse is not love.

Larnelle Harris and Sandy Patti's duet, 'I've Just seen Jesus', brought tears to my eyes and me straight to my computer so that I could buy a copy of the Kennedy Homecoming just for that song alone.It's perfect.

Davey and Jade's love for electronic music really shows. The overall sound is familiar for those who listened to electronic music in the 80's. But this stands on its own rather than being an imitation, and I think it deserves more recognition than to be labelled a \\"side project\\" album. I look forward to more from them in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Depeche Mode","review":"Modern sound but reminiscent of Depeche Mode and that era of 80's music.

It's like early Depeche Mode meets AFI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and captivating","review":"This is, as many people point out, the first release from AFI's darkwave side project.But I see it something completely seperate from AFI. The vocals and music, although from the same creators, give off an entirely different perspective, tone, and feel than their rock counterparts. The songs are melodious and catchy. I cannot listen to any song without wanting to, and usually ending up, belting it out.I believe it is some of the most emotional music to come from Havok and Puget. The lyrics are easier to interpret than most of AFI's catalouge, which is refreshing.This CD is one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in industrial or darkwave."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again!","review":"Even though this is a drastic change from their typical music style, Davey Havok and Jade Puget did an amazing job at creating a dance album. I would highly recommend this album if you are a fan of bands like Depeche Mode or AFI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Blaqk Audio is the electronica side project by AFI's Davey Havok and Jade Puget. I admit I am not a fan of AFI's music. I like a couple of their songs here and there but overall I am not a fan. When I first heard samples of Blaqk Audio last year I was totally blown away by what I hear. Their music was definitely right up my alley. CEX CELLS is the duo's first (and hopefully not their last) album. The music reminded me a lot of my favorite EBM and synthpop bands. I found the music very upbeat and addictively catchy. I especially love the opening track \\"Stiff Kittens\\" which is a lot of fun to dance too. I also enjoy \\"Snuff on Digital\\" as well. The only drawback is Davey's vocals which has a tendency to be nasally and that isn't a good thing. The lyrics are often silly but overall I enjoyed CEX CELLS a lot. I hope Blaqk Audio isn't a one album project. They definitely have the potential of being really great right up there with VNV Nation and Depeche Mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done synthpop a la DM and Camouflage!","review":"I have never been a huge AFI fan, basically Davey's voice was a bit annoying to me, but on this album he has found his niche. His voice was truly meant for this sort of music, not the hardcore punk of the earlier years, or the emoish influenced crap of recent years. I really think he should throw himself full fledged into this genre, it really works for him! There is a strong Depeche Mode flavor, obviously, but anyone remember Camouflage, a German late 80s group (Great Commandment)? Well I think I hear even more influence from them (of course they were accused of being a DM knockoff) I also trace some OMD and Ultravox shadings in the music and singing. Actually I gave it 4 stars, but it comes close to a five star project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metro-rave","review":"This is probably one of the most disappointing albums I have ever bought!Davey's voice is fine but the music and lyrics are sooo over-the-top cheesey, ex) \\"I...want...I want you.\\" UGH!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Davey Havok What Happened to You Review","review":"CD was in fine shape.

Two 'hardcore' punks trying to make an album of synth pop to rival Depesh Mode's greatest work. That clearly didn't work out. Davey Havok doesn't succeed with this style of music. While his voice works perfect his style and lyrics fail. Jade Pudget, well as a guitarst he is decent, but as a producer/engineer, he is not qualified.'Stiff Kittens' 'On A Friday' 'Semiotic Love' and 'Again, Again, and Again' are the only worth while tracks on the entire album.

I will give a review of each song on this cd.1.)...Baby One More Time [5/5] Brilliantly well produced song. The beat is catchy and her voice sounds really good here.2.)...Baby One More Time (Sharp Platinum Vocal Remix) [5/5] Although it's catchy and is a good remix, it's a little too long. Fit for clubs, though.3.)...Baby One More Time (Davidson Ospina Club Mix) [5/5] The better remix on this cd. It's a little shorter, but it is more catchy than the other one. To me, this does not seem to be a club mix.Overall, a 5/5.

This book, accomanied by a copy of the federal rules will be all that you need in the study of evidence. This text isnt like most books on evidence, there are no problems, only cases and notes. The cases correspond to specific rules in the Federal Rules and help explian how each rule works. Also the notes expand on the rule to show how it would it apply in other contexts.Also if you are in a TX law school, this book will also help to illustrate some of the key difference in the federal rules and the Texas state rules (i.e. statement against interest hearsay exception).All in All this is a great text."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece of funk drumming analysis","review":"I use this book extensively with my private students and consider it one of the best drumset instruction books ever written. The book explains the seminal James Brown funk grooves and how to build upon them, the Tower Of Power grooves that Garibaldi made famous with that band, and has eight funk-fusion music tracks with and without drums, charts of those songs and developmental analysis of the different grooves used in those songs. The drum solo alone on the CD is worth the price of admission. There is also a companion video called \\"Tower of Groove\\" that shows Garibaldi and a very tight band playing these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!","review":"I recommend this book to any drummer especially younger students developing their sense of time. You will not be disappointed with this book. Great for those students moving into high school and even some advanced Junior High drummers. Each groove is broken down into manageable pieces then combined together. The book allows the student to build their funk vocabulary without being intimidated. This is a very useful and fun book.Also check out: \\"Rockin' Bass Drum\\"Rockin' Bass DrumRockin' Bass Drum, Book 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar Electronics for Musicians","review":"Was disappointed with this book. The guitar electronics theory was fine but the illustrations, photos, and wiring diagrams were not that great. The photos are in black and white and look as though they were from a '60's text book. The diagrams actually look better than the photos.Parts of this book seem to be a compilation of manufacturers' wiring diagrams and manuals, most of which didn't apply to any of my needs.If you're into guitar electronic theory, this is the book for you. However, you may do better with the Dan Earlewine or the Dave Burrlick books."},{"rating":"1","title":"so outdated it should be out of print","review":"This book doesn't even mention active pickups or noisefree single-coil pickups. It lists about 20 major manufacturers, of which I'd only heard about maybe 5 of them, and then I'm a gear head. Of course basic electronic principles haven't changed since this book was written but come on. I generally don't agree with folks who say \\"you can get all this information on the internet\\" because there's a value in having everything carefully preselected and gathered in one place, but this book is so dated I would recommend people to use google instead.

And I can see why. But isn't this just plain wrong? Shouldn't the anonymous author own up to his words? For younger people whose only information about the author might be the admittedly good movies The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, isn't The Tristan Betrayal a kind of betrayal? I think so. It's fraud by whomever owns the rights to Robert Ludlum's name.Even if this book were good, which it isn't for the reasons well-covered by others below, no one should be allowed to perpetrate such a fraud on the public.

I can only assume that the publishers got hold of a first draft and edited it for publication because that is exactly how it reads. I would like to think that Ludlum would never have submited this for publication as is. Perhaps a few re-writes later and this would have been a good novel. As it is, I find it rather obvious and not all that well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very dull","review":"It would be a terrible shame if Robert Ludlum was to be remembered for books like this, rather then some of the great thrillers he has written over the years. This story has been ghost written and it reads nothing like a Ludlum novel. Amazingly there is no tension or true thrills at any point of the book and you ended up not caring about the characters at all. Despite the potentially interesting background I was bored from start to finish and I had a sense of relief when I finally reached the end.The real crime here sits with the editor and the publisher who do not seem to realise what the reading public want and expect from a novel that has Ludlum's name on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Ludlum Book","review":"I have read several of Ludlum's books and plan to read the rest of them soon. I think he is a great writer with an amazing ability to keep you on your toes. I loved this book and it may be my favorite that I have read so far (The Janson Directive would be the other) This book does a great job of fictitiously explaining events that occurred during World War II. As another reviewer said, it is not in the same mold as his other books. Personally, I liked the break in style and the storyline. Maybe it is just because I love history but this book is certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp excrement cashing in on Ludlum franchise.","review":"First, it's \\"ghost\\" authored, ( if anyone would seek to claim authorship ).Second, it's unreadable.

I have always been interested in thrillers and mysteries and about this general time period and subject so the book was right up my ally. I think Mr. Ludlum incorporated some great plot twists to the story keeping it interesting all the way through. He also has a great ability to make the reader really connect with the characters from their humanistic side, as well as be in awe of them as people.

It's dead on. Maybe because I'm now older, my tastes more refined, or maybe ghostwriting just doesn't do it, but I was laughing out loud at all the wrong parts. I wanted the good guys to die, they all made me crazy. Would you want have live a main character who has endless interior dialog with italics? Terrible. Awful. Imagine all these words all in italics, and you get a glimpse of the writing as well!

What a disappointment. I thought that since it had the great name Ludlum on it, it would be better. How wrong I was.I agree with the reviewer who said it lost steam after about 150 pages. It started out great, and I was really enjoying it as the tension built up. But then something happened midway through where it just became unbelievable. The main character, Metcalfe (who is supposed to be only 29 but acts way older at times) will be in a hot spot, unable to get out, and lo-and-behold, somebody would come along just in time to rescue him, or he'd happen upon just the right tool to help him out of the job. In the end, everything fell together just too easily, and it was too cliche the way the \\"bad guy\\" spent several pages explaining what he did, the whole time threatening to kill the hero. I just can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized and illustrated.","review":"The first thing that struck me about this book was the way it is organized. It attempts to guide the reader through a full year of qigong practice, starting in spring. While this idea is, in itself, not a bad one, the increased intensity of the exercises inhibits the ability to begin practice at any other time. In other words, if your bought this book in January, as I did, you'd be starting at \\"month 11,\\" which is almost at the end of the book and assumes knowledge of the previous 10 months. So, unless you begin practice in March of April, the book is nearly useless until then.Even if the qigong exercises in this book were accurate and beneficial, you'd never know it. The sparse illustrations only show one of the three to eight steps in each exercise and the written descriptions of each step is often unclear. An introduction to qigong should be more accessible to the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usefulness is Wonderful","review":"I have a few books on qigong and this one is the one I rec'd to others, both beginners and experienced.

Anyone who listens to this Cd will find out that Rachial is very passionate about her music, and gives it her 100% best everytime. The only thing preventing me from giving this five stars is that I think Rachial deserves a fuller more orchestrated sound with her music. I think adding bass would give this band the bottom that is apparently missing. I hope that if the band reads this that they don't feel insulted, because I still bought the Cd, and like the songs very much.

This is a charming film that depicts the difficulty of a double life and achieving your dreams. Glenn Close is quite convincing as a woman passing herself off as a man and the performances of all the players are outstanding. The Albert Nobbs character is very likeable and I found myself hoping for something positive to come out of the man's/woman's experience. The film is never slow, and every aspect of the movie is very well done.

I loved it and yet I thought it could have been so much more. Glenn Close was amazing as Albert but I thought her performance was a little too stoic and reticent. Janet McTeer as Hubert Page turned in a stellar portrayal of a woman living as a man.I never believed Close as Albert, her facial bone structure is too womanly, her stature too small. I was however completely taken in by McTeer's performance as Hubert Page. Her stature and mannerisms were very believable until she whipped out some mighty fine looking breasts to show Albert she had no reason to fear discovery.The turn of the century costumes and scenery were fabulous, the performances overall first rate.

Yet, the energy of both soloist and orchestra carry the work's dramaturgy and leave your soul feeling like you just experienced all human emotions.The soloist and orchestra have a global vision of this work often lacking in other recordings even by Bashmet or Van Keulen that seem to juxtapose various sections without a sense of the whole.A must have.P.S.

Some of the nuances and her style of playing does not sound quite right to me when I hear this work. It almost comes off as obnoxious at times. (No offense to Kashkashian and her incredible technique.) Bashmet on the other hand brings a wider range of sounds and moods that I find rather lacking here.I also found that the orchestra sounds rather distant and unclear at times. The orchestra that accompanies Bashmet's RCA recording sounds very clear and many of the finer details can be heard better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of this book sickened me","review":"If you really like alligators, this is not the book for you.

You can choose players with varying skills, try different strategies, set players at different defensive positions, adjust the lineup before each game, and track one game or a whole season (complete with playoffs). There are a lot of options that change the difficulty level, which makes it fun for a wide age range.A huge advantage over the original backyard baseball is the choice of over 30 \\"professionals as kids.\\" Read Amazon reviews of the new 2003 edition to see if you prefer its pro players; I think they're an important buying consideration. Other than the pro players, I recommend drafting Keisha Phillips and Pedro Sanchez for power, Kenny Kawaguchi for pitching, Achmed Khan for overall offense and defense, Stephanie Morgan for infield, and Pete Wheeler for speed--he makes a great lead-off hitter! It's great, great fun, and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baseball, Fun Game","review":"This game is definatly better than the first one.

The options are plentiful, from choices among exotic and attractive ball fields (boy, I should have been so lucky as a kid), line ups (as a kid, fielding a full team in the backyard would constitute a once-in-kid's lifetime dream), to pitch selection (for me as a kid it was simply throw hard, harder or harder still).Not for the impatient or the slow-witted.

Matter impacts with antimatter all around us in billions and billions of atomic collisions every second.\\" If that weren't bad enough, his new friend responds, \\"Some matter matters more, though, doesn't it?\\" That was enough for me.

Yeah, they have 'in your face..[love scences]', but it's not sensual or arrousing. It's just poking and proding. The author, aka narrator, is TELLING the story, not SHOWING the reader. The twists of plot were very good. The tidey ending was clever. And maybe this is a view of inside Hollywood. If so, what a horrible place to be addicted to.

While the writing is a bit predictable and sluggish at times, and the attempt to come across blunt and gritty just feels forced, its still a fun and entertaining read with a nice touch of dark humor. The narrative is engaging and the twists will make your brain smile. It reads like a decent movie script in need of an editor: fun and full of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unabridged audio","review":"A fast entertaining story, written by one of Hollywoods power players, gives you a pretty good idea about the goings on in tinsel town.This is one story that, perhaps, is perfect for unabridged audio. It's fast paced, easy to follow, and read with flair by Dennis Franz. I kinda liked the jokes too.From inside:\\"There used to be a writer by the name of Merle Miller, who wrote that people in Hollywood are always touching you - not because they like you, but because they want to see how soft you are before they eat you alive.\\"Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically OK but unpalatable","review":"This author gets a bit too cute with his fun-loving, profane personality. He likes to talk about sex, and failure, and the dark things in the human soul, but by page 20 his shtick gets old. The mystery behind this book, in technical terms, is well-executed, but the characters are as dead as toy plastic soldiers and have about the same range of emotions. Bochco tries to talk us through it with a series of narrative visions of Hollywood, but these end up being repetitive instead of clever. Was he drunk? He gunked up a fairly competent mystery with a lack of humanity, or maybe, an inner desire to wallow in the grey side of humanity, which is not the evil aspects but the boringly predictable and degenerative ones. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from an NYPD-B fan","review":"Unfortunately, Bochco should stick to TV, where he RULES!The writing is poor, and the plot was predictable.

I always enjoy reading novels about Hollywood, it being such a fasinating city with all the personalities bursting out all over. Bochos' book however was more of a soft porn attempt. I am not a prude, but nearly every paragraph contained a graphic descriptions of sex that was going on or would be.I usually pass books on to friends, or keep it for my shelf if it was really good.

Steven Bochco is SO GREAT with his TV shows and I thought his book was be equally entertaining....not so.

What is with all the parentheses and added on little phrases everyother sentence.Is Bochco trying to be Harold Robbins of the 21st century? I read four chapters and was wondering if all the language and sex went anywhere but dead??? The sex is just there, as foul language, it doesn't add anything to the story line and as whitty as Mr. Bochco tries to be with these characters, they just don't go anywhere!

I was also worried that with only a little over 200 pages (and not small font print)the story would be a little thin. I was right.The first thing I didn't like about the book was it being written in third person. You are being told what happened to the main character, told by his agent. It was a plot with great potential, just told through the wrong eyes and it kind of just \\"ended\\", on a flat note at that.Although I read this book in one day, it wasn't because I was engrossed in the plot, I was just trying to get to the \\"good part\\"..it just never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Advanced for most","review":"This is so rigorous it is only for the advanced mathematician.

I took it back to the store, and got a replacement, thinking that perhaps the box had had a crack at the hinges. The very next evening, when I opened the lid, it swung back and I watched, dumbfounded, as two of the hinges snapped in two again! The lid is too heavy for these hinges, and when it swings back they snap. I do not recommend that one of these type boxes are purchased without checking out the hinges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and Poorly Characterized","review":"The writing in this book is very amateurish. It is roughly the quality you would expect from a high school sophomore who received a B-. If you go to the author's web site, you can read a few excerpts there and see this for yourself.An even worse problem is that the characters do not act as you would expect. They seem more like lampoons of the founding fathers, rather than the fathers themselves.Despite these flaws, Rowe deserves some credit for presenting an interesting, if far-fetched, scenario and including a few mildly humorous scenes in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike any other","review":"When I got this book, I was most intrigued by the notion that a modern day story would contain historically accurate portrayals of the founding fathers. The book delivered on the claim of being well researched. There were a lot of insights into these founders that are not covered in history class, or even most books. However, the best surprise was that by the end of the book, I was just as interested in the unfolding storyline as the historical insights. I look forward to the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Karen Leblanc?","review":"I've loved this movie ever since I saw it on VH1. It was played out well.

It was originally released on VH1 as \\"Out of Sync\\". I happened to catch it and all the cliche'd characters and catchy songs totally got me into it. Gail O' Grady is absolutely hot and her son in the movie (who's actually in the now defunct band, Serial Joe) reminds me of when I was young trying to find direction in music. For a TV movie it totally rocked and I could watch the ending song \\"If Love Could Only Live (Online)\\" a hundred times. From what I've found, that song was written and recorded by Kim Bingham with her band, \\"The Kim Band\\", but I haven't been able to find it...just a snippet from her website.

Not even close.Really I expected better from the likes of Gordon Fee and company.Go with \\"What the Bible is All About\\" instead. It's got kind of a juvenile atmosphere to it, but has been the preeminent book in its category for years and years (has sold over 10 million copies!) and with good reason.

The book does an excellent job describing the fundamentals of CRT and gives numerous hypothetical scenarios in which this method of financial planning would be beneficial. Although rather simplified, each scenario is illustrated with $ comparisons of Assets, Cash flow, and Estate tax, with and without the use of CRT. (This comparison got a bit tedious towards the end.) The book also contains a short glossary for reference. As with any beginner book on a highly technical and complex subject, the reader is left with more questions than he/she had started with. A good beginner book answers most of the questions that the reader started with and elevates the reader's curiosity to seek answers to a more refined set of questions.

It has stopped gripping the can. I put it on the can, squeeze it shut to cut it, and then.... I turn the handle, and nothing happens. It just spins in place. In order to open a can, I now have to open it, clamp it on, squeeze it, open it back up, clamp it back on, etc. until I have individually cut open each 3/4 inch space along the edge of the can.

The dialogue was horrible--unbelievable and sophmoric. It was like the author was trying to be funny but really was not. The character development and plot were almost nonexistent, and what I did learn about the characters I mostly didn't like. There were a lot of editing errors as well, which I could have overlooked if the story was good. It was full of cliches, for example the opening scene the cops are eating donuts, the master vampire owns a nightclub, etc.I am very annoyed that I spent $15 on this book based on all the positive reviews and now find the positive reviews suspect. Scanning the reviews more closely I see several are copy and pasted with only minor changes.

She even recommended I buy a used copy. Of which, I did.So, spelling and grammar errors aside (I'm all for looking over the occasional typo, but so many errors are rather distracting), I can't finish this book. Like one of the other reviewers have said, it's like a bunch of characters having their own storyline. I don't care about any of these characters, they don't pull me in. In order for me to care about a book, I have to feel like I'm being pulled into the world that I'm reading about. I don't know whether it's the writing itself or the spelling/grammar errors detracting from the flow.

It is quite possibly one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The sentance structure is horrendous and there is no character development. As for dialogue, it's a joke. There is an exchange where the main character confronts her mother about a secret her parent's kept from her for years; a secret that is a major plot point. The conversation took less than 2 pages and involved no emotion and the most ridiculous \\"arguement\\" and peaceful resolution I've ever seen imagined.There are so many other books out there where there is actual romance, complex characters, and compelling story lines that it is a waste of time to bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry But This Is The Worst","review":"Book I have ever read.

No real romance, little history, to many people with not enough interaction, almost no crime discussion and even the sex wasn't to hot. The spelling and grammar didn't bother me too much except when a whole sentence didn't make sense due to a word that just didn't belong there.I have never written a review and normally wouldn't, but I am hoping to save someone from wasting the too large amount of cash for this book.

This will be forever remembered as the night HHH/HBK/Chyna formed DX to comete with the WCW's NWO.Here are the matches:1.)Dude Love vs. HHHgood match with the crowd really in it 4/52.)WWF Tag Title MatchHeadbangers vs. Los BaricuasNice match headbangers sucessfully defended their titles 4/53.)Legion of Doom vs. The godwinnsthe L.o.D. are great and they showed it but not in the greatest match 3/54.)Vader vs. OwenThis match was great owen proved that he could go with big men although he eventually lost.5.)WWF European ChampionshipShawn Michaels vs. British BulldogBulldog comes home to the UK to defend his title but loses it in an amazing match. DX was formed at the end of this match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection of pieces played elegantly","review":"This is not the first baroque/ early baroque wood instrument album one would buy most probably. People tend to go for more famous composers. This album targets the audience who have had enough of the household names, and want to delve deeper into this genre. Some composers' names were unheard to me, so after my first listening this album turns out to be one of my best finds of this year. The Academy of Ancient Music title produces gold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FloorPlan Basic Software","review":"FloorPlan 3D is capable of drawing basic layouts of a two story structure and placing within most elements. It is difficult to use and is limited to the range of elements and custom designs. Upgrades and patches are not currently available. Technical assistance is on a fee basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Disappointment","review":"In view of the lack of modern books on this subject, and the failure to reprint the standard (and admirable) biographies, this monument of modern academic P & P (pedantry and pedagogy) is seriously disappointing. If you are seeking enlightenment about this motivation and methods of this most sublime of composers --- look elsewhere. This is a view through a microscope of the vast Brucknerian universe. You will, however, get a glimpse of current efforts to achieve tenure in academe. The standard works (in addition to Simpson, Schoenzeler, and Doernberg, perhaps the recent compilation by Stephen Johnson)remain essential --- so search the used book sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Us More!","review":"I loved this little book. It is the perfect gift book for yourself or anyone else you know who has experienced the joy of sailing. The photos are great - very beautiful - they capture the many moods of sailing: from sheer excitement to calm reflection. The quotes are wonderfully chosen and are some of the most eloquent quotes about sailing by famous authors and others. ENJOY! I only give it 4 stars out of 5 because I wish it was longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe him...","review":"I believe Dumitru Duduman's prophetic sayings...some has already taken place and I believe the others will too. He speaks for God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"This is a wonderful book. It shows you how to touch the heart of God in crisis. Fasting is something we have forgotten in the Church today, but those who do fast, have great submission to the Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, challenging, and thought-provoking!","review":"The book tells the story of Dumitru Duduman, a Christian whounderwent tremendous persecution in a Communist nation. Themessage he brings is that Christians serve a God who candeliver them through any situation. At the end of the book,some prophecies Dumitru has received are described. Considerthem prayerfully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrecking Everything","review":"This DVD is laid out exactly how a live DVD should be. First off you have the full 'Wrecking Everything' show. Without any interuptions. Most concert videos, dvds will cut in the middle with an interview or dumb on the road footage and then go back to the show and 80% of the time the show it's getting back to will be a totally different show at a different venue, etc. So you have that and then you have the 2nd discs. There is where you find the interviews, rare concert clips and alot of it is vintage. Unless you are a hardcore overkill concert collector you have not seen any of these clips. The only thing it is lacking is videos. I wish they would of threw their video collection on there. But that is no biggie. It's still worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blitz and friends","review":"This is a must for any heavy metal fan,it's just amazing .It's like being front row there ,the concert section with terrific sound ,performance and every song you could ask for(exception of Thanx for nothing).Personally I love over kill's old songs better and they sound alot better then the newer ones live.The second disc is a bonus , a in depth history about the band.They should have put some more clips on it ,so it didn't seem to run so long ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD!","review":"I got into OVERKILL after seeing the video for \\"In Union We Stand\\". Loved the song and the stage presence. I continued to buy their albums during my high school years, but then lost track. Now, 20 years later, I started catching up. This video, together with Rat Skates documentary, are not only a good introduction to new OVERKILL fans, but an inspiring testament from guys who never quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERKILL - Wrecking Everything DVD","review":"This DVD, filmed live in New Jersey(OVERKILL's hometown),puts the facts on the table for all to see. OVERKILL are the kings of Thrash & Speed Metal! Period! They are on top of their game and Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth & the rest of the band are on fire! The crowd is great too, a real heartfelt performance from OVERKILL + a 2nd DVD featuring extras, clips and rarities. Easily the best DVD on the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Scholarly Work / Kali in Literature","review":"This book is a fascinating work of scholarship which traces the path of the Goddess Kali through several literary works. Although thorough and well-researched, it is not your typical volume of scholarly literary analysis. Throughout the book, the author has illuminated the pages with her own personal insights and impressions, so that the reader may share in the sense of delight and wonder of making new spiritual and intellectual connections. This book is for those interested in religion, literature, or both. I highly recommend this book to the serious reader who wants to explore this literary-spiritual connection. It is a valuable contribution to the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for serious students of Chinese religious history","review":"This is simply an excellent volume, a solid overview of one thousand years of Daoism from THE expert on the Shangqing school of southern Daoism (4th-5th c.AD). The bibliography alone makes this book worth it, both extensive and broken down by period. I'm just finishing up a master's concerning Ge Hong's \\"Baopuzi\\" and I'm about to start a Ph.D. project on the \\"Huainanzi,\\" and I must say that even though I've read many excellent texts on Daoism, Robinet's provides some excellent defining concepts as well as a good introduction to many of the strengths of French scholarship in my field."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW Ambassador 1984","review":"I am a PFAL Grad and a WOW Ambassador. Dr. Wierwille's teaching taught me to read, believe, teach and apply the the Word of God in my life. I am thankful for what I learned. I miss TWIG and the Ministry, but I am thankful that alot of the books are now being made available with this web-site. I would love to find other believers (former way followers) and fellowship via internet orin person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to come to the Word","review":"Though I never met Dr. Wierwille in person, I believe his stand upon Gods word was genuine. He was a man who researched the word of God to learn it for himself and to better be able to teach other how to read the Bible on their own. Yes, on their own!! God could of never ment for just a select few people to understand His Word, for He deisres we all come to a knowledge of the truth, His Word. If you really want to get a good basis after reading this book for how to read and understand the Bible for yourself, I recommend buying E.W. Bullingers \\"How to Enjoy the Bible.\\" This book is essentialy the Power for Abundant Living Class that Dr. Wierwille videotaped and made available for people to learn how to not only get born again but how to \\"manifest\\" the nine manifistations of Holy Spirit.

It would not warm up completely and when it did it kept reverting back to the warming setting which does not produce steam. When I went to descale it, the circuit breaker kept popping. I brought it to be fixed and that lasted all of 3 months and we are back where we were. Same problem. I want to throw it off the balcony.I have a Capresso in my office which does not look as pretty but works consistently and makes just as good a cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took a bit of time, but we are hooked","review":"I'll keep this short, since this product is now discontinued...It took us a bit of time to get used to the way this machine operates, or perhaps it took a bit of time for the machine to break in. At first it seemed like the coffee was weak and tepid. However, after a week or two, that problem went away and it now produces nice strong, hot espresso with great crema. The steaming capabilities of this machine are outstanding as well.It definitely is bulky and expensive, but it also is automatic and produces some great coffee. With the push of a button in the morning, a beautiful cup of espresso is waiting for you. What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"This is my first automatic espresso machince. All I can say is Wow. This machine makes perhaps the best cup of coffee outside of Europe that I have ever had.It is also the easiest machine I have ever used. After initial setup, you put your cup under the spout, push a button and 20 seconds later you have a fabulous espresso!I have had this machine for 30 days now. No problems whatsoever. It is rather large size wise (my wife's main complaint) so be prepared.One warning: This machine makes such a good cup of coffee, I find that when I travel it is difficult to drink any other coffee other than Starbuck's espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ...!!!!!!!","review":"If you are an Ozzy fan or a music fan of any type then DO NOT buy this trash!!!!! This is one of the poorest quality videos that I have ever seen. The information is wrong half of the time and most of the footage is not even of Ozzy. The portion of the tape that is actually an interview with the Ozzman is over 10 years old and badly edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL GARBAGE!","review":"I am the biggest Ozzy fan in the world. I have 5 autographs, I have collectibles, every cd, rare stuff... you get the point. I know the facts and I have seen every Ozzy piece there is. This is the worst piece ... I have ever seen. This looks like someone made it in their basement with a cam-corder. It has no concert footage, no ozzy music and no new information to offer. I am not joking. This stinks. Knowing Ozzy, don't be surprised if he speaks out against this unauthorized piece of junk and tells you not to buy it. He always deals with quality. He will be very angry to see this- so was I and you will be too. Words cannot express how angry I was at this \\"thing\\". ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Horrid","review":"Possibly the worst DVD or rockumentary I have ever seen. And in Bangkok it cost me 25$! Basically a bunch of teens claimiing they planned the bat things and trying to capitalize on it. 75% is footage that has nothing to do with Ozzy: beer cans on a table, some garage band playing, some girls showing their breasts (not at an Ozzy concert...). It's ridiculous.Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BoRiNg!!!","review":"This was very boring, you see the same things again and again and the things they said and show in this video you can have read it on magazine, see it on tv.

That is not easy! I can see that for longer rides it could be pulled out again and again over the course of the trip. We didn't really use it as a competitive game (for the four year old), but just tried to fill in rows and then the whole box of pictures. It was really fun, and made the kids look around and think about where they were.
